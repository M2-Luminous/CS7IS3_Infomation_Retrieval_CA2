FR941207-1-00024 FR941207-1-00006 Examples of Proposed Actions Areas which contain habitat used by the owl during its life cycle support a number of existing, proposed, and potential activities. Commercial activities that may affect Mexican spotted owl critical habitat include timber harvest, timber salvage harvest, other wood fiber utilization (e.g., paper, firewood), snag removal, construction of hydroelectric facilities, and construction of ski areas and resort facilities. Additional activities include ``personal use'' commodity production, such as fuelwood gathering and Christmas tree cutting. Activities associated with land management by involved agencies include campground and road construction, certain fire suppression activities such as fire break construction and use of chemical fire retardants; silvicultural activities such as forest pest management and stocking control; and military maneuvers. The Service recognizes that these activities may affect individual owls and portions of their habitat. However, the Service has identified the timber management program as the activity that constitutes the most significant threat to the survival of the species because of its scope across the landscape, and because it is the predominant threat to habitat in the areas with the largest owl populations. The Service believes that where there are other activities section 7 consultations on effects of projects to the species and other regulatory mechanisms provide adequate protection. In evaluating proposed activities within critical habitat through section 7 analyses, the Service uses project descriptions and biological assessments provided by the action agency, and focuses on the likely impacts of a project on the constituent elements of the site and surrounding areas. The Federal agencies requesting consultation can assist the Service in its evaluation of proposed actions by providing detailed information on the habitat configuration of a project area, habitat conditions of surrounding areas, and information on known locations of Mexican spotted owls. Proposed actions would be individually examined in terms of site-specific impacts to the primary constituent elements and the reasons for which the critical habitat unit was designated. Certain proposed actions, such as the selective harvest or commercial thinning of timber stands, may or may not destroy or adversely modify critical habitat, depending on the type and extent of harvest and the pre-project condition of the site in relation to Mexican spotted owl habitat needs. Activities that disturb, remove, or retard the development of the primary constituent elements within designated critical habitat units may adversely modify the Mexican spotted owl's critical habitat. These activities may include, but are not limited to, actions that would significantly reduce the canopy closure of a timber stand, modify multi-canopy stand structure, significantly reduce the stand's average tree diameter, significantly alter tree size and age class distribution and species composition, reduce the availability of nesting structures and sites, reduce the suitability of the landscape to provide for safe movement, or reduce the abundance or availability of prey species. In addition to site-specific analysis, Service evaluation of proposed Federal actions would also consider the additive effects of past, on-going, and proposed actions. Proposed projects within critical habitat would also be examined spatially to determine adverse modification of habitat across the surrounding landscape. The additive effects of actions in proximity to the proposed project may collectively result in the appreciable reduction of the value of a critical habitat unit. Conversely, an isolated proposed action within a spacious expanse of unmodified habitat may not adversely affect the function for which a critical habitat unit was designed. An activity cannot cause adverse modification of critical habitat in an area that does not contain or have the potential to contain the physical and biological features comprising the primary constituent elements. Due to limitations in the fineness of the mapping effort, and the interspersed nature of suitable and unsuitable habitat types, some such areas have been incidentally included in the proposed designation as inclusions within surrounding Mexican spotted owl habitat. Furthermore, some activities may not be restricted due to critical habitat designation because there would be no effect on the primary constituent elements. However, Federal projects that do not adversely modify critical habitat may still affect Mexican spotted owls (e.g., through disturbance) and, therefore, may be subject to review under section 7 of the Act. Some activities may be considered to be of benefit to Mexican spotted owl habitat and, therefore, would not be expected to adversely modify critical habitat. Examples of activities that could benefit critical habitat may include some protective measures such as fire suppression, prescribed burning, brush control, snag creation, and certain silvicultural activities such as thinning. Other Conservation Measures Section 9 of the Act prohibits intentional and non-intentional ``take'' of listed species and applies to all landowners regardless of whether or not their lands are within critical habitat. The term ``take'', as defined by the Act, means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. ``Incidental take'' is take that results from, but is not the purpose of, an otherwise lawful activity.
