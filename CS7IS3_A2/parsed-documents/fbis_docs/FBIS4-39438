The reactions of certain high-ranking Russian representatives show that there is not a uniform attitude toward this issue at the top. [Lobov] The Security Council includes the president and the ministers of defense, foreign affairs, and internal affairs, all of whom participate in adopting important decisions, including the decision on the Partnership for Peace. One should not be hasty in anything related to this program. Russia is too big to be pressurized. Its power is equal to that of NATO. It is no accident that when one says that the United States could destroy the world 16 times over, one immediately adds that Russia could do it 24 times. However, this is not the most important issue. We must understand precisely what we would get out of the Partnership for Peace. If Russia has to scrap its arms -- this naturally is no partnership. One cannot rationalize in a simplistic manner: We offered our hand (to Russia), you rejected it, therefore you are the bad guys. All issues must be clarified -- this includes the arms systems issue, the rights that Russia will have, and so on. The document must be very precise and clear. When the documents will be signed is not the most important issue. As far as the different attitudes are concerned -- this is a natural phenomenon. The minister of defense has his own opinion, and the same applies to the president and the foreign minister. It is precisely those different views and opinions that are being discussed at the Security Council, with a view to working out the most precise position and a uniform point of view. The Security Council still has not expressed its position on the Partnership for Peace program, and is preparing it now. [Apostolov] Mr. Lobov, what attracted your interest in Bulgaria -- our weapons technologies or the possibilities of our military-industrial complex? Will you purchase, sell, or discuss joint production? [Lobov] We were briefed on the possibilities of the military industry, and naturally, with its problems. We have no intention of purchasing anything. [Apostolov] Would Russia sell Bulgaria its most modern weapons, for example, the SU-34? [Lobov] The Bulgarian side did not express any interest in this aircraft. [Apostolov] What about other systems that are more modern than the MIG-29? [Lobov] No, the Bulgarians did not request such weapon systems. [Apostolov] Mr. Lobov, the ratio between the Russian and Turkish naval forces in the Black Sea has changed in the last few years from 2:1 to 1:1. [Lobov] Yes, this is so, and we must analyze this issue. We must think what could happen in the future against the background of a Black Sea Fleet that is divided between Russia and Ukraine. If the navies of Bulgaria and Russia must be strengthened -- then it must be done, and we are prepared to help Bulgaria as partners. After all, if we sign the Partnership for Peace we become partners, is this not so? Our navies must be strengthened. There is a war being waged near our borders.
