FBIS4-58207 "drnes085_d_94001" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 1 May 1994 Libya Al-Qadhdhafi: Country Will `Never' Recognize Israel Al-Qadhdhafi: Country Will `Never' Recognize Israel LD0205102794 Tripoli Libyan Television Network in Arabic 2005 GMT 1 May 94 LD0205102794 Tripoli Libyan Television Network Arabic BFN [Speech by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in Tarhunah on 1 May -- recorded] [Excerpts] [Announcer] Brothers, in another outburst of anger against the challenges of the forces of colonialism and hegemony to the Arab Libyan people and the Arab nation, and in another festival of defiance, the masses of Tarhunah today took to the streets to welcome the brother leader of the revolution and to fuse together in him. They strongly shouted that the voice of this free and sovereign people over its land is stronger than the embargo and the voice of the crusader war drums. Amid the masses, the brother leader of the revolution delivered this speech: Brothers, when the drums of confrontation beat, Tarhunah, which history knows very well, will not hesitate to stand in the front line to face challenge with challenge. Brothers, at the moment in which the camp of enemies is trying to impose defeat on the Arab nation and trying to humiliate this great nation before the world, at this moment the masses of struggling Tarhunah come out to declare to the world that in this place humiliation cannot pass. From this place we challenge insolence and arrogance. From this place we declare the will of defiance; declare the will of confrontation; and declare our readiness to face up to the enemies unintimidated by their fleets, their forces, or their might. The will of the peoples is stronger than the armies of enemies and the aggressors. [passage omitted] Tarhunah became the center of the resistance to Italy and the base of the counteroffensive against Italian colonialism. Tarhunah became the strategic target for the colonialist operation in the Italian fascist ugly era. They moved their armies from Gharyan, from al-Aziziyah, and from Tajura in order to attack Tarhunah from all directions. [passage omitted] After these villains took over the other resistance centers their aim and concern was to subjugate Tarhunah and bring it under control. [passage omitted] Today, brothers, history is repeating itself: the United States is raising the crusade banner, and the western Christian forces are allying themselves with it in a modern neo-crusade aimed at mosques, at burning the Koran once again, and at taking over Mecca and Medina, which are now considered as taken over de facto. Most regrettably, the decision of the Christian states, made at what is called the Security Council, has been implemented against holy Mecca. The strugglers, the Libyan revolutionaries, have been prevented from performing the pilgrimage because the decision of the Christian states -- America, Britain, and France -- has been carried out against Mecca. We are playing a part in another historic epic poem, and God wants to prescribe for us honor, glory, and martyrdom as He did for our fathers and ancestors. We will be lucky brothers if we enter more modern battles against America, Britain, and France. Our dead will be in heaven and their dead in hell. We will gain glory and leave an honorable history for our children and grandchildren just as our fathers and ancestors left this shining history. [passage omitted] Tomorrow and after tomorrow, brothers, history will curse America, Britain, France, and the Western Christian bloc and will glorify us. History will record sacrifice and glory for us and shame and disgrace for the states of arrogance. Brothers, we are resurrecting our history anew because these hours are the hours of taking along provisions from the history of our fathers and forefathers who were not living in luxury or greedy. Brothers, we are reviving our history, because these hours are hours where we get inspiration from the history of our fathers and ancestors who were not prodigal, rich, or greedy. [passage omitted] The weapons of confrontation are industrialization, farming, knowledge, defiance, and austerity. These are the weapons with which we confront the enemy. We should have a full awareness of the new international politics meant to bring about a neo-colonial domination of Christian Europe over the Arab-Islamic world. They want to destroy mosques once again, they want to burn the Koran, Koran books once again, they want us to live as their subjects once again. Never! These evil objectives will never be realized; they will never be able to achieve what they want. Here are the aware masses, the free masses, the [word indistinct] masses that can instill life in the dead and lift the morale of the humiliated Arab nation. We send our backing and support to the fighters of the Lebanese people who launch daring attacks and are unafraid of the threats of America, Britain, France, and Europe. So that despicable Zionism will understand, they launch daring attacks on the north of Palestine and we say to them that these attacks open the door for the great conquest, the liberation of the land from the south to the south [as heard]. These attacks must not stop, must not stop in southern Lebanon as far as the south of occupied Palestine. O brothers, we will not be satisfied that the soil of Egypt and Jordan should be isolated from each other with the enemy dividing them, the enemy who is occupying Umm al-Rashrash which the Israelis called Elat. This is Egyptian land 100 percent. [passage omitted] The Israeli occupation of Umm al-Rashrash prevented even pilgrims from going to Mecca in cars, on camels, or on foot. When pilgrims go from Egypt to Saudi Arabia, how will they get through? From which place will they get through? They cannot get through, O brothers, by land, because the land between Jordan and Egypt is occupied. Egyptian Umm al-Rashrash is occupied. It is a disgrace, O brothers, that Umm al-Rashrash should be occupied. It is a disgrace that the Arab homeland should be divided on land between Jordan and Egypt. The battle will be for the liberation of Umm al- Rashrash. The revolutionaries of Egypt, of Jordan, or the Arab Peninsula are faced with the task of the liberation of Umm al- Rashrash so that the Egyptian land may find itself in contact with the Jordanian land through Ummm al-Rashrash. This is the coming battle. The first battle toward which the Islamic world must move is the liberation of Umm al-Rashrash. Egyptian Umm al-Rashrash is an extremely important strategic area. It has divided the Arab homeland, broken the spine of the Arab nation, prevented the pilgrims of the Arab Maghreb from going to Mecca. You cannot pass from Egypt to Jordan because Umm al-Rashrash is occupied, brothers. This is not Palestine, not occupied Palestine. Egyptian Umm al- Rashrash is occupied. When they ask Syria to recognize Israel in return for a withdrawal from the Golan, it is a great encroachment, a great humiliation, brothers. Syria has the right to recover the Golan Heights in acordance with the UN charter, without any condition. The Israelis must withdraw from the Golan without any condition or negotiations. The Golan is an occupied Syrian land. The UN charter says that land must not be taken by force. Why, brothers, are they trampling the UN charter underfoot? They are trampling international law underfoot and asking Syria to recognize Israel so as to humiliate it, to belittle it, to tarnish its history of struggle, and to humiliate the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party at pan-Arab and international levels. They want to humiliate the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party. They want to inflict humiliation on the history of the 'Umayyids [dynasty of caliphs who had Damascus as capital] and the history of Khalid Ibn-al-Walid [Arab army commander who conquered Syria and the Levant]. [passage omitted] Brothers, they want Libya to rcognize Israel so as to solve the problem of Lockerbie with her. To hell and 1,000 times to hell if that is the condition. Never and never, this condition will never be realized. Libya will fight until doomsday. Libya knows through her historic awareness and her rich history that the road to her security in the future, to which she is forging ahead, is fraught with sweat, blood, and sacrifices. However, it is the only road and there is no alternative to it to reach an honorable and free tomorrow. [Excerpts] [passage omitted] O brothers, they lie and cheat, they say that Libya brought down the Pan Am plane and that this is the problem. So there they are behind the scenes saying ...[changes thought]... this is not the problem. The problem is that Libya is called upon to recognize Israel. Look at this injustice. They want us to recognize that white is black and that black is white. Why should we be forced into recognition? Death is easier than recognition, easier than recognition by injustice, by falsification. We do not recognize falsification. Palestine ...[changes thought]... the Palestinian people, Palestine is an occupied Arab territory. [passage omitted] We support the Jews so that they live in their homelands and are respected, so that persecution is lifted on them, including the Jews from the Arab world. They must return to their countries and Palestine must be left to the Palestinians. We challenge them to return the Palestinian people to Palestine. We challenge them to carry out free elections with the Palestinian people's presence and under the supervision of the so-called United Nations, as is the case now in South Africa. We challenge them to show they want peace. We are the ones who call for this solution and we are the ones who want and love peace. When we are forced to fight, we will fight with fierceness and madness because we will be forced to fight, whereas they are cowards who look for fighting for prosperity and when the time of confrontation comes, they will run away like dogs just like Italy ran away from this place, this sacred place. [passage omitted]
