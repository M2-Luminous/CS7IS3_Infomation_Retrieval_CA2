"If those who have been amnestied by the State Duma decision start any activity jeopardizing the Russian state's security, they will be arrested again in accordance with law," the president said. Meanwhile, a high-ranking official at the Security Council staff was utterly pessimistic in his comments on the news agency reports: "The time is wrong, the form is wrong, and the effect is also wrong..." Many staffers at the Security Council head office on Ilinka Street are presently convinced that the presidential advisers' key mistake was that they did not try to draw on the authority of the Security Council, which "has not yet been squandered on petty political showdowns and bickering," to settle the amnesty scandal. Speaking to your SEGODNYA correspondent, a chief of the Security Council staff noted: "If the amnesty-related problems were discussed not at the meeting chaired by Kryzhakov, but at a Security Council meeting, which State Duma representatives could well have been invited to join, the matter could just have ended in a pacifying statement." Moreover, in the immediate vicinity from the Kremlin they have even been discussing a theory (which, as a matter of fact, appears fairly trustworthy) whereby as early as one week before the scandalous voting at the State Duma took place, Boris Yeltsin received clear signals from the Security Council to the effect that the potential political damage from the amnesty could be minimized only if the president were decisively to regain the initiative by granting a pardon himself. It is doubtful, however, that any of the Security Council chiefs would presently like to confirm the reports. The only reaction they might have drawn would have been irritated remarks about "that die-hard conservative, Lobov, who is always putting his foot in it..." Be that as it may, the Security Council sees the amnesty story as a thing of the past. This is why yesterday's agenda did not say a single word about it. Instead, it focused on the discussion of the "Russian Federation Federal Program To Step Up the Struggle against Crime." According to reports from the Security Council staff, the nearly 90-page document was undergoing the third reading in six months. The document's authors, however, pointed out from the outset that the implementation and, most important, the financing of the extremely costly project would be impossible without a political decision made at the top federal level. In accordance with a resolution adopted by the Security Council yesterday, the program must be submitted to the president for definite approval within one week. The two-year program, in its current form, is estimated to cost slightly more than 4.8 trillion rubles (including around 2 trillion for 1994). The Security Council was careful to emphasize, however, that these figures should be treated only as preliminary estimates: the program is yet to pass a final expert appraisal in the government. Given that the first, "liberal" version of the program was estimated at nearly 15 trillion rubles (it has thus been trimmed by two-thirds within the past six months), further cuts in the proposed subsidies appear fairly likely. Citing estimates made according to UN methods, the authors claim that all this money should be seen as "investment in a profitable industry," because in two years' time it promises a nearly two-fold yield.
