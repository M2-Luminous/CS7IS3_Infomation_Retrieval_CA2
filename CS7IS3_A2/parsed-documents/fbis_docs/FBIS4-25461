Since reform and opening up, particularly since the mid-eighties, transportation and communication departments have, with the full support of the state, built more than 44,000 km of new highways which were up to prescribed grades and standards, and more than 42,000 km of new roads for use by farm machines. They have repaired more than 64,000 km of off-grade highways, built over 8,500 new bridges, harnessed more than 700 km of waterways, and connected over 1,500 towns and townships and more than 10,000 administrative villages by highways. These projects have played an important role in developing the economy of poverty-ridden areas and in solving people's food and clothing problems. Nevertheless, more than 1,700 towns and townships and over 17,000 administrative villages nationwide have not yet been connected by highways and thus are inaccessible by car. Most of these townships and villages, which are not connected by highways, are located in poor areas in west-central China. Accordingly, the State Council has decided to use newly allocated work-relief funds this year, mainly to launch communications projects in impoverished areas. Working around the central task of economic development, the state will build roads leading to townships, interconnected highways, highways leading to rural trade fairs and commodity distribution centers, and "truncated" highways [highways cut short and diverted to other directions], while paying equal attention to the problem of drinking water for human and animal consumption in areas with serious water shortages. A relevant responsible person from the State Council's Leading Group for Aid-the-Poor Projects noted: The state's investment of massive work-relief funds to improve communications conditions in poverty-stricken areas is an important part of our country's key "87" aid-the-poor program [a program under which 80 million households will be lifted out of poverty within seven years]. Therefore, we should genuinely stress investment returns, ensuring that every road which we start building will be completed, and that every road which we build will lead to prosperity. We must not rush headlong into action and start projects indiscriminately.
