FR941025-0-00071 FR941025-0-00025 In anticipation of an increase in the domestic harvesting capacity to take royal red shrimp, the Council initiated Amendment 7 to the FMP, which, among other things, would increase the domestic quota for royal red shrimp to 195.6 mt. The proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 was published for public comment on September 12, 1994 (59 FR 46810). The public comment period closes October 24, 1994. Accordingly, a final rule to implement Amendment 7 cannot be published prior to the time when the domestic quota is expected to be reached. Without this emergency interim rule, the royal red shrimp fishery would have to be closed when the current domestic quota is reached. Such a disruption in the harvest of royal red shrimp is unnecessary for effective conservation and management of the resource and constitutes an economic emergency for participants in the fishery. As explained in Amendment 7, the data for determining the MSY for royal red shrimp are sparse, that is, catch and effort data are limited. The FMP indicates that MSY falls within a range between 159.66 mt and 294.84 mt. The MSY has been set at the single point estimate of 177.8 mt, which is near the lower end of the range. The Council and NMFS believe that harvest above the point estimate of MSY for a limited time would contribute additional current catch and effort data that are necessary to ascertain the appropriate MSY for royal red shrimp. Accordingly, at the Council's request, this emergency interim rule establishes a domestic quota for royal red shrimp that exceeds MSY for the fishing year that ends December 31, 1994. The Council requested a domestic quota of 251 mt for the emergency rule. That amount was based on data that show that landings of royal red shrimp have fallen short of the MSY in each of the last 2 fishing years as follows: ␣ 1Year 1MSY (mt) 1Landings (mt) 1Shortfall (mt) 1992 177.8 60.9 116.9 1993 177.8 148.4 29.4 The Council's requested domestic quota is the sum of the MSY (177.8 mt) and the average harvest shortfall for the last 2 fishing years (116.9 mt+29.4 mt ’ 2=73.15 mt, rounded to 73.2 mt). Because the royal red shrimp fishery consists of multiple year classes, portions of prior years' foregone harvests are available for harvest in subsequent years. However, such a calculation is not scientifically defensible_a portion of each year's foregone harvests would not be available in subsequent years because of natural mortality. Nevertheless, some amount of harvest over the point estimate of MSY is (1) Necessary both to address the economic emergency and to obtain current additional catch and effort data for future refinements of MSY, and (2) justified and supportable. Accordingly, this emergency interim rule establishes for 1994 a domestic quota of 215 mt. This amount represents the reasonably expected domestic annual harvest based on the most recent landings and effort data, and is somewhat higher then the domestic quota proposed in Amendment 7. The Council and NMFS believe that establishing the domestic quota above the MSY point estimate for the current fishing year has scientific merit (it would contribute current catch and effort data that are necessary to better estimate MSY) and would not jeopardize the long-term biological integrity of the resource for the following reasons: (1) The fishery exploits only 3 of the 5 year classes of royal red shrimp; (2) The fishery operates in only a small portion of the Gulf of Mexico, whereas the resource exists throughout the Gulf of Mexico; (3) Some amount of surplus production, that is, the difference between the point estimate of MSY and landings in previous years, is available for harvest; and (4) The increased domestic quota is well within the current range of acceptable values for MSY. Compliance With NMFS Guidelines for Emergency Rules The Council and NMFS have concluded that the present situation constitutes an economic emergency, which is properly addressed by this emergency interim rule, and that the situation meets NMFS's policy guidelines for the use of emergency rules, published on January 6, 1992 (57 FR 375). The situation: 1. Results from recent, unforeseen events or recently discovered circumstances. While the domestic harvest of royal red shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico increased in 1993, the increased rate of harvest in 1994 was unanticipated. 2. Presents serious management problems in the fishery. A developing fishery will be unnecessarily disrupted, OY will not be attained, and necessary catch and effort data will not be obtained, unless the emergency rule is issued.
