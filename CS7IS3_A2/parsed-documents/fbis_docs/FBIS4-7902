Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's speech, greeting an international conference on the Hungarian Holocaust at the Budapest University of Arts and Sciences, was drowned out by stamping and slow handclapping from audience members showing derision at the minister's ideas on 1940's history. Jeszenszky said one should never forget that Hungary gave refuge to the Jews until 1944 and that the German invasion marked not only the start of deportations but also atrocities against non-Jewish Hungarian citizens. As a Hungarian citizen, historian, politician, and presidium member of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum, the minister said those not sympathizing with the victims of 1944 have no place in the Hungarian nation. He asked listeners to mourn not just the 600,000 Jewish victims, but also nearly 500,000 Hungarians who died in World War II. The minister reminded politicians and scholars at the conference of the link between the Hungarian Holocaust and the Peace Treaty concluding World War I, a treaty very damaging for Hungary. Jeszenszky then drew a parallel between Communism and Nazism, saying that both are barbarous ideas which should be condemned together. But he could not continue because of jeering and stamping from some of the audience. Before Jeszenszky's remarks, Director of the New York Rosenthal Institute Randolph L. Braham had delivered a lecture. "Keeping silent about this genocide makes us complicit in it," said Braham. "This political attitude aimed at falsifying history -- one seen in Western Europe after the war and in the post- communist countries today -- is particularly dangerous," he added. Braham thought right-wing movements reviving in the region with anti-Semitism central to their political ideology had just this goal. He hoped these "political charlatans" could be squeezed out of public life by resolving underlying economic problems.
