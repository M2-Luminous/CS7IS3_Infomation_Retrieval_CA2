In his arrival statement, Buwayz said his participation in Mandela's inauguration reflects Lebanon's support for the return of democracy and genuine representation in South Africa. Here is a recording of Minister Buwayz' statement to colleague Darwish 'Ammar: [Begin recording] [passage omitted] ['Ammar] Mr. Minister, it is known that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher began a new tour of the region. Do you know if he will visit Lebanon? What does Lebanon expect from Christopher's tour? [Buwayz] So far, we have not been informed of a possible visit to Lebanon by Christopher. We do not expect such a visit. I believe that Secretary Christopher is trying to address problems related to the Syrian-Israeli track of negotiations. As far as I know, his proposals are still somewhat far from constituting a genuine and constructive common ground. [end recording]
