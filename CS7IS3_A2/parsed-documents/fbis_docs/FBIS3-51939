Commander Fernando Caldera asserted that the transportation workers' strike has not exceeded the limits of peace and tranquility. To contribute to that atmosphere, the Police have allowed vehicles to be parked on the streets so long as they are not blocking traffic. Caldera also listed the incidents that have taken place, including the arrest of two armed persons and some broken windows on vehicles belonging to those who support the strike as well as to those who continue to provide service to the population. Caldera denied that there have been traffic jams in Managua or in any other part of the country. [Begin Caldera recording] The only incident that has taken place was this morning in Ciudad Sandino, where a group of transportation workers blocked the road. We went there and were able to persuade them to unblock the road, then we left a stronger Police contingent in the area. There was another small incident. Some young children -- 13 or 14 years old -- threw some stones, but it was not important. They didn't do any damage. Some have said there was a traffic jam on 4th Avenue, but that is not true. We also received reports of a traffic jam in a place called El Capulina in Granada, but that was not true, either. There were buses on the sides of the street, but no traffic jam. Generally speaking, the atmosphere has been tranquil in the rest of the country. [end recording] Caldera denied the statements made by Gustavo Aguiluz, a member of the National Transportation Commission, who asserted that 20 taxi drivers had been arrested. [Begin Caldera recording; in progress] ... saying we had arrested 20 taxi drivers in the (Repotola) 15. We were very annoyed by that, because if, as a union leader, he wants to heat up the strike, he has every right. However, we do not agree that he should do it at the expense of the Police, that is to say, by causing a state of alert at the expense of the Police. There have been absolutely no incidents in (Repotola) 15. [end recording] The Police will continue to take the necessary measures to maintain public order, thus preventing the appearance of firearms and violence. [Begin Caldera recording] People who have carried weapons during past events should indeed worry because we are keeping an eye on them. Those who have not carried weapons can feel calm. Simply put, everyone who we suspect of carrying weapons or anyone who we know was armed during past events should worry, because we are keeping an eye on them. It is true. Why? Because that person was carrying a weapon. Everyone who has not been involved in violence can be calm because we have no problem with them. Let's put it that way. However, it is definitely untrue that we have arrested or harassed anyone. I will say, however, that anyone who is going around armed should worry. That is our duty, and we are determine to banish violence and the use of violent methods. [end recording] The Police's main concern is to keep the strike from creating a violent situation of which criminals could take advantage. Caldera then emphasized the Police's continuous surveillance and willingness to use force if the situation warrants such actions.
