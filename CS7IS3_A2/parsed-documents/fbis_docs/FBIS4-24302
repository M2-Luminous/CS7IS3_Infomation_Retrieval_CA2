Addressing the joint standing committee on finance, he said R37 million [rand] of the R3.093 billion Special Defence Account was earmarked for intelligence projects. The remainder of the SDA was allocated to capital expenditure and non-project related expenditure such as ammunition, weapons, missiles, vehicles, spares and repairs. The SDA was subject to more stringent control than the rest of the defence budget. Any expenditure had to be authorised by both the ministers of defence and finance.

R297 million had been cut from the SDA for re-allocation to the Reconstruction and Development Programme in the current financial year. He offered the joint committee a detailed briefing on the manner in which the SANDF determined its strategic threat analysis which forms the basis for its budgeting.
