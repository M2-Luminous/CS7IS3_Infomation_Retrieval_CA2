FR940707-0-00014 FR940707-0-00007 22 CFR 514.14 sets forth only minimum insurance requirements, so exchange visitors and their families are encouraged to be educated consumers and consult with insurance professionals, rating services, and insurance regulators before determining their insurance coverage. Comment The Agency invites comments from the public on this interim final rule. The Agency is under no legal requirement to invite comments. The designation of exchange visitor sponsors and the administration of the Exchange Visitor Program are deemed to be foreign affairs functions of the United States Government. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)(1989) specifically exempts such functions from the rulemaking requirements of the Act. The Agency will accept comments for 30 days after publication of this interim final rule. A final rule will be published thereafter to respond to comments received and to promulgate changes, if any, as part of the Exchange Visitor Program regulations, 22 CFR Part 514. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Agency certifies that this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is not considered to be a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does it have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.
