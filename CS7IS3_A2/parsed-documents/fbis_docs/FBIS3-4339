The poll found that respondents believed products from the United States, Japan and Germany topped other countries in terms of product quality, followed by Mainland China, Taiwan and Central American nations. "This rating flies in the face of international praise for Taiwan products," Stan Shih, chairman of the Brand International Promotion Association told reporters after reading the poll results. Shih said the poll was conducted by the US-based Gallup Organization and divided responses into three areas, North America, South America and the rest of the world. The arbitrary division may have influenced the survey outcome, Shih said. "Those surveyed from countries with poor educational standards may have confused Taiwan with Thailand or thought of Taiwan as part of Mainland China," he added. Secretary-General Huang Hsing-kuo of the private Foreign Trade Association explained that the low product quality rating also may have resulted from a high number of survey responses from India and Latin America. "Taiwan product promotion efforts target the US and Europe and not other areas of the globe," Huang explained. "As a result, Americans and Europeans are well aware that Taiwan products are of the highest quality, but people from other countries may not know this," he added.
