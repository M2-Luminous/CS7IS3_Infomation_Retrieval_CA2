The Slovenian Foreign Ministry has assessed, in agreement with the Ministry for Culture, that the arrival of Pavic and the "Branko Krsmanovic" choir in Ljubljana are "not in the interest of the Slovenian state," TANJUG learned. The ministry did not specify in what way the artists were a threat to the state of Slovenia. Pavic and the "Branko Krsmanovic" choir were to take part in an academy marking the day of St. Sava in Ljubljana, which is organized by the Serbian Orthodox community. The action by the Slovenian authorities has in fact indirectly prevented this ceremony from taking place. St. Sava day has been celebrated by Serbian Orthodox Christians on January 27 since the early thirteenth century when Rastko Nemanjic, a Serbian medieval ruler, monk and educator was proclaimed Saint Sava after his death. Peran Boskovic, a priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Ljubljana, recently sent a letter to Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, urging him to help enable the holding of Orthodox religious ceremonies. There has been no reply yet. This indirect assault on religious ceremonies of non-Slovenes by the Slovenian authorities, which took place despite promises by certain Catholic Church dignitaries that other religions would not be discriminated against in Slovenia, might provoke an embittered protest by tens of thousands of Serbs who live in Slovenia. Slovenia recently twice in two weeks banned entry into Slovenia to well-known Serbian pop singer Mocilo Bajagic Bajaga, although his concerts in Ljubljana and Maribor had been sold out.
