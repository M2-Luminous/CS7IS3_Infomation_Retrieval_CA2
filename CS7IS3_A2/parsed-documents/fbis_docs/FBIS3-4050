Following the two current sessions [as heard], Tibet has announced measures for reform in nine sectors: reform of agriculture and animal husbandry, the investment structure, revenues and taxes, the housing system, and so forth. These measures have been announced after repeated deliberation and taking into consideration the views of various sectors. This year, we will be combining package reform with breakthroughs in key areas. We must also take Tibet's realities into account. We should be bold, but the measures we adopt must be well-considered. Under such a guideline, we set an annual GNP target of 4,002,000,000 yuan, an increase of 8 percent over last year. I believe this target can be reached through the concerted efforts of people of all nationalities in the region. [passage omitted] [end Norbu recording]
