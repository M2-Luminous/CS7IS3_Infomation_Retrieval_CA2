Forms of Iron that May be Less Toxic As previously discussed in this document, some evidence suggests that carbonyl iron, an elemental iron powder, seems to be effective in the prevention or treatment of iron deficiency, and that it might be significantly less toxic than other forms of iron commonly used in iron-containing products. The agency requested data on the acute toxicity in humans, and particularly in children, of elemental iron. FDA stated that, if information is received that is persuasive that the use of elemental iron will substantially decrease the risk of pediatric poisoning while allowing for effective dietary iron supplementation, it will consider exempting iron-containing products that incorporate reduced iron from any regulations that result from this rulemaking. FDA does not have any information regarding the availability of such forms of iron for use in iron-containing products. Nor does FDA possess any information that would allow it to determine how many products would be reformulated with less toxic forms of iron in order to take advantage of such an exemption. FDA requests comment on the economic impact of exempting products containing less toxic forms of iron. 6. Consumer Education Campaign Two of the three petitions that FDA received advocated educational efforts for the public and health professionals. FDA agrees that the public needs to be informed of the dangers of pediatric iron poisoning. The fact that in 7 years over 2,000 poisonings have occurred that have required some kind of treatment indicates that the public is not aware of the potential for serious harm or death in young children from accidental ingestion of iron-containing products. FDA is developing materials for a public information campaign utilizing the channels available to the agency.
