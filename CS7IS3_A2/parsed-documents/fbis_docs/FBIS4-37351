The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from Mashhad, Khorramabad, Khodabandeh, and Ahar and Haris gave preagenda speeches. Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. Mohammad Hadi-'Abdkhoda'i, Deputy From Mashhad It is the skilled academic work force that is bringing the nation to a peak of cultural, political and economic authority. The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was 'Abdkhoda'i, deputy from Mashhad. He offered condolences on the martyrdom of Imam Javad (peace be upon him). He said: The Majles is at the end of the First Five-Year Plan and the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan. There is much to say about the splendidness of the Islamic revolution and its power to endure, about the crimes of world imperialism and its practices, about the cultural invasion and ostentation, about the economic programs and the mistakes of some of their planners, about high prices, inflation and ways to keep them down, about balance between the private and government sectors and avoiding one-dimensional activity, about controlling prices, about excessive purchases of goods, about borrowing and its consequences, and about the need for subsidies to support the deprived. He continued: The Second Five-Year Plan must bring the country as close as possible to independence and nondependence. It must rely on high production, less consumption, more exports and fewer imports, and it must anticipate consequences and problems. The speaker also discussed higher education programs. He said: The experts are presenting factors that will help a country grow and develop such as natural resources, manpower and proper management, but above all these things one can consider skilled academic manpower. Even capable management and useful manpower arise from their ranks. Continuing, 'Abdkhoda'i said: It is the skilled academic work force that is bringing the nation to a peak of cultural, political and economic authority and makes the best use of natural resources. The deputy from Mashhad said that to the extent it is able the government must invest in manpower training in the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: In this regard there is need for several reminders: 1. Manpower training must be done with proper planning based on needs. 2. The educational centers must definitely place great emphasis on the quality of education. Today we have little skilled manpower at the research and doctoral levels compared to our needs, and in this regard the doctoral programs must be reinforced both in quality and quantity. 3. The universities must give importance to applied knowledge and make knowledge work with ability. Some of our professors are even more advanced than the foreign professors academically, but unfortunately there are two shortages. One is that although they are strong in theory, in the area of practice they are not as strong, and they also lack the tools for work. 'Abdkhoda'i then said: A short experiment in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] was hopeful. As the result of cooperation between the academic institutions and the executive universities, by the end of the month of Azar [30 December], 453 projects were carried out or were under way. A total of 19.8 billion rials was spent and there was a good return. The speaker discussed education at the doctoral level. He said: It was a disaster at our universities that last year in the nonmedical fields we had only about 1,200 doctoral students inside the country. In the same regard I must say that one of the benefits of forming the Ministry of Health was the admission of more students. In the year 1356 [21 March 1977-20 March 1978] 844 students were admitted, but in the year 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] the number reached 6,480, almost eight times as many, and this is considered a source of pride for the Islamic Republic of Iran. Unfortunately, however, after that the figures declined, so that in the year 1372 medical student admissions throughout the country was 3,656, and this figure is fully evocative. The deputy from Mashhad discussed the shortage of physicians in the country and the fact that the number of our physicians is about one-fifth the number of physicians in some industrial nations. He said: Why are our professors unable to accept more students? At the end of his speech, the deputy from Mashhad discussed the deprived areas in the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: On the fringes of the major cities and also in their rural areas we have places that are living in deprivation, but because they are close to prosperous areas, they do not receive the benefits of deprived areas, and their needs must definitely be addressed. Today one of the important sources of foreign exchange is tourism, and Mashhad can be the best base for attracting visitors from all the Islamic nations. However, the government must invest, and it must see Mashhad as a national city in relation to all of Iran and an international city in the world of Islam. Mohammad Saleh-Taheri, Deputy From Khorramabad In the last 15 years we have not had a firm and comprehensive policy on economic matters. The next speaker was Taheri, deputy from Khorramabad. In his speech he said: In the last year we have not had a firm and comprehensive policy on economic matters. Although the president of the republic, as the most concerned executive official, has always worked unceasingly and has not been out of range or immune to damage from domestic and foreign enemies, God has always been generous with his boundless help at sensitive times. He added: The chaotic foreign exchange market; the 7-tuman competitive rate and the 80-tuman rate for foreign exchange; the failure to anchor the inflationary rate for the dollar; the release of contradictory guidelines by the banks themselves; insubstantial and increasing taxes, which in my view erode the principle of investment; increases in the rate on bank deposits to 18.5 percent by the Money and Credit Council, which is very strongly rumored; the increase in the rate on foreign exchange for investment in projects without setting priorities; and the failure to control either the unregulated or the government prices. [sentence as published] The deputy from Khorramabad noted: For example, the price of a kilogram of cucumbers increases from 15 to 150 tumans between the time it leaves the hands of the producer until it reaches the consumer of Africa Street. The oil price crisis and the playing with OPEC that is being done by foreigners and economic speculators, low prices whenever production is high, low production whenever prices are high and thousands of other problems have given our country an ailing economy. Our people know well that everyone was mobilized during the war and they were never psychologically shocked in victory or in defeat under the leadership of the late leader of the revolution, the fifth anniversary of whose death is approaching, because the participation of the people and the close relationship between the leader and the people prevailed over the problem of the war. Unfortunately, that formula is not working in the economic situation. He explained that in his view the people are innocent. He said: The people do not doubt the sincerity of the officials. Today economic planning requires a lot of manpower. A handful of experts, no matter how good, will not solve the problem. Mr. Hashemi is the guardian of policy, culture, society, and religion. Economics is another matter. In my view we need to reconsider the situation. I myself have been among the gentlemen for 30 years, with the revolutionaries both before and after the opening of Mecca. We ourselves still have not been unable to understand, much less our other people. Deputies, there is still time, but tomorrow will be too late. While we still have these honest companions of the Imam, while we are still under the shadow of the leader and the vice regency of the chief jurisconsult, who always has the last word, you must clarify the nation's economic situation. This problem must be solved. Taheri discussed the fact that we do not reject work and service in the country. He said: Work has been done in all the ministries. These communications and their extensive reach, fiber optics and copper cable in Yazd, petrochemicals in Bandar-Emam and thousands of other phenomena are undeniable. These phenomena should stimulate questions and conversation, instead of us having interpellation and bringing the country to a standstill, although interpellation is the clear right of the deputies and in some cases is a necessary and unavoidable procedure. The blessed trip by the president of the republic to the province of Lorestan, the new political coordination in the province thanks to his visit, and the documented report from the province's political official made at the Administrative Council in the presence of the president of the republic were and are desired by all the general managers, Friday imams and the province's contingent of deputies, and the report must be published in the province. He added: Among this trip's many blessings was the lighting of the gas flame at Borujerd and Aligudarz and the ground breaking for the gas facilities at Khorramabad by the minister of petroleum. For this purpose 2 billion tumans has been set aside and allocated. The rightful promise of the petrochemical units in the province are compensation for the losses to Lorestan caused by the oppressive construction of the petrochemical complex in Arak. Continuing, Taheri issued a memo to the minister of the interior about creating governorates in Azna, Alshotor, and Poldokhtar. He noted: The main problem in the country is clarification of the economic situation and its disrupted state in all its dimensions. The main problem in the province of Lorestan is unemployment, unemployment and unemployment. Seyyed Mohammad 'Ali Musavi, Deputy From Khodabandeh The Second Five-Year Plan must be designed in such a way that the people will be optimistic about the nation's future. The next speaker was Musavi, deputy from Khodabandeh. During his speech he offered condolences on the occasion of the martyrdom of Imam Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him). He discussed the exalted leader's New Year's message with regard to the work ethic, social order, and designing the Second Five-Year Plan. He expressed the hope that the plan will be designed in such a way that the people will be more optimistic than before about the nation's future. The speaker then discussed the report on activities carried out by the president of the republic with regard to the First Five-Year Plan. He said: It is hoped that the Majles and the toiling government will take hopeful steps to stop the bad effects of inflation and high prices and to reform the nation's administrative structure, which is already under discussion. The deputy from Khodabandeh then discussed the various advances that have been made in the country. He said: In the year 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] 3.79 million tons of wheat was produced, while 10.8 million tons was produced in the year 1372. With regard to communications, the results of one year of activity in communications were equal to 20 years of communications activity before the revolution. In conclusion, he said: 1. The minister of petroleum is asked to take note of the cold climate in the Khodabandeh region and its short season for laying gas pipes, and he is asked to give attention to the matter of supplying gas service to this municipality. 2. I ask the minister of roads and transportation to deal expeditiously with the first section of the road from Qidar to Bijar, which was abandoned incomplete, while its second section from Bijar to the east was completed, and also to attend to the road from Qidar to Kabudarahang, on which work is proceeding slowly. 3. I asked the minister of agriculture to help his representative more than before with the procurement of agricultural implements. Valiollah Ahmadi-Zadsaray, Deputy From Ahar and Haris To solve the problems of the people, some thinking must be done so that they will no longer be subjected to the pressures of inflation and high prices. Ahmadi-Zadsaray, deputy from Ahar and Haris, was the final preagenda speaker. During his speech he offered condolences on the martyrdom of Imam Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him) and he commemorated Teacher Week. He said: Now, as the task of studying the government's Second Five-Year Plan is on the agendas of the Majles commissions, I ask my respected colleagues to give attention to the following as they study the plan: In view of the situation that has developed and is developing in the world with regard to oil prices, destroying the justification for the prices, in designing the Second Five-Year Plan measures must be adopted to deliver the nation from dependence on oil, and the planners must give great importance to agricultural and livestock products and their export. He added: Many studies must be done concerning the creation of conversion industries and agriculture and animal husbandry, and we must give priority to the creation of such industries. The importation of nonessential and decorative goods must be avoided. Consideration must be given to the problem of youth unemployment, especially those who have sacrificed, combatants and injured war veterans, and more attention must be given to the creation of employment-creating projects. To solve the problems of the people, especially the deprived and oppressed classes of society and the government staff workers, they must do some thinking and planning so they will no longer be subjected to the pressures of inflation and high prices. He expressed thanks for the trip by the minister of energy and his entourage to the area. He said: During Teacher Week Ahar witnessed the minister of education and training going among the people and the teachers. On the auspicious occasion of this esteemed week, the teacher training building was opened, and I thank him for that. I ask the government to allocate industrial and employment-creating projects in view of the fact that the necessary potential exists in the municipalities of Ahar and Haris, and to take effective steps to create employment for the region's unemployed to bring about economic growth in the region. I ask the minister of education and training and the minister of higher education to start the agricultural college that was approved years ago, and to construct a building on the donated land. He also mentioned the shortage of athletic facilities in his electoral district. Legislation Motion on Procedures for Rendering Obligatory Service for Graduates in the Judicial Sciences The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was continued consideration of the report from the first consultation of the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission concerning the Motion To Spend the Period of Obligatory Service for Graduates From the Judicial Affairs Colleges in the Nation's Public Prosecutor's Offices and Judicial Courts, the general form of which was approved. It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned motion states: "Graduates from the judicial affairs colleges affiliated with the Ministry of Justice of the Islamic Republic of Iran who have not performed their service as soldiers, provided they commit to at least five years of service in the judicial power, are exempt from service under the flag in peacetime." Reasoning of Opponents and Supporters To summarize the remarks of the motion's opponents, this action is discriminatory and is not a good innovation. What is the difference between law colleges and other universities and the Ministry of Justice Judicial Sciences College, that the students in the judicial sciences should be exempt, but not students from the other colleges? The other government universities are going to learn that they must say that their graduates should be exempt from service as soldiers. Supporters of the motion claim that this action is not discriminatory, but it is a solution to the nation's judicial problems. They say if it were discriminatory, we would not permit students in teacher training colleges to spend their obligatory military service time as teachers in various regions. Likewise, with regard to this motion, Dr. Shahrzad, deputy from Esfahan, issued a warning in accordance with Article 75 of the Constitution that this motion entails a financial burden and is a violation of the Constitution. Motion To Elect Members of the Commission To Reclaim the Wages of Deputies From Dissolved Majleses The second item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission concerning the Motion To Elect Members of the Commission To Reclaim the Wages of Deputies From Dissolved Majleses, the general form of which was not approved and was rejected. It is worth mentioning that Article 1 of the motion states: "The chiefs of the Judicial Affairs Commission and the Accounting Court and the chief of the Majles Administrative Organization are designated as members of the commission mentioned in the Law on Procedures for Collecting the Wages Paid to Those Who Were Appointed as Deputies between 3/15/1342 [June 5 1963] through 11/22/1357 [11 February 1979], enacted 5/19/1358 [August 10 1979], and the amendment dated 3/25/1359 [15 June 1980]." Iran Joins the Maritime Search and Rescue Convention The next item on the agenda was the report from the Housing and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill To Add the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Maritime Search and Rescue Convention. The aforementioned bill was approved by the Majles. Bill on Employment and Social Facilities for Wounded Veterans The next item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission on the Bill on Employment and Social Facilities for Wounded Veterans of the Islamic Revolution, the general form of which was approved. The aforementioned bill's goals include: (a) creating the necessary conditions to preserve and extend the spiritual and ongoing presence of wounded veterans in economic and cultural settings (b) supporting the aspirations, perpetuating the ideological and cultural activities of wounded veterans and improving their individual, family and social circumstances (j) creating the ability to apply and coordinate the nation's administrative and employment regulations with the special bodily circumstances of wounded war veterans. Rashidi, the commission's expert, said concerning this bill: The period allowed for the experimental implementation of this law, which was approved in the year 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991], has already expired, and the government has presented this bill to the Majles. He then added: It is the duty of the government and the Majles to strive to alleviate the social deficiencies for our sacrificing wounded war veterans, who have expended their bodies and souls to preserve and guard the valuable achievements of the Islamic revolution, and who now have bodily and psychological defects. Motion To Prohibit the Use of Satellite Antennas The Motion To Prohibit the Use of Satellite Antennas (Dish Antennas) was presented by a number of deputies as a single-urgency motion. Mr. Nateq-Nuri deemed it advisable to give priority consideration to this motion and to have it placed on the Majles agenda as an ordinary motion with priority. It is worth mentioning in this regard that Mr. Nateq-Nuri said: This motion does not need an urgency rating, but I ask that it be given priority. This motion, whose arrival was announced at the Wednesday open Majles session (yesterday), emphasis is given to the prohibition on importing, construction, distribution and use of the satellite antennas. The motion states: The Ministry of the Interior is required to use the police to gather up satellite antennas in the shortest time possible, through the use of police forces. The Ministry of the Interior is also required to use any possible means to prevent the importation, manufacture or distribution of satellite antennas, and, in the course of confiscating the aforementioned implements, to turn over the perpetrators to the competent courts. In this bill, which was signed by about 20 deputies, penalties are provided for violators. Views of Engineer Yusefpur Concerning the Motion To Prohibit Satellite Dishes Mr. Yusefpur, deputy chief of the Councils Commission and deputy from Ardel, discussed the Motion To Prohibit Satellite Dishes with our parliamentary correspondent. He said: Because satellite dishes are a new phenomenon in our country and because there is now no law of any kind concerning their use or prohibition, and because the executive organizations are now uncertain how to deal with them, a motion was prepared to permit individuals and organizations who need to use satellite dishes to perform their duties with authorization from the Ministry of Islamic Guidance. He noted: Currently the use of satellite dishes is prohibited to all the people except in special cases in most Western and non-Islamic nations. We must realize that the Western nations are not willing to tolerate the slightest cultural phenomenon from us. How can we leave them free to freely spread various kinds of political and cultural propaganda in our country? Discussing the important points in this bill, Mr. Yusefpur said: In this motion the unauthorized use of satellite dishes is prohibited, importers and producers will be punished, and the satellite antennas will be collected. In conclusion he said: Some people believe that the phenomenon of satellite dishes cannot be physically opposed, but these people must be told that there is a way to fight any technical or specialist phenomenon that is produced.
