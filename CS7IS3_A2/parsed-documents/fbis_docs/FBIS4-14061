"I believe what (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin) said is positive...it is the first time he makes such a statement and it (means) an acceptance of the truth that peace cannot be achieved as long as the settlements exist in their current shape," Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali told reporters. Restating Jordan's position that settlements are an obstacle to peace, Dr. al-Majali said the Hebron massacre was a major factor in "shaking the idea of building and keeping settlements." Dr. al-Majali said Jordan was ready to hold the meetings of the Jordanian-Palestinian coordination committees, blaming the failure of these committees to meet on the Palestinian engagement with the autonomy talks in Egypt. He said this engagement partly justifies the Palestine Liberation Organisation's (PLO) failure to hold the meetings of these committees but "does not justify it fully because a long time has passed (since the formation of committees)." He said, "our fear for the absence of coordination is that our brothers in the organisation do not have enough experience in certain issues and we are more experienced than them and could help them and avoid harm." But coordination with Syria "is at its best," said Dr. al-Majali adding that Syria supports Jordan's demand for an end to the siege on al-'Aqabah and the two countries along with other Arab partners will meet to coordinate before the resumption of the bilateral peace talks. He said the Hebron massacre and the siege on al-'Aqabah contributed to the halting of the peace talks until the emergence of positive signs about these issues. Dr. al-Majali rejected accusations that his government lacked a strategy on the process or its media policy, saying Jordan was among the first countries to seek peace in the region. Reiterating Jordan's commitment to a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, the prime minister said Jordan will be ready for discussing all issues related to the peace process when it resumes. He said Jordan will take into consideration developments on other tracks of the negotiations which will lead to peace treaties in accordance with the Madrid formula. Dr. al-Majali repeated Jordan's rejection of Israel's "illogical" demands to sign a peace treaty before resolving the issues on the agenda for the talks signed by the two countries in September last year. He said the objective of the negotiations is to reach a peace treaty but only after all issues in the agenda have been resolved. In reply to a question on the status of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Jordan, Dr. al-Majali reiterated that Jordan does not accept "any illegal grouping" and will only deal with the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people. Dr. al-Majali said Jordanian relations with some Gulf Arab countries have improved but said "some issues" remain unresolved between the Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. "Time will reveal it all and the day will come when the brothers will realise that we did not do them any wrong at all," the prime minister told foreign correspondents at the Prime Ministry. Dr. al-Majali held the Jordanian media responsible for the failure of the reconciliation efforts among Arab states, adding that Jordan received some complaints from some Arab Gulf countries about reports carried by the country's unofficial media. "The role of the press was not positive in improving relations," Dr. al-Majali said, expressing an opinion he has projected earlier. Dr. al-Majali, who said the media "shoulders 95 per cent of the responsibility" for the tension in relations with the Gulf, said Jordan had told countries which complained that the media in Jordan are free and "we have never guided (them)," adding that the Press and Publication Law bans the publishing of news that harm friendly countries and legal cases have been launched against those who violated the law. Pointing out that the government cannot control the unofficial press, Dr. al-Majali said, "the role played by the official media towards Arab relations is positive and there was nothing in them that could be interpreted as offensive to our brothers in the Arab countries." Responding to a question on whether Egypt was trying to undermine Jordan's role in the region, Dr. al-Majali said that Egypt and Jordan had strong relations and the two countries look into means of strengthening them. The prime minister said Jordan played a mediation role in the Yemeni conflict upon the request of its leaders who trust the wisdom of His Majesty King Husayn. But he said there are differences in Yemen that might have become personal which makes the implementation of the reconciliation agreement signed in Amman difficult. The prime minister said: "We believe in the Iraqi people, their freedom and (the need) to lift the injustice inflicted upon them." The Iraqi people, he said, "are free in their choice of its leadership and we do not impose our opinion on them because we do not allow ourselves to interfere in the affairs of others." Asked about the reported involvement of an Arab country in the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut in January, Dr. al-Majali said the results of the investigation conducted by the Lebanese authorities did not name any country behind the assassination. The prime minister said the two suspects arrested in the case admitted that their organisation, Abu-Nidal Group, assassinated Mr. Ma'ayitah because it "was not happy with Jordan's policy." It was "a big plot; too many people were involved," said Dr. al-Majali, adding that the assassins had planned to kill the Jordanian ambassador in Beirut.
