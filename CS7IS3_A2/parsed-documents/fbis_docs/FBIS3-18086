The trip coincides with growing worry in Western capitals that resurgent Russian nationalism is pushing Moscow into a more confrontational attitude towards the West. The mission comprises the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Robert Hunter, and his counterparts from Britain, Sir John Weston, and Spain, Carlos Miranda. A U.S. spokesman at NATO said the trip "explains and seeks to encourage membership" by Russia in a Partnership for Peace initiative between the trans-Atlantic alliance and countries of the former Soviet bloc. The initiative involves East-West cooperation in a wide range of military and political activities ranging from joint military manoeuvres to peace-keeping. A NATO source, speaking on condition that he not be named, said the alliance was anxious to get Russia to join. "We want to get the message across clearly that NATO is not trying to isolate Russia." He added: "We are at a very delicate stage of our relations with Russia. We want a harmonious relationship of cooperation with it.... It is clear we must work doubly hard in establishing (military) relations with Russia." [passage omitted]
