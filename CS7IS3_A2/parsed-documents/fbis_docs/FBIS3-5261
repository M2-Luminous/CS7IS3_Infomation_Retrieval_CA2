Super 301 is a fearsome weapon as far as the United States is concerned, and that country hopes that the article will force Japan to open its market to U.S. products. [passage omitted] President George Bush used Super 301 in 1989 and 1990. Japan was the target of the article in 1989 and as a result agreed to open its supercomputer and satellite markets. It is worth noting that in the two years that the United States used Super 301, the ultimate part of the article was never applied: that is, the United States has never used Super 301 to carry out trade sanctions or retaliation against any country. It can be said that Super 301 is merely a threat, not a tool to be implemented. In the latest development, the United States has declared that it would apply Super 301 against Japan. However, it is evident that there are many steps in the process: that is, on 31 March the United States will publish a trade report which will identify the countries which are considered to be unfair trading partners. [passage omitted] The important point is that there is a considerable time lag before the sword of Super 301 is actually delivered to the victim. This situation makes Japanese investors feel impervious to the threat of Super 301. The Tokyo stock market went up 360.14 points on 4 March as if to challenge the U.S. announcement. The Japanese feel that Japan will open its market voluntarily before the Super 301's deadline. Therefore, although U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced the use of Super 301, Japanese investors feel that the United States was merely play acting. Asian stock markets have also not shown that much concern about the matter. The Thai stock market went up 18.87 points despite recent weak trading. The Nikkei soared 360 points, while the Hang Seng increased 116 points. The story seems to be that Japan itself has not been frightened by the Super 301 issue, and Thailand would therefore be overreacting if it became frightened.
