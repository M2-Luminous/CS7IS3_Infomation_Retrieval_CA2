Punishment ranges between six months and two years of imprisonment. Two opinions, one raised by the Legislative Committee and another by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, were considered. The first paragraph of Article No. 1 states that violations include "opinions, remarks, or expressions on partisan politics or proselytizing acts." There was a long discussion on the possibility of applying this provision to public or private activities. As we went to press, some congressmen were asking for a reconsideration of this paragraph. The senators also described as a violation "any presence at meetings organized by political, partisan, movement, municipal, departmental, or national authorities that are not of an official, professional, or merely social nature." Another violation of the bill approved by the plenary session involves "the presence of military or police personnel at meetings of political parties, movements, or factions, even if said meetings are held at buildings that do not belong to any party or movement." In addition, "efforts to raise funds and resources for any type of political activity, their donation, or their management by military or police personnel or any intermediary" will be considered a violation. In its last paragraph, the bill describes "political party or movement membership" by military or police personnel as a serious violation. Article No. 2 establishes that ordinary criminal courts will hear the appropriate proceedings, which may be filed through an official petition or through a petition by any qualified person. Article No. 3 establishes that an arrest warrant against military or police personnel involved in these violations will automatically entail the suspension of their duties and that they will serve their arrest at a unit established by the office of the Armed Forces commander-in-chief or the national police. The last article of the approved bill states that those who violate the current bill will be liable to a prison term ranging between six months and two years.
