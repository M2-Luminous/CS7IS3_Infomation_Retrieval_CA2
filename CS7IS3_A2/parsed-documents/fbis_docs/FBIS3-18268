This is the result of a Trust Agency poll. However, part of this personnel reduction has already been implemented, the Trust Agency announced in Berlin on Wednesday [23 February]. The Trust Agency thus refuted reports that in Saxony-Anhalt alone 22,000 lay-offs are imminent and in Thuringia 10,000. Even the 29,000 employees of Trust Agency companies that are in the process of being liquidated are not all affected by lay-offs, it is said, because so far one-third of the jobs in liquidated companies have been preserved. In addition, the Trust Agency points out that not all of those laid-off will be released into the labor market. More than half of those who have been dismissed so far have been included in labor market policy measures. Before the beginning of privatization in 1990, about 4 million people had worked in Trust Agency companies. Today the proportion of Trust Agency employees in the overall number of people employed in eastern Germany is only 2.9 percent. Two-thirds of the remaining 149,000 employees work in companies still to be privatized, including 22,000 in management companies. A total of 19,000 people work in companies that have already been sold. In addition, 15,000 people are employed in brown coal improvement companies, which will probably be financed until 1997 via Article 249h of the Labor Promotion Law.
