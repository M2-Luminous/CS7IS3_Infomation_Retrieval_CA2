FBIS4-24674 "drchi105_n_94038" FBIS-CHI-94-105 Daily Report 30 May 1994 Economic & Agricultural Ministry Issues Notice on Rapeseed Purchasing Ministry Issues Notice on Rapeseed Purchasing OW3105103394 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 0851 GMT 30 May 94 OW3105103394 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service Chinese BFN [Text] Beijing, 30 May (XINHUA) -- According to the Ministry of Internal Trade, owing to larger rapeseed acreage this year, rapeseed output is expected to be higher than that of last year; and owing to arriving shipments of cooking oil imported with the State Council's approval, the cooking oil supply and demand are calming down in the market, and the price is quite stable. As the supply of summer rapeseed will continue to increase in the market, the Ministry of Internal Trade and the State Administration of Grain Reserves yesterday issued a "Notice on Intensifying the Market Management of Cooking Oil and Doing a Good Job in Summer Rapeseed Purchasing." The notice says: While various localities are doing a good job and making quick progress in rapeseed purchasing, certain localities appear to be ready to fight a "big purchasing war" [shougou dazhan 2392 6356 1129 2069] for rapeseed. The notice urges state-operated grain departments to take effective measures to fulfill state-set quotas of purchasing 70 to 80 percent of rapeseed needed for processing into cooking oil. It says: In each and every county, which should be treated as one unit, state-operated grain departments there must purchase rapeseed strictly in accordance with the collective plan and price. By no means should they compete with one another in purchasing rapeseed by offering a higher price, much less should they compete with buyers in other provinces by offering a higher price. Whoever has been found to do so in violation of regulations will have their grain and oil operating license revoked, their illegal profits confisticated, and the rapeseed they have purchased will be turned over to state-operated grain departments at a set price. Control in all channels must be intensified, and responsbilities must be prescribed and fulfilled. Under local governments' leadership, grain departments should work in close coordination with business, price, public security, and taxation departments; and share responsibilities with them in exercising stronger supervision over rapeseed purchasing and law enforcement so that normal market order can be maintained. To stabilize the cooking oil market, there should be effective measures for guarding against competitive rapeseed purchasing through various channels, and earnest efforts must be made to prevent a big war [da zhan 1129 2069] in rapeseed purchasing.
