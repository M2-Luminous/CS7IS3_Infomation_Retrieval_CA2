"Our country hails the avoidance of air strikes," Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "We hope this will lead to a first step toward peace not only in Bosnia but also in the former Yugoslavia as well," the top government spokesman said. A deadline for the Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons or surrender them to United Nations peacekeepers expired at midnight Sunday GMT with some of the weapons still in place on the snowy mountains around Sarajevo. But NATO agreed not to launch air strikes after Yasushi Akashi, a Japanese national who serves as the UN special envoy in Sarajevo, said he sees no need to do so, at least for the moment. Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito also welcomed NATO's suspension of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, saying it is a great step forward toward a peaceful solution to the problems in the former Yugoslavia. Saito told a press conference Japan will steadily implement its contribution plan hammered out earlier this month after a government mission toured the former Yugoslavia in early January. Under the plan, Japan will not participate in UN peacekeeping operations there "at present" but will extend humanitarian assistance of between 10 million and 15 million dollars to international organizations. Tokyo also plans to boost economic and technical aid to Macedonia. Saito also welcomed Russia's initiative in persuading Bosnian Serbs to begin a major withdrawal of heavy weapons around Sarajevo. He said, however, the latest avoidance of air strikes is not the final solution since the problems in the former Yugoslavia are deep- rooted, and called on all concerned parties to try to solve the problems through peaceful means.
