Sergio de Mello, UN civil affairs coordinator for ex-Yugoslavia, told reporters after the meeting that the agreement on the tank movement reached by Akashi Tuesday [3 May] with Bosnian Serb leaders was made "in the context of a rather complex and long negotiation." De Mello said he was "not in Sarajevo to admit mistakes," but declined to provide details of his discussions with Izetbegovic, who has demanded Akashi's dismissal over the issue. Since Akashi agreed to allow seven Serb tanks to pass through the NATO-enforced 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital, five have transited to the Trnovo region south of the city, a sixth has been blocked by UN troops near the Serb-held suburb of Lukavica and a seventh has gone missing in Serb-held Grbavica, close to the city centre. The Bosnian authorities, angered by Akashi's decision, have written to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali asking him to sack Akashi, and have said they will refuse to cooperate with the envoy any longer. UN peacekeeping officials in Sarajevo were also dismayed at the decision. De Mello said he would "certainly not" replace Akashi in subsequent dealings between the United Nations and the Bosnian authorities. Meanwhile, soldiers of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) continued searching for the missing Serb T-34 tank, UNPROFOR said in a statement early Sunday. A UN source said on Saturday that the tank was probably hidden in a large building such as a barn or a warehouse in or near Grbavica. The concession for Serb tanks to pass through the Sarajevo exclusion zone was "not the only event that may have slowed down the peace process in recent times," De Mello said. It was "perhaps not the most striking of the setbacks" suffered by the peace process, and mediators were hoping to resolve "other chronic problems," citing the situation in the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde, the northwestern Bihac region and "other hot-spots." His talks with Izetbegovic had covered the situation in Gorazde where there remained "some seemingly minor but in fact very important differences" to resolve, notably the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces, "especially the Serb militia," from the three-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion zone. Izetbegovic again insisted on full Serb compliance with NATO ultimatums and exclusion zones as a prior condition for agreeing to a country-wide ceasefire.
