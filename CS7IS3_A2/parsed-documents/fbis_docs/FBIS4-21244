The problems which appear in big politics are fortunately not felt in security policy,'' Beckstein said in an interview with CTK. He said he considered car smuggling, documents forgery, illegal migration and antiques smuggling from the Czech Republic the main problems on the common Bavarian-Czech border. ``Antiques smuggling considerably harms the Czech Republic,'' said Beckstein, adding that Bavaria ``has taken many successful steps in this respect. The Czechs did so in the smuggling of German cars.'' The Czech-Bavarian border is also the main route for heroin smugglers. Last year customs officials seized 520 kilograms on the Czech-Bavarian border and 531 kilograms the year before. With regard to illegal immigration, Beckstein said Bavaria wanted a readmission agreement between the Czech Republic and Germany to be concluded soon. In 1993 Bavarian border guards detained almost 1,700 people smuggling refugees, of whom 1,285 were seized on the Czech-Bavarian border and the rest on the Bavarian-Austrian border.
