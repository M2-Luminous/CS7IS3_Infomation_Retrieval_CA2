In this lecture, we will mainly discuss consumption and resource taxes. Although consumption taxes will only be levied on products of (?11) major categories, they have drawn strong responses. Enterprises, especially mining enterprises and other resources-exploitation enterprises, are very concerned about resource taxes. Because consumption taxes were proposed, many comrades have asked: Both consumption and value-added taxes [VAT] are levied on some products. Is this a kind of double taxation? Director Chen, would you please explain this? [Chen] First, I have to admit that this does involve double taxation. Why does the new taxation system stipulate that consumption taxes are to be levied on a small group of commodities because VAT is levied on the production and sales of all commodities? We call this method an integration of general regulation and special regulation -- this method currently has been adopted quite widely by many countries. From the viewpoint of enterprises' production and business operations, under market economic conditions, enterprises themselves should mainly decide what and how they want to produce. The undesirable effects of taxes and other economic polices on enterprises should be minimized. [passage omitted] Why do we have to add consumption taxes? Why do we permit double taxation? First, we want to restrict the production and consumption of some products; second, we want to place restrictions on some products of which the supply has outstripped the demand; third, we want to ensure that taxes on some products will be considerably reduced within a specific period. Incidentally, consumption taxes will be grouped into two major categories in the future. The first category will be routine, or fixed, taxes, such as those on cigarettes and liquor, which will be limited by means of a special regulation. The other category is [words indistinct], which may be readjusted from time to time in the future, depending on the economic development situation. [passage omitted] [Jiang] Many people, especially mining enterprises and other resources-exploitation enterprises, have expressed their opinions about the resource taxes. Some of them have said after the new system is instituted, it will be better to buy minerals than to excavate them. Would you please give your opinion on this? [Chen] The new central taxation system still maintains its function of regulating resources. However, there are some differences in form. In the past, there was only one list of taxation rates, which was applicable to all mining enterprises. The new system provides two lists: The first one is the Provisional Regulations on Resource Taxes, which were promulgated by the State Council, and the other is an auxiliary tax rates list which sets the lowest and highest tax rates for each kind of mineral product. The State Council's regulations contain stipulations concerning the tax rates for nearly all kinds of products applicable to enterprises. But these regulations are a basic law, so they do not provide specific stipulations. [passage omitted] [Wang] The resources tax rates are not very high and are considered local taxes. But, according to the Constitution and the Law on Mineral Resources, mineral resources belong to the state. Because of what reasons does the State General Administration of Taxation consider resource taxes to be local taxes? [Chen] Resource taxes are regarded as local tax revenues. To be frank with you, the State General Administration of Taxation did not make the decision. The Finance Ministry studied the issue, and the central authorities made the decision. [passage omitted]
