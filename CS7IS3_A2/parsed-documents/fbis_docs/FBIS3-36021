Medvedev told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday there is a danger that the federal government will support reforms, "while opposition forces might come to power at the regional and republican level". And no matter how constructive the efforts of reformers in the centre are, they don't stand a chance without the support of Russia's regions, he declared. One of the problems revealed by the unfolding local campaigns is, Medvedev explained, that "despite reformers' calls for unification, in actuality we don't have any party structures in the regions". Those parties who do have local power structures are the Communist Party and others of the same leaning. They are now restoring their organisations and will, of course, do everything they can to defeat the reformers in the upcoming local elections, Medvedev said. The economic and financial difficulties in the regions play into the hands of the opposition forces. Medvedev voiced his opinion that reformers can improve their alarming electoral prospects by "honestly explaining their mistakes made in socio-economic and financial policy, which did not take reality into account". After recognizing its mistakes, the Russian Government "should, as soon as possible, determine how it is going to correct its reform policy". "There is a hope that the president's address, to be delivered to parliament on February 18, will be the starting point of a socially-orientated policy", Medvedev pointed out. In his analysis of elections already held in Moscow, the Moscow and Tula regions, and tens of other districts, Medvedev said he thinks the current office-holders are better than their predecessors. Therefore, he supposed, if the democratic forces can unite their efforts, they can be successful in other regions as well. However, the presidential adviser admitted, he has little reason for optimism, since "we cannot rule out the possibility of the formation of a sort of 'red belt' around Moscow", which would be made up of regions with anti-reform and anti-president mind-sets: Tambov, Oryol, Voronezh, Lipetsk, Ryazan, Mordoviya, and Penza". Medvedev was able to find one observation which he could call "comforting". During his trips around the country, he met with various political leaders. From his meetings, Medvedev concluded that many of them, including opposition politicians, are taking a second look at their potential allies, especially Zhirinovskiy's party with its inflammatory statements.
