[Begin recording] [Reina] One reason for my visit to the Swan Islands was to investigate complaints that there might be some sort of strange activity going on there related in some way to the Caribbean situation. I have gone all over the islands and seen what I just told you. Let this serve as evidence to deny any suspicions, rumors, or comments that differ from the truth. [Unidentified reporter] What strange activities were reportedly going on there? [Reina] We were advised by a nearby country that some sort of armed action against a Caribbean country was being prepared there. [Reporter] What country? [Reina] When you speak of the Caribbean, the political problem has always been Cuba, the Republic of Cuba, which I hope will reenter the inter-American system when the island can meet the system's requirements. These complaints had been kept secret, but they could surface later and tarnish Honduras' image. We do not want our country to be hurt in any way. On the contrary, we want Honduran prestige to afford us all possible international assistance and worldwide acceptance, because democracy is reaffirmed every day in Honduras.
