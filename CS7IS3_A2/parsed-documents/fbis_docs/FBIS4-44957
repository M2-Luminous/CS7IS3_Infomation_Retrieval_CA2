FBIS4-44957 "jpnea030___94012" JPRS-NEA-94-030 JPRS Near East & South Asia 27 April 1994 NEAR EAST EGYPT Attorney General Views on Investment Fraud, Corruption Attorney General Views on Investment Fraud, Corruption 94LD0046A Cairo AKHIR SA'AH in Arabic 27 Apr 94 pp 12-14 94LD0046A Cairo AKHIR SA'AH Arabic CSO [Interview with Counselor Raja' al-'Arabi, attorney general of Egypt, by Suhayr al-Husayni; place and date not given: "1994 Is the Year of the End of Troubles for Capital Investors and Settlement of Their Claims"--first paragraph is AKHIR SA'AH introduction] [Text] Issue No. 1: Counselor Raja' al-'Arabi, by virtue of his work as a prosecutor for more than 30 years, is used to asking questions and exercising the authority of an investigator. But in this meeting I asked his permission for us to change roles. I brought up with him a number of important issues that reflect the concerns and worries of Egyptian citizens. The questions were bold and direct, and the replies were confident and definite, and they reflected the man's candor and clarity. It was only natural that the first matter to be brought up in an interview with the attorney general was the case involving the victims of the investment companies. [Al-Husayni] The attorney Shawqi al-Sayyid received a judgment from the courts concerned obliging the state to give back the investors' capital. Why has this judgment not been carried out so far, and to what extent can it be carried out? [Al-'Arabi] A news item really has appeared to the effect that one of the courts has issued a judgment which obliges the state to give back the investors' capital. However, this news item is totally devoid of the truth. What really happened is that three investors of capital in small investment companies filed a lawsuit against the owners of the investment companies and the state in which they demanded that they give back the investors' capital. The court appointed an expert to determine the value of this capital and the deposits, who should pay them, who was responsible for their not being paid so that a judgment can be rendered against these persons. After that, the case was delayed until the expert could present his fees, and the case is still in the courts. This is why this news item was totally false. Responsibility of the State [Al-Husayni] Leaving aside this news item, what is your comment concerning what some investors are saying to the effect that the intervention of the state and law agencies such as the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the State Prosecutor between the investment companies and the investors is the reason for the obstruction of the process restoring the claims of the investors against these companies? [Al-'Arabi] There is no sound basis for saying this, because the state did not intervene in the matter of the investment companies until after it became a problem. In fact, it did not do this until the investors demanded that the state intervene. Just so I don't forget, let us go back and review what happened. What we see is that many loud voices demanded that the state quickly intervene. And when the state legally intervened, these companies were exposed, because they had not been operating on sound bases. The state intervened on the basis of the wish of the masses of people in order to protect the Egyptian economy and in order to protect the investors themselves. The reason is that, since fraudalent acts were taking place, it was possible for these companies to go bankrupt and for their owners to flee abroad. In the case of some companies, this really happened. In such a case, the investors will not get any of their money back. This is why the state intervened and issued a law regulating activity in these companies. When the law was put into effect, these companies were exposed and they stumbled after they were unable to reconcile their situations with the law. For this reason, they were then attached. Even yesterday, some of the owners of the small investment companies, who had been jailed and whose cases were still before the courts, demanded the authorization of the attorney general to sell the assets of their companies so that they could pay the investors what they owed them--in spite of the fact that this long period of time had gone by without their even thinking of authorizing anyone to do so. It was possible for me, as the attorney general, not to intervene at all in this matter, and to wait until judgments were issued against the owners of these companies. And it was likely that the verdict would be that the owners of these companies would be acquitted and we would be forced to turn over the capital to them, and after that it would not be our concern what they would do with the investors. But what I did as attorney general--especially since it is well known that cases such as these drag on a long time in the courts--was to offer to let the owners of the companies who were the defendants return to the investors what they owed them by means of what they would earn from the sales. This is what we are doing right now. I believe that, if the Office of the Attorney General had not intervened and undertaken the sales operations itself, no one would have gotten the prices at which we are selling, because purchasers have boundless trust in the Office of the Attorney General. This is why we are getting higher prices than what the market prices are. For example, a plot of land that was owned by the al-Sharif Company was offered for sale by means of an auction after being advertised in the newspapers. Only one company offered to buy it, and the amount offered was 17 million Egyptian pounds. I cancelled this auction and did not accept the price because, in my opinion, the price was not high enough. Then I authorized a bank to sell this land. The bank then negotiated with the company which came to the auction, and the result was that the price of the land rose to 22 million instead of 17 million Egyptian pounds, with the company asking for some easy terms dealing with the payment period. However, I even rejected this offer, and I finally sold the plot of land for 24 million Egyptian pounds. Nevertheless, all I hear is blame that is being cast on us now because this activity is not within our domain. Let it be known to everyone that it really is not my job to do buying or selling. But sometimes I occupy myself with such a matter in order to solve a national problem that could affect the nation's higher interest, especially since millions of Egyptian families were victims of these companies. After all, should the attorney general remain silent and just look on as a big problem occurs that we might not be able to solve later on--particularly since we fear that there are some individuals or parties who have an interest in seeing the problem continue to exist, without a solution? I say that I fear this, but I am not accusing anyone in particular. [Al-Husayni] Who are these parties that have an interest in seeing the problem of the investment companies remain unsolved? [Al-'Arabi] I am not accusing anybody in particular. But, as I mentioned, I am afraid that there are those who have an interest in having this problem remain in existence and not be solved. Convicted Investor Makes Business Contacts [Al-Husayni] The fact that Ahmad Tawfiq al-Rayyan left prison to administer the capital of the investors has made many people inquire, with astonishment, whether or not a person who has been sentenced to hard labor because he was not trustworthy concerning investors' money and rights should be allowed to administer this capital once again? [Al-'Arabi] Ahmad Tawfiq [al-Rayyan] did not leave prison in order to administer the capital of the al-Rayyan Company. What happened is that the Office of Confiscation [idarat al-tahaffudh] occasionally requests that he be let out of jail in order to make contacts to get buyers for the company's assets. Ahmad al-Rayyan does not administer the capital, because he does not have the right to do so after being sentenced to hard labor. This makes it illegal for him to undertake any administration or disposal [of such capital]. A "caretaker" has been appointed for him. In addition to this, Ahmad al-Rayyan, after being sentenced, authorized me, as the attorney general, to sell the company's assets. For this reason, when we bring him to the Office of Confiscation, we do this because this man has numerous contacts with many people who could buy the company's assets. I utilize him, but I do not let him administer the capital. I, in turn, should be asking: How could a man who is in prison and has been sentenced to hard labor be allowed to administer capital such as this? This is impossible, but we are still being hounded by these rumors. [Al-Husayni] Concerning the administration of the investment companies' capital, there are those who are wondering whether or not the Office of the Attorney General has people who are qualified financially and business-wise to administer capital totalling more than 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds. [Al-'Arabi] As for administration of the capital of the investment companies, the Office of the Attorney General does not intervene in the manner that is imagined. However, we entrust this work to people who did this administrative work before--in exchange for the payment of certain fees. What we do is supervise this work. This supervision is done by means of an accounts monitoring agency that audits all of the transactions undertaken by those undertaking the administration so that no fraud takes place. So, as far as the office is concerned, the administration [of these companies] is not considered to be a problem. The work is done under the supervision of the Capital Attachment Office, and experts are sent to audit the transactions of the administrators who supervise the administration in order to see if there are any irregularities. If any irregularities are found, we call to account the person who is at fault, and this is not something that is difficult to do. In fact, we did succeed in paying back the capital to all of the investors in some of the small investment companies when their owner requested that the office settle his situation. Overlapping Spheres of Activity [Al-Husayni] The Office of the State Prosecutor General is also working on the administration of millions [of Egyptian pounds] of capital deposited by investors in the investment companies. Is this not considered to be duplication and overlapping in spheres of activity, especially since it is a known fact that the Office of the State Prosecutor deals with economic issues? [Al-'Arabi] This is no duplication or overlapping in the spheres of activity, and each office is preceding along its path in accordance with the system that it is governed by. [Al-Husayni] Do you mean that there is coordination between the Office of the State Prosecutor and the Office of the Attorney General, in the sense that each of them deals with particular types of cases, in accordance with the system of operation in each of the offices? [Al-'Arabi] No, there are no specializations involved. But each office does its work in accordance with the complaints that it receives. Furthermore, if the complaints involve the occurrence of a crime, then they become the sphere of activity of the Office of the Attorney General. [Al-Husayni] The investment company cases, in general, involve crimes such as swindling, committing fraud in order to gain control of the capital of investors, and refusal to make payments. [Al-'Arabi] The establishment of capital investment companies, in general, is something that is governed by law, and any violation of this law constitutes a definite crime, and this falls within the sphere of authority of the attorney general. For this reason, most of the investment company cases come to our office. However, what has happened is that some of those who deposited capital in the investment companies took their complaints to the Office of the State Prosecutor General either before coming to the Office of the Attorney General or before our office could take measures. The Office of the State Prosecutor has been faster when it comes to taking measures dealing with attachment. In order that the owner of a company not be subjected to attachment in two different agencies, the Office of the Attorney General is starting to follow the path of dealing with criminal cases and lawsuits, and is allowing the state prosecutor to take the other steps and measures, as long as the perpetrator of the criminal act has been subjected to attachment by the Office of the State Prosecutor. [Al-Husayni] What is your response to those who say that it would be more correct and appropriate to entrust the administration of the investment companies to banks since they have expertise in dealing with financial and business transactions? [Al-'Arabi] The answer is simple. The Office of the Attorney General right now does not undertake the administration of the capital of the investment companies. However, our office does undertake the liquidation of the assets of these companies and hands over the earnings from the liquidation to the investors, the owners of this capital. We basically do not resort to relying on the administrative method. The reason for this is that, if we had decided to repay the investors by means of administering the capital of these companies, these investors would have to wait 20 or 30 years before receiving the full amount of their repayments. This is why we resorted to the method of immediate liquidation of these companies by means of selling them off, in order that the investors be repaid faster. Also, banks do not purchase the assets of these companies, but it is possible for them to finance buyers. This has actually happened in the case of some banks. Investors' Troubles Will End in 1994 [Al-Husayni] The problem of the investors and the investment companies has been in your office since 1988, that is, for six years, but the victims of these companies still have not been payed what they are owed, and this is in spite of the fact that statements are continually being made to the effect that a solution to the problem is near at hand. This has caused the investors to become desperate and frustrated. [Al-'Arabi] Our office has had the problem of the investment companies since 1988. But I only took up the problem in 1991, when I was appointed attorney general. Therefore I am not responsible for the preceding period. Also, I am only responsible for statements that I myself make. Concerning the al-Rayyan case, I have fulfilled my promise to the investors and they have actually received 10 percent of their capital back. And now we have enough money to pay them another 10 percent. Right now we are undertaking an urgent study, which will be finished this week. There are businessmen and plant owners who are prepared to offer goods and products to the investors. Thus, instead of receiving 10 percent in the form of cash, it would be possible for them to receive goods worth 20 or 30 percent of what they are owed. [Al-Husayni] Are these goods produced by the al-Rayyan and al-Sharif companies, as was previously the case? [Al-'Arabi] No. These goods are produced by Egyptian plants in general. [Al-Husayni] Will the owners of these plants furnish these goods and products in return for their purchase of the assets of the investment companies? [Al-'Arabi] No. The owners of these plants will provide these goods immediately. Then they will give us a chance to sell the assets of the companies and pay them what we owe them after that. An agreement actually has been reached with them. This will enable us to achieve more than one goal. First of all, it will stimulate Egyptian industry, and secondly, the investors will be paid back what is owed to them at greater rates than would be possible if we paid them only with the money that we have available right now. [Al-Husayni] People have been very patient, but they are wondering when the problem of the investors and the capital investment companies will be solved once and for all? [Al-'Arabi] If the rate of sales continues at its present pace, I am hoping that the troubles of the investors will end in 1994. I am trying extremely hard to have the problem of the capital investment companies be solved by the end of this year. If some loose ends concerning this problem remain, they will be very simple matters and will be beyond my control. I should remark that this matter is one that requires a great deal of effort. For example, if the al-Rayyan investors are paid back 10 percent of what they are owed, this means that we have to pay them more than 150 million Egyptian pounds. The same situation applies to the al-Sharif investors. So let the investors be lenient with me and give me a chance to be able to finish this task as it should be done and as I hope to do it. [Al-Husayni] What about the investors with the al-Sa'd Company? Will their troubles also come to an end, and will they get paid back in 1994? [Al-'Arabi] The al-Sa'd case is being taken up by the Office of the Attorney General as a criminal case. But the capital of the al-Sa'd Company has been attached by the Office of the State Prosecutor General. Therefore you should ask the state prosecutor general about what is owed to the al-Sa'd investors. Emergency Law Powers [Issue No. 2: In its interview with the attorney general, AKHIR SA'AH then took up the matter of the Emergency Law, which has been put into effect for an additional three years.] [Al-Husayni] The renewal of the Emergency Law for three more years has led us to wonder what the effect of this law has been on the work and investigations conducted by the Office of the Attorney General. We are wondering, in particular, whether or not it is true--as some members of the opposition have been saying--that it is difficult for accused persons to receive complete justice when this law is being applied. [Al-'Arabi] The Emergency Law is like any other law. It does not affect the rules of conducting investigations according to which we proceed. There is no dispute about the fact that the Office of the Attorney General does its job, whether according to the Emergency Law, the Criminal Procedure Law, or any other law. In our agency, work is being conducted according to one system and one set of guarantees. [Al-Husayni] However, it is being said that the Emergency Law gives the Office of the Attorney General additional powers that might diminish the rights of citizens when they are subject to investigations. [Al-'Arabi] All of the guarantees provided to accused persons by the Criminal Procedure Law apply to them completely under the Emergency Law. Perhaps what is meant by this talk is the fact that the Emergency Law grants to the Office of the Attorney General the authority to use pre-trial detention in connection with crimes subject to this law. An example of this is the powers of the investigative judge. This is not considered to be an additional prerogative of the Office of the Attorney General. Many laws already give our office this authority. The most recent is Law No. 105 dealing with the establishment of State Security Courts which gives the Office of the Attorney General, in connection with crimes such as bribery and embezzlement as well as crimes which violate the internal and external security of the state, the powers of an investigative judge when investigating crimes such as these, and they include pre-trial detention. Thus the Emergency Law does not at all affect the work done by the Office of the Attorney General. Perhaps the effect of this law is to be found in the name of the type of trial in accordance with which the accused is tried, as well as the procedure of certification of judgments which differs from that of appeals against judgments. This is a matter which does not affect or directly apply to the work done by the Office of the Attorney General. [Al-Husayni] Since we are talking about pre-trial detention, [I should mention that] it is a known fact that pre-trial detention of the accused before conviction is a matter which infringes upon his freedom. It is supposed to be used only to a very limited extent, such as if one fears that the accused will flee or if the accused has no known address. However, it should be remarked that the Office of the Attorney General has started utilizing this authority in a way which transforms it into a type of penal authority. [Al-'Arabi] That does not happen at all. Pre-trial detention is a preventive measure done in order to guarantee that justice be carried out. It generally is done when one fears that the accused will obtain access to witnesses, will influence them, or will tamper with the evidence of a case. Pre-trial detention is not a punishment, as you have said it is. The Office of the Attorney General does not inflict any punishment on any individual. However, in big cases such as cases of terrorism, it is possible that the accused persons will have known addresses, but should one release them? The same applies to bribery and embezzlement cases. Should we release the accused persons so that they would tamper with the evidence of the case or gain access to the witnesses before they come to trial? In cases such as these, the accused is detained before trial, and when the investigation is over, he is either charged with the crime and brought to trial as a prisoner or he is released. But as for what is being said about the Office of the Attorney General expanding its use of pre-trial detention, this has not happened--unless you have already done a statistical survey [and found this to be true]. Even if this has happened, we could undertake a statistical survey which would show that the number of crimes has increased. Consequently, there has not been any expansion in the use of this right on the part of the Office of the Attorney General. [Issue No. 3: The interview then switched over to the issue dealing with journalists.] [Al-Husayni] Permit me at this point to speak as a journalist and a member of the Journalists' Union. We have come to feel a sense of alarm concerning the steps being taken against journalists when they are being investigated in cases dealing with the publication of news. These steps conflict with the guarantees provided to them by the Union Law, the Press Authority Law, and other laws. [Al-'Arabi] First of all, there is no problem between the attorney general's apparatus and the journalists. Secondly, what are the reasons for the alarm and the fear? When has the Office of the Attorney General ever dealt with a journalist in a way that violates his freedom or conflicts with the Press Authority Law? [Al-Husayni] This actually did happen with some of my colleagues who were being investigated recently in connection with cases concerning the publication of news. They were arrested, detained, and then released on bail in a manner that violates the text of the Press Authority Law in Article No. 135 of the Criminal Procedure Law. [Al-'Arabi] It is very unfortunate that the newspapers are publishing and circulating talk like this that has no basis in fact. I mentioned this in a response to the head of the Journalists' Union. Also, we should differentiate between the measures taken by the Office of the Attorney General and those taken by others. The question is: Has the Office of the Attorney General ever ordered the arrest of a journalist? This has never happened. Has the Office of the Attorney General ever put a journalist in jail for the purpose of pre- trial detention? This has never happened. [Al-Husayni] Who are these others, and do they have the authority to commit these deeds that are in violation of the law? [Al-'Arabi] Don't ask me about others, for the simple reason that I do not know the facts concerning the problem. Any journalist who says that there is a problem between him and the Office of the Attorney General, and does not submit a written complaint so that I can take investigative measures such as I do with any case, is indisputably mistaken. Often citizens come to me with complaints about the behavior of members of the Office of the Attorney General. These complaints are submitted in writing, and then the Judicial Inspection Agency begins looking into them. And if a mistake has been committed, the person who made the mistake is immediately called to account. But as far as journalists are concerned, so far I have not received a single complaint. The problem has only been brought up on the pages of the newspapers. I am not responsible for dealing with what has been brought up on the pages of newspapers. We always say that any citizen who has a complaint against a member of the Office of the Attorney General, a member of the judicial authority, or anyone else has to submit the complaint to us in order that we conduct the investigation concerning it so that we can verify the truth and seriousness of the complaint. I often receive complaints in which citizens complain against each other. It is more appropriate for me to receive complaints against the agency that works with me. But, in this case, a matter is being brought up in the newspapers or at Journalists' Union meetings in order to have me make decisions based on only one point of view--that of the journalists. Have you even listened to the other point of view? [Al-Husayni] What is the other point of view it would be possible for us to listen to now? [Al-'Arabi] I am not the person with an opinion concerning the case you are talking about. I am an investigative party. For this reason, the journalist who is the aggrieved party should have submitted a complaint in order that it be investigated. Then we would have announced which party was in the wrong--whether it was the journalist, the prosecuting attorney, or the advocate general. I have received a letter from the Journalists' Union, which made its demands as a result of what happened. But I ask--on what basis does the Journalists' Union reach this verdict? Would it not be sounder if the journalist who is the aggrieved party were to submit a complaint in order that it be investigated? When one of the members of the Office of the Attorney General is found guilty, then we will determine the claims. [Al-Husayni] As the person responsible for the Office of the Attorney General, [do you know whether or not] there is a dispute concerning providing the guarantees that are guaranteed by the Journalists' Law? [Al-'Arabi] Do the Press Authority and the Press Law forbid questioning and investigating a journalist if we have received a particular complaint [about him]? What happens is, whenever someone submits a complaint to us about a particular person or party, the law determines for us the bases on which we may investigate these complaints. I deny that anyone in the Office of the Attorney General has violated the guarantees provided for in the law in the case of any person in our society, whether a journalist or not. If any journalist, in his opinion, feels that an investigator has resorted to procedures outside the law in his investigation with him, then he must submit a complaint to us in order that we investigate it. When such a journalist does not receive what he feels is owed to him, then the attacks in the newspapers begin. Casting suspicion on the Office of the Attorney General, which is a fundamental branch of the judiciary, is not in anyone's interest, especially if the other point of view is not listened to. This is why I was hoping that someone would contact us or submit a written complaint concerning what occurred to him that was outside the law, so that we could then investigate the matter. It is being said that we did not notify the Journalists' Union before an investigation. First of all, the law has not determined the manner in which we are supposed to notify the Journalists' Union. When a representative from the union is present with the journalist during the investigation, does this not constitute notification of the union? What was said would be true if the investigation had been carried out without the presence of a representative. And if the journalist were present without a representative from the union, the prosecuting attorney would not be able to ask him any questions. A journalist has the right to tell the prosecuting attorney that he will not talk to him unless a representative from the union is present. [Al-Husayni] Did you conduct an investigation into complaints by journalists? [Al-'Arabi] Certainly I asked questions and investigated, but I will not talk about the results of this investigation, because so far I have not received a [written] complaint from anyone. The Law and Economic Crimes [Al-Husayni] Issue No. 4: Let us now switch over to another issue, which is that of the spread of economic crimes recently to a degree which threatens the processes of development and national security in Egypt. In your personal estimation, and by virtue of your position as attorney general, do you feel that crimes of this type have increased to the point that they require the issuance of new laws and new legislation to decisively deal with them? [Al-'Arabi] I don't believe that we need more laws. The laws that we have on the books are enough. But we do need more decisiveness and experience when dealing with cases of this type. So in spite of the fact that we abolished the prosecuting offices that specialized in some types of crimes, we have not changed anything as far as the economic crimes are concerned. Thus we have the Public Property Prosecution Office, the Financial and Administrative Affairs Prosecution Office, and the Tax Prosecution Office. All of these prosecution offices specialize in economic crimes. In addition to this, we are constantly endeavoring to provide support for these prosecution offices by means of providing new expertise and specializations and holding high-level training courses for men from the Attorney General's Office at the National Criminal Investigation Center as support for our practical training. [Al-Husayni] What is your opinion concerning the proposal made by some specialists concerning issuing new legislation to regulate the use of checks? [Al-'Arabi] My opinion is that, as far as the current economic situation and those persons dealing in the financial market are concerned, if we put controls on the use of checks that would be stricter than they are now, this would have some negative consequences. For example, it is possible that trade and commerce would suffer some degree of stagnation. Also, this might cause some difficulties for employees who purchase their basic necessities on the installment plan. Why not leave things as they are until economic conditions improve? If we slap restrictions on checks, we will find merchants then becoming afraid to deal with checks. For this reason, I feel that we should wait a while so that we do not affect the situation that currently exists between buyers and sellers. Terrorism Issues [Al-Husayni] Issue No. 5: Egypt has experienced many waves of terrorism during the last 40 years, and [most of the time] such terrorism has been dealt with and ended in the space of just a few months, as was the case with the Muslim Brotherhood in 1948, 1965, and 1970. What are the reasons for the continuation of the current wave of terrorism that began in 1990? Is it because of the expertise the terrorists have acquired as a result of their previous experience, or is it because they are taking advantage of the climate of freedom and democracy which prevails in Egypt nowadays? [Al-'Arabi] No one can say that a climate of freedom and democracy can be exploited for the purposes of terrorist operations. But the fact is that the problem of terrorism in Egypt is a problem with many ramifications, and no individual can express his opinion on it without being versed in all the aspects of the problem. For this reason, allow me to apologize for not answering this question, even though I have been living with this problem for a long time. A discussion of this problem requires specialists in numerous fields. What I mean is that I am able to talk about the problem only from the point of view of the judiciary. [Al-Husayni] But what we want is your opinion as a member of the judiciary. [Al-'Arabi] I cannot answer this question merely from the point of view of the judiciary. The reason is that it would be a fragmentary and incomplete answer. This problem has to be discussed on all levels--the social, economic, human, and psychological levels. Regarding the reasons for the continuation of the wave of terrorism for such a long time, I believe that these terrorists have, without a doubt, acquired experience from the former terrorist movements. Also, these terrorist groups have individuals abroad working for them, and the hand of justice has not been able to get to them. This is also one of the reasons why they are continuing their terrorism. [Al-Husayni] Concerning the decision by the president to refer cases of terrorism to the military justice system because it decides cases quickly, why is the Military Prosecution Office not handling the investigation of these cases instead of the Office of the Attorney General? [Al-'Arabi] When the president issues a decree to refer a particular case to the military justice system, the Office of the Attorney General forgoes the completion of its procedure and the case is referred to the military justice system, that is, the investigation is conducted by the Military Prosecution Office and then the case is tried by the military justice system. Also, not all terrorism cases are referred to the military justice system. The president feels that there are terrorism cases that do not need to be referred to the military justice system because they are not so important. So not all cases of terrorism are referred to the military courts. But this does happen with major cases that could involve bad consequences for the nation, such as the cases involving shooting tourists. This is a matter that requires quick steps and a quick deterrent. For this reason, there are terrorism cases that are investigated by the Office of the Attorney General and then referred to the regular courts. Attorney General's Office and the Inspection Control [Al-Husayni] Issue No. 6: There are cases that have stirred up public opinion and received a great deal of attention in the media when investigations concerning them were being conducted, but then these cases ended with no convictions being made. They include the cases of Lucy Artin and al-Mahjub. Did this happen because of mistakes made during the process of arrest or investigation, or were there other reasons for this? [Al-'Arabi] All the fuss raised concerning certain cases, as I have said, is the work of the media. I am not responsible for that. The attorney general's apparatus conducts its investigations and then assesses what has been done. That is, it decides whether or not the case should be sent to court and whether or not there is enough evidence for a conviction. But unfortunately, when an incident happens, the media quickly jumps in and utilizes it as a story to be published, with a lot of hype, even though they do not know what has been going on in the investigations. Furthermore, as I always say, a judge looks at a case in a way that is different from the point of view of a person who is far away from the judge's podium. In fact, it is possible for one judge's view to be different from another's. Criminal justice is based on the judge being convinced of the facts of a case. If the judge is convinced that a person is guilty, then that person is convicted, but if the judge is not convinced that he is guilty, then he is acquitted--and there is no argument about the matter. The judge's view of the matter is more all-inclusive and broader because he makes judgments concerning a situation on the basis of the intuition and conscience of a judge. In addition to this, he takes into consideration the results of the investigation that he undertakes in the court session. [Al-Husayni] It is also a known fact that the Office of the Attorney General has the authority of inspection. But the practice has been to authorize police officers, in their capacity as persons commissioned by the judiciary authorities, to undertake this work. For this reason, we often see criminals being acquitted, especially in narcotics cases, because the inspection procedure was carried out in a way that violates the law, both in form as well as in content. Why do members of the Office of the Attorney General not exercise the power of inspection themselves so that things are carried out in a sound manner? [Al-'Arabi] Fundamentally, the members of the Office of the Attorney General carry out the investigation procedure as a whole, and not merely the inspection, because the inspection is just one of the procedures of the investigation. But the law entitles a member of the Office of the Attorney General to authorize any policeman commissioned by the authority of the judiciary to conduct this procedure in his place. The members of the Office of the Attorney General actually conduct the inspections in important cases, particularly since we do not have enough men in the Office of the Attorney General to conduct the inspections in all the cases. Furthermore, in cases involving narcotics or theft, if a member of the Office of the Attorney General goes out to conduct an inspection, he may end up endangering his life. This is particularly true because members of the Office of the Attorney General are not allowed to carry weapons--so that accused persons cannot claim that they used a weapon against them. So if members of the Office of the Attorney General go out and hunt down drug smugglers and armed criminals, they are endangering their lives. But the matter is different in the case of a policeman, because he carries a weapon and works within the framework of an integrated plan to pursue individuals who are in violation of the law. It might happen that the procedure undertaken by a policeman commissioned by the authority of the judiciary is unsound and thus results in an acquittal, as you mentioned. But such persons who are commissioned by the authority of the judiciary, and who are police officers, have studied the law and are perfectly aware of what sound arrest procedures are. So such acquittals do not happen merely because a member of the Office of the Attorney General has authorized a police officer to undertake an inspection. If this does happen, it is because the officer did not follow the procedures stipulated by the law.
