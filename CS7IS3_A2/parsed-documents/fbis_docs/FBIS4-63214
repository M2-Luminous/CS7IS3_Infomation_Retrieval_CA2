This was stated today by Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin upon completion of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. Vitaliy Churkin said Alain Juppe assured Viktor Chernomyrdin of France's readiness in the near future to join Russia in resolving the question of the trade in products of the nuclear cycle. The special position adopted by France in this area has so far held back the talks on concluding a cooperation agreement between Russia and the EC. Russia and France are, of course, major producers of fuel for nuclear power stations and compete in European markets. A number of questions relating to bilateral trade-economic cooperation were also discussed at the talks. Alain Juppe handed Viktor Chernomyrdin an invitation from French Prime Minister Eduard Balladur to visit France in the second half of this year. The invitation was accepted.
