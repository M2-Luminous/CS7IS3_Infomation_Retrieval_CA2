The deputies were addressed by Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president and the president of the HDZ. The session was attended by members of the ruling party's presidency. Here is the full text of the statement: In his speech, President Tudjman briefly restated the guidelines of Croatia's foreign policy, in particular in relation to Bosnia-Herzegovina. He stressed that Croatia achieved its present standing in the world -- which has never been higher -- because the world could see for itself the stability of Croatia's democratic system, to which the HDZ has made the largest contribution, and could also see that Croatia's leadership knew how to coordinate its national and state interests with international interests, and that such a Croatia could be an important and active factor in the creation of the international order in this part of Europe. As regards the policy relating to Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Washington agreement, the president stressed that there had been no U-turns in Croatia's policy, but the policy had consistently taken into consideration interests of the Croat people as a whole and strategic interests of the Croatian state. It is precisely because of this consistent position that the world has accepted Croatia's policy. The president also said that the reputation and the position that Croatia has acquired in today's world ought to be used for the speedier development of our country in political, economic and cultural spheres. The case of Josip Manolic was also discussed at the session. Unanimous support was expressed for the policy pursued hitherto by the HDZ under the leadership of President Franjo Tudjman. In the light of the conclusions adopted at the second HDZ general convention, it was emphasized that the HDZ is a democratic party of the people, which bases its program on the principles of Christian democracy.
