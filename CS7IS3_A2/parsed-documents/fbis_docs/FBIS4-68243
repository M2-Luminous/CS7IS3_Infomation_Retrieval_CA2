Experts agree that the development lays a good foundation for a settlement of the protracted conflict. However, all this has happened in the past, and more than once. Where haven't agreements been signed--in Moscow, Geneva, Sochi. Eduard Shevardnadze and Vladislav Ardzinba have gone to not only the Russian capital but also New York in search of truth. (Needless to say, each for his own version). Until they realized that they need not necessary look for the road to domestic peace in some distant land. But this was pointed out even earlier at the CIS countries' interparliamentary assembly by Georgian parliamentary speaker Vakhtang Goguadze. He was one of the first to say that a solution to the Abkhaz problem hardly required a trip to America, that it should be solved within the CIS framework. And so an understanding has been reached. There remains to hope that the parties to the conflict will move from declarations of accord to its implementation--against the backdrop, needless to say, of active mediation efforts by Russia and other CIS countries and United Nations assistance in the search for a peaceful solution.
