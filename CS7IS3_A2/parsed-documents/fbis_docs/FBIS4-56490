GRANMA highlights Nelson Mandela's words during his visit to Cuba: We are determined to have the people of South Africa forge their own future. When that moment comes, it will not have been solely through our own efforts, but also thanks to the solidarity, support, and encouragement of the extraordinary people of Cuba. The editorial goes on to point out that the Cuito Canavale victory overturned the balance of power in South Africa, which resulted in consolidation, through the ballot, of the efforts cemented for years with blood.
