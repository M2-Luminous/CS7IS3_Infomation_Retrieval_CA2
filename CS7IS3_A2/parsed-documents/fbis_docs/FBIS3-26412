When President Clinton submitted the federal budget plan for fiscal 1995 to Congress today, the cuts in many of its spending programs will be the sharpest ever. The 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars plan "is to prioritize programs, decide what we don't need and focus investments in the areas we think are important for the country," said Budget Director Leon Panetta. In the plan, the Clinton administration proposed to cut spending from more than 300 federal programs, eliminate 115 minor programs to save 3.25 billion dollars, and cut federal workforce by over 100,000. The budget gave seven of the 14 cabinet departments less money to spend while investing more on high-tech, job creation, children education, worker training, crime fighting and protection of environment. Inputs in areas like technology, for example, will be up about 40 percent, spending for primary schools will be slightly more. Some 2.7 billion dollars with regards to fighting crime are also added. Congress republicans complained that there were only some minor changes in the new budget as compared with that of Former President George Bush. "But I still think it had teeth in it," said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole. "I think republicans ought to help the President in eliminating some of these programs," Dole said on Sunday [6 February], although he, like other republican lawmakers, foresaw that some massaging will take place. Observers predicted a lot of fire around the budget, which did not include, for example, the full effects of Clinton's two major proposals: welfare and health care reform, making it an incomplete presentation of all added costs. "Both health care and welfare reform have profound budgetary and economic consequences," said Representative Alex Mcmillan, a republican from North Carolina, who called the missing "especially distressing." The budget included tax increases on tobacco and business, and proposed cuts in Medicaid and Medicare, instead of the costs of some new entitlements and subsidies, observers noted. "The budget is remarkable for what it's missing," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said. He said he was worried that the elimination of some programs might affect the low-income Americans. The budget is controversial in three major cuts: urban mass transit subsidies, community development grants like public housing for the elderly, and subsidies for the poor to heat their homes, the last of which was protested in a letter signed by 51 senators. The three have become "non-negotiable items," said Kweisi Mfume, a democratic representative from Maryland. He stressed that "there are other things to look at" when cuts are considered and compromises are made. Explained Budget Director Leon Panetta, "We are pumping money on one end, and its not coming out the other end in terms of constructing public housing." According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit will dip to 171 billion dollars this year and 166 billion dollars in the next fiscal year, but it will rise to over 300 by the year 2004. "If we were not doing what we're doing, (the deficit) will be much higher," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Sunday. Despite the efforts in deficit reduction, the total federal spending will continue to rise over the past five years by about 23 percent, according to the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office.
