Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata and Brown had a brief talk while they were here for a meeting of economic, industry and trade ministers from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized states and 10 former East Bloc nations. Brown expressed a wish to reach a common understanding with Japan on the three points raised by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech last month -- that Japan take steps on both the macroeconomic and sectoral levels and set "objective criteria" to reduce its trade surplus, Japanese officials said. Such an understanding is a prerequisite to the resumption of talks with Japan on a new bilateral trade framework, the U.S. secretary said, according to the officials. Hata replied that he understands the importance of the three points and Japan wishes to see the issue settled in a way that would not lead to "managed trade," the officials said. The Japanese minister indicated that efforts will be made to resume the trade framework talks ahead of an upcoming summit meeting of the G-7 countries in Naples, Italy, in July. In a separate meeting with Russian Deputy Premier Aleksandr Shokhin the same day, Hata said Japan will continue support for Russia in its efforts for reform.
