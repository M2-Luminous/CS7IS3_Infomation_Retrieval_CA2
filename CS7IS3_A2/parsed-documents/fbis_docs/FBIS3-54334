The foreign minister voiced special interest in what is taking place in Ethiopia and Kenya, where a considerable number of Israeli irrigation and dam experts are working. He proposed that Egypt provide the two countries with Egyptian experts. Musa told the ministers that, despite peace and reconciliation between Egypt and Israel, it is not in the basin countries' interest to permit external parties to tamper with the Nile waters. He explained that under no circumstances would Egypt tolerate any harm to its water resources because this is "a life or death issue" for Egypt. Therefore, he added, it is better for experts from Egyptian and the other Nile basin countries to cooperate to implement projects in these countries, as such a cooperation will ensure the interests of the countries in which projects are implemented, as well as those of Egypt in which the Nile river ends. Employing Israeli or European experts, he said, may open the door for foreign interests to play a destructive role in the water issue. The Egyptian foreign minister pointed out that his country had informed all parties involved, including Israel and the big powers, that the Nile waters issue is not a subject of any Middle East multilateral negotiations or any Middle East cooperation in the water area and that it concerns no one except the basin countries themselves. In another development, Egyptian Irrigation Minister Engineer 'Abd-al-Hadi Radi told AL-ITTIHAD that alleged reports from Khartoum, or other capitals, on Sudan requesting new negotiations on sharing the Nile water by Egypt and Sudan are absolutely unfounded.
