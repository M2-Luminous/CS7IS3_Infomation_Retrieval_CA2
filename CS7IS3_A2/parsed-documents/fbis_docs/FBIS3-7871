Reception is fair. Describing the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says that "the town is still in shock after yesterday's massacre of civilians. A direct howitzer shot hit an ambulance killing four civilians and mutilating 11, three of whom were children." He says that "this was not enough for [Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko] Mladic's butchers, and the shelling of the center of Maglaj continued well into the night. Hundreds of howitzer shells and mortars landed on the town. One person was killed in the shelling." Sermic says that "the fierce shelling of Maglaj continues today. Early this morning the aggressor launched a powerful infantry attack on the southeastern part of the front, in the (Siprage)-(Strajista)-Lijesnica direction. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters repulsed this attack, but the aggressor has now launched a new attack, which is under way at the moment." In his report from Brcko, Hamid Deronjic says that "another enemy tank has been destroyed on this front. The heavy concentration and increased movement of the enemy armored and mechanized vehicles, registered yesterday, enabled our fighters to score a few points. The artillery of the 108th Motorized Brcko Brigade again excelled, as yesterday afternoon at 1630 it fired a precise shot and completely destroyed a T-34 chetnik tank together with its crew. So yet another in the whole series of Serb tanks on the Brcko front has been turned into a heap of useless iron. During the night the aggressor fiercely shelled the defense lines and civilian targets on the free territory." Deronjic says that "there have been further clashes among various groups of the Serb aggressor's army on the Brcko front. Last night on the Cadjavac-Sumari direction the chetniks exchanged mortar and small arms fire." Reporting from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "Bihac and Cazin suffered further destruction overnight. Insane, bloody, bestial -- is there a word to describe the onslaught by chetnik multiple rocket launchers, howitzers, tanks, and Vis? Thousands of shells were fired overnight at [word indistinct], (Gornji Troholj), [words indistinct], and (Srdjani). The industrial zone of Bihac has been under the fiercest attack overnight and this morning." He says that "the chetniks attempted further breakthroughs but in vain as the heroes, the defenders, present an impenetrable wall. Milosevic and Karadzic must finally understand this." Amila Salihbasic reports from Olovo that "the [Serb] enemy attacks continued last night. The largest part of the artillery that was withdrawn from around Sarajevo is now in use in the chetnik positions around Olovo." She says that "the first day of March has been marked by several mortar explosions, while enemy infantry has intensified small arms fire at the defense lines." Sead Custovic reports from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps that "the population of the (Vrezani) area were woken up this morning by powerful explosions of chetnik heavy artillery shells. Early this morning the aggressor from (Sovrsko Brdo) fired dozens of shells from an ESP [not further specified], and 120-mm and 82-mm mortars at the region of Vrbovik. Soon the chetnik artillery in Podlugovi was activated, and a hill gun shelled (Podzupce). It must be stressed that certain positions from which shells are being fired are within the 20-kilometer zone around Sarajevo, from where the artillery pieces should have been moved long ago."
