Western politicians are much more circumspect on the subject. Recently, the European Commission's delegate to Prague, Gerard Sabathil, presented his views on the question of the admission of countries from our region of Europe into the Community: Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should indeed join the European Union, but only after they have moved at least halfway toward the levels of economic development standard throughout its countries. Mr. Sabathil must surely be aware of the unrealistic quality of his suggestion. In the West, GDP figures are at least dozens of times higher than in Poland. Our GDP amounts to 4.7 percent of Belgian GNP and 6.1 percent of the German GDP. These proportions could change even further to our detriment, considering that, since 1989, our GNP has already fallen by about 12 percent. Gerhard Sabathil's words gave rise to a storm of protests. Wolfgang Roth, SPD deputy and vice president of the European Investment Bank, accused Sabathil of creating an atmosphere conducive to another war in Europe. In his opinion, West Europe must accept the necessity of making efforts to "propel" the weaker economies of East European countries in order to prevent a political disaster. "The European Union cannot become some kind of exclusive `Prosperity Club' for countries that have inherited Charlemagne's legacy," Roth insists. The view that the speedy integration of East Europe into the European Union is a necessity remains an empty declaration. Reality paints a completely different picture. There are few honest intentions underlying the facade of fine words. The European Commission has rolled out the heavy artillery of its protectionist policies, which have been hitting our exports with all their might. The West applies the weapons of antidumping prices and predetermined limited import quotas. Steel producers have fought the hardest campaign against goods exported by the East. It is true that the European Union has promised a gradual lowering of tariffs on these products, yet it did not hesitate to introduce antidumping prices against the Czechs, who, in the opinion of Brussels politicians, were selling their products at below-production costs. So where is the alleged free market that has been praised to high heaven by the same politicians from Brussels? Not only steel is at issue. There is a large variety of goods on which import limits or customs tariffs are imposed: meat, soft fruit, grains, and so on. The West's resistance is not restricted to erecting economic barriers against us. Within the European Union itself, there are politicians hostile to the idea of accepting us into the Community. The French are terrified that East Europeans could reinforce Germany's powerful position. The weaker countries, such as Spain and Portugal, are afraid that East Europe's accession to the Union will weaken their own importance in the group. There is no need to go on at length about the disastrous effects of such policies. Our countries' share in the trading figures of West European markets is rapidly decreasing for all sectors of the economy. Only 1.3 percent of chemical products sold there come from East Europe; the corresponding figures are 2.7 percent of steel and steel products, and 2.3 percent of agricultural products. We on our part are determined to give as good as we get in our trading with the West, and so we also slap customs tariffs on imported products and set limits on the quotas on individual goods (such as, for instance, automobiles). It is not the purpose of this article just to describe the consequences of the protectionist policy. However, it must be said that it is first and foremost the customer who loses by it because he has no opportunity to choose freely the product that it would suit him most to buy. When imports are restricted, prices rise above the levels they would otherwise have reached. It is the customer who pays the difference. Moreover, the imposition of customs tariffs is harmful also to companies themselves because the weaker producers manage to survive in the market precisely thanks to tariffs. If these were eliminated, they could move their capital to more cost-effective sectors of the economy. There are many more consequences of the protectionist policy, and the harmful ones outnumber those that are beneficial. Apart from our low GDP, what other reasons influence the Brussels politicians' unwillingness to approve our accession to the European Union? In 1990, the average length of the Polish working week was 33.3 hours. In Germany, it was longer by six hours, while in Austria and Switzerland it was longer by eight hours. In addition to this, we must remember that, in the West, people work those longer hours with better machines and equipment. For the time being, at least, their managerial personnel are also superior to ours. Consequently, they achieve higher productivity figures. Furthermore, the structure of our economy also leaves a lot to be desired. In the West, the industry sector produces 25-35 percent of the GDP. In Poland, our industry turns out as much as 40.9 percent of the GDP. It is possible that this is the result of the strong predilection that our former rulers manifested for the fire-belching smokestacks of heavy industry. By contrast, they paid absolutely no attention to the services sector, which generates the highest proportion of the West's wealth. Our agriculture is in a state of complete collapse. Even though we turn out plenty of agricultural products, this is done at tremendous expense. Our farms are fragmented in the extreme. As many as 53.4 percent farms work between 1 and 4.9 hectares of land, a situation that is practically unknown in the West. The rural sector employs 27.8 percent of our working population in Poland, while the corresponding percentages in all countries between the Odra and the Atlantic are expressed in single figures. As we can see, here in Poland a whole massive army of agricultural workers cultivates a large number of small fields. Given such excessive fragmentation, it becomes not cost-effective to buy machines and fertilizers or to strive for higher productivity. Even though farmers keep agricultural production going, they are forced to do so at such a high price that they have hardly any money left in the form of decent profit. These are merely the basic reasons the European Union does not want us in its midst. As long as we fail to put our own economic house and backyard in order, we need not count on receiving from the West a positive assessment of the possibility of our admission. It will depend on nothing but our own work whether we catch up with the wealthier countries. And we had better believe that no one is going to help us with it. We are forced to rely on ourselves and ourselves alone.
