[passage omitted] In accordance to the general theme of the conference, dedicated to development and integration, the heads of state asserted the need to achieve economic growth without leaving the people's social needs to one side. In one of the few speeches that conformed to the time limit assigned to each leader, Spanish King Juan Carlos also advocated the need to strengthen social development and respect for human rights. [passage omitted] Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez called on his colleagues to admit with "courage" that the adjustment policies had not solved the unequal distribution of wealth or the unemployment problem. However, like several of his colleagues, such as Argentine Carlos Menem or Panamanian Guillermo Endara, the Spanish socialist mentioned with optimism the democratic and economic achievements made by the Ibero-American countries since the Salvador de Bahia (Brazil) conference a year ago. As had been done by Endara and Menem, Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and Ecuadoran Sixto Duran-Ballen highlighted the advances made by their respective administrations in the economic and political spheres. In addition, De Leon Carpio promised, despite the difficulties that have arisen, he would do everything possible to continue the peace negotiations with the guerrillas as scheduled and reach an agreement before the end of the year. The Guatemalan guerrillas comprise the last such organization still active in Central America. Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, the latter with much more vehemence and thoroughness, defended the countries' right to their institutional peculiarities. The Andean head of state, who was strongly criticized by his colleague two years ago when he took on extraordinary powers and suspended the parliament and the Supreme Court, said political systems cannot be called good or bad and must be graded based upon their results and without any foreign interference. Chilean Eduardo Frei and Paraguayan Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who, as with five other presidents elected recent months, attended an Ibero-American summit for the first time, called for the promotion of free commerce and integration, which the Andean leader leaned toward "open regionalism." The newest president was Salvadoran Armando Calderon Sol, who assumed the post less than two weeks ago. He, together with several of his Central American colleagues, defended the position that development should not be limited to the liberalization of commerce. Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua and Jose Maria Figueres of Costa Rica underscored the advances made by Central America in regard to integration, peace, and the consolidation of democracy. They also presented a regional model for a "feasible development" [desarrollo sostenible] based on social needs and respect for ecology. Several presidents, such as Caldera, mentioned Spain and Portugal and asked that they become spokesmen for Latin America in Europe. Uruguayan Luis Alberto Lacalle, however, noted the difference of interests between the Ibero-American countries and the summit's host, Cesar Gaviria, asked for a policy to attract investment to the region and expressed his hope that America will become a single commercial bloc.
