The St. Petersburg-based design bureau "Malakhit" which previously designed power plants for nuclear submarines has developed a new underground nuclear power plant which can generate 220 megawatt of electricity and work for 50 years. The generator will be assembled in an underground tunnel dug in the rock at a depth of 100 meters. The use of module-type generators and liquid-metal coolant make these power plants especially safe and convenient as they are secured against radioactive leaks and can produce as much electricity as needed.
