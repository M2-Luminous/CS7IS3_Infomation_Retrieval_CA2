Independent Deputy Nadezhda Verveyko of the Krasnodar territory suggested at a plenary meeting of the Duma on Friday that an item on the Russian president's oath be put on the agenda of the session. She asserted that for several months now the Russian president has been working without being sworn in. A minority of deputies of the State Duma voted for her proposal. Deputy from Russia's Choice group Anatoliy Yushchenko who spoke in the debate pointed out that Nadezhda Verveyko, a trained jurist, should know that under articles of the new Russian Constitution for the transitional period the president need not be sworn in a second time. Nevertheless Verveyko has insisted on the voting. It is surprising that despite the clarity of the matter she was still supported by 178 votes.
