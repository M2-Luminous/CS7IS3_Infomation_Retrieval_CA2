"THE INDEPENDENT" wrote Monday that the British Government had given "tacit support to an illegal scheme to supply Azerbaijan with military backing in its war with Armenia." The military backing, according to the newspaper, included both the supply of arms and "a large number of mercenaries." Moreover, "THE INDEPENDENT" wrote that the negotiating sides' representatives were based in Cyprus' Turkish-occupied areas "where it is not illegal to trade in arms to Azerbaijan." The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared independence in 1983. The illegal entity is recognised only by Turkey, which occupies 37 percent of the island's territory since 1974. The transactions were confirmed by Lord Erskine of Rerrick, 68, who, according to the daily, lives in these areas but is to return to the U.K. within a month. Lord Erskine confirmed to the daily that the negotiations had taken place between Azeri authorities and a consortium for which he is acting as consultant.
