FR940428-2-00133 FR940428-2-00063 [Release No. 34&hyph;33935; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Enhanced Parity Split for Specialists. April 20, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on February 28, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes a one-year pilot program to permit Phlx equity option specialists to receive an enhanced participation in parity trades based upon certain conditions and subject to a review procedure. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Phlx, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Phlx Rules 119 and 120, generally, and Phlx Rule 1014(g), specifically, direct members in the establishment of priority and parity of orders on the options floor. These rules provide that when bids/offers are made simultaneously, or when it is impossible to determine clearly the order of time in which they were made, all such bids/offers shall be on parity, and as such shall be shared equally. This equal sharing of parity trades among a specialist and Registered Options Traders (``ROTs'') has served the Exchange well in a market structure where certain options classes are listed exclusively on the Phlx. Because all newly listed options classes are subject to multiple listing and all currently listed ones are or will become so eligible, the current parity participation rule has come under review. The Exchange represents that while ROTs provide critical liquidity to the market making process at the Phlx, under the Phlx's specialist system, the role of the specialist is to provide leadership, liquidity, and continuity, and satisfy market making obligations in multiply listed options classes, particularly at the incipiency of competition for a multiply traded issue. For the options classes that will be eligible for multiple listing, the Exchange represents that specialists have also taken on a larger market making obligation in order to accommodate customers in the hope of garnering critical loyalty that will lead to sustained order flow whether the class is or is not ever actually multiply traded. Furthermore, the Exchange has identified the need to attract new specialist units and retain and encourage current specialists units to vigorously trade existing options classes as well as to aggressively seek and apply for newly allocated classes. The Phlx understands that many if not most specialist units, are seeking, or at least have the capability to seek, specialist privileges or the equivalent lead market making status for any particular multiply listed options class on any national securities exchange. Therefore, the Phlx is sensitive to the need to afford its specialist units parity split treatment at least comparable to the programs existing on other national securities exchanges which list options and compete for specialist capital and market making talent. Specifically, in order to address these factors, the Exchange has determined to implement this one-year pilot program to increase the specialist's participation in certain trades where the specialist is on parity with ROTs. As a point of clarification, the Exchange states that this proposed rule change will operate in tandem with another proposal submitted by the Exchange that is pending Commission approval. 1 The Exchange represents that the proposal contained in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;29 would provide a different variant of enhanced specialist parity participation applicable only to new specialist units in newly allocated equity options classes for a six-month period (subject to one six-month extension). If File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;29 is approved (in addition to the present filing), new specialists in new issues could opt for the enhanced parity split treatment proposed in this filing at the point in time that the enhanced treatment granted under File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;29 terminates. As long as a specialist is a ``New Unit'' (as defined in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;29), the specialist is not eligible for the enhanced parity split proposed herein for any new issue of options traded by that specialist. 2 1 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32891 (September 14, 1993), 58 FR 48921 (September 20, 1993) (Notice of filing of SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;29). 2 Telephone conversation between Michele Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, and Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Oversight, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, on April 18, 1994.
