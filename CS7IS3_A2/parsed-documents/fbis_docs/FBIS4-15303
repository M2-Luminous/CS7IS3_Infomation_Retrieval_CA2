As on previous days, the sides refrained from active military operations. Nevertheless, in spite of some pressure decrease, the Azeri units continue shelling the Armenian positions. According to the RMK Defense Army headquarters, in the evening of April 4 and April 5 night the enemy units, stationed at the villages of Akhmedbeyli, Kerimbeyli (Berinbeyli (?) "AZG") and Arayatli in the Fizulinskiy district, shelled the Karabakh guardpoints at the villages of Mirzajamali and Karakhanbeyli. No casualties are reported. During the night and in the morning of April 5 the Azeri soldiers in the villages of Bashkervend, Afatli and Chemenli in the Agdamskiy district shelled, using mortars and large caliber machine- guns, the Karabakh defense positions at the villages of Geoytepe, Maksudlu and Seyidli. Again, no casualties are reported. The Karabakh side refrained from retaliating. Later in the afternoon on April 5 the enemy troops, stationed in the northern section of the Mardakertskiy district, which is currently controlled by the Azeris, particularly from the villages of Hasangaya, Karmiravan and Seisulan (Heyzalagh "AZG"), shelled, using different kinds of weaponry, the villages of Matagis, Magavuz and Aghabekalend. No casualties are reported. According to the RMK military reconnaissance, active movements of the enemy manpower and military equipment is reported at several sections of the front. The specialists believe, these probably mean enemy's preparation to a new large-scale offensive. According to a representative of the RMK Defense Army Rudolf Martirosyan, the shells recently launched by the Azeris in the Agdamskiy district have mostly been made in 1990 in Turkey. This is not the first case when the Azeri troops used Turkish-made weaponry in military operations. Mr. Martirosyan mentioned the recent events in Kelbadzharskiy in this regard: the Armenian soldiers found large ammunition stores containing Turkish-made shells and mines. In addition to this, the same sources report, some 200 "Grey Wolves" are currently fighting at some sections of the front. According to Mr. Martirosyan, Turkey's active military, political and financial aid to Azerbaijan shows once again that Turkey is going to continue interfering in the internal affairs of CIS countries.
