FBIS4-58398 "drnes086_n_94007" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 LEBANON Hizballah Official on Lebanon, Other Issues Hizballah Official on Lebanon, Other Issues JN0305151694 London AL-WASAT in Arabic 2-8 May 94 pp 19, 20 JN0305151694 London AL-WASAT Arabic BFN ["Text of dialogue" with Shaykh Na'im Qasim, deputy secretary general of Hizballah, by Faysal Jallul in Beirut; date not given] [Excerpts] [Jallul] Hizballah is at odds with the Lebanese State, and therefore, it has to either accept or reject it. It seems to us that your party has decided to adapt to the situation. This is clear because it did not respond to the al-Ghubayrah incident and because it takes part in parliamentary action and politics. [Qasim] Adaptation usually means a relinquishment of principles. This is wrong and unacceptable. Adherence to principles, however, does not necessarily mean a military clash with those with whom we differ. The West may want to promote the idea that any ideological and political difference with a party like ours will inevitably lead to a military clash. We in Lebanon have chosen the way of clashes with the Israeli enemy only. On the internal level, we believe that ideological and political differences should not lead to military clashes. We also still believe in the need to promote the Islamic trend and thought as the best alternative for the people. We offer our faith to others, share with them issues acceptable to us and them, explain our views on issues of dispute, and do not believe in the use of force to impose our will on others. Therefore, we did not respond militarily to the 13 September massacre. Those who perpetrated the massacre wanted to draw us into an internal military conflict to justify the international security situation, confuse the party, and try to settle some scores under the pretext that our party opted for a military clash, especially with the Lebanese Army. We did not respond militarily because we do not believe in the use of that method by any side and because we did not want to be drawn into others' plans whenever and wherever they wanted. We view the 13 September massacre as part of a plan to strike at the resistance, and not as a transitory issue designed to prevent a peaceful demonstration. Regarding mass media propaganda, we believe that this way pushes the country toward a unilateral military rule and will not lead to the establishment of a free, coexisting Lebanon, which we have known and which should continue to be. Without such freedoms, there will be no Lebanon. We have no interest in confronting the authority through newscasts, and we want to prevent any comparison between us and people blasting the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. Some people wanted such an unfair comparison. Therefore, we deprived them of such a chance. [Jallul] You seem to be supporting the dissolution of the Lebanese Forces. [Qasim] We are against any international explosion, we condemn any relationship with the Israeli enemy, and we build our relations with others on this basis. I believe that a peripheral issue led to the dissolution of the Lebanese Forces, and it is essential to concentrate on the nature of these forces and their positions. We clearly reject the logic of these forces and their relationship with the Israeli enemy. [passage omitted] [Jallul] You are linked with Iran by spiritual and strategic ties, and you are linked with Syria by political relations on the ground. Do you not fear the risks of a collision between the two parties over the Middle East issue? [Qasim] I believe that the collision assumption is wrong and baseless. The contrast in views on the Madrid conference is not new. Had collision been a possibility, it would have begun when the Madrid conference convened. Each of the two states appreciated the other state's position, convictions, and circumstances, so the relationship between them continued to be strong without being affected by what takes place in this regard. I do not believe that there is a problem more sensitive than this one. Thus, the possibility of collision is ruled out, and the possibility of understanding and cooperation on common bases is the rule. In our relations with Iran and Syria, we do not feel that Iranian-Syrian relations are contradictory, and we feel that we are in harmony with both parties. [Jallul] Many people fear that your resistance of Israel is meant to achieve domestic purposes. [Qasim] Our resistance of Israel will give us a great asset among our people and kinsfolk who are yearning for the removal of Israel from every inch of occupied land. Thus, the outcome of confrontation with Israel cannot be separated from the repercussions on the domestic level. It is unfair to say that we are fighting Israel to increase our domestic weight. Fighting against Israel is part of our ideology, plan, and strategic conviction. [Jallul] Will you continue to fight Israel if it withdraws from Lebanon? [Qasim] We support the Palestinian people in defending their occupied territories because we regard this people as rightful. However, details of this support would be discussed at an appropriate time. [Jallul] Are you negotiating with Israel on a possible withdrawal from southern Lebanon? [Qasim] There is no need to negotiate with anyone. Israel can withdraw, and no one is preventing it from doing so. We do not want to conclude any security or political agreement with Israel because it is an occupying force and should withdraw from the territory it occupies. [Jallul] In your slogans you say that "Israel is a germ" and should be removed from the map. Let us suppose that the Lebanese state and Israel would sign an agreement for withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Would you continue to open fire on Israel across the Lebanese border? [Qasim] We will oppose any agreement that gives legitimacy to occupation which usurps lands. [Jallul] In Palestine or Lebanon? [Qasim] Anywhere in this occupied territory. Details on the way of dealing and on confrontation will be left for the future. [Jallul] Is the Iranian "Revolutionary Guard" playing a role in the confrontation you are waging with Israel? [Qasim] The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard does not fight in southern Lebanon. However, it is known that some of its members are present in the al-Biqa' area; they play an educational and training role and do not participate in other matters. This is partly due to the Islamic leadership's attitude and partly due to the harmony among those concerned in the region. [Jallul] Elections of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council were held recently. You participated in these elections in favor of Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din. Your failure to nominate an independent candidate was interpreted to mean that you are not permitted to occupy posts in the official shiite institutions. [Qasim] Only those things which God banned us from doing are prohibited. We are convinced of the need to deal with these institutions, and we determine the way and limits of such dealing according to both our goals and the objective circumstances. In analyzing the situation of the Shiite Islamic Council, we found that Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din is the right man for this post. You know that in such cases a person may be nominated but another person may be selected. There is nothing strange in this matter.
