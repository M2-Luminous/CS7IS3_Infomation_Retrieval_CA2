In other words, those laboring under the impression that the United States is being intimidated by North Korea are making the mistake of looking at the trees but not the forest, they say. They also argue that it is wrong to assume that President Bill Clinton's administration is unable to forge a consistent policy on North Korea as it is busy looking over its shoulder at the hawks in the Defense Ministry and the Central Intelligence Agency. The White House may even be trying to give that appearance, they say. In a nutshell, the White House is attempting to maintain and protect its controlling position not only on the Korean peninsula but also in the whole of Asia by playing "the North Korea card" to the fullest, they say. One has to keep in mind, they advise, that the North Korean nuclear issue has been dragged out since Washington's interest in the region and Pyongyang's urgent need for improved relations with America have meshed nicely. Of course, unexpected events and the interests of China and Japan tended to complicate the issue, but in the end, the compromise worked out by Washington and Pyongyang appears to have gone as planned by both sides. Banking on its anxiety, South Korea could have been made to play the game, probably unwittingly, by the White House, some analysts say. Certain diplomatic sources in Washington question how accurately the South Korean Government has been "reading the minds" of President Clinton and his staff at the White House. As one example of Seoul's inability to divine the White House's intentions, the sources cite the aborted visit to North Korea by Rep. Ronald Dellums. Even after Dellums' scheduled trip to Pyongyang was announced, South Korean Foreign Ministry officials were said to be skeptical of the visit ever coming off. They reportedly wondered: Would it be necessary when North Korea had already accepted outside inspection of its nuclear facilities? Some South Korean officials were even said to be betting on Dellums' visit being cancelled, which has indeed happened. In any event, it wasn't for nothing that North Korea singled out Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and "an influential dove" in the U.S. Congress, and invited him to visit Pyongyang at this crucial juncture, they say. The White House says Dellums' planned visit had nothing to do with the U.S. Government, but no one in Washington would take this statement seriously, the analysts say. One American Korea watcher said North Korea has "earned" a one-year lease on life by agreeing to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect its facilities. It is thus time for South Korea to be really alert and pursue policy bearing its own interests in mind, they say.
