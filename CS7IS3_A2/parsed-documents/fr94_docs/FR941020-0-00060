FR941020-0-00060 FR941020-0-00020 This rule also makes a technical correction to 50 CFR 216.24(d)(2)(i)(A)( 2 ), where the scientific names for coastal spotted dolphin ( Stenella attenuata ) and northern tropical striped dolphin ( Stenella coeruleoalba ) were inadvertently transposed. Classification This rule implements a Court order and does not involve the exercise of agency discretion and, therefore, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) good cause exists to waive the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, as such procedures are unnecessary. Further, in that this rule implements a Court order already in effect, good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to waive the 30-day delay in effective date. Because the revision of 216.24(d)(2)(i)(A)( 2 ) only makes a technical correction, it is unnecessary to provide notice and public comment, or to delay for 30 days the effective date. This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.
