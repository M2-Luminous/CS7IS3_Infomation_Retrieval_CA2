There is reason to suppose that this is not just a regional event. First of all, the New Wave leaders, and they are People's Deputies Mykhaylo Kostyv, Viktor Pynzenyk, Taras Stetskyv, and the young politician Igor Grynyv, who is well-known from the parliament of the last convocation, are perhaps not persons of a regional scale. And it seems that the question concerns a tendency. If you will permit me a small pun--a wave rises, when the foam subsides... I do not know what the diplomaed political scientists will say, but it seems to me: The phenomenon matured at a logical time. Only high tones could be heard and two colors could be viewed in a period when totalitarian walls and bars were being pulled down and at the time of yet another fermentation of ideas, intellects, and speeches. It was necessary later at least to go through a rudimentary restructuring of political forces. And also to experience a certain disappointment in the existing organizations and parties. This is what affects factors that in a positive way influence the possibility of the emergence of fruitful work of regional or global associations of reform-minded centrist-democrats. Of course, there is also the negative factor--red and blue-yellow "Sharikov's" who are ready "to divide everything" and to jail those over and over whom they do not hang, are growing like mushrooms on the threshold of the key posts of a society that is rolling into the abyss. Thus, everything occurs at the conjunction of a paradox: A catastrophic economy and a stagnating state structure persistently require the intervention of those who are capable of making anything that is real and civilized. And the very same aforementioned troubles do not let the centrists expand: The people are not inclined either to mature to a sensible choice, nor to trust anyone, and, indeed, not much time is allotted... The Lvov New Wave was born during the recent preelection campaign and with the purpose of participating in it. Not bound by party limits and the "long-playing" obligations that intimidated the intelligentsia from time immemorial, it was able to assemble not only a fair circle of candidates for parliament, but also rather good company around the candidates, if it can be expressed this way. Intellectual, young, and pragmatic. As our newspaper has already written, the result of the elections, proceeding from the fact that the association could not use the halo of past feats and did not tickle the sensitive centers of the lovers of rallies, can be called not bad. Here is something else that is interesting: No one was cursed as much, and no one was fought against as hard by all possible kinds of extremists. Stepan Khmara, for example, being already elected, dropped all of his affairs and traveled all around the district of a candidate from New Wave who was not familiar to him, desperately agitating against him. The candidate, by the way, was elected. Just before the local elections, visitors began to come to New Wave frequently: Many potential candidates wanted to associate their preelection fate specifically with this association. There is this feature--among the New Wave nominees to the city council today, there are members of the URP [Ukrainian Republican Party], the KUN [Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists], and the SOU [Ukrainian Officers Union]. Both this and other facts indicate: In the Galicia region, the "seismic waves," as the group is sometimes referred to teasingly, have come into their own under the political sun. And in doing this, they got rid of the adjective "electoral" before the word "association." The talk turned to a new social movement. Let us put it this way, there was nothing unusual in the proclamation documents and speeches at the first conference. It was rather transparently stated that the New Wave considers itself one of the components of a future democratic center (read--party). But, not being a party, at this stage it calls on the unity and cooperation of all who share the key postulates: the formation of a Ukrainian national state, orientation of Ukraine on integration in Europe, and the formation of a civil society and a rule-of-law state. It should be added that on economic questions the New Wave supports a market economy, orienting itself on Viktor Pynzenyk's program. What are we dealing with this time? With yet another fragmentation of the national-democratic movement, or actually, with absorption, and does this means a uniting of healthy forces? The "eggheads" traditionally lost to the Bolsheviks from the aspect of the mass character and organization of basic cells. Today, branches of the Lvov New Wave are appearing in the rayon centers; moreover, this process is really coming from below and not from above. Will it come to a halt after the local elections, or will it continue? Incidentally, it is exactly the local elections that can become a trampoline, but they can, just the opposite, bury the new movement. The fact is that the "'Piemonte' of the national renewal" (probably no one in all Galicia can pronounce these words any longer today without irony) cannot brag about economic successes. In the event that the New Wave and its allies receive a sufficient number of seats to the local organs of authority, Viktor Pynzenyk, and other prominent economists, promise to implement a regional program of reforms here with the involvement of the best forces. If the seats are present and there are no positive accomplishments, even because of global or national reasons, the disappointment will be fierce. A final resolution of the "East-West" problem was not within the capability of either Rukh [Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka], or URP. The new centrist organizations seem to have the grounds for becoming a consolidating factor: Standing on indisputable positions of independence and statehood, they do not regard wide trousers, or even language, of paramount importance. This plus has an opposite side--it is for this reason that this kind of a movement will become the object of a tough struggle on the part of extremists in both the West and in the East. But how will the fraternal organizations behave? Will Rukh and URP like the fact that, figuratively speaking, a new little horse is entering the field, nipping at the general electorate? As always, there are more questions than answers at the moment of birth. It is unlikely that astrologists will help. Mykhaylo Kostyv, of course, was joking: New Wave received its registration certificate on St. George's day. And George, as is well-known, is a dragon-slayer. Shall we end on this optimistic note?
