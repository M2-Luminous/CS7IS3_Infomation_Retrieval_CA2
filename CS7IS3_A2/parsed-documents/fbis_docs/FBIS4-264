"We'll make sure the state of emergency does not work in Natal/kwaZulu as long as we live," IFP Youth Brigade publicity secretary Zenzele Phakathi told the crowd before delivering a memorandum to an Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] official. IFP regional secretary and kwaZulu legislative assembly member Blessed Gwala warned the IEC the people of the region would not allow polling booths to be set up before their demands were met. "If the IEC makes it possible to force the installation of polling booths in our areas before our demands are met, I am afraid people will use even their teeth to tear them down. "We are prepared to pay even the highest price with our lives if need be, for the sake of our children and the next generations." Mr Gwala warned that if the IFP's demands for federalism were not ad?ressed "then there is no election on April 27, 1994". In apparent reference to the state of emergency in Natal, he said: "We will do everything in our power to destroy any attempt by any state organ used by the African National Congress which is bent on dividing the zulu nation by encouraging certain elements in kwazulu to rebel against the king". Earlier, Mr Phakathi, reading from the IFP memo, warned the IEC it would find it very difficult to maintain peace and stability which would allow free and fair elections in the country "unless this constitution is corrected in accordance with the minimum demands of the IFP and the Freedom Alliance". He said the IEC was a product of the ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council, an enemy of the IFP and kwaZulu, and said IEC decisions were proscribed by the ANC. "The IEC like the Goldstone Commission is a political weapon of the ANC/communist party/government alliance which is to be used as an instrument which will lead kwaZulu into final destruction." Earlier, large groups of the crowd who assembled at an open field at the start of the march refused to lay down their traditional weapons in defiance of the emergency regulations proclaimed in Natal/kwaZulu last Thursday. Police legal adviser Maj Margaret Kruger told reporters police did not want to provoke the marchers and would negotiate with leaders on the issue of weapons. She said, however, that those carrying sticks and spears were contravening the emergency regulations. IFP leaders, including Women's Brigade National Chairman Faith Gaza, angrily told reporters the emergency regulations discriminated against the IFP. "The state of emergency is biased against us. It allows the ANC to train its people, but it strips us of our traditional weapons," Mrs Gaza said. While many IFP supporters heeded calls to hand in weapons, others refused to do so. And while many marchers carried sticks, spears were also visible. Police and soldiers lined most of the route and no incidents had been reported by the end of the procession.
