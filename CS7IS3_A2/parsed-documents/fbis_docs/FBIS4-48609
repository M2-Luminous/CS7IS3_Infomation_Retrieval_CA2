Mr Modise's minders are twitchy. Nothing is certain. Civil servants are walking on eggshells to preserve their jobs. The process of educating the minister has barely begun. Although he sat on the Transitional Executive Council's defence sub- committee, Mr Modise must be schooled before he is quizzed and tested in public. "Don't question him too deeply," whispers an aide as we enter the L-shaped office on the fourth floor of the Armscor building, east of Pretoria. The advice is as unnecessary as it is unwelcome. Mr Modise is no stranger to hard questions. He has bitten the bullet many times. His orders to MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] risked cadres' lives and wrought death and destruction in apartheid South Africa. But, like the thousand of guerrilla footsoldiers, Mr Modise led as commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe, he is still being integrated into the new defence force. Mr Modise, 64, is bright-eyed and ardent. He speaks carefully. Careers and multi-million-rand empires sit balanced on his comments and decisions. His immediate priorities are to establish a civilian department of defence and scrutinise the defence accounts for any "prunings" that will enable the SANDF [South African National Defense Force] to take on new responsibilities for integration without pushing the current R[Rand]9.3-billion budget above R10-billion next year. Mr Modise says details of plans that will effectively draw the teeth of the generals by putting responsibility for military policy- making, funding and personnel under civilian control will be announced "within days". "If we are going to break with the past, we must make the Ministry of Defence a civilian apparatus that is accountable to Parliament," he says. While Mr Modise refuses to discuss names, Lieutenant-General Pierre Steyn, the SADF [South African Defense Force] second-in- command "Mr Clean" who took early retirement late last year, is a favoured candidate for Secretary of State for Defence. He would have equal status with the Chief of the Defence Force who will retain operational control. On the matter of appointments, Mr Modise says he cannot explain why he has no deputy, a post that was mooted for MK and SACP [South African Communist Party] firebrand Ronnie Kasrils. "I have been asking that question myself," says Mr Modise. "Defence is a huge task. It is too much for one man. I am seeing it from the inside now. "I have raised it with the deputy president and he cannot answer, so I will ask President Mandela why I can't have a deputy." As expected, Mr Modise is disbanding the National Peace-keeping Force [NKF] ending the misery of uncertainty for the "blue berets", the controversial force integrating SADF, MK, SAP [South African Police] and homeland troops that he helped establish. Members are being returned to the units from which they were seconded. Refusing to join the chorus crowing over the hastily-trained and rashly-deployed peacekeepers' failure, Mr Modise blames part of the fiasco on a "reluctance" by the SADF and SAP to wholeheartedly support the force. "Now that the situation is normalising, the police must do this work of law and order, and the army must go back to barracks. "I don't see any reason for the NPKF," says Mr Modise. The NPKF is estimated to have cost about R240-million. Axing it now leaves more than R120-million to be recouped from its budget. Anything that can be saved is a bonus: the cost of integrating more than 30,000 soldiers from MK and the homeland armies into the SANDF, followed by the inevitable pay-offs for retrenchments to rationalise the force below 100,000 is likely to add more than R1-billion a year to the defence bill. "Such a sensitive subject," Mr Modise says with a wince. It is clear that in the next round of cuts, jobs as well as treasured projects will be lost. It is not a policy of savings at any cost, however. Mr Modise supports the Navy's R1.2-billion bid to acquire four corvettes to restore its blue-water patrol and anti-submarine capability. He sees the porject fitting into the ANC Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) by creating jobs in the equipping of "green hulls" bought overseas. The project also ensures the protection of South Africa's marine resources. Caught between his ministerial responsibility to champion the best interests of the SANDF and Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] in cabinet and the ANC's obligations to better citizens' lives, Mr Modise plays down the conflict inherent in his new job. Long dubbed a hawk, Mr Modise sees South Africa's multi-billion- rand arms industry as an irreplaceable source of skills, jobs and income for the RDP. "There is no contradiction. Morally the ANC is bound by the RDP to create jobs for people and if the defence budget is kept where it is and the arms embargo is lifted, jobs are going to be created," he says. As far as Mr Modise is concerned, the lifting of the UN Security Council arms embargo, now openly disregarded, is but a fomarlity. "We called for the embargo because of apartheid and if we call for it to be lifted anybody opposing that will have to come with good reasons. We cannot impose it on ourselves," he says. Another major step towards normality will come with the imminent return and integration of 2,500 MK cadres who have been trained in Tanzania.
