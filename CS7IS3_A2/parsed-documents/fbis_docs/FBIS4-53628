A plan to nurture large-scale farming is one of its pillars. At the same time, Ozawa explained his view that self-sufficiency in the rice supply should be maintained even if the people have to bear the consequences of the disparity between Japanese and overseas prices. Reportedly, Chairman Toyoda agreed with Ozawa and "promised to have close cooperation with Shinseito in the future." Since he is an influential figure in the ruling coalition, it seems that Ozawa's criticism of the agricultural policy will impact on management of future agricultural policies. The meeting was held on 5 April [as published] under the auspices of JA Zenchu in Iwate Prefecture, where Ozawa's hometown is. In the meeting, Ozawa touched on and criticized the new agricultural policy that the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Ministry mapped out in 1992 to nurture large-scale farmers. He said: "The policy will create a large landowner system. Large-scale farming is impossible in Japan." On liberalization of Japan's rice market, Ozawa said that: "I was against the partial liberalization (of rice imports) from the beginning." In this way, he insisted that we should keep foreign rice out of the Japanese market by choosing tariffication of rice rather than accepting minimum access." Moreover, he explained his pet theme, saying that "rice supply self-sufficiency should be maintained even if the people have to pay five times more than (the international price) for rice." In the past, the Zenchu mobilized agricultural cooperatives and farmers across the nation to support the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. It was the LDP's largest supporting body. Following the collapse of the 1955 regime of Japanese politics, however, the Zenchu reviewed its stance of supporting only the LDP. Prior to the Ozawa-Toyoda meeting, the Zenchu held social gatherings by inviting senior executives of the ruling coalition. The Zenchu was apparently "moving away from the LDP." Takami Eto, Sadanori Nakayama, and other members of the LDP's Agricultural and Forestry Department protested against the Zenchu's move. There was trouble stirring between the LDP and the Zenchu. Contents of the meeting were scheduled to be published in JAPANESE AGRICULTURAL NEWSPAPER, which is the Zenchu organ. However, it was not realized because senior Zenchu officials had decided that "our ties with the LDP will definitely become worse if we excite the LDP more than it is now." Ozawa's office printed the contents of the discussions at the meeting in newsletters and began on the seventh to distribute them among Ozawa's supporters.
