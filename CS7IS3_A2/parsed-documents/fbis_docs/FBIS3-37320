Now we offer for your attention an exclusive interview which the high-ranking guest gave to the Russian television. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, there are different symbols and stereotypes: good and bad; a red star, a matreshka doll, rockets. For a long time they were the stereotypes of our country. What image of Russia do you have now? [Major] I believe that many of the stereotypes you have just mentioned have given way to new realities and a new understanding. This morning President Yeltsin said that relations between Russia and the United Kingdom today are better than they had been in past decades. The main reason for this is that they have become closer. We know more about one another. Trade between our countries is developing, political contacts are expanding, and visits of top officials are becoming more frequent. The British now have a better understanding of what is going on in Russia, and the Russians have a better understanding of what Britain supports. [Correspondent] What are the current potential areas of disagreement? Can you predict some of them at all? In general, we have a good idea as to where our positions are close and opinions coincide, but it is no less important to know where they do not coincide and how to overcome them. [Major] I will be straightforward. Today in the course of the talks we were unable to identify many disagreements. But we discovered many areas where we coincide. For example, we actively support your reforms. They are rather painful, we know that. They are difficult. It is not easy to make the transition from the type of system you used to have to a free market system, but when the transition is completed, major advantages are revealed. At some point in time Russia's citizens saw that transformations were occurring in the old system, but the price of change entails difficulties, and the Russian people are carrying difficulties on their shoulders. It is a time of heavy burdens and a time of change, but at the moment the advantages which will be revealed later--they will not fail to be revealed--are not very apparent to people, because people live for today. That is why the main thing is accord and support for bold actions. As we are in a position to help, we would like to do so. [Correspondent] Disagreements and a divergence of views still exist, they exist here and there, but they exist. Where do you think they are apparent? [Major] Really, there are not many such areas. Now, in bilateral relations between Russian and the United Kingdom the number of such disagreements is very small. Where there are some, we try to eliminate them. It is an amazing fact that only four and five and, even more so, seven and eight years ago, one could state numerous disagreements between our countries, and nowadays they are hard to find. What can be found straight away is accord. Coincidence of views on the issue of the reforms, agreement on Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and on Russia's joining the European Council, agreement regarding ways to bring an end to the bloodshed in Bosnia and, finally, the agreement, which we signed officially today, on not targeting Russian nuclear weapons on Great Britain. Our nuclear weapons will not be targeted against Russia. We have achieved a great deal of accord. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, in what areas of cooperation can you suggest a greater breakthrough was made and what prospects are most favorable? [Major] I think that we reached great understanding in the economic sphere. There is every possibility of increasing the volumes of trade. At present out trade aircraft has just taken off, it is still touching the ground and has not yet gained any height. The potential for increasing mutual trade is immense. The potential for increasing capital investments is equally great. What is good for Russia will also be good for Great Britain. I think that as the reforms progress, Russia's attractiveness for foreign investors will increase sharply as stability increases. Then trade turnover with western countries, and with Great Britain in particular, will increase as a whole. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, would you please say a few words directly to Russian television viewers. [Major] We have watched with great admiration from afar how in the past four-five years Russia has been carrying out amazing political reforms--difficult reforms, complex ones. Five years ago the British people could not imagine that your country would have a publicly elected president, a new constitution, and a democratically elected parliament, whose work can be followed on television. Very few people could imagine the considerable economic transformations which are taking place in your country. These transformations include a great degree of price liberalization, an immense scale of privatization and, finally, the determination with which you are advancing toward a free market. Of course, this needs time, and this cannot be achieved without hard work, sweat, and pain, but I see that Russia and Russia's citizens are full of determination to advance in this direction and we support you in this.
