Gen. Tetsuya Nishimoto, chairman of the Joint Staff Council of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, paid a courtesy call on Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, at the Pentagon. Nishimoto later told reporters that he discussed North Korea's nuclear program and other matters with Shalikashvili, and got the impression that "the U.S. has been negotiating very patiently" with Pyongyang over the nuclear issue. The United States is formulating a comprehensive policy approach toward North Korea that focuses not only on the nuclear issue but also takes into account North Korea's missile development program, its vast military power and possible involvement in international terrorism, he said. Nishimoto is currently on a three-day visit to the United States as Shalikashvili's official guest.
