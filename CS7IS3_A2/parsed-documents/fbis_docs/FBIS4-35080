As a man of exemplary character and deep understanding, I want you to know that the Haitian people want peace and well-being and not war and misery. Monde writes: They reject dictatorship in any form and only want the kind of true democracy that develops over years within the framework of their own culture, customs, and history. He continues: Mr. President, why are so many blacks in the U.S. Congress so desperate to lead you into military intervention against a small, poor, defenseless country? They want victory for the U.S. Government and Armed Forces, yet -- as Cornet, the French poet, might say -- they remain silent on the tragedy of hundreds of thousands of their African brothers dying in Rwanda. Monde asks: Mr. President, did you ever question their interests and what the Democratic Party has to gain by you, as the one representing them at the highest leadership level, making this decision?
