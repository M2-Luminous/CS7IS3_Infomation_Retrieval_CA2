The full document, pending official adoption by the Commission and translation into all of the Union's official languages, is expected at the time of writing to be published in March/April 1994. Ian Holt, who contributed to its development, looks at the main points of the Green Paper, the background to it, and its importance in the overall scheme of things. Construction of European telecommunications policy started in earnest with the publication of the 1987 telecoms Green Paper. The strategy was to tackle the fixed area directly, and to address mobile and satellite communications separately. A Green Paper on satellite policy appeared in 1990, but the mobile Green Paper seemed to drift off the agenda. Therein lies an apparently famous fact about the mobile Green Paper -- that it is two years late. This stems from linking the Green Paper (like a lot of things) to the deadline for completion of the single market by the end of 1992; it does not refer specifically to the state of development of the mobile sector itself. In fact, in these terms, the timing of the Green Paper is about right, coming at a point where the balance of opinion believes that a large consumer market for personal communications is going to develop. This provides a strategic focus for policy development and a forward-looking context for analysis of the current environment. In 1990-1991, a formative period for the shaping of mobile trends as well as telecoms policy, the Green Paper would have had less of a sense of direction. And since actions were already being taken to promote pan-European mobile communications and introduce competition (second GSM licenses being granted in France, Germany and elsewhere), it would have had less to say. As it is, the Green Paper is able to build on recent technological, market and policy advances to propose new directions of consequence to telecommunications as a whole. Main Goals of the Mobile Green Paper The Green Paper is driven by two main aims. Single Market The first of these is to ensure the existence of a Union-wide market for mobile communications. European telecommunications policy has been largely shaped through application of the single market and -- of particular relevance to telecoms -- the competition provisions of the EEC Treaty, and the present Green Paper is no exception. Mobile services currently remain outside the scope of the EC directives which carry the main thrusts of telecoms policy, concerning market opening, licensing and open network provision (ONP). A core job of the Green Paper is therefore to propose how to extend these directives and the principles embodied in them into the mobile area, taking account of the specific circumstances of the sector. Pursuing the single market aim in the fixed telecommunications area has set an important context for the Green Paper. In June 1993, following the Commission's 1992 review of telecommunications, the Council of the European Union plumped for full liberalisation of telecoms services starting in 1998. For mobile policy, a key question arising was how to interpret full liberalisation in a sector where limited frequency availability leads to restricted entry. Of a more strategic nature, it became of interest to consider what new factors would come into play as a consequence of dissolving the regulatory boundary between fixed and mobile service areas. Development of Personal Communications The second aim comes from within the sector itself, and gives the Green paper its strategic focus. This is to push the development in Europe of a mass market for personal communications services (linking this to a point with the "Trans-European Networks" initiative introduced via the Maastricht Treaty). In part, this is because the Commission sees personal communications as an area in which Europe could lead the world, building on the success of GSM. The Green paper suggests that as many as 80 million Europeans could be users of mobile personal communications by 2010, with ultimate potential to reach 80 per cent of the total population (i.e., one connection per adult -- easily exceeding the penetration level for fixed telephony). The most critical factor for achieving mass market penetrations is seen to be the price of handsets; it is predicted that take-up will accelerate significantly once prices fall below 250 ECUs. It is envisaged that personal communications will be based, at least initially, on combinations of existing systems such as GSM, DC51800 and DECT, together with intelligent functions providing mobility services on the fixed network, and use of satellite personal communications in thinly-populated areas. The Green Paper further sees that "personal communications will ultimately allow person-to-person calling independent of the location and the terminal used, the means or transmission (wired or wireless) and/or choice of technology." Flexibility in service provision, including the possibility to combine services offered via different networks and technologies in response to market demand, is seen as particularly important to enable movement in this direction. Whilst noting Europe's generally strong positioning for development of personal communications, the Green Paper also highlights a number of barriers to market development, including: -- maintenance of restrictions on entry and operation which constrain market development and prevent equality of opportunity for market participants; -- market fragmentation, caused by different licensing arrangements in different countries and through awarding licences along the lines of radio system technologies (a consequence of frequency assignment methods); -- lack of a common approach regarding service provision, in particular by independent service providers, which could provide flexibility to overcome problems of market fragmentation; -- constraints on freedom to achieve economic mobile network operation, particularly regarding dependence on fixed network operators for interconnection and infrastructure; -- lack of firm timetables for allocation of frequencies for key personal communications technologies. Main Proposals The Green Paper's major prescription for realising the goals and overcoming the barriers set out above is, unsurprisingly, to maximise commercial freedom and allow market forces to play a full role. A broad interpretation of the Green Paper's positions picks out the following as components of the regulatory regime proposed for mobile services: Open Market -- Abolition of exclusive and special rights for mobile network operation, in essence requiring introduction of competition and non-discretionary licensing. The Green Paper states that the procedures and criteria for award of licences should be fully objective and transparent, and that applicants should be treated in an equal manner. The Green Paper does not recommend a method of awarding licences, but states that the method chosen should aim particularly at maximising benefits for users e.g., in terms of prices, quality, etc. It implies that licensing competitions (beauty parades or auctions) should be resorted to only where there is contention for available frequencies. It stops short of suggesting that regulators should leave determination of numbers of entrants to the market. -- Unrestricted entry into service provision. The Green Paper states that both independent service providers and mobile network operators should be allowed entry. It further states that mobile network operators should accept all reasonable requests from service providers (including those integrated with other mobile network operators) to deal, within the limits of normal commercial practice and competition law. It considers that service provision does not require licensing, however service providers should follow a self-regulation code of conduct. -- Mutual recognition. The Green Paper extends the principles of mutual recognition of national authorisations into the mobile area, in order to reduce barriers to entry in different countries. However, it points out that full mutual recognition of mobile network operator licences is only possible where there is no limitation on the number of operators. As regards service providers, it states that their established relationships with mobile operators should be fully recognised. -- Frequency availability. The Green Paper stresses the need to efficiently use frequency spectrum, to involve market participants in frequency planning and to publish clear and non-discriminatory frequency allocation procedures. Level Playing Field -- Non-discriminatory licensing conditions. This includes abolition of special rights granting any player a lasting advantage. -- Safeguards in licensing to ensure equal treatment. The Green paper makes specific reference to the interface between mobile network operators and service providers. It considers that the licenses of mobile network operators should require sufficient transparency, in particular concerning accounting, to allow supervision of service provision activities which are integrated into their operations. Freedom of Operation -- Minimum necessary regulation. The Green paper considers that regulation should be limited to what is justified in the general interest. It states that mobile licensing conditions may set purblicservice requirements concerning permanence, availability and quality of service, and should restrict activities only on the grounds of "essential requirements" such as the integrity of public networks. -- Free combination of service offerings. The Green paper sees as essential for development of personal communications the freedom for service providers to offer a combination of mobile services provided under different licences (in the same or different countries) and using different technologies. Come 1998, this freedom should be extended across both fixed and mobile areas. -- The Green Paper indicates that mobile network operations would as a normal rule be allowed to expand their mobile operations through bids for multiple licences. From 1998, mobile operators could bid for licences for provision of public voice via the fixed network, and fixed network operators could bid for mobile licences. -- Open interconnection. The Green Paper indicates that the principles of interconnection defined under ONP for access to the fixed network should be employed in the mobile area. Mobile operators should respond to reasonable requests for interconnection, with agreement reached primarily through commercial negotiation. They should be allowed to directly interconnect, both within and between Member States. -- Infrastructure. The Green Paper considers that mobile network operators should have rights to establish their own infrastructure or use that provided by a third party, subject to use for their licensed activities. They should also be able to share infrastructure and sites. The implementation of these proposed positions is seen to involve some extension of EC directives, but mainly requires action to be taken by administrations and regulators at the national level. EC mobile policy did not start with the Green paper (but could only get so far without it). Since 1987, actions have been taken in a number of key areas: -- Support for introduction of GSM, ERMES and DECT. In 1987, the EU Council of Ministers adopted a recommendation and accompanying directive promoting the coordinated introduction of GSM. The recommendation set targets for rollout and availability; the directive required Member States to make available the necessary frequencies. Subsequently, a similar dual measure approach was taken in 1990 for ERMES (digital radio paging) and in 1991 for DECT (digital cordless). -- Frequency coordination framework. In 1990, the Council adopted a resolution calling for CEPT wide cooperation on radio frequencies focused on the CEPT European Radiocommunications Committee (ERC). The ERC adopted a mechanism in 1991 for implementation of 'ERC Decisions' which the EC Council subsequently said should be used in preference to EC frequency directives. The arrangements for cooperation between the Commission and the CEPT bodies concerned under this approach are being worked out. A similar framework is being developed for numbering. -- Introduction of competition. The Commission's competition directorate, DGIV, has acted to encourage a small number of Member States to license a second GSM operator. -- Mobile terminals. The first common technical regulations (OTRs) were adopted in 1993 as the basis for mutual recognition of type approval of GSM terminals according to the 1991 directive covering this subject. -- Research and development. The RACE mobile project (Research Into Advanced Communications in Europe) is carrying out research into a 3rd- generation UMTS system (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System). Actions to Promote Development A number of further actions at the European level are proposed to promote development of Europe-wide mobile and personal communications. These include: -- Completion of CEPT-wide frameworks for frequency and numbering coordination. -- Promoting Europe-wide introduction of key personal communications systems, such as DCS1800, UMTS and LEOs, via the setting of firm frequency allocation schedules and, for future systems, coordinated/Community-level licensing. -- Introducing a European numbering space for Europe-wide personal numbers. -- Establishing a code of conduct for service providers. -- Setting up an action programme to address concerns about health hazards and interference from radiocommunications devices and establish safety standards. -- Promoting standarisation to ensure interconnection and interoperability, including access to intelligent network functionality. -- Working out common positions with regard to non- EEA countries concerning porvision of mobile and personal communications. Conclusions The mobile Green Paper shows that there is a lot more to mobile policy than simply licensing two operators in each area. It points, for example, to the structure of the sector itself and indicates a general requirement for greater flexibility. The timing of the Green paper is just about right, coinciding with initial steps towards development of personal communications. This allows it to contribute some significant ideas concerning the future direction of European telecommunications, such as the emergence of the wholesale/retail concept -- with service providers operating across the boundaries of network provision -- as a major structure for the future supply of telecommunications services in Europe. Its timing also allows it to take advantage of the recent policy success of the 1992 telecoms review, for example initiating the adaptation of ONP towards becoming a set of general regulatory principles applicable throughout the sector. Overall, better late.
