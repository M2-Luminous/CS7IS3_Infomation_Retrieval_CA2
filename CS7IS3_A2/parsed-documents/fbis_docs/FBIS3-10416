The political crisis settlement plan that arose from the Washington negotiations and was approved by a majority of deputies in a parliamentary session on 2 March seems to be gathering a maximum of support. The Haitian employer sector also is backing the document for which CONACOM [National Congress Of Democratic Movements], a party close to the president in exile, also gave its support to the parliament. The other political parties are still waiting and have refrained from taking a stand on what the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Port-au-Prince sees as a step toward the exit door in this long, Haitian crisis.
