FR941219-1-00004 FR941219-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 81&hyph;ANE&hyph;03] Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT8D Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: This notice revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt & Whitney JT8D series turbofan engines, that would have amended an existing AD by eliminating an optional on-wing ultrasonic inspection of the 10th stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk, and by including an engine model inadvertently omitted. That proposal was prompted by a report of an uncontained failure of a 10th stage HPC disk that was previously inspected using the on-wing ultrasonic inspection method. This action revises the proposed rule by removing the reference to the inadvertently omitted engine model, as the FAA has remedied this discrepancy in an earlier correction to the AD, and changing the proposed action from amending AD 81&hyph;08&hyph;02 R2 to superseding that AD. The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended to prevent uncontained fractures of 9th through 12th stage HPC disks and engine failure. DATES: Comments must be received by February 17, 1995.
