FR941110-0-00197 FR941110-0-00016 Comment: One commenter suggested that at proposed §488.230(i) we provide for the accrual of interest. Response: We are revising redesignated §488.440 to require that the notice of the penalty amount due include a statement of the interest rate so that a provider is aware of the interest rate applicable if the penalty is not paid on the due date. Redesignated §488.442(c), which discusses the collection procedures for civil money penalties, specifies how the rate of interest is computed. Redesignated §488.442 Due date for payment of penalty. Comment: Several commenters proposed changing the date when civil money penalties are due as stipulated at §488.230(j)(1) of the proposed rule to one of the following: •30 days everywhere the proposed rule specifies 15 days, as 30 days is more commonly used in commerce; •30 days from the date of notification or any earlier period as provided for by State law; or •Within 10 days of receipt of notice of penalty or within 10 days of receipt of the final hearing decision unless the decision is appealed. Response: We do not accept the recommendations of the commenters to change the due date. The due date proposed (now in redesignated §488.442) is consistent with existing HCFA notification procedures in which we give the provider a 15 day notice before a remedy begins, such as, in the case of the denial of payment for new admissions or termination in nonimmediate jeopardy situations. Because we have no compelling reason to conclude that reducing the 15 days to 10 days or increasing the 15 days to 30 days would result in a more effective enforcement process, we are not changing this policy. However, while reviewing these comments, we realized that we did not include all of the provisions explaining when the civil money penalty can be collected. Consequently, we are adding these provisions to redesignated §488.442(a). Comment: One commenter said that a facility should not have to pay any penalty until it has fully exhausted its appeal rights, including appeals to the appropriate State or Federal court. Response: We do not accept this recommendation. We are revising redesignated §488.442(a) to make clear that the civil money penalty is collectible when a final administrative decision is issued upholding the imposition of the penalty. This position is in accordance with the intent of section 1128A(e) of the Act, as stated in the conference agreement. The conference agreement provides that no penalties will be assessed nor payment prohibited until all administrative remedies have been exhausted. (See H.R. Rept. 97&hyph;208, 97 Cong., 1st Sess. Book 2 (Conference Report) p. 950. (1981)). Comment: Many commenters supported the provision that allows the civil money penalty to be deducted from any sum then or later owing to the facility by HCFA or the State. The commenters believe that this provision is time saving and cost effective. A few commenters recommended only deducting the civil money penalty from any sum then or later owing by HCFA or the State if the penalty payment is not received in full within 30 days from the date of notification. A commenter asked if HCFA or the State will notify the facility when they plan to deduct the penalty from future monies that HCFA or the State owe the facility. Response: We appreciate the support of the commenters who agree that the amount of the penalty when determined, may be deducted from any sum then or later that HCFA or the State owe to the facility as specified in redesignated §488.442(b). This provision implements section 1128A(f) of the Act. The comments to only deduct the penalty if the facility has not paid in full within 30 days and the question about notifying a facility of a deduction are concerns that will be addressed in forthcoming manual instructions. However, a facility is not precluded from paying the civil money penalty, when it is collectible, at any time prior to the time when the penalty would be deducted from sums then or later owing to the facility. Comment: A commenter stated that HCFA and/or the State should collect the civil money penalty after all appeal rights are exhausted because the ability to deduct a civil money penalty, when determined, from any sum then or later owing, is unfair and could financially cripple the facility.
