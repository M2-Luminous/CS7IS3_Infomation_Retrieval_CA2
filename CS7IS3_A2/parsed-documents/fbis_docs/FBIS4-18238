During the term of office of the 45-year-old head of BMW, who succeeded Eberhard von Kuenheim in May 1993, the top position of the Munich corporation has been expanded further. "We are the only German automobile producers," BMW Financial Director Volker Doppelfeld said, summarizing the past business year, "that has avoided working short hours and still achieved good operation results." This is a special economic development in the crisis-torn automobile industry, which BMW head Pischetsrieder wants to continue this year. "We expect slight increases in production, sales, and yield," his cautious prediction says. Even though the international deliveries of BMW stagnated at 137,300 cars during the first quarter of 1994, the turnover of the corporation rose by 2.7 percent to 7.5 billion German marks [DM] during the same period. As a result of the acquisition of British automobile producer Rover, which was sealed a few weeks ago, the BMW corporation is growing into new dimensions: The acquisition led to doubling of the European market share to 6.4 percent. At the end of 1994, the turnover of the BMW corporation, together with the consolidated Rover group, will amount to at least DM40 billion. The assessments of the British automobile producer (turnover in 1993 was 4.3 billion pounds, sales were 442,000 vehicles), which are linked with the consolidation, are in full swing at the moment. "Rover is even better off than we originally expected," Doppelfeld says about the results of his examination. In addition, it is certain that the British BMW company, which is operating independently, can contribute a positive result. To expand its traditional position in the small-car sector (Metro, Mini) and cross-country-vehicle sector (Range Rover), BMW head Pischetsreder announced "increased investments" in the improvement of the range of models. With a total of 534,397 sold vehicles last year, the number of deliveries to customers exceeded production (532,960 units), which means that stocks were reduced. [passage omitted] Despite the difficult economic situation or the strains because of currency fluctuations, the BMW corporation shows a yield of DM16 (726) million after taxes. [passage omitted] In addition to material expenditures, it was also possible to reduce expenditures for personnel (the total number of employees all over the world went down by 3.4 percent to 71,034).
