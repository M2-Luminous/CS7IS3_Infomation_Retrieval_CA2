Ulmanis added that an official letter to NATO would also be prepared, in which the wish of the Latvian side to participate in the program will be expressed. The issue of Latvia joining NATO is, however, to be considered only in a more distant future. Ulmanis believes initial cooperation with NATO can be in the way of training and consultations. The first step toward this cooperation from the Latvian side would be working out a unified concept for material and technical supplies for the state armed structures. The cooperation program also includes the request to be very objective and loyal in the issues of human rights, which Latvia perceives with great responsibility. Ulmanis added that in the framework of the proposed partnership, it would be very important to form balanced relations with Russia.
