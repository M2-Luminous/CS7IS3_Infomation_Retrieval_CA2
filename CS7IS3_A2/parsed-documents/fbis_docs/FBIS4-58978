Concerning the security situation, the head of government has reaffirmed that the security forces are in control of all regions, despite an increase in provocative acts at times. He asserted that anything else is merely propaganda and biased interpretations. The head of government has stressed Algeria's respect for human rights and pointed out that instructions had been given to the security forces to avoid the pitfall of abuses. Replying to a question regarding what Algeria was expecting from France, Sifi said: Everything of concern to Algeria should be of concern to France. It is in the interest of France to help Algeria, because our country's problems, if not checked, will have repercussions in the Arab Maghreb and France. Once the situation stabilizes, Algeria will be one of the biggest markets for France and Europe. Concerning the Algerian expatriate community in France, the head of the government said it is possible for such a community--it is its duty--to play an important role. Our citizens should play a role in the management of the country, he added. As far as the political issues in the country are concerned, Sifi has affirmed that dialogue is continuing with Algerians, who jealously support the unity of the people and the homeland. His government has no right, however, to choose a political model for the society. Hence, it is not right for any political minority to impose its will upon others, he added.
