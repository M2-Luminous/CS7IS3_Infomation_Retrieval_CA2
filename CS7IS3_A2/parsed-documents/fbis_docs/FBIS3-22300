This greatly angers the nation. Data show nuclear power stations in South Korea dumped into the sea 142 trillion becquerels of radioactive waste materials in 1991 and 155 trillion becquerels of radioactive waste materials in 1992. The South Korean puppets dumped 11,000 trillion becquerels, or approximately 100,000 curie, into the sea in the seven years from 1986 to 1992. This is an unimaginable, grave crime that artificially destroys the ecosystem and inflicts miserable nuclear damage on the South Korean people, in addition to fellow countrymen and mankind in general. Generally speaking, radiation amounting to approximately 1.7 curie has damaged the ecosystem. It is not difficult to imagine the horrific, devastating consequences the massive nuclear waste materials, amounting to 100,000 curie that the South Korean puppets dumped into the sea, will bring to the ecosystem and the frightening catastrophes it will inflict on the South Korean people, in addition to fellow countrymen and mankind in general. As is well known, if nuclear waste materials are dumped into the sea, they will contaminate or kill fish, shells, laver, brown seaweed, and other maritime resources and, thus, inflict fatal damage on the existence of the maritime ecosystem and people. Therefore, the London Convention bans the maritime dumping of high-intensity [kojunwi] nuclear waste materials. It also stipulates that dumping of low-intensity [chojunwi] nuclear waste materials in maritime areas must be over 200 miles away from continental shores [taeryuk yonan], where fish live, and over 4,000 km deep, where there are no volcanic activities and where man will not enter even in the distant future. It also stipulates that dumping in those areas is prohibited without notifying the International Atomic Energy Agency. A decision was adopted in 1993 on completely banning maritime dumping of nuclear waste materials. The South Korean puppets' random dumping of nuclear waste materials into the sea is an unforgivable grave crime of flagrantly violating international law on respecting the natural environment and protecting maritime resources. Because of the uncouth ruling bunch, which ignores the law and destroys the environment at random, the South Korean sea is turning into a sea of death where all maritime resources are on the verge of extinction and the ecosystem and the people's existence are gravely threatened. Because of the puppet clique's reckless dumping of nuclear waste materials in the South Korean sea, many sorts of fish have disappeared, fish are killed en masse, and seaweeds are dying. Moreover, in South Korea, women who ate fish contaminated by nuclear waste materials have given birth to premature or deformed babies, numerous people suffer from cancer and other incurable diseases and unidentified diseases, and fishermen's lives have become difficult because people will not buy contaminated fish. This is none other than a crime of devastating the land where our fellow countrymen live and threatening the existence of our fellow countrymen. Our country is called a 3,000-ri land of beautiful mountains and rivers because water is clear and because the scenery is beautiful, and it is all the better to live in because the land is fertile and because maritime resources are abundant for the land is surrounded by the sea on three sides. How can Korean [Choson] people who have a national spirit tolerate this utterly unforgivable crime of turning such land into a land contaminated by nuclear waste materials where man cannot live and how can people of the world who have conscience turn a blind eye to [panggwan] this crime? The Workers' Party of Korea and all other political parties and public organizations on the northern half of the Republic sternly denounce the Kim Yong-sam ring's dumping of nuclear waste materials in the name of all fellow countrymen, describing such dumping as an antinational crime of severing the lifeline of the South Korean people and all fellow countrymen in general and of turning our country into a barren land [pulmojidae] contaminated by nuclear materials and as a flagrant violation of the international law and convention on protecting the natural environment and banning the dumping of radioactive waste materials. The South Korean puppets' dumping of nuclear waste materials is unthinkable apart from the secret maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons in South Korea. The South Korean puppets' maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons which started in the early seventies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella have reached a very grave stage today. The puppets raise our nonexistent nuclear issue and viciously conduct an anti-Republic smear campaign. One of the reasons for this is to divert attention at home and abroad to the North and accelerate their maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons. Traitor [yokto] Kim Yong-sam himself told a news conference on the first anniversary of his inauguration a few days ago that the North has no nuclear weapons. In this way, he himself admitted that their anti- North nuclear commotions were a false smear campaign to harm their fellow countrymen and hide the truth of their nuclear development. Even while pursuing nuclear development, the Kim Yong-sam ring babbles about even military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] against someone else. Because it is so mean and shameless, the Kim Yong-sam ring unhesitatingly dumps nuclear waste materials, an antinational act against humanity [pan illyu chogin]. Even after running amok in toadyism, treachery, fascism, anti- North confrontation, and divisionist maneuvers, traitor Kim Yong-sam even kicks up maneuvers to dump nuclear waste materials. If traitor Kim Yong-sam is left intact, no one can expect independence and democracy in South Korean society or peace in the country and its peaceful reunification, and our fellow countrymen will not be able to escape from the danger of nuclear disasters [haekchenan]. The South Korean ruling bunch must immediately disclose its past dumping of nuclear waste materials and apologize to all fellow countrymen. If the South Korean authorities continue dumping nuclear waste materials and secretly pursue nuclear development, they will not be able to escape from the stern judgment of all fellow countrymen and history. It is the South Korean people who will suffer the greatest damage from the nuclear waste materials that have flowed into the South Korean sea and who will be sacrificed first. The South Korean people must wage a popular struggle against the puppet ruling bunch's dumping of nuclear waste materials and develop this struggle into an anti-U.S. and antigovernment struggle by closely linking it to the antiwar and antinuclear struggle. The South Korean ruling bunch's maneuvers to dump nuclear waste materials are a crime against humanity [panillyujogin pomjoe haengwi], which harms not only our fellow countrymen but also countries in our vicinity and various regions in Asia and the world. On this opportunity, we expect that political parties and organizations of various countries of the world, international organizations, and people of all countries that love peace and aspire for social justice and progress will pay due attention to the South Korean ruling bunch's maneuvers to dump nuclear waste materials, raise their voices against such maneuvers, and take appropriate measures to stop them.
