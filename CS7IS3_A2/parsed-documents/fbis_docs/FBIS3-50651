"Only a sincere understanding on the essential, the first step toward an indispensable union, can save the country," the general noted adding that "this understanding must be the result of ample dialogue." "It is essential for it to be a national debate. The country must question itself, its future. It must find solutions for the structural problems that are obstructing the evolution of society and the free play of democratic institutions," Cedras said. "By losing brotherhood, all that is left for us is division, hatred, and violence," he stated, adding that "1994 will be decisive for our country."
