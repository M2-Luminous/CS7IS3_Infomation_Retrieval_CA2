Addressing a news conference after meeting visiting Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and a day before crucial talks with Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Mr Mandela repeated he will press ahead with efforts to bring boycotters into the election process. But he made it clear that his crusade would rest on two main considerations. "That the date set for the elections will under no circumstances be postponed and secondly that... the sovereignty of South Africa as a united nation must under no circumstances be violated." Mr Mandela was apparently referring to demands for self-determinatioon and for a volkstaat [homeland] by the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and rightwing political groups. The IFP is also reported to to have started moves for the election to be postponed in kwaZulu/Natal. "Within that framework I am prepared to spend the rest of my days in an attempt to persuade every South African leader to join us," Mr Mandela said. Asked whether he was optimistic about his meeting with Mr Buthelezi on Tuesday, Mr Mandela said dialogue was the ANC's weapon which it would employ to sway groups bent on shuning the process. "I approach every problem with optimism, because dialogue is one of the most important weapons that we command," he said after meeting Mr Lubbers. Touching on political violence, Mr Mandela said it was a duty of all South Africans to address the issue of violence to create a proper environment for investment. The violence was creating conditions where it was difficult to predict the economic or political situation. The ANC leader also said his organsiation was making progress in talks with rightwing organisations. He did not elaborate, but has repeatedly said in the past that the ANC will not cave in to demands for a volkstaat. Mr Lubbers said he hoped ties between South Africa and his country, which gave the ANC substantial financial and moral support during its 30 years of anti-partheid struggle, will be closer in the future. Mr Mandela said Holland was one of the countries to throw their weight behind the ANC campaign "in the most difficult time in our struggle".
