A brand new "President Demirel" has supplanted the former Demirel, who was a fault-finder, prejudiced, and had a passion for trivia. This new brand of Demirel, who has supplanted Suleyman Bey, is no longer looking at events on a daily basis. He also gives the impression that he is sorry about certain things he said in the past. Furthermore, we have a Demirel who, if not a replica of the late Ozal, makes us not miss the latter. In protecting Turkey's interests, Demirel commands an excellent assessment and grasp of its rights as regards its neighbors and of the international situation. President Demirel has clearly identified his country's internal and external enemies. He realizes that Turkey is located in a very dangerous zone, and he is capable of making a serious assessment of the instability in this zone. Among Demirel's ideas is the desire to live in peace with our neighbors and the world within the existing national borders, but he is also the first among those who know that this is not, and will not be, at all easy. Just like Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures, Demirel too knew from the very start that "Russia is a threat," and he is not afraid to state this openly. Again, none but Demirel can assess Greece's position so well. Demirel, who is deeply concerned that Turkey is virtually encircled, is making calculations on how to coexist in this delicate situation. Vigilance and care not to get involved in a "hot" entanglement have become Demirel's preoccupation. As a journalist covering Demirel's visit to Poland, Egypt, and Ukraine since he became president, I felt the excitement of discovering these concerns. Truly, President Demirel sees to it that Turkey does not get involved in clashes and does not suffer injustice. Notwithstanding his "balanced" statements and behavior, he is seeking new friendships and strategies. Demirel's worries are prompting the search for ways out the situation and long-term political investments. The visit to Ukraine and Moldova was the product of such a thinking.
