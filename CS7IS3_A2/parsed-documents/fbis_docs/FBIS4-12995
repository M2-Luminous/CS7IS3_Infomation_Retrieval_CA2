FBIS4-12995 "drnes073_l_94014" FBIS-NES-94-073 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Russia Notifies State of Arms Sale to Syria Russia Notifies State of Arms Sale to Syria TA1304182094 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 13 Apr 94 pp A1, A10 TA1304182094 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] [Excerpt] Russia has decided to renew its arms sales to Syria, and the two countries will sign a large $500-million arms deal in the near future. For the first time, Russia has informed Israel in advance of its intention to sign a new arms deal with Syria but did not specify the type of weapons covered by the transaction or the timetable of the weapons' delivery. Moscow recently informed Jerusalem of the expected deal through diplomatic channels. According to the report, Russia has agreed to reschedule Damascus' $7-billion debt to the former Soviet Union, which was given as credit to finance previous arms purchases. After Syria makes the first payment of $2 billion to Russia, the two countries will sign a new arms deal. Until now, Syria's huge debts were an obstacle to relations between Damascus and Moscow. For a long time the Syrians refused to discuss returning the money, claiming that Russia was not the sole heir to the former Soviet Union. Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad has recently recognized Russia as the sole creditor for outstanding debts and agreed to discuss resolving the problem. In their message to Jerusalem, the Russians asserted that Moscow was still playing a marginal role in superpower arm sales to the Middle East, especially in comparison to the United States. The Russians also noted that Israel was selling weapons to the former Soviet republics bordering on Russia, such as Estonia, much to the displeasure of Moscow, which fears that these weapons may in future be turned against the Russian Army or Russian minorities in the republic. According to reports which recently reached Israel from other sources, Syria is deliberately putting off its arms purchases from Russia in order to pressure Moscow to write off most of Syria's debt and settle for one payment of $2 billion. According to these reports, the Syrians hope that the economic crisis in Russia will force Moscow to write off their debt in order to supply work to the Russian arms industries. It was recently reported that Syria seeks to purchase sophisticated SA-10 anti-aircraft missiles and new fighter jets from Russia. Officials in Jerusalem have still not decided how to react to the reports on the new arms deal between Syria and Russia. Senior political sources yesterday said that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin may discuss the Russian arms sales to the Middle East when he visits Moscow at the end of the month and meets Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Relations between Syria and the United States have become tense over recent weeks. Christopher Ross, the American ambassador to Syria, held an especially tough meeting, focusing on the continuing terrorist attacks in Lebanon, with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. Information reaching Jerusalem indicates that the tension in U.S.-Syrian relations was the main reason for al-Asad's trip to Egypt last week to meet Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. Al-Asad expressed his deep disappointment with U.S. promises to improve relations with Syria, especially with regard to removing Syria from the list of countries sponsoring terrorism and the drug trade. The Administration recently decided to leave Syria on "the drug list" despite an earlier promise to remove the Syrians from the list. [passage omitted]
