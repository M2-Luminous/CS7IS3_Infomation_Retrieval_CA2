According to the correspondent who quotes Colonel Claudel Josaphat, military commander of the northern department, the soldiers seized weapons, including a 40 MM grenade launcher, an AR-15 rifle, a Parabellum 9 MM pistol, explosives, and ammunition. The military sustained no dead. A soldier was shot in the foot under circumstances not yet clarified. The armed followers were led by Marc Lamour, who served as Constituent Assembly member in 1987. He was also deputy delegate for the region during the mandate of Father Aristide in Haiti. The same source added that this operation was prompted by an attack by two Marc Lamour followers on a military post at Petit Bourg du Borgne (50 km west of Cap-Haitien) on the evening of 7 April. Several people were arrested in Borgne and in the neighboring towns of Port Margot and Limbe. Among them was Borgne Mayor Belizaire Fils-Aime, who was arrested on 8 April for crimes against state security. The OAS-UN international civilian mission and the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince expressed concern for Fils-Aime and his family. On 27 April, a reliable source from Cap-Haitien confirmed to AFP over the telephone that three trucks loaded with soldiers returned on 26 April after carrying out operations over the weekend in the rural area of Bassin Caiman, a cavernous region north of Petit Bourg du Borgne. The soldiers combed the area after firing mortars at a cavernous area of about two square km where the presence of armed men had been reported. The source was unable to determine the death toll. The Haitian Army accused Aristide of initiating an armed operation known as "Operation Cut Iron" to "destabilize the state" since he delivered a speech in Creole in early 1994 from the United States. In the speech, Aristide extolled Jean-Jacques Dessalines, author of the 1804 Haitian independence and the slogan "Coupe tetes, brule cayes" (cut off heads, burn houses) that was used against French expeditioneers of that time. Aristide spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau denied this charge. Speaking from Washington to Haitian stations over the telephone, Martineau pointed out that the military is trying to blame others for its own "crimes." Members of the OAS-UN civilian mission had planned to travel to Borgne and Gonaives on 27 April, where 28 people, according to the most recent estimates, died on 22 April during a police operation in the low-income neighborhood of Raboteau.
