FR941102-0-00009 FR941102-0-00004 Definitions (Section 16.2) The proposal cross-referenced a number of definitions in the Securities Act. One such definition was the Securities Act definition of ``underwriter.'' The proposal's cross-reference to the ``underwriter'' definition brought sales of stock by control persons and affiliates within the coverage of part 16. The former version of part 16 had covered those sales as indirect sales by a bank. By adopting the Securities Act underwriter definition, the proposal clarified the coverage of part 16. The final rule adopts the cross-reference to the definition of ``underwriter'' as proposed. The proposal also defined ``security'' to conform with the definition in the Securities Act. The proposed definition was more detailed than the definition in the former part 16, specifying that all bank debt, not just debt subordinated to the claims of general creditors was considered a security. The definition in the former part 16 was unclear as to what debt instruments were covered. The OCC received six comments on this issue. One commenter favored specifically covering senior debt in the definition while five commenters were opposed. Several commenters also stated that the definition of ``security'' should exclude specific traditional bank products and deposits. The final rule includes a cross-reference to the Securities Act definition of ``security.'' That definition clearly includes senior debt. While a number of banks interpreted the definition of ``security'' in the former part 16 as excluding senior debt and opposed a change in the definition that they viewed as expanding the coverage of part 16, the OCC believes there is no reason to treat senior debt differently from subordinated debt for purposes of this definition. Purchasers of both types of debt should receive the information necessary to make informed investment decisions. In fact, the passage of the depositor preference provisions of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 (12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(11)) has strengthened the need for purchasers of senior debt to receive disclosure materials. The depositor preference provisions require the FDIC to pay the claims of uninsured depositors prior to paying the claims of any other general creditors of a bank. Senior debt, therefore, is not equivalent to uninsured deposits. Purchasers of senior debt now are less likely than they were prior to the passage of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act to receive full payment in the event of a bank's insolvency. The definition of ``security'' in the final rule does not specifically exclude traditional bank products. Nevertheless, the OCC does not intend that the definition cover insured or uninsured deposits or other traditional bank products, including letters of credit, banker's acceptances, or repurchase agreements. Judicial precedents have generally found these instruments not to be securities. Providing an exhaustive list of exceptions in the definition of ``security'' would be unwieldy and detract from the benefits of cross-referencing the SEC definition. Registration Statement and Prospectus Requirements (Section 16.3) Section 16.3 of the proposal set forth the general prohibitions on offers and sales of bank securities. Under the proposal, no person could offer or sell bank securities unless a registration statement for the securities had been filed with and declared effective by the OCC and the offer or sale was accompanied or preceded by a prospectus filed as a part of that registration statement, or an exemption was available under part 16. The OCC would keep on file and make available for public inspection the information that was included in the registration statement but not included in the prospectus provided to shareholders.
