These funding measures, which are specially tailored to the needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs], were launched back in 1990 and 1991 and have already achieved initial positive results in terms of the stabilization of industrial research in the new federal laender. The [word omitted in original] of industrial research in the new federal laender was primarily up to private industry, stressed Federal Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger, although the radical changes that the new laender were currently undergoing necessitated a substantial commitment on the part of the state over a transitional period. The three special measures concerned consist in: 1. Funding for R&D Staff Expansion SME's receive subsidies equivalent to 50 percent of the salaries of scientists and engineers newly recruited to set up or expand their in-house R&D capability. Since 1990, 932 mainly small, innovative businesses have been funded to the tune of 45 million German marks [DM], making it possible to secure 2,800 industrial research jobs. The deadline for applications for inclusion in this measure has been extended to 31 December 1995. 2. Contract Research East Also since 1990, SME's have been receiving 50-percent subsidies when they award R&D contracts to specialized R&D contractors in Germany and abroad. This offer of funding has to date been taken up by 863 businesses for 1,273 R&D contracts. Subsidies totaling DM110.4 million have thus set contracts for an overall value of DM225 million in motion. 3. Contract Research West-East This measure supports research facilities and firms that obtain R&D contracts from elsewhere, in particular from the original federal laender and eastern Europe, with 35- to 40-percent subsidies. The rate of take-up is particularly brisk, and the trend is extremely satisfactory. The measure helps the research facilities in the new federal laender to adapt to market requirements. Since 1991, 485 facilities have taken advantage of this program to win a total of 1,024 R&D contracts for an overall value of DM208 million, the BMFT [Federal Ministry of Research and Technology] share amounting to DM80.8 million. Between them, these two varieties of contract research contributed to the preservation of about 2,000 jobs in industry-oriented research in 1993. The deadline for applications for inclusion under these two measures has been extended to 31 December 1994, after which firms may apply to the nationwide "Joint Research in the SME Economy" program, which has recently been relaunched by the BMFT and, if initial impressions are anything to go by, is really gathering momentum.
