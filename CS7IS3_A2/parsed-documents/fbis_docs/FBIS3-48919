The bulk of the acts amend existing ones. MP's failed to update social legislation. Parliament also passed a package of the following acts: Tax Proceedings Act, Tax Administration Act, Value Added Tax Act. Their passing by mid-1993 deprived the exchequer of large revenues, the Finance Ministry claims. The restructuring of bad credits into a state debt was also stalled. Parliament passed it at the end of December. Parliament also passed several agriculture-related acts on 1993 agriculture financial backup and on 1993/1994 autumn and spring agriculture activities financial backup. Tobacco and Tobacco Products Act was among the most important tobacco-related acts. Tobacco producers protests continued despite their passing. MP's also passed the National Police Act at the end of the year on the structure and activity of one of the Interior Ministry sectors. A bill on the Structure of the Legal System was not passed. Debates on the bills often grew into continuous political disputes: During the debate on the 1993 Budget Act (introduced in late April and passed in early June) during its updating increasing budget deficit by 5,470 million leva, during a debate on a bill amending the Supreme Judicial Council Act (passed at first reading), which, to quote MP's from the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), aimed to remove Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev and Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov from their posts. MP's had a three-week debate on a SDS MP's proposal on declassifying MP's and senior state officials' files. Sometimes the National Assembly would pass important acts and decisions in the very last days preceding parliamentary recess. This was the case with the declaration on Bulgaria's relations with NATO passed in late December. In August MP's even cut short their summer recess at the request of the prime minister to pass the Amendments to the Turnover Tax and Excise Duty Act. Over the past year MP's ratified a number of bilateral agreements: with France, Moldova, Ukraine, Italy, Kazakhstan, Albania and Poland. Parliament gave the cabinet term to negotiate and sign lending agreements with different foreign banks. This year saw the ratification of bilateral agreements on consolidation and rescheduling of Bulgaria's foreign debt to the creditors of the Paris Club. The cabinet was given term to negotiate this country's foreign debt to the commercial creditor banks. A special sitting of parliament in February commemorate the 50th anniversary of the deliverance of Bulgarian Jews and the death of the Jews from Macedonia and Aegean Thrace in the Nazi death camps. The sitting was addressed by Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev and Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss. Italian President Luigi Scalfaro, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Chairman Miguel Martines and North Atlantic Assembly Chairman Louic Bouvard also addressed the Bulgarian Parliament during their visits to this country.
