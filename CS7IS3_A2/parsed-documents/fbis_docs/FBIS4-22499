However, as the results of the Commission for Operational Management meeting held yesterday testify, the poor coordination of the work of the appropriate departments is leading to even those decisions, whose adoption served as an occasion for government resignations, not being implemented. The government's examination of questions concerning preparations for the spring sowing is just as traditional and inevitable as the greeting of the new year. The ritual during the examination of these questions has not changed for years -- the representatives of the agrarians complain about the acute shortage of fuel (this year, almost twofold less than last year has been prepared), tractors (62,000 fewer), seeds, and -- what is the main thing -- money. In accordance with the government's decree adopted in January for financing Russian agriculture, approximately 5 trillion rubles should be allotted for the spring sowing. However, only about 800 billion rubles had been provided by 1 March. In connection with this, the meeting participants recalled last year with great warmth. Then, the majority of fuel and mineral fertilizer deliveries were carried out without any mandatory prepayments by order of the prime minister (as a result of this, the agrarians still owe mineral fertilizer producers 100 billion rubles). Nevertheless, in the words of Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukh, it is possible that the second part of the money -- almost 1.3 trillion rubles -- will begin to arrive in the accounts of the agrarians this week. Moreover, he expects the repayment of the debts of agroproduct consumers to amount to 2 trillion rubles; true, the hopes among the agrarians for its repayment are rather weak -- probably because they themselves are not noted for strict financial discipline: Of the credits supplied last year, they returned only 25 percent (another 60 percent, or 1.5 trillion rubles of credits, was postponed to this year). Yesterday, the members of the commission did not confine themselves only to "seasonal work": One can view the discussion of the Federal Energy Commission question as an element in the strategic planning of the government's activity. Traditionally, this is a weak spot in Viktor Chernomyrdin's Cabinet. Not only the fact that Russian industrialists consider the existing tariffs (the main subject of the Federal Energy Commission's activity) extremely high but also the fact that the inter-relationship mechanism between the Federal Economic Commission and the producers of electrical energy can be a model for developing a mechanism to regulate the activity of natural and state monopolies, in general, explain the economic significance of this question. In this connection, the discussion about the commission's personnel composition (Aleksandr Shokhin was appointed chairman) and functions, which was begun by Yuriy Shafranik, minister of fuel and energy, but immediately suppressed by the presiding Oleg Soskovets, is extremely symptomatic. Oleg Soskovets' desire to reduce the influence of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy on the decisions adopted by a state (and not public, as now) commission is completely justified -- otherwise, the present situation in the pricing of electrical energy, where the interests of the power workers and not those of the industrialists have paramount importance, could be reproduced even with the new statute for the commission. Moreover, Shokhin, who is more loyal to the first vice-premier, along with developing a concept for controlling energy prices, "will not forget" the question of favorable rates for individual enterprises in metallurgy and transport. The third question on the agenda of yesterday's meeting was increasing the volume of export quotas for 1994. For more details about this, see the article on this same page.
