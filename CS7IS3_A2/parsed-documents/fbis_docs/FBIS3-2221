Wei returned to the Chinese capital late Saturday and "went to sleep very late" at his brother's house, the relative said by telephone, but declined to give details of his ordeal. The dissident, who had been released from prison on September 14 just six months short of a 15-year term, was picked up by police early Friday and taken to a state guest house on the northeastern outskirts of the capital. He telephoned friends at 12:20 p.m. (0800 GMT) Saturday to say his interrogation had finished and that he would return home later that day. [passage omitted]
