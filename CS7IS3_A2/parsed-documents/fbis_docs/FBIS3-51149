[Begin Cervini recording] Measures, such as price controls, just seek to please the people for the time being. If there was really a serious interest in controlling prices, the correct thing to do would have been to regulate bank interests as well as the costs of electricity, telephones, and transportation. In addition, measures should have been taken to control the prices businessmen pay for Central Bank bonds, and this would then lead to a just control of prices. What is being done now will bring negative consequences for the national producers. The measure is strictly to please the people, but it is not being handled properly. [end recording]
