Bai Enpei, deputy secretary of the regional party committee; and Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the regional government, accompanied Wang Qun to conduct the investigation and study in Ulanqab League. They successively investigated Liangcheng, several townships, households engaged in breeding industry, and key enterprises; and inspected, on the spot, the construction of the three-mu farmland projects, the development of the socialized service system, the coordination of cropping, breeding, and processing industries, the processing of farm and sideline products, and the circulation and marketing situation. They heard the reports made by responsible persons of 15 townships and held talks with some grass-roots cadres on the issues of developing high-efficient agriculture and readjusting the industrial structure. They also went deep to the peasant households to hold heart-to-heart talks with the peasants; to ask, in detail, about their production, living, and income situation; and to solicit the opinions from the grass-roots cadres and the peasants. They encouraged that in the new year, the people should make persistent efforts to make new achievements and make new headway. During the investigation and study tour, Wang Qun pointed out: Accelerating the pace of emancipating the mind and quickening the development of agriculture and animal husbandry is the principle for guiding the urban and pastoral areas' 1994 economic work. The setup of a perfect socialist market economic system as set forth at the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee has provided us with the best opportunity to accelerate the pace of emancipating the mind and the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. This is the best external condition. The readjustment of farm and livestock product prices will bring about gigantic benefits to the peasants and the herdsmen. However, we must notice that our internal factors have gigantic potential. To further accelerate the agricultural and livestock development, we should first accelerate the pace of linking agriculture with animal husbandry. We have many typical examples in this regard. All this has provided us with beneficial experiences. We must cherish and pay attention to these experiences. So long as we handle affairs according to the market law will we be able to make acceleration in these two aspects and satisfy the people. Wang Qun also pointed out: Our region has appropriately improved the agricultural production. Particularly, the construction of farmland water conservation projects, the setup of the scientific and technological service system, the cultivation of skilled persons, and the setup of the market system have helped lay a better foundation for agricultural production. How shall we be able to step onto a new stage? We should [words indistinct] to create high efficiency and high economic results. That is, we should take the path of developing high-yield, high-efficient, and good-quality agriculture. First of all, it is necessary to readjust the structures within agriculture, including the cropping structure, the cropping-breeding-processing structure, and the trade-industry- agriculture structure. It is necessary to plant crops according to market demands and to develop the crops with good economic results. The readjustment pace should be accelerated and the dynamics of readjustment should be expanded. So long as the agricultural structure is reasonably readjusted will we be able to take the path of favorable cycle. Second, the pace of transforming cropping, breeding, and processing industries should be accelerated. We must clearly notice that the key to developing agriculture hinges on transformation, the potential is changing, and the efficiency is changing. Only when we firmly grasp the link of transforming cropping, breeding, and processing industries will we be able to take the path of becoming rich as soon as possible. Wang Qun particularly stressed: The party and government departments at various levels, particularly banners, counties, towns and townships, and sumu, should accelerate the changes of functions, strengthen the service for the people's life, and streamline [words indistinct]. The personnel divorced from departments are allowed to engage in economic entities. Production should vigorously be developed and a large number of cadres should be transferred from their work posts. The broad masses of cadres should bring into play their wisdom and intelligence in the rural socialized service. This is a need for organizational reform as well as a need for deepening the rural reform. According to the actual conditions, all localities should work out [words indistinct] policies suitable to themselves. In regard to the issue of setting up a town and township overall service system, Wang Qun pointed out: The overall service stations of towns and townships are a key link of the overall socialized service system. This link has the connection between markets and households. So, we should bring into full play the functions of this link. We should conscientiously solve the problems relating to the service stations; particularly work out some preferential policies toward them, including distribution and taxation policies; simultaneously strengthen the leadership over them; and [words indistinct]. Bai Enpei and Yun Bulong also made specific opinions on positively guiding the peasants to enter the markets.
