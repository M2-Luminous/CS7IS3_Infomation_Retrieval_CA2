Children of our mujahid Arab nation; children of Iraq and Palestine; O Arab strugglers, children of the Ba'th Party: The massacre at the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque adds yet another tragic, bleeding event to the Arabs' wounds in Palestine, the Arab homeland, and the Muslim world. This was a major wound to dignity that reminds us of the burning of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. It reminds us of the unseen reasons behind it, warns us against its serious consequences, specifies the disease in the body of the nation, and reveals a painful and depressing defect in Arab reactions and the contradiction that continues to expand between the true substance of the nation and its current reality. The picture of this event -- the picture of worshipers at dawn prayer, kneeling to Allah in the mihrab of Ibrahim [Abraham] -- has entered into the mind of the Arab people and the Muslim peoples as a clear embodiment of the true nature of the Zionist entity, the deep wound in the Arab and Muslim realities, and the dimensions of the conspiracy against the Arab nation's future. Such an event symbolizes the substantive meanings that reveal the nature and full dimensions of the challenge, which cannot be dealt with from a classical view or through an immediate reaction. It requires a daring, thorough thought about one's self and the event. Those who are today voicing denunciations and condemnations and showing outrage, as well as those who pretend to have been outraged, should not only express pain and outrage. They should ask the basic question: Why was Palestine usurped? The Ibrahimi Mosque event must make Arabs ask this question again. It should make them raise their political analyses to a level that goes beyond the logic of the regimes that have given in to negative realities and circumstances and to the schemes of enemies that made the Arab conditions reach such a position. Such a major event combines the meanings and images that remind us of the origins of the Palestinian and Arab national and pan-Arab tragedies and the conspiracy against the Arab nation's future and destiny. Therefore, emphasizing the substantive meanings of the Ibrahimi Mosque event and turning these feelings into mature action and a (noble?) view of a genuine strategy to face current challenges is the sound way to deal with this bloody event, in which a new group of Palestinian martyrs joined the caravan of Arab struggle. O valiant sons of Arabism: The massacre of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque raises several significant questions. The bloody incident raises the question of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It reasserts its new dimensions, which were absent from the plans of those who are working to resolve the Palestine question and those who are running after crumbs of humiliation and unfair solutions. These solutions hold an arrogant, usurping criminal to be the same as a victim whose self-defense capability, existence, rights, and destiny are restrained by Western powers and Zionism. This horrible massacre brings into question anew the root of the problem, namely, the Zionist occupation. It exposes old and new Western intentions to encroach on the Arab nation's rights to progress by continuing a colonialist policy that is permeated with a Zionist spirit bearing grudges against Arabism and Islam. The new massacre raises anew the question about the real role of the Zionist entity, a role that manifests itself in this barbarous example of terror and collective killing, a role that holds all values in contempt and whose only aim is to hamper the Arab nation's cultural and human progress. It embodies an example of the cultural degeneration that is revealed if we compare the scene of the worshipers, portraying the meaning of human faith, and the scene of Zionist treachery that depicts Zionism's racist nature as well as the hatred and rancor imbibed by Zionist generations who have made their first aim annihilating the Arabs. Thus, the grave incident portrays the contradiction between the line of the capitulationist settlement on the one hand and the real nature of the Zionist enemy and the real dimension of the Arab-Israeli struggle on the other, shedding light on plans and schemes aimed at opening the door for transforming the Arab region into a graveyard of its own history and people's rights and wiping out its national identity and the aspirations of its masses. The characteristics of jihad as manifested in the Mother of Battles have thus reasserted their values, strengthened their principled logic, and renewed the nation's confidence in facing he challenges, no matter how great and immense they may be. The Ibrahimi Mosque incident might have been just a new wound in the nation's body had it not been for the spirit of jihad released by the Mother of Battles which saved this body from being totally paralyzed, opening new horizons for the Arab struggle and making clear what is possible and what is not possible in light of the clarity of the nation's substance, the level of deception in it and the exposure of the deceivers and the great distance that separates them from the line of the mujahidin. O free Palestinians and Arabs. The factors of the current Palestinian, Arab, and international situation are interacting to express the nation's substance and cultural struggle in facing the aggressive Western colonialist policies and Zionism's fascist, racist, domineering, and expansionist nature. The Mother of Battles opened the door for a new phase of mass struggle. Therefore, despite its grave and disastrous nature, the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre brought a new powerful shock to the nation and released the anger of the broad masses in the Arab homeland against the settlement scheme to liquidate the Palestinian cause. It reaffirmed the truthfulness of the Mother of Battle's principled stand of jihad in expressing the nation's dignity, honor, and the future of Palestine and Arabism. The time has come for a discussion in this spirit by the nation's free men in a pan-Arab program, and for emphasizing the pan-Arab nature of the battle for a comprehensive mass confrontation of the Zionist challenge and the capitulationist settlement line. Now that our Palestinian people have given their opinion on all the capitulationist formulas, the nation is motivated to take care of its central cause and to effect a program of struggle that is farsighted and carefully wrought, which will transform the revenge for the martyrs blood into profound motives for entrenching the principled stand for the sake of liberation, for strengthening the spirit of jihad and the struggle for unity, and for raising the confrontation to a new and advanced level on the road to liberation and to the realization of pan-Arab aims. The Ibrahimi Mosque incident reveals to those who had believed that the Gaza-Jericho agreement had ended the Arab-Zionist struggle and placed the Palestinian cause on the brink of liquidation that they are deceiving themselves. This is because this illusion presents a superficial, unrealistic view of the nature of the struggle and an incorrect picture of the nature of the enemy. To attach new traits to the Zionist enemy that do not match its nature is a matter of theorization in order to justify the retreat from the real principled stand and the correct revolutionary concept of the nation's resources. The unprincipled agreements, no matter under what names and regardless of their descriptions, are an abandonment of the substance of the nation and the understanding of the enemy's nature. The chaste blood shed at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the betrayed blood that will be added to the rivers of blood in Palestine and the Arab arenas of struggle, coupled with the pain twisting in our hearts as a nation facing immense dangers, call upon us to reconsider and contemplate, stop this capitulationist policy and restore the principled awareness that binds our nationalist stands in various arenas. Foremost of these arenas is the one in which the nation expressed its historic readiness to confront the challenges besieging us and the capitulationist schemes that contradict our real nature as a mujahid nation capable of steadfastness in the face of this barbarous and evil aggression, which assumed the most terrible dimension during the 30-state aggression against Iraq and the most treacherous and grotesque picture in the attack on the Ibrahimi Mosque and the worshipping faithful during the month of Ramadan, the symbol of peace and Islam. The incident reveals the enemy's brutality in the face of the humane Arabism and its contemporary cultural endeavor. Children of Arabism and Islam: Adhering to the principled course constitutes the boat of survival for the nation. If the struggling Arab forces are incapable of engaging in equal, decisive battles under the current pan-Arab circumstances, this does not absolve them from standing fast and harassing the enemies in order to confuse their plans and weaken their resources and morale, until the day when conditions for decisive battles become available. Introducing the criteria for what is correct and what is biased in the current positions is one of the most important requirements for struggle and jihad in this circumstance. Therefore, despite the seeming disequilibrium in the balance of forces in favor of the imperialist and Zionist camp, the Ibrahimi Mosque crime reveals the bankruptcy of Zionist methods in the face of Arab resistance to occupation and usurpation. It confirms the ability of the militant Arab forces to stand fast and resist as long as they abide by the principled course, which sticks to national and pan-Arab rights, as the realistic, genuine course that understands the nature of the decisive, cultural conflict the nation is fighting in defense of its right to life and renaissance. Consequently, the spirit of resistance, the spirit of the Mother of Battles and the stone-throwing heroes, must be maintained. It must continue in the nation and must expand, be entrenched, and spread in the greater Arab homeland because this spirit will decide the final outcome of the conflict and the cultural and humanitarian meanings of the national and pan-Arab liberation struggle. Arabs may not be able to regain all of their rights now. However, by maintaining their principled positions and honor, they can guarantee the future and create new militant formulas by siding with the masses to revive militant and jihad popular action in national and pan-Arab life and transform emerging events, regardless of how great their challenges may be, and threats and pains into futuristic phenomena and steady steps on the path of the future, which the nation and its sacrifices are worthy of. If you aid God, he will aid you. [part of a Koranic verse] Long live Palestine, free and Arab; Long live the struggle of the people of Palestine and the stone-throwing children; Long live the principled, jihad confrontation in the Mother of Battles; Long live the mujahid people of Iraq; Long live the nation of the Arabs, free and glorious.
