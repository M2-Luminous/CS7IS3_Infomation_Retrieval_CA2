Pangalos, chairman of the EU's Council of Foreign Ministers, said they had failed to overcome a dispute over a change in the balance of power if Austria, Finland, Sweden and possibly Norway are admitted in 1995. The issue is threatening to wreck the chances that the four countries will be able to join the Union. Pangalos said he would turn the matter over to EU heads of state and government if the foreign ministers failed at another attempt to resolve the dispute on Tuesday. Italy on Monday joined Britain and Spain in insisting that the entry of the three or four newcomers should not affect the ability of a small number of countries to block controversial decisions. The Greek minister added that there had been no progress in a dispute between Norway and Spain which is blocking the Norwegians' entry into the Union. Spain is trying to gain catch quotas for Norwegian cod as part of the price for Norway's membership of the EU, a price which Oslo is steadfastly refusing to pay. The European Union agreed with Austria, Finland and Sweden last week on their terms of entry, a decision which will have little effect if the enlargement process is torpedoed by the voting quarrel.
