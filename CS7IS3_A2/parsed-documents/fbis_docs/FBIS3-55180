This is served by the edict "On Additional Guarantees of the Right of Citizens to Information," which ITAR-TASS received yesterday. The president has entrusted the Legislative Proposals Commission with preparing a draft law "On the Right to Information," which will be submitted to parliament as a priority legislative initiative. Pending the adoption of such a law, the edict establishes the responsibilities of state organs, organizations and enterprises, public associations, and officials in ensuring information openness. In particular, it guarantees the accessibility of information which is of public interest or affects citizens' personal interests. The essence of state organs' decisions will be explained more extensively on radio and television. One of the points in the edict particularly stipulates that the activities of federal organs of legislative, executive, and judicial power are given equal coverage in programs. By means of another edict Boris Yeltsin has decided to form the Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes under the Russian Federation president on the basis of the Information Arbitration Court which operated during the period of preparation for the parliamentary elections. The edict, which ITAR-TASS also received yesterday, states that the main functions of the Judicial Chamber are to assist the president in defending rights and freedoms in the mass information sphere; to ensure the objective and reliable nature of reports; to ensure the principle of equality of rights in the mass information sphere; to ensure protection of the moral interests of children and young people in the mass media; to ensure pluralism in news and sociopolitical television and radio programs; and a number of other tasks. Anatoliy Vengerov has been appointed chairman of the Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes.
