FR940617-0-00146 FR940617-0-00026 To maintain acceptable performance throughout the engine speed band, some manufacturers commented that they will choose to use waste-gate technology in lieu of smoke limiters on some of their engine models. These manufacturers stated that, for their engine designs, applying a smoke limiter to control smoke could cause a performance discontinuity that could present a safety concern under certain operating conditions. While the cost of waste-gate technology was not accounted for in EPA's proposed cost impact, the Agency believes it is reasonable for manufacturers to use a costlier solution in those cases where there is a potential performance or safety impact. EPA estimates that half of the turbocharged engines could be fitted with this technology. That represents approximately 30 percent of all engines covered by this rule with a parallel 30 percent reduction in use of smoke limiter technology. Based on average per piece cost figures submitted by manufacturers, EPA has calculated that the addition of waste-gate technology in the technology mix would result in a per engine weighted hardware cost increase of approximately $35 per engine, while the weighted cost due to use of smoke limiter technology will be revised to $3 per engine. EPA also assumed in its estimate of hardware cost that there would be little or no cost involved with upgrading fuel pumps to increased injection pressures (as opposed to changing pump type, rotary to in-line, in-line to unit injector). During the comment period, manufacturers provided concrete evidence that there is a significant cost increment to increasing injection pressures. Based on manufacturers' data an average weighted cost of $73 per engine will be assessed to account for modifications that will allow in-line fuel pumps and unit fuel injection systems to accommodate incremental increases in injection pressure. Manufacturers also provided information on additional hardware costs. Electronic control systems and low sac fuel injectors were two strategies mentioned. While electronic control will reduce NO X emission, EPA maintains that is not the most cost effective method to meet the requirements of this rule. A number of marketing and performance reasons unrelated to emission performance, such as fuel economy and versatility, make such strategies attractive to manufacturers. These reasons in and of themselves may cause manufacturers to convert a portion of their fleets to electronic controls. Because EPA's cost estimate is based on the necessary cost to meet this rule and to maintain current performance and fuel economy characteristics, the extra cost incurred by a manufacturer to install electronic control will not be added to EPA cost estimates. Similarly, manufacturers requested that EPA include the cost of low sac injectors. Low sac injectors are an effective HC control strategy. However, EPA's proposal did not contain HC standards, and the HC standard adopted in the final rule can be expected to do no better than cap the current HC levels. Furthermore, EPA requested that manufacturers provide information on the cost ramifications of adopting additional standards. Industry comments have stated that EPA's adoption of the HC standard will not increase the cost of this rule. EPA believes it has adequately accounted for costs of low sac injectors in its fuel system cost estimates and will not report a separate cost line to account for the limited usage of low sac injectors caused by this rulemaking. A percentage of the engine production volume by the 1996 model year will be using low sac injectors whether regulations are in place or not. An additional percentage of regulated engines that undergo fuel system modifications will incorporate low sac injectors at that time. Manufacturers that intend to do this have reported fuel system modification costs that include the low sac injector costs. These costs are already included in the EPA hardware cost estimate under the ``Fuel System Improvements'' section of the RSD. Several manufacturers suggested that their engine model prices would increase more than the proposed EPA per engine retail price increase. It should be noted that the EPA present value per engine retail price estimate is a relative estimate aggregated across engines on a sales-weighted basis. Thus the estimate cannot be directly translated into the price increase a consumer should expect to pay for a particular piece of equipment. For engines greater than 130 kW, the disaggregated data generally indicate that an engine purchaser can expect a price increase of approximately $100 per 75 kW, which represents less than one percent of the equipment price in most cases. Price increases for engines between 37 kW and 130 kW will generally increase between zero to two percent of the equipment price. These are general estimates and there will be exceptions that do not show in EPA's reported aggregate value. In any event, relative industry level estimates calculated for regulatory analysis purposes would not be expected to match the retail price of a particular engine design. However, based on all data available (including confidential manufacturers' submissions), EPA believes that its final adjusted estimate reported in the rulemaking is accurate in the aggregate and is consistent with accepted regulatory costing methodology.
