In his words, "hysteria stirred by the opposition Russia's Choice" is the major hindrance on the way to unification of Belarus' and Russia's monetary systems and further integration of these two Slavic states. Zametalin is convinced that by preventing creation of a monetary union, "the Gaydar-Fedorov bloc is fulfilling the order of their behind-the-ocean patrons who are concerned over Russia's entering the geopolitical arena." Meanwhile, according to Zametalin, Moscow "sees the way out of the crisis at the expense of strengthening of integration ties with young Slavic states as well." He expressed opinion that "strengthening of Russia's positions on international arena and possible unification of Belarus and Russia will put an end to the West's monopoly in determining priorities in mutual relations between world community states which has established over the last period of time." Responding to the question whether the delay in signing of the Belarusian-Russian documents on creation of a monetary union affects the situation in Belarus economy, Zametalin pointed out that over the last few months the situation in the republic "is characterized by substantial lowering of businesslike activity." In his words, entrepreneurs do not risk to take "serious credits due to uncertainty, to be or not to be for the union and, if yes, then what will be the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble to the Russian one." "There is artificial manipulation in the increase of the Russian ruble to a hair" (a common name for the Belarusian ruble -- INTERFAX) underlined Zametalin. To reaffirm his words, he mentioned the fact of the exchange rate growth of 1.5 over the last months. "There is more policy than sound financial and economic sense in the increasing discrepancy of two monetary systems," believes Zametalin. At the same time he "does not rule out the possibility that such a situation in the financial sphere is being created by special adversaries of monetary systems' unification in order to get rich at the expense of variance in exchange rates."
