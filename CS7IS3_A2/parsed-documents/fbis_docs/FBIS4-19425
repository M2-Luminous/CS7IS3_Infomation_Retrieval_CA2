Should the UN formalities be awaited before withdrawing the Belgian UN troops from the destroyed country? Can violence be used to prevent Kigali airport being fired upon? What should be done with the now thousands of Rwandans wanting to leave and what procedure will be used to select who is allowed to come along? As the departure of the last aircraft from Kigali airport approaches, the tempo of such decisions increases. One of the difficult political decisions concerns the Belgian UN troops. Foreign Minister Willy Claes has said that "they will not stay in Rwanda under any circumstances." In concrete terms, that means that they will fly back with the paratroopers who were there to help the refugees. Does that also mean: without procrastination? Yesterday the ambiguity on the subject had not been fully cleared up. The army had received no formal order to withdraw the UN troops. That could simply be because the government wants to show consideration for the United Nations for as long as possible. Something similar happened during the decolonization of the Congo in 1960. The delay of the evacuation yesterday also makes it possible to keep up the appearance that the UN troops will only depart after a decision by the Security Council. But even if New York should decide against the departure of the UN troops, Belgium may not delay. The safety of its soldiers, who can do nothing more on the ground, weighs heavier than the limited loss of face of UN representatives or even African political leaders' fears of the destabilization of Central Africa. To prevent that, some 400 UN troops are certainly not enough. But the UN chapter will not be closed with the evacuation of the 2nd Commando Battalion, which made up the bulk of the Belgian UN troops in Rwanda. It is insufficient to just ask the United Nations to investigate the murder of the 10 Belgian UN soldiers last Thursday [7 April]? In New York, it will become one of the many cases for which there will never be time. An internal investigation to see whether errors were made, is also necessary. Given that it is now known the murders took place on Thursday morning, fairly soon after the attack on the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, then it is becoming clear that there was very little time for a new assessment of the situation. This makes a flagrant error unlikely. But that does not make an investigation superfluous, even if only because very many questions and much discontent remain in the paratroop battalion concerned. A total assessment of the role and above all the vulnerability of the UN troops is necessary in any case, not just in the United Nations, but also within the Belgian Government. Six Belgian UN soldiers died in Somalia. They carried out useful work, but it now appears that little remains of it. In Bosnia yesterday, the conflict escalated to such a point that more than 15 UN troops were taken hostage by the Bosnian Serbs in spite of all the stepped-up arms and NATO threats. To put it soberly, the costs of UN operations are starting to outweigh the benefits. Belgium, which has cooperated very generously with the peace forces but then paid a relatively high price, can no longer put up with any indecisiveness or bureaucratic inertia in New York. If the United Nations does not make its own military apparatus more efficient, something for which our country has already made a large number of suggestions, then we would do better to pass from now on.
