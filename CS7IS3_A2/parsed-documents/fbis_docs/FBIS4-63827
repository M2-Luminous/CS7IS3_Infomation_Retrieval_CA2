FBIS4-63827 "drsov101_a_94027" FBIS-SOV-94-101 Daily Report 24 May 1994 RUSSIAN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Moscow Court Cancels License of Russian-U.S. Oil Venture Moscow Court Cancels License of Russian-U.S. Oil Venture LD2405143694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1304 GMT 24 May 94 LD2405143694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The arbitration court in Moscow has cancelled a license issued to the Russian-U.S. oil venture calling itself White Nights, well-informed sources told INTERFAX. The company was expected to develop a new oil field in Tyumen region. White Nights is the first oil producing venture formed by Russia's Varyeganneftegaz and two U.S. companies -- Anglo-Suisse and Fibro Energy -- in November 1990. Since then, the company produced a total of 2.4 million [metric] tonnes of crude oil from its Zapadno-Varyeganskii oil field. The project cost 53.7 billion rubles to implement. White Nights also has licenses for the development of Tagrin and Roslavl oil fields of Western Siberia. The suit against the Russian Committee for Natural Resources (Goskomnedr) and the administration of the Khanty Mansy autonomous region was brought by a public group, Tayezhnik (uniting several local clans) which owns part of the land where the company operates. The plaintiff on Monday challenged the legitimacy of the company's license which was negotiated rather than won at a tender. This is in breach of the federal law on mineral resources adopted in February 1992.
