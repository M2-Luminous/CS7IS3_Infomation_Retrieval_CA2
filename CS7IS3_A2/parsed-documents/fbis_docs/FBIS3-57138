Ruvinskiy questions the wisdom of the proposed bill on the status of deputies, as well as the reasons behind some of the government's decisions, such as the refurbishing of the White House and moving government offices there at a considerable cost to the taxpayer. He then adds that Sergey Shakhray held an interesting news conference today at which he explained the role of his faction, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, in the Duma, and his reasons for accepting a ministerial post. Shakhray says: "For the first time in three-and-a-half years, an opportunity--this is a very gentle, preliminary assessment--an opportunity has arisen for a coordinated activity of the legislative and the executive powers in the area of regional policy. Representatives of our faction in the State Duma are heading three committees: the Committee for Matters of the Federation and Regional Policy; the Committee for Matters of the Commonwealth and Compatriots; and the Committee for Local Self-government. In fact, the entire regional spectrum is covered by these committees in the State Duma. "The position of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord is also very influential in the upper chamber--the Federation Council. My acceptance of the post of minister for nationalities and regional policy was influenced by another consideration that is very important to me. Our analysis shows that 1994 will be a very difficult year with respect to interethnic relations. There is a threat of interethnic and regional strife and even conflict. In this situation, it would have been very easy to feel insulted by the downgrading from the status of a deputy prime minister to the status of a minister or to find another plausible reason--since the administration provides numerous opportunities to do so--and to resign from the government having adopted a position of a constructive or non-constructive opposition and criticism. For me, such a position would be unacceptable from a moral and professional point of view. As long as there is an opportunity to influence regional policy, a chance to avert or minimize the negative consequences of possible conflicts, I will continue to work."
