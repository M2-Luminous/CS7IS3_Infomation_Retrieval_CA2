Secondly, I am not in a position to understand Zulu cultural ... culture at its heart, and therefore I would really like you to give us some clarification. Can I start by asking you: If the king says he advises his people not to vote, what does it mean in practice? Does it mean that he is actually ordering them not to vote? [Buthelezi] No, I think that the king is expressing no more than a dissatisfaction, because in fairness to the king I think that you must recall that on the 17 January we went to see Mr. De Klerk about these concerns and he also saw Mr. de Klerk on 14 February, and also on 1 February -- and 14 February and 22 February -- and each time he said that he wanted Mr. De Klerk as the de facto and de jure head of state to fix up or to put right that which he asked him to put right as far as the sovereignty of his kingdom is concerned, before the elections, so that therefore, when he speaks like that I think he is saying no more than the fact that he cannot be positive towards elections if elections in fact are removing from the table, these very deep concerns about the monarchy itself as an institution and also about the kingdom of KwaZulu. [Robinson] But the question specifically that I put to you -- let's put it a different way: Would people on the ground, ordinary folk in the street, interpret the king's advice as being actually an order not to vote? [Buthelezi] Well, he has not put it as an order really, as far as I have heard him, but he says that most of the ... [changes thought] many Zulu people agree with the king -- I think many of his subjects agree with him, and therefore, because he believes that if this matter is not sorted out before the elections, which is not just the opinion of the king -- I think yesterday in the talks that we had with Mr. de Klerk it seems to me that at long last Mr. de Klerk himself appreciates that something must be done about this and possibly that a meeting is needed either between himself and the king and Mr. Mandela to try and sort this out as soon as possible, possibly this week, so quite clearly the king is saying to his people, that you know, if there is going to be a unilateral imposition of this 1993 constitution, which doesn't say anything about his kingdom, doesn't say anything about the sovereignty of kwaZulu, shared sovereignty or even full sovereignty, then he means that, therefore, he cannot recommend to them that they should participate in an election which literally expunges the Zulu nation from the South African map. [Robinson] Let's leave that for a moment. Can I get back to the meeting that you have had with State President de Klerk yesterday. What does it mean when you say jointly that mechanisms will be put in place to ensure free and fair elections? What does it mean? [Buthelezi] I suppose that it is just another word, of saying that booths will be set up where it is possible -- facilities will be made available to the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. That's how I understand that to mean. [Robinson] Does it mean in practice that you are giving your full cooperation in a process to ensure free and fair elections? [Buthelezi] Well, Freek, from the very word go when the judge came to see me in Ulundi on the 17 of last month, I actually assured him that I regarded it as a democratic right for citizens of South Africa who want to participate in the elections to do so. In the same way the converse of that coin is that those who do not want to participate have a democratic right not to participate, and that has alway? been my guideline as far as that is concerned, and from the very word go, in fact, I asked the judge on the 17th to set up mechanisms as soon as possible. It was my suggestion, not even his. Therefore, I just don't understand, you know, I am being badgered by the question, will you give him full cooperation, because even the resolution that was passed by the cabinet of kwaZulu, in fact, makes it very, very clear that we have prepared, wherever it was possible to do so, to give the Independent Electoral Commission full cooperation. [Robinson] But it seems to me, Dr. Buthelezi, on the basis of what the IEC has said, that they did not get the impression that the members of the Legislative Assembly were in the mood to give that cooperation. In fact, they have said, the IEC, that the proceedings had been stage managed to humiliate them. [Buthelezi] I don't know -- anyone with anything between their ears would really have a very low opinion of me and my colleagues to say that we could stage manage any humiliation of the judge and the Independent Electoral Commission. Let me just say, by the way, that I have known the judge for more than 20 years. In fact at one time he represented, as an advocate, the interests of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] when one of our publications was banned by the government, so therefore, I have always held him in high esteem, and then, let us go to the question of how the judge came to Ulundi. The Judge was here on the 17 February, and then he -- suddenly he requested, you know, another meeting with me -- not only with me, he wanted a meeting with the king. He wanted a meeting with members of the Assembly. He wanted a meeting with Amakhosi [chiefs]. He wanted a meeting with senior officials of the government. So therefore ... [Robinson interrupting] Dr. Buthelezi ... [Buthelezi continuing] So, therefore, I had to put together a meeting where he could deliver a message to all these people, and therefore, the resolution of the cabinet was actually read out to him before others spoke, and to say in those circumstances, when I did just what he wanted by bringing all those people together, that he wanted together, is nothing but sheer poppycock, from my point of view, with all due respect to him. [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi, I have been told by our technical staff in Johannesburg that we have limited time but may I at the same time also appeal to our colleagues at FCC [expansion unknown] to try to give us a few extra minutes since we have had these problems. Could I put it to you, now just to come to very practical terms: What are you going to do, to ensure from your side, that your cooperation will mean, in practice, that there will be free and fair elections? [Buthelezi] Well, the judge asked for facilities from us. He asked for schools. We told him the number of schools that are available to the government will be made available to the Independent Electoral Commission. We made a distinction between those schools which are actually government schools and schools that are actually the property of communities -- in our communities, and that, therefore, we have no authority over those. We told the judge that all government buildings, whether it's courts or police stations, that belong to us, we have made available. So all the facilities that he wanted from us, which it was possible for us to make available for election purposes, we said we would make available, so I really don't know what more was expected of us. [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi, can I attend to something else: Do you align yourself with the declaration by the king for sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom? [Buthelezi] Let me say this -- the king never raised this subject before when we were trying to negotiate a federal formula, that the self-determination of the Zulu people would be exercised through a federation, but when they failed to deliver that federation, when the king then raised these subjects because he became anxious when realizing that we were being pushed into a unitary state, whereas we came into the Union of South Africa willy nilly, in fact, through the barrel of the gun, therefore, as a loyal subject of the king I said I was disarmed. I think in one interview by the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV I said that I was completely disarmed when the federation was rejected, because what can I say to the king when he says -- what about my future? What about the [words indistinct] as an institution? What about the kingdom of KwaZulu institution, because after all, KwaZulu was a sovereign state, was an independent sovereign state and which was not ordained by God that we should be part of one South Africa. But all along I have always said myself that history had made us that and that, therefore, I preferred a system where we could continue to be part of South Africa. [Robinson] Now, can I put it, since you quoted it in those terms, that you said in an interview earlier, some years ago that there is nothing ordained by God which forces apartheid and the ideals for self-determination on human society. At the time you were actually very scathing about the idea of self-determination. [Buthelezi] I was talking about self-determination as spelled out by the apartheid regime. I mean self-determination is recognized by the United Nations. I was not talking about self ... [pauses] Self-determination is not something, you know, that I regarded this day, but in that context it was the self- determination through the ideology of apartheid. [Robinson] Could I put it to you Doctor, with great respect, some people say the mere fact that the king has proclaimed freedom and sovereignty for the Zulu kingdom is in fact a device to ensure for himself, and for you as his Prime Minister, continued power without contesting elections. [Buthelezi] The king doesn't need to contest an election. The king doesn't have to beg for his sovereignty -- or sovereignty of his state or of his people from anyone. The king doesn't need to do that. The king -- in fact that sovereignty is not compared by any person because we were a sovereign people, and when now you come and say that well, now we are putting right that what was wrong, by allowing everyone in the country to be free, to decide what form of state he wants, the king has every right to do so, and it's nonsensical to say, to suggest that, you know, the king is doing this to ensure power for himself and so on, I mean, there are kingdoms right on the border of KwaZulu, one in Lesotho and one in Swaziland, of nations that we respect very much but which are smaller than the Zulu nation, now if we take the absence of any federation, the king has every right to say that he wants to know what sort of future that he and his people will have. [Robinson] Thank you Dr. Buthelezi, unfortunately I'm being told by the people in Johannesburg that we don't have any more time, but I would like to continue our conversation and record it so that we can still broadcast it at a later stage. Thank you very much for your cooperation, and I pass over to Johannesburg. [Du Preez] Judge Kriegler, a quick reaction from you on what Mr. Buthelezi had said. [Kriegler] I heard what chief minister said. I didn't hear what I wanted to hear, namely, that there will be real, meaningful, on the ground cooperation -- ostensible cooperation, protestations of willingness, simply will not enable us to do our job, and I'm appealing to the chief minister, and I hope Freek Robinson can record it in the rest of the evening, that they will settle down and talk real business to us and not have ostensible cooperation and actual frustration. [Du Preez] Thank you Mr. Justice Kriegler. That's it for tonight.
