Today our People's Army has grown up strong to be the party's ever-victorious, invincible Army, which firmly guarantees the chuche revolutionary cause, the socialist cause, with force of arms under the excellent and tested leadership of the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA] Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great commander. With his deep insight into the significance and importance of the work of firmly preparing soldiers politically, ideologically, militarily, and technologically, our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has thoroughly mastered the great leader's [suryong] ideology and theory on army building and is constantly developing and enriching them, has extensively elucidated the theoretical and practical problems arising in fostering them into the party's fighters and wisely led them. On 25 August, 1960 -- which is still fresh in our memory -- our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il visited a tank unit. That day, discovering the slogan "Let us defend with our lives the party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim Il-song" placed on the top of the gate of the soldiers' hall in the unit, Comrade Kim Chong-il said with emotion that this slogan is a good slogan reflecting the firm and invariable faith of our people and soldiers of the People's Army and that we should expedite the final victory of the Korean revolution by upholding this slogan in the future, too. Two years later, one day in August 1962, our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il visited a military camp. There, he made the significant remarks that the first, the second, and the third mission and duty of our fighters are to defend the leader [suryong] with our lives and stressed that the People's Army is the great leader's [suryong] Army and the Workers Party's Army. After that, he constantly made a tour of on-the-spot guidance to various units of different services and branches of the KPA and brilliantly elucidated and wisely led the direction and method that the People's Army should advance at every phase of the developing revolution. In late April 1981, our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il personally called responsible functionaries of the People's Army. That day our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il scientifically analyzed the deviation as found in the international communist movement, and taught that we should inherit and consummate to the end the chuche revolutionary cause generation after generation under any difficult circumstances. He then said that to brilliantly inherit and consummate this cause, it is imperative to firmly guarantee the party's leadership. At that moment, the functionaries were wrapped up in solemn emotion. The party's leadership--this is a fundamental source and lifeline of the might of our People's Army. Therefore, apart from the party's leadership, we cannot think about the existence of the People's Army itself and hope for victories in all activities. What suddenly crossed the minds of the officials who are engraving his words was the days of the wise leadership of our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il who exerted unremitting efforts to foster the People's Army into an invincible powerful Army as today that is endlessly loyal to the party. It was a New Year's eve of a certain year when the whole country was stirring with the atmosphere of a holiday. Our supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il did not even rest on this New Year's day but called a functionary to give a teaching on the problems in the work of the People's Army. On this day, as an Army of the great leader [suryong] and an Army of the party, the supreme comrade commander made a programmatic teaching, which will be a guideline in thoroughly being prepared with its party-type trait and in brilliantly realizing the cause of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea. Our supreme comrade commander said that the policy on further strengthening the People's Army politically and militarily is the leader's [suryong] program to strengthen the People's Army as a revolutionary force of the party and his determination, and also said that in the People's Army, it must be fully filled with the firm faith of entrusting everything to only the party and that it knows of no one else but the party. He said that this is the party-type trait which the People's Army must be prepared with. He then warmly emphasized that this can be achieved only when the party's leadership system is thoroughly established within the People's Army. It became late into the night in silence. Our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il is embracing the programmatic guideline to further strengthen and develop the People's Army into the party's army. His efforts overflowing with enthusiasm continued endlessly. The functionary who deeply bore in his heart the supreme comrade commander's teaching and who looked up to him, was infinitely pulsating with the pride and satisfaction of living and struggling by upholding the leader [yongdoja] of the revolutionary force who is such a brilliant and great person. Truly, our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il elucidated the party's great military building program of the working class, and created a brilliant example in the party military building through outstanding military ideology, theory, and unremitting energetic activities. He is a military commander of the times. It is not only this. To foster the People's Army into a party's army, which is possessed with a party-type trait, our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il not only provided a programmatic guideline and fundamental principle in military building, but he also took an epoch-making measure to thoroughly implement it. He is also a refined leader [yongdoja] of the revolutionary force who led the People's Army step by step and hand in hand. It was mid-March 1985. On this day, our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il talked with a responsible functionary of the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces through the telephone and made an epoch-making measure to further strengthen and develop the People's Army into a party's Army and embraced him with great faith. That functionary tried hard to repress his heart which was burning with passion, and stood for a long time with the receiver in his hand as if he was stuck. The historical days when the supreme comrade commander endlessly exerted all his energy to thoroughly establish the party's leadership system within the People's Army was once again warmly rekindled in the mind of the functionary. One day in late August 1977 our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il called the functionary and gave a valuable teaching to him for a long time. Comrade supreme commander told him that the basic mission of the party organizations and political organs in the People's Army is to build our People's Army into a powerful party's Army by firmly establishing the party's unitary ideological system, that is, the party's leadership system, within the entire Army. He then stressed that soldiers should not forget historic lessons and should advance upholding the banner of modeling the entire Army after the chuche idea in the People's Army in order to be infinitely loyal to the party's leadership. Looking at comrade supreme commander who was continuing the talk with strong passion the functionary seethed with burning emotion. The great commander Comrade Kim Chong-il who [word indistinct] the political [word indistinct] of the People's Army and who is setting the Army on a firm, immortal track today by personally leading the party's work in the Army! With what words can we explain the efforts he has devoted in fostering the People's Army into the party's army? When the functionary's heart was seething with such thought the Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il told him that it is important to correctly grasp the principal line in the party's political work in the People's Army and that the principal line in the party's political work in the People's Army is to firmly establish the party's leadership system. Indeed, our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il's teaching on that day was precious words which make it possible for functionaries to clearly know the principal line and core element in the party's political work in the Army and to outstandingly perform their mission. The physical and mental efforts our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il has devoted to strengthen and develop the KPA into an ever-victorious, invincible party's Army are indeed boundless. Comrade Kim Kyong-hwan, a KPA officer, says: "The Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, who earlier elucidated the mission and duty of the revolutionary armed forces as a profound principle has thoroughly established the leadership system of the entire Army in conformity with the inherent nature and mission of the People's Army and is energetically leading the struggle to strengthen the People's Army politically and ideologically. Thanks to the wise leadership of the comrade supreme commander who set forth the slogan of loyalty, `Let us fight with life for the great leader [suryong]' and who has led soldiers not only to strengthen the education in loyalty to the party and the leader [suryong], but also to accelerate the revolution our People's Army has been able to firmly adhere to the revolutionary character as the leader's Army and as the party's Army and to constantly consummate the party's features in conformity with the demands of the developing revolution." Yes, it is indeed so. Our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il's wise leadership was the great (?bloodshot) and the boundless nourishment which has fostered the People's Army into an ever-victorious and invincible army which is infinitely loyal to the party. Thanks to these great (?bloodshot) and infinite nourishment today our People's Army has been able to grow up to be a genuine party's Army which is demonstrating its ever-victorious might. These ranks of loyalty and ranks of singlehearted unity will trust and follow forever only our Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, the great commander, as the party's army and will more vigorously fight under his leadership for the consummation and victory of the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style and for the country's reunification.
