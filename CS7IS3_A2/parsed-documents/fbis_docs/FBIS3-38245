The visa will allow him to launch a media blitz on behalf of the republican cause but not to raise funds. Officials said Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48 hours, be barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New York and not allowed to engage in "direct or indirect fund raising." The ostensible purpose of his trip is to attend a conference of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a non-profit group whose honorary chairman is the former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Some members of Congress opposed the visa as a dangerous concession that could only result in political comfort for the IRA. The U.S. decision followed a statement in which Mr Adams declared himself to be against all forms of violence in Northern Ireland, "including the violence of the British army and security forces," and said he looked forward to the disbandment of the IRA. Mr Adams has been repeatedly denied admission to the United States over the past 20 years on grounds of his alleged involvement in terrorism. Ulster Unionists and Conservative backbenchers will be concerned that American-Irish politicians will give him a publicity platform and effectively condone terrorism. The British Government said that Sinn Fein would be judged by deeds, not words. A spokesman said: "The fact is that Adams said in a statement that he wants to end violence and is working towards supporting the Downing Street declaration, and it is on that basis that he is being admitted, under very strict conditions for 48 hours. The British Government does not issue visas for admission to the U.S." Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, Kevin McNamara, said: "We are against exclusion orders in principle. It is purely an internal domestic matter for the United States Government, and I have no views about it." Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, who refused to go to the same conference if Mr Adams was there, said last night: "My understanding was that two conditions were being imposed on Mr Adams, firstly that he accepted the Downing Street declaration and secondly that the IRA would cease violence. I cannot believe that he has accepted either of those." Sammy Wilson, spokesman for the hardline Democratic Unionist Party, last night deplored the U.S. decision. "It's quite clear since the declaration was signed on December 15 that the payoff for the IRA was coming. They've had their secret talks with the British Government, the broadcasting ban in the Irish Republic has been lifted and even the Americans are in the payoff too by giving their terrorist leader a plafform." The conference will give Mr Adams the opportunity to reinvigorate the U.S. support for Sinn Fein, and to appear on as many U.S. TV news and talkshows as he can squeeze in. The Clinton administration had said last week that its decision would depend on a statement of Mr Adams's views on violence and his readiness to support the peace efforts of John Major and the Irish Government. British officials in Washington last night were putting the best face on their defeat, suggesting that if Mr Adams lived up to his statement, Northern Ireland would benefit. If he did not, the U.S. Government would learn its lesson, and Sinn Fein would lose credibility. President Clinton was under strong pressure from congressmen with influential Irish-American constituencies. Democratic senators Teddy Kennedy of Massachusetts, who faces a difficult re-election battle this year, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, whose chairmanship of the finance commitee gives him a near-stranglehold on Mr Clinton's domestic agenda, had both urged that the visa be granted. Before the announcement from Washington, Mr Adams had denied he had renounced violence as a condition of getting the visa. He said in Dublin that he had had "a very interesting exchange of views" with a senior U.S. official which showed that the Clinton administration was acquainting itself with the republican position. The Irish Government remained aloof from the controversy sticking to its formal line that it was entirely a matter for Washington. It is believed to have cautioned the Americans against allowing Mr Adams too much latitude.
