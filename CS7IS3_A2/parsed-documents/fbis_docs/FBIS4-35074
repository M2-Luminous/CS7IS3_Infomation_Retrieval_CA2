All day long, the 250 participants, including 115 foreigners, held bilateral meetings which resulted in broad cooperation prospects. This is how Mauricio Martin described the goal of these meetings: [Begin Martin recording] The idea is for the Caribbean Businessmen's Meeting to become a meeting of Caribbean businessmen for trade with the world, not only with Cuba. [end recording] According to Martin, manager of Lafitel Enterprise, his enterprise has already attained this. [Begin Martin recording] Yes, I believe so. We have already seen the interest of certain companies. Our goal is of course to expand to the Caribbean, either in terms of exports to the Caribbean or associations with Caribbean companies to modestly fill a niche in the Caribbean market and also to contribute our grain of sand to Caribbean integration. [end recording] The meetings were held behind closed doors. Everyone's goal is to take advantage of integration conditions and mutual trade. As this meeting ended, the Expocaribe-94 Fair began promptly at 1800. Several countries and dozens of companies are participating. This guarantees the success of a fair that promises to be better than the previous ones.
