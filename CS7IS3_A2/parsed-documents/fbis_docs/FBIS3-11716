Money laundering is at the wholesale level here. The measures adopted to control money laundering equally affect legitimate businessmen. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] About $4 billion from drug trafficking reportedly arrives in the country each year. The most common method to introduce money is through construction, cars, and many consumption goods like food and presents. [Fedesarrollo President Eduardo Lora] Almost every product can be imported by purchasing it abroad using foreign currency that was bought at very low exchange rates and used as money laundering mechanisms. [Reporter] The National Superintendency of Banks and the National Customs and Tax Directorate are currently investigating some 5,300 violations of foreign exchange guidelines that businessmen, importers, and even banks have concocted. At least 90 percent of them are supposedly involved in money laundering. [Bank Superintendent Jose Elias Melo] Financial institutions are frequently involved in money laundering operations because they handle money. [Lora] The attraction stems from the slowness of the devaluation process, which makes stashing money in Colombia more profitable than stashing it abroad. [Reporter] Colombia lacks legislation to control money laundering. Meanwhile, measures to restrain lawful money, such as credit restrictions, affect drug traffickers and legitimate businessmen equally. [end recording]
