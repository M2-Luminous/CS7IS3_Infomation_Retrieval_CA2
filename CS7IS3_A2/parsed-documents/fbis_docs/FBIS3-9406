This was caused by the moderate decline in prices of food (0.2 percent) and a marginal price increase in the other groups, which amounted to 0.3 percent in public catering and in both nonfood items and services equal to 0.4 percent. The moderate decline in food prices was caused, above all, by the decline of prices of meat and meat products (by 1.3 percent) and eggs (by 16.9 percent). The largest increase was registered in the price of coffee (4.2 percent) and beverages (0.7 percent). In public catering, the prices of restaurant catering rose by only 0.1 percent, while company food services went up 1.2 percent. Only a moderate increase was registered in the prices of nonfood items, and that in practically all groups of goods--prices of footwear and leather haberdashery rose most (0.9 percent), followed by household appliances (0.8 percent). Fuel prices remained at the level of January 1994, and tobacco prices declined by 0.2 percent. In services, prices of water and sewage rose most of all (7.0 percent), followed by garbage removal (4.7 percent). Over the first two months of the year (February in comparison with December 1993), the prices rose overall by 2.1 percent, of which services increased most (8.4 percent--the result of the increased rents, heating, and hot water in January), while the prices of nonfood items rose substantially less, as did public catering (1.4 and 1.1 percent, respectively). The prices of food remained at the level of December 1993. The prorated annual rate of inflation (the average for the past 12 months in comparison with the 12 preceding months) amounted to 18.7 percent in February. In connection with the consumer price development, the household expenditures of white-color workers rose in February--from January--by 0.2 percent, and expenditures of farmers by 0.3 percent. Because of the largest share of food in the overall household expenditures of pensioners, their cost of living did not change in February (in comparison with January 1994).
