Well-known arguments raged back and forth across the table in the first -- and very heated -- EU duel between the leading figures on the yes and no sides: Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and Center Party leader Anne Enger Lahnstein. They were assisted by Labor Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland and Center Party parliamentary leader John J. Jakobsen. The Center Party leaders completely disagreed with Brundtland: They argued that Norway would lose its national identity as an EU member. "It will be impossible to be an independent nation," Lahnstein said. While Jakobsen claimed that we are now seeing the formation of a new state, and that German Chancellor Kohl has the goal of a United States of Europe. The prime minister took Jakobsen to mean that borders will be scrapped -- and argued strongly against such a view. Lahnstein said that we have lost our right of control over fish resources in the north, while the prime minister found it impossible to believe that the fisheries minister had been tricked. Gro Harlem Brundtland had dressed in green for the occasion, while Anne Enger Lahnstein was all in red. "We go better together now than we did at the party leader debate," the prime minister said, recalling that on that occasion they both turned up is shades of red -- and sat side by side. Yesterday they were placed at opposite ends of the table, but were quickly involved in hand-to-hand fighting. Thorbjorn Jagland did not seem particularly interested in answering the question of whether he would recommend a no if a majority in Sweden said no to the EU. The program chairman pointed to earlier statements that the Nordic area should stand united. Jagland said that the people must decide, but said finally that the Labor Party will maintain its position -- that is, that the party will recommend a yes to membership, regardless of the Swedes' choice. Both Jagland and Brundtland made it clear that they want a referendum in Norway after the referendums in Sweden and Finland. The Labor Party leaders asked whether the Center Party is unable to see what is democratic -- and hinted that what is democratic would be to satisfy the wishes of those who want to see what choices Norway's neighbors reach before casting their own votes. Center Party parliamentary leader Johan J. Jakobsen said that he does not attach any great importance to the timing of a referendum -- he expects a clear no regardless. But he would prefer coordination with Sweden and Finland. Jagland for his part claimed that he does not think that there is a greater chance of a yes if the Norwegians vote after the Swedes.
