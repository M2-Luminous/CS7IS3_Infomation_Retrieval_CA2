In the program, he touched on how Japan should deal with the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected possession of nuclear arms in its diplomacy toward the country. He stressed: "It is important that the United States, Japan, and the ROK will get united in dialogue with the country gradually and step by step." He also added: "Because some members of the ruling coalition parties have had close relations with North Korea, it would be possible to hold dialogue with the country via them." Thus, he indicated that the ruling parties would also seek dialogue with North Korea through diplomatic efforts with the Social Democratic Party of Japan and other parties playing a mediatory role.
