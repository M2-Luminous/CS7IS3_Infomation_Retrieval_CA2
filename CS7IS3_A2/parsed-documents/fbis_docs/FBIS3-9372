From one side the commander in chief receives a decree on releasing generals and admirals from the military service, while from the other lists of officers who covet the general rank. In such situations it is very important whether one hand knows what the other is doing. It is not a tragedy for the Army if four generals retire simultaneously. Anyway, there are more generals on the payroll than our Army needs. Furthermore, in the General Staff and in the Ground Troops Command there are more generals than desks. The problem with eventual cuts in the Army is more complicated. In this sphere the commander in chief, [Defense] Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, and the head of the General Staff are between the hammer and the anvil. On the one side there is the budget plight that hovers over the officers, and on the other the war that rages only 500 km from our border. Even King Solomon himself would have difficulties in resolving this problem, but this is no justification for either staying idle or adopting hasty decisions. Obviously, the problem could only be resolved by experts, who would objectively consider all arguments for and against the cuts, without being interested at all in the political manipulations of parties, leaders, legions, and alliances, which utilize the national security problems for promoting their own interests. Any other decision regarding the Army's fate could have unpredictable consequences.
