FR940610-2-00077 FR940610-2-00053 (f) Develop a service delivery model for women with HIV disease that emphasizes the coordination of services from outreach, counseling and HIV testing, including expanded counseling and testing during pregnancy, through early intervention and care, including appropriate therapeutic drug regimens, for asymptomatic and symptomatic disease, and for prevention of transmission of HIV during pregnancy and delivery. Grantees must describe how the proposed model is using innovative features to reach pregnant women and women at high risk (e.g., substance abusing women) who have been reluctant to become engaged in traditional counseling/testing services, and how these women will be engaged and retained in care systems for themselves during and after pregnancy. Priority will be given to applicants in States or cities which have made the decision to ``routinely recommend'' that women (during pregnancy and/or whenever they receive primary care services) learn their HIV infection status for the purposes of improving their own care and health status; preventing transmission to their infants during pregnancy; and preventing transmission during breastfeeding. The funds will be used primarily to support system development and organizing and training providers. The intent of this sub-category is to foster systems of care for women with HIV; to encourage more women to know their infection status; to encourage States and cities to develop plans for accomplishing this; and to assess the reasons for and impact of the various decisions women make regarding HIV testing, use of AZT during pregnancy, and adherence to follow-up care decisions made jointly with providers. (2) Coordinated delivery of HIV health and support services to specific mobile populations in the United States, ensuring the delivery of continuous services throughout the course of HIV disease. For the purposes of this category, mobile populations are defined as border populations; populations with migration patterns primarily between the continental United States and its territories and commonwealths and between the United States and other countries; migrant farm labor workers; and, undocumented workers and residents. Examples of services needed by these populations include primary medical care, mental health services, and advocacy or other legal support services that address AIDS discrimination and access to care. Special attention must be paid to ensuring and documenting continuity of care for clients that receive care from providers located in different geographical locations. SPNS is seeking innovative methods of interagency communication and for tracking referrals between providers so that longitudinal follow-up of clients from provider to provider will be possible. Grantees must evaluate their success at ensuring continuity of medical care and access to needed support services. (3) Reduction of cultural, linguistic, and/or organizational barriers to care in a geographically defined area (e.g., neighborhood, community, region, state). Grantees must have the capacity to analyze reductions in organizational barriers to accessing care. AIDS service providers and other community-based organizations located in the geographic area and staffed by the cultural and/or linguistic group to be served by the proposed service delivery model are encouraged to apply under this category. Grantees submitting a proposal under Category # 3 must address one of the following four populations: (a) An underserved population group experiencing significant barriers to care (e.g., men of color, HIV infected women, AIDS survivors, etc.) by addressing their access to care issues through organizational collaboration and inclusion in policy development. The grantee chooses the target population in this sub-category based on documented evidence that this population affected by HIV disease is not receiving services. At a minimum, collaboration among providers must include all Ryan White CARE Act-funded grantees in the area that serve the targeted population. (b) An ethnic group facing both linguistic and cultural barriers. A critical component of a proposed model in this sub-category must be the involvement of individuals and/or community-based organizations with established service relationships with the targeted special population. (c) Active substance abusers utilizing primary care on an intermittent basis or who do not adhere to their treatment regiment. Models for expanding enrollment and enhancing retention of HIV infected substance users, particularly active users, in primary care may include methods of increasing primary care providers' knowledge, receptiveness, and skill in treating this population. (d) Individuals or special populations experiencing HIV-based discrimination in health care, employment, and/or housing, that inhibits their receipt and/or utilization of health care services. Grantees must demonstrate and evaluate how innovative advocacy services targeting HIV discrimination impacts access to and utilization of appropriate health care for people whose needs are already complicated by cultural, linguistic or organizational issues. (4) Provider training and education models that develop, test, and evaluate strategies for increasing, improving or updating knowledge about HIV disease and its treatment for providers in rural areas, correctional facilities or mental health services programs and facilities. Grantees should collaborate, when feasible, with existing AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETC) and other training centers already providing education services to a wide variety of health care providers. Adoption, or adaptation to local conditions, of existing training models with outcome oriented evaluation is encouraged. The project's evaluation must specify the extent to which providers incorporate new skills and knowledge into their practices, and if there are any changes in numbers of people with HIV disease served by the provider. Evaluation designs comparing the results between different levels or intensity of training are encouraged. Review Criteria: HIV Service Delivery Models All applications for HIV Service Delivery Model cooperative agreements described under Category (1) through (4) above and submitted to the SPNS program will be reviewed and rated by an objective review panel. Factors for the technical review of applications are as follows:
