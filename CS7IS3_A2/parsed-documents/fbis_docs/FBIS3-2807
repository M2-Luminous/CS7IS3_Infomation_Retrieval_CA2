"The further reform is carried out, the more extensively the pattern of interest sharing is adjusted, and the greater the market role is, the more vigorously we should advocate socialist ethics, discipline, attention to national interests as a whole, and common prosperity," he said. Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, attended a group discussion on Premier Li Peng's government work report by Shanghai deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC), of which he is one. Joining the discussion, Jiang said that under the current good situation at home and abroad, it is imperative to seize opportunities for economic development. "Meanwhile," he said, "we must keep sober-minded and be fully aware of challenges faced by China in the international community, as well as problems that have arisen at home amid continuous progress." Jiang Zemin stressed the need to work even harder and more diligently. He asked governments at all levels to devote their major attention to seizing development opportunities, deepening reforms, opening China wider to the outside world, promoting economic development and maintaining social stability. The central authorities have decided on the focus of work for this year in order to achieve "a sustained, rapid and sound" development of the national economy, he said. The key to successfully fulfilling the task, he said, is to correctly handle relations between reform, development and stability. "We must pay close attention to maintaining a stable social and political environment, promote reform and development amid stability, and ensure long-term social stability through reform and development," he said. The president described reform, development and stability as three closely interrelated "strategic pieces" on a chess board, saying that it is a leadership art to correctly handle relations among the three. On agriculture, he stressed the importance of adhering to the following principles: -- To strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the national economy; -- To steadily increase the output of major farm products such as grain, cotton and cooking oil; -- To alleviate farmers' financial burdens while increasing their incomes; -- To vigorously develop rural enterprises; -- To stabilize the household-based system of farming; and -- To improve the work efficiency of village-level organizations led by village party branches. Jiang praised large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises for their vital contributions to China's economic growth. "These enterprises serve as the backbone of China's economy and will continue to play a leading role in expanding a socialist market economy," he said. "Therefore, no matter what difficulties we may face, we should make every effort to improve the performance of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises," Jiang said. Speaking of difficulties being faced by many state-owned enterprises, Jiang said it is a major task of the party, the government and the society as a whole to help them overcome their difficulties and help invigorate them. The fundamental solution is to deepen reform and unswervingly separate the functions of the government from those of the enterprise, accelerate a change of their operational mechanism and build a modern enterprise system, he said. It is imperative to push such enterprises onto the marketplace where they should seek new ways to overcome difficulties. State enterprises, in different types and with different conditions, can have diversified operational approaches and varied ways to invigorate themselves, Jiang said. However, he said, it is a must to preserve and increase the value of state assets. He expressed the hope that Shanghai will accumulate more valuable experience in state enterprise reform. Jiang also emphasized the importance of socialist cultural and ideological progress. Both material civilization and cultural and ideological progress are important aspects of China's modernization program, he said. It will be a dangerous deviation for a country, a nation and individuals to emphasize only the material side to the neglect of the spiritual side, he said. Jiang expressed his appreciation of remarkable achievements made by the people of Shanghai. He reiterated that development of Pudong is a major policy decision of the central authorities, that development and opening of pudong is a firm strategy and that the central authorities' policy towards Pudong will remain unchanged. Jiang also expressed the hope that Pudong will become a real "dragon head" for the Chang Jiang River valley. Shanghai's development can never be separated from the support of other parts of the country and the latter's development also needs Shanghai's support. Shanghai's working class and people should make continuous and fresh contributions to the development of other parts of the country, especially central and western regions, he said. Rong Yiren, Chinese vice president and an NPC deputy in the Shanghai delegation, also spoke at the group discussion.
