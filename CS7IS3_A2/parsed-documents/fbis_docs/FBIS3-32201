The letter states: Upon the conclusion of the agenda of our sixth congress, we wish to express the intense commitment this process generated in our journalists. Two issues not fully debated in the congress because of time constraints were discussed in this meeting: Cuba's image abroad and media finances. The participants were unanimous in stressing the role of our media in disseminating the true image of Cuba and in confronting the U.S. blockade as well as the campaigns of the disinformation multinationals.
