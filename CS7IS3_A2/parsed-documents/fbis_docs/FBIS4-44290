Bild said that, within the next 10-15 years, the area would become one of the most important and dynamic regions in Europe. In Bildt's view, it will now be important to develop the Baltic Sea into the "European Union's Inland Sea." In this connection he was also banking on the Federal Government and its upcoming EU presidency and the land governments of Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg Western Pomerania. Seite and Simonis pointed out that the Baltic Sea area has been given a new perspective through the forthcoming EU accession of Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and the political changes and reforms in northeast and Central Europe. Seite: "The Baltic Sea has become a sea of opportunities." The countries on the shores of the Baltic Sea need future-oriented technologies. He, therefore, asked the Schleswig-Holstein minister president to participate in the Transrapid project. Mrs. Simonis expects from the German EU presidency that the north would be integrated into the European Union more strongly, too, and that not "everything is pumped into the south of Europe -- the bacon belt," as has been the case so far. The Swedish Government head also expressed his optimism in Bonn that his country's accession to the European Union would be supported in the upcoming referendum. With the exception of the former communists, all Swedish parties gave a clear signal to vote "yes." He was quite sure that the Swedes would vote in favor, Bildt said, adding that he also assumed that the referendums in Norway and Finland would yield a positive result, too. For the prime minister, who signed the treaty with the European Union along with the government heads of the other Nordic EU candidates at the EU summit in Corfu, it is now of particular importance to initiate the process for Polish membership. "As far as this question is concerned, we are pinning high hopes on the German EU presidency, due to begin on 1 July." The same applies to paving the way for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania for future EU membership. He described the search for a new president of the EU Commission as the European Union's most important personnel decision for the next 10 years. "All three men that have been in the contest so far are very good candidates," he said. Bildt said he was having difficulties noticing differences on basic EU issues between them. In a lecture he gave later in Bonn, Bildt, whose schedule also included a meeting with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, pleaded for integrating Russia more closely into Baltic cooperation. World War II will really be over only when the last Russian Forces had withdrawn from the Baltic states. He welcomed the European Union's partnership agreement with Russia. He appealed to the Baltic countries to be generous toward their Russian inhabitants.
