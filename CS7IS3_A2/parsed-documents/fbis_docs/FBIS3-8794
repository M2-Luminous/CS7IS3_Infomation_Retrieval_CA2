[Carnogursky] It will be a government of experts. No single party chairman is among them. For example, the new foreign minister has experience as a UN ambassador, and the new finance minister is a banking expert. [Patsch] Will the alliance of the opposition, which has been so much at variance so far, hold? [Carnogursky] There are, of course, different views within the government. But all know what is at stake. We have a joint objective.... [Patsch] ...the elimination of Meciar? [Carnogursky] Above all, the future of our country. Moreover, I believe that it might work better than many assume. Peter Weiss (chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left--SDL) is a man with whom one can have a reasonable talk. At any rate, I am optimistic. [Patsch] How can early new elections be pushed through? [Carnogursky] This is difficult because the Constitution does not provide for it. Basically, we are sticking to our point of view: new elections in September or October. We would need a three-fifths' majority for it. If Meciar rejects our proposal, we have to look for another way. It would be conceivable to ask the president to open the road to new elections by a referendum. It should contain only one question: early elections--yes or no? [Patsch] A referendum has already been initiated by Meciar.... [Carnogursky] ... which does not meet the requirements. Signatures turn up two and three times. There are names on the list that are not registered anywhere.
