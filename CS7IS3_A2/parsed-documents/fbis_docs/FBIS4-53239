FBIS4-53239 "dreas096_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 North Korea Remarks by ROK Ruling Party Chairman Denounced Remarks by ROK Ruling Party Chairman Denounced SK1705053194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0522 GMT 17 May 94 SK1705053194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Chong-pil, "chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party" of South Korea, again claimed recently that the "May 16 military coup" was a "revolution". Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today brands this as a shameless and brazen nonsensical balderdash. The analyst says: The "May 16 military coup" was an anti-democratic crime which blocked democratic development in South Korea and brought a more brutal military fascist dictatorship. The "May 16 military coup" staged under the manipulation of the United States and the military fascist dictatorship produced by it imposed formidable misfortunes and disasters upon the people and left incurable wounds of grievances in their hearts. This was why the traitor Kim Chong-pil invited angry rebuffs from the mass when he defended the "May 16 military coup" last year. Nevertheless, he again praised the military coup. This is, indeed, an unpardonable challenge to the people's aspiration and demand for democracy. He makes such remarks in an effort to conceal the past crimes he committed against the people, but it is a foolish act. His face is the wolf's, whether he wears a mask, or not. He only reeks of blood. The traitor Kim Chong-pil contended that the present "regime" has its roots in the soil of "May 16". But he only took the "civilian" veil off the South Korean "president", Kim Yong-sam, while defending the "May 16 military coup" in which he had played the key role. The Kim Yong-sam regime is, in fact, a fascist dictatorial regime disguised with the "civilian" veil. Kim Yong-sam once said "May 16" was a "coup". But it has become all the clearer that his words were intended to conceal the reactionary nature of the "civilian" regime which has its roots in the military fascist dictatorship.
