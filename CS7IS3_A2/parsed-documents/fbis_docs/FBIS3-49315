[Silajdzic] Hello. [Mueller-Blattau] Are such peace talks at all meaningful if some of the warring parties involved, that is the Serbs, are not participating? [Silajdzic] Of course, there are questions that could be solved only among three parties, but there are also questions that can be discussed bilaterally. [Mueller-Blattau] Which would you discuss bilaterally tomorrow; what are the most important points? [Silajdzic] Well, unfortunately we have many points. Allow me to begin with the humanitarian convoys. Then there is a field hospital that we have been wanting to bring to Mostar for three months. But the Croat extremists do not want to let the hospital in. Then, there are the territorial issues and the status of Mostar. We have all agreed, of course, that the town is to be under EU [European Union] administration. Of course, we have to restrict to what extent the EU will administer the territory, and then there are many other things that we must discuss tomorrow. [Mueller-Blattau] It seems that talks with the various political parties always only deal with territorial issues. Aren't the people far more important? [Silajdzic] Yes, I hope you argue with the Croat side, because we always offer them no lines [boundaries] between us. It is the lines that lead to problems for the people. But they reject this, and they do not want to live together with us in one state. That is the problem. And when I say they, I mean those who have the guns and the power. I am not that sure whether the people themselves really want to live apart. For that kind of ideology is after all what caused the bloodbath; it started in Belgrade. It is a reality that they just do not want to live with us in one state. And I mean the Croats, who are the ones with the power. [Mueller-Blattau] Lord Owen has savagely criticized the three parties. He said that all three only talk about peace, but do not really want it. What do you think of that? [Silajdzic] Yes, I have heard this comment, and it is a very strange thing to say. I must say that it a major surprise for me, because he knows the truth, after all. Only two days ago, he said that Croatian troops and tanks are in Bosnia, and that amounts to intervention by the Croatians on Bosnian territory. Lord Owen said that himself. And he knows perfectly well -- we all know it -- who started the war there. It was the regime in Belgrade, with its expansionist desires and its intervention and aggression against Bosnia. Thus, there are two foreign armies in Bosnia. And on the other hand, there is a legal Bosnian armed force in Bosnia itself. If Lord Owen and others think that we are a helpless victim, it seems to be the case that we are only accepted when we are helpless victims. But that will not be true, because we will have to fight back. That is why we are particularly angry at such comments. Those people that are dying in Sarajevo, and there is heavy shelling there, but also in Doboj, Tuzla, and Mostar. Lord Owen does not even regard it as particularly worthy of mention to discuss it. He discusses quite different things. Let me summarize: Bosnia-Herzegovina was attacked by the Belgrade regime and by Serb troops, and then by the Croat extremists. And now they [Bosnia] are unfortunately being attacked by the legal Croatian Army -- by the official Croatia, that is. Those are the facts. They all know that, and nobody denies it. The aggression against Bosnia was facilitated by the arms embargo against Bosnia, against the legitimate Bosnian Government. Now we are producing arms in order to fight, but it looks as though they do not want to allow us to do so. And when we fight back, then they call us the aggressors, in our own country, on our own territory. And it looks as though some will prefer to see a Greater Croatia and Greater Serbia installed there at the expense of Bosnia. When we fight back, well, then they are frustrated, because we should have surrendered to them one year ago, but that is not going to happen. [Mueller-Blattau] Lord Owen even said the Muslims are only striving for a military solution. [Silajdzic] What he means is that the Muslims, or rather the Bosnians -- he always prefers to call us Muslims for certain reasons... [Mueller-Blattau] For what reason? [Silajdzic] The reason is to remind us what Islam means in historical terms in Europe, we have our name, we are Bosnians. But all this greatly surprises me. Are we allegedly supposed to want a military solution? Are the victims without arms really supposed to want a military solution? Isn't that a bit too illogical? One should consider what lies behind those words. It is as follows. We should have surrendered long ago. We should have made it easy for the Serbs to set up a Greater Serbia. That, at any rate, is what some governments in Europe believe, and unfortunately one of the mediators also thinks, from time to time, that we should have surrendered, that Greater Serbia and Greater Croatia should be created, all at Bosnia's expense and then we could all live together happily ever after in large tribes. The reality, however, is that so far 200,000 people have been killed, and that is forgotten by Lord Owen and his friends in Europe. But we cannot forget and we will fight back. We must be permitted to produce weapons, because thanks to people like Lord Owen and others, there is an illegal and immoral arms embargo against Bosnia. [Mueller-Blattau] You criticize Lord Owen very strongly. Do you believe he should give up his role as mediator? [Silajdzic] Yes, after what he has said I think he should retire. [Mueller-Blattau] Why? [Silajdzic] Exactly because by what he said he showed that he does not want a Bosnia to exist, it is a Greater Serbia that must be installed. [Mueller-Blattau] What do you expect from the United Nations? [Silajdzic] That it respect its own decisions. [Mueller-Blattau] Meaning? [Silajdzic] There are a great number of resolutions by the UN Security Council that are nothing but pieces of paper. The United Nations is just like a piece of paper. If that is what it wants to be, OK. But if it wants to be a world organization that does something and does not just cover pieces of paper with writing, then it is a different matter. More than 100 states in the United Nations General Assembly voted in favor of Bosnia. No attention was paid to that. If the United Nations is only there to help a few big rich countries when they need it, alright. But I think that should be changed. [Mueller-Blattau] Today I talked with a representative from the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees]. She says that all three warring parties are blocking the UN aid convoys. [Silajdzic] For us in Bosnia the most painful things are not shells, the most painful things are lies. They come from two sides; one side watches as shells fall on us and the other side targets the shells at us. The point has been reached where the credibility and morality, specifically of the European governments and international organizations, are called into question. If 200,000 people die because of one aggressor, then these dead can only be on one side and those they have killed on the other. There is an attacker and there is a victim. They want to forget that because they do not want to get involved. That is the problem. [Mueller-Blattau] Are there cases where your soldiers, your troops, have been hindering the UN aid convoys? [Silajdzic] I do not think so, because who needs it? The Bosnian population is now being encircled, is living in ghettos, mostly surrounded by Serb units. It is quite clear who needs aid and who is hindering that aid. The international organizations have to be precise. If you hear that again from the UNHCR representative, ask for details. Who, for example, is preventing the Danish troops from reaching Srebrenica? Who is preventing Tuzla airport from being reopened? Who is preventing the field hospital from being brought to Mostar? Ask her, and then you will hear the answer. The United Nations only ever talks about all three warring parties. You know why? Because they do not want to get involved. For them the 200,000 people, among them 14,000 children, are the same as those who killed them. That is Europe, that is a disgrace. But that is European bureaucracy, those are not people. That has to change because these people are bringing us into difficulties, they are bringing the whole of Europe into difficulties. These incompetent European bureaucrats might just drive us into a third world war. I do not know whether you realize that, but it is important for us recognize this. This is about human lives, this is about our future, the future of the region, the future of Europe, and these incompetents must go. This is the time to tell them to go. [Mueller-Blattau] You say they must go. What is to happen after that? [Silajdzic] The European Community should finally implement the UN Security Council resolution, immediately.
