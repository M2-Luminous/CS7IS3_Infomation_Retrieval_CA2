An internal feud in the ruling Nepali Congress (NC) has already delayed the winter session of parliament for more than a week. The main opposition in the parliament, the Nepal Communist Party- United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML), had appealed to the king to urgently call a parliamentary session to discuss the current political situation. The NCP-UML argued that a call for mid-term polls 26 months ahead of the expiry of the current parliament's five-year term should not be made on Koirala's recommendation alone, and should be debated in parliament. The row in the NC started after the defeat of party president and bitter Koirala rival Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in a parliamentary by-election February 7. Koirala had bitterly flayed Bhattarai for criticising him and the government in a by-election campaign speech. Bhattarai supporters and more than 50 NC MPs for their part said the prime minister's comments, as well as a deliberately poor campaign effort by some NC officials, cost the party the election. Analysts said Koirala wanted a snap election to force the party to unify behind him. His party has a fairly comfortable majority of 113 seats in the 205-member parliament. Since Bhattarai's defeat, students and front-line NC youth supporters have taken to the streets to denounce Koirala, and the party's executive body, the Central Working Committee, is deciding whether to take action against Koirala for his alleged misconduct during the recent by-elections. Most committee members are loyal to Bhattarai and he is expected to repeat his call for Koirala to resign when the committee completes deliberations, probably on Friday. Party sources said that would lead to a crisis within the NC and a possible bid to oust him from the party, but that Koirala was seeking support from students and MPs ahead of a showdown.
