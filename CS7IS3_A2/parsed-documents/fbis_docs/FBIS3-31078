This is what he said among other things about the aims of the ultimatum: [Begin Jovanovic recording] The present (?Muslim) leadership in Bosnia-Herzegovina has never been independent. Whenever a problem regarding Bosnia was being solved, this leadership was always led by interests and directions from abroad. It is indebted to these [foreign] factors, considering the huge support it has been receiving. This support is financial, moral, and political, and probably there are also ideological and religious elements which are rarely pointed to although they lie at the foundation of everything. Therefore, foreign interests, the interests of certain factors, have always been not to end a Yugoslav crisis during a time that they needed to penetrate the Balkan Peninsula deeply and find firmer and more lasting support for their new strategic [word indistinct] in the Balkans. Therefore, whenever peace was in the offing, whenever things looked as if they were virtually solved, foreign factors intervened with actions of an opposite nature which was immediately interpreted by the Muslim leadership as a signal, as a support, almost as an order to turn their backs on negotiations and peace. They have always acted accordingly; ranging from Cutilheiro's mission when the Bosnian crisis was expected to be solved by exclusively political means and the war was not to take place at all, to various stages of negotiations. Also in this case, it turned out that a virtual assassination of a political kind was committed at this renewed peace process that started from the heart of the crisis, from Sarajevo, followed with many hopes. This is this ultimatum which was obviously made with a view to calling on the Muslim side not to cooperate in the peace process, because why should it cooperate when it can expect to get much more in 10 days by air raids and war than it would achieve by peace.
