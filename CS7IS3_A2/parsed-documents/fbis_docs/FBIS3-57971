FBIS3-57971 "drweu003__a94032" FBIS-WEU-94-003-A Document Type:Daily Report 5 January 1994 ANNEX Italy & Vatican City Finance Minister on Supplementary Budget Measures BR3012105493 Rome ANSAMAIL Database in English 2151 GMT 29 Dec 93--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR3012105493 Rome ANSAMAIL Database Language: English Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "Cabinet Approves 6.78 Trillion Supplementary Budget"] [Text] Rome, 29 Dec (ANSA) -- The cabinet this evening approved a supplementary budget expected to bring in 6.78 trillion lire next year by a series of measures including hikes on Value-Added Tax, spirits and petrol and two new state lotteries: a " scratch-and-win" game, and a new version of the soccer pools in which punters have to guess the highest-scoring matches. The package contains no increase in the price of cigarettes, although Finance Minister Franco Gallo said certain fixed taxes including that on tobacco "might be reviewed before the end of April." According to ministerial estimates, the measures will bring in 6 trillion lire in 1995 and 6.29 trillion the year after. The package will only boost inflation by 0.2 percent next year, ministers said. In wider moves attached to the mini-budget, the cabinet exempted Treasury bond transactions from bourse taxes and approved a capital gains package -- in the form of a bill -- including incentives to give firms greater access to risk capital. It also authorised the Treasury's deposits and loans department to issue bonds that may be underwritten by its joint-stock subsidiaries -- a move seen as aimed at helping the IRI [Institute for Industrial reconstruction] engineering conglomerate get its runaway debt under control. The mini-budget adds 50 lire onto the price of lead-free petrol and 70 lire onto that of normal petrol, taking them up to 1,550 lire per litre and 1,655 lire per litre respectively: widening the eco-friendly difference between the two from 85 to 105 lire per litre. VAT [value-added tax] rises from 4 to 9 percent for the sale of restructured buildings and the granting of licenses to cooperatives; from 12 to 13 percent for clothing, footwear, fabrics, wines and certain foodstuffs; and from 9 to 13 percent -- from 1995 -- for telephone services. But it falls from 19 to 13 percent for deluxe hotel charges. The price of a large bottle of spirits will rise by about 250 lire, bringing Italy's VAT on liquor into line with European Union standards. Ministers said VAT revenue would rise by 2.51 trillion lire next year, 90 billion in 1995, and 100 billion the year after that. The lapse between VAT registration and payment was shortened by 15 days. The package retains through 1994 last summer's extraordinary levy on powerful cars and motorcycles. It also targeted second homes in the country -- many of which have escaped heavy taxation by calling themselves farms -- by requiring all so-called rural buildings which are not in fact farmhouses to be registered at land offices in the nearest town. But it abolishes a 500-lire levy on credit card transactions and replaces cheque and receipt levies with a surcharge on bank statements, so as to favour the use of current accounts for most payments. The capital gains bill, linked to the mini-budget but requiring separate parlimanetary approval, widens the tax base of financial activities, reintroduces taxation of profits via anonymous detractions on overall results, offers an optional system of lump-sum detractions from dividends, and offers a range of tax breaks for investors in private companies. Enlarging on the capital gains package, Gallo explained that the government "intends to reclaim also capital gains on bourse earnings: but the tax must be applied on the net result and levied in an anonymous form." He said the Finance Ministry is in favour of cutting capital gains tax rates to just three, between 10 and 25 percent. "We are obviously thinking of cutting the levy on bank deposits from 30 to 25 percent. But I think the detraction on state bonds should stay at 12.5 percent," he said. There would also be the option of the "straight coupon payment" on dividends, he said. Amid a range of separate measures aimed at making it more difficult to dodge VAT and other direct tax payments, the cabinet cut from 2/3rds to 1/10th the proportion of taxes on entertainers' publicity costs that can be paid in a lump sum rather than a percentage of overall earnings. It also lowered from 15 to 10 percent the floor above which shareholdings in limited companies are subject to a separate 25 percent levy rather than a percentage payment. Gallo also said that, despite the tight limits set by the budget, the government had also tried to produce a fiscal policy that was not an "end unto itself," but rather represented a step towards "simplification by bringing order to legislative chaos and setting the administrative machine in motion again."
