Police said that no extortion or racketeering cases had been reported at the Badaling section of the Great Wall, a drive of about 90 minutes from the city centre, since the end of April. Forced sales had evidently decreased. Since the beginning of the year, the famous tourist site had been plagued by cases of forced sales, extortion and racketeering. The victims were Chinese and overseas tourists, and sometimes even foreign diplomatic personnel could not escape, according to police sources. As a result, normal tourist order disappeared, and the number of visitors to that site declined. Concentrated efforts were made from late April. A team of 300 people, from police departments, industrial and commercial administration departments and city order departments, regularly and persistently inspected the area, achieving remarkable success. Seven illegal vendors were detained. The stock of four stalls near the wall was confiscated and they were banned from trading for two months. Confiscated goods and fines totalled 31,000 yuan. In addition, education courses were given to vendors at the site and farmers around the area. Police said they have improved telecommunications and transport equipment for the site. Police and industrial and commercial departments extended their own daily duty times by an hour. The Badaling section of the Great Wall, which in 1991 was listed as a world top heritage site by the United Nations, stretches along 3.7 km. More than five million tourists visited the site last year.
