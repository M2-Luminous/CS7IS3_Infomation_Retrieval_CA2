Chairman of the Oil-Workers Union Vladimir Medvedev is the leader of this group in the lower chamber of the newly elected Russian parliament. Yuriy Voevoda told ITAR-TASS that the group has 65 members. It consists mainly of representatives of industrial circles with Medvedev at their head. Former Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party Aleksandr Dzasokhov, who gathered around himself regional representatives, including those from the North Caucasus, added another twenty or so members to the group. So far the group's members are united by the slogan, "Strong regions - a strong federation". But many of the deputies interpret this phrase, first voiced by Boris Yeltsin, in different ways. Some of the deputies think it is their duty to force the reduction of the percentage of overall income transferred by local governments to the center down to thirty per cent. Voevoda and his allies think that the regions should use their own resources to solve their internal problems, perhaps by attracting funds from the international community. The districts who have free economic zones on their territory, like the Kaliningrad region and in the Far East, see this option as being a possibility for their own areas. It is obvious that State Duma deputies are going to lobby the parliament for the interests of their home districts. Voevoda, for example, intends to use the support of his deputies' group to enact a law declaring a special status for the Kaliningrad region, so that the region can become "an object of international law for the resolution of all its problems without asking the centre for permission". The Kaliningrad region's difficult location, which is territorially cut off from Russia proper, makes it necessary for it to develop its own independent policies concerning the surrounding states in order to establish optimal border, transport, and energy systems, Voevoda asserted. He said that part of the deputies' group intend to have another look at specific articles of the federal treaty and will push to make that document an integral part of the Russian Constitution. The "New Regional Politics" group can be classified as centrist. Therefore, the "regionalists'" position will have the power to seriously influence the adoption of decisions in the parliament, depending on whether the group aligns itself with the "left" or the "right" blocs on any given question.
