FR940524-2-00094 FR940524-2-00052 Finally, the Commission does not agree with some commenters who argue that broker-dealers should not be required to submit requests for extensions of time for payment or delivery of securities to any SRO. 71 These commenters argue that broker-dealers should make such determinations since it is their capital at stake. The Commission does not need to address these arguments in the context of this rule proposal which concerns the allocation of extension requests among the SROs. The Commission, however, preliminarily believes that there is a need for checks on the granting of such extensions by broker-dealers. Without SRO review in this area, broker-dealers would be free to add unwarranted risk to securities transactions by granting credit in excess of what is reasonable or granting excessive extensions of time in order to ensure that a transaction for which a commission is earned is completed. The Commission, however, along with the FRB's ongoing review of Regulation T, will continue to examine these issues. 71 See Bear Sterns and A.G. Edwards Letters, supra note 11. VI. Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, we believe that the proposal is consistent with the Act. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 72 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;88&hyph;35) be, and hereby is, approved. 72 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 73 73 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
