Let us link up with Francesco Pionati. [Pionati] Yes, the debate is taking place in a confused atmosphere. At the end of this morning, Ciampi will go to the Quirinale Palace [President's office] in order to hand his resignation to the Head of State [Oscar Luigi Scalfaro], who then has the task of dissolving the chambers and calling fresh elections. This morning the differences between the ruling coalition parties, that want the legislature to continue -- a view supported by [Savino Melillo] from the Liberal Party and by [Enrico] Ferri from the Social Democratic Party who both spoke this morning, and the opposition parties that, on the other hand, want the chambers dissolved and elections to take place by the end of March, became apparent once again. [passage omitted] [Giorgio] Napolitano and Ciampi will be the last two to speak at the debate. At 1200, there will be a meeting of the political groups making up the ruling coalition, which want to propose a confidence motion in the government. However, this proposal now seems out of the question. So all in all, the debate is proceeding in this climate of confusion.
