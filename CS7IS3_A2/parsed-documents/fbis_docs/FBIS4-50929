During the U.S. visit, Governor Chen Huanyou met with New York State Governor Mario Cuomo and Georgia Governor Zell Miller. Following friendly and frank discussions, both sides exchanged views on exchange and cooperation, reached a consensus, and signed four agreements in economic and science trade. The four agreements were: The Jiangsu-New York High-Technology Cooperation Agreement; the Jiangsu-Georgia Economic and Trade Development and Exchange Memorandum; the New York State Financial Investment Seminar in Jiangsu Memorandum; and the Jiangsu-New York Comprehensive Visual Testing Agreement. The U.S. visit marked the first meeting between Jiangsu and U.S. governors and the signing of the four agreements signified the actual progress that Jiangsu has achieved in developing exchange and cooperation with the United States. To enhance understanding, deepen friendship, and expand cooperation, the Jiangsu delegation made extensive contacts with U.S. industry, commerce, science and technology, education, legal, and media circles and Chinese in the United States. It attended the opening ceremony of the Jiangsu investment and trade fair in New York City, visited Ford Motor Company, the Atlanta Science Park, and New York State University's High Technology Center. Governor Chen was invited to speak at the receptions sponsored by the U.S.-Chinese Relations National Committee; the New York State International Cooperation Committee; and the business, scientific, and educational circles of Georgia. He introduced China's opening-up policy, Jiangsu's economic development and investment environment, and the prospects of developing Sino-U.S. friendly exchange and cooperation to those at the receptions. He also fielded questions posed by business, political, and legal circles and reporters. Many heads of major corporations discussed with the delegation the possibility of expanding cooperation. The vice chairman of the Detroit-based (Carden) Company and his party took a special nighttime charter flight from Michigan to discuss investment with the delegation. New York and Georgia officials said they would organize heads of major corporations to visit Jiangsu to explore investment projects. Good results exceeding original expectations were achieved at the investment and trade fair in New York City, where agreements on 48 projects totalling $510 million were signed. The delegation was warmly received everywhere by various circles and by Chinese in the United States. On its first day in New York, Chinese organizations in the eastern United States and Suxing International Trading Company jointly sponsored a grand reception. Some 250 people turned up at that warm reception. This showed that Overseas Chinese love their country and miss their hometowns. During a stopover in San Francisco following visits to New York and Georgia, the California governor forwarded a personal letter via his special representative to the delegation in which he congratulated the delegation's successful visit and expressed the wish to develop friendly cooperation. Chinese circles in San Francisco and Los Angeles hosted a grand reception to welcome Governor Chen and his party. The delegation also met with Hawaii Governor John Waihee to discuss exchange and cooperation. During the visit, Governor Chen met with UN Deputy Secretary General Ji Chaozhu and many responsible persons at the Chinese embassy and consulate in the United States. He also met with comrades working at Chinese enterprises in the United States and urged them to further emancipate their minds, seize the opportunity, run well overseas enterprises, and accelerate the pace of developing overseas markets. Cao Keming, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC committee; Wang Rongbing, vice governor; Liang Baohua, secretary general of the provincial CPC committee; and Shi Shaoxiang, deputy secretary general of the provincial government, met the delegation at the airport. Other delegation members, including Chen Biting, Ye Jian, Chen Deming, Li Zhonghe, and Gu Mingdao, returned to Nanjing on the same plane.
