FR940921-0-00019 FR940921-0-00010 4. The air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; and, 5. The area must have a fully approved maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A of the CAA. III. Review of State Submittal On June 14, 1994, Region IV determined that the information received from the NCDEM constituted a complete redesignation request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V, §§2.1 and 2.2. The North Carolina redesignation request for the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area meets the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E), noted above. The following is a brief description of how the State has fulfilled each of these requirements. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request. 1. Attainment of the CO NAAQS The North Carolina request is based on an analysis of quality assured CO air monitoring data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. The ambient air CO monitoring data for calendar year 1990 through calendar year 1993 shows no violations of the CO NAAQS in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area. The most recent ambient CO data for the calendar year 1994 continue to show no violations in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area. Because the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area has complete quality assured data showing no more than one exceedance of the standard per year over at least two consecutive years, the area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the CO NAAQS (40 CFR 50.9 and appendix C). North Carolina has committed to continue monitoring in this area in accordance with 40 CFR part 58. 2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D The 1990 CAA Amendments, modified section 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the CAA, EPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were due under the 1990 Amendments prior to or at the time the State submitted its redesignation request. A. Section 110 Requirements Although section 110 was amended by the 1990 Amendments, the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County SIP meets the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). The State implemented an Oxygenated Fuel program for the areas of Raleigh/Durham and Winston-Salem during the 1992 and 1993 winter seasons. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). B. Part D Requirements Before Winston-Salem/Forsyth County may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled the applicable requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 3 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified under section 186(a). The Winston-Salem area was classified as moderate (See 40 CFR 81.334). Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the State must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, specifically sections 172(c) and 176, and the requirements of subpart 3 of part D, which became due on or before April 27, 1994, the date the State submitted a complete redesignation request. EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(v) to mean that, for a redesignation request to be approved, the State must have met all requirements that become applicable to the subject area prior to or at time of the submission of the redesignation request. The area will become subject to the CAA that come due subsequent to the submission of the redesignation request until the request is approved (See section 175A(c)) and if the redesignation is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements. B1. Subpart 1 of Part D _Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator but no later than three years after an area is designated as nonattainment. Because Winston-Salem was designated as a new CO nonattainment area on June 6, 1992, the requirements are not due until June 6, 1995. Therefore, the submission of a New Source Review program and contingency measures required under 172(c) are not yet due. The Region is, however, in the process of approving the State's revised NSR regulation which includes CO nonattainment areas. Upon redesignation of these areas to attainment, the Prevent of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions contained in part C of title I are applicable. On June 12, 1975, December 30, 1976, June 19, 1978, August 7, 1980, February 23, 1982, and August 15, 1994, EPA approved revisions to the State of North Carolina's PSD program (See 40 FR 25004, 41 FR 56805, 43 FR 26388, 45 FR 52676, 47 FR 7836, 59 FR 41708).
