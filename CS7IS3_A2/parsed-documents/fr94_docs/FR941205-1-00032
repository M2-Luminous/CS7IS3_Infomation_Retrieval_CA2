FR941205-1-00032 FR941205-1-00012 The deemed inclusion rule could be used only by a service recipient whose compliance with applicable Form W&hyph;2 or 1099 reporting requirements was timely. Thus, for example, under the current reporting requirements, if amounts attributable to one or more section 83 transfers of property are includible in an employee's income in year 1 (and are not eligible for any reporting exemption), the employer generally would be required to furnish the employee a Form W&hyph;2 reflecting that amount by January 31 of year 2 and generally would be required to file a copy of the Form W&hyph;2 with the federal government by the last day of February of year 2. If the employer did report to the employee and the government in a timely manner, the employer would be able to rely on the deemed inclusion rule to claim a deduction for the amount in year 1. If the employee's Form W&hyph;2 were not furnished until after January 31 of year 2 or the government's copy of Form W&hyph;2 were not filed until after the last day of February of year 2, the employer generally would be required to demonstrate that the employee actually included the amount in income in order to support its deduction of such amount. Under the proposed amendments, a special rule would apply with respect to an amount includible in an employee's or former employee's income by reason of a disqualifying disposition of stock that had been acquired pursuant to a statutory stock option. In the case of such a disposition, a Form W&hyph;2 or W&hyph;2c (as appropriate) would have to be furnished to the employee or former employee, and filed with the federal government, only by the date on which the employer files its tax return (including an amended return) claiming a deduction for that amount. With respect to disqualifying dispositions, the proposed amendments would modify the conditions for an employer's deduction under section 83(h) in a manner that is not inconsistent with the guidance provided by Notice 87&hyph;49 (Changes to Incentive Stock Option Requirements by Section 321 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986), 1987&hyph;2 C.B. 355. The proposed amendments are not intended to have any effect on the application of Notice 87&hyph;49 or the analysis contained therein, and therefore should not be viewed as constituting a reconsideration of Revenue Ruling 71&hyph;52, 1971&hyph;1 C.B. 278, within the meaning of Notice 87&hyph;49. Although the withholding requirement would be eliminated as a prerequisite for claiming a deduction, the proposed amendments would not relieve the service recipient from any applicable withholding requirements of subtitle C or from the statutorily prescribed penalties or additions to tax for noncompliance with those requirements. Thus, for example, if an employer transferred to an employee property to which section 83 applies and failed to withhold income tax on the payment, the employer would be liable for the tax under section 3403. However, under section 3402(d), any tax liability assessed against the employer would be offset by any tax paid by the employee. In addition, nothing in this proposed regulation would relieve the service recipient from penalties or additions to tax for noncompliance with the requirements of section 6041 or 6041A (relating to information reporting) to the extent they otherwise apply. The proposed regulation that was published in the Federal Register on November 16, 1983 (48 FR 52079), proposing to amend the special rule in ยง1.83&hyph;6(a)(2), is hereby withdrawn. These amendments are proposed to be effective for deductions allowable for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. However, taxpayers may apply these proposed amendments when claiming a deduction for any year not closed by the statute of limitations. For example, if substantially vested (within the meaning of ยง1.83&hyph;3(b)) stock was transferred to an employee in 1992 upon the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, and if the calendar year employer furnished a Form W&hyph;2 to the employee by January 31, 1993, reflecting the income generated by such transfer, and filed the appropriate Form W&hyph;2 with the federal government by February 28, 1993, then the employer could apply these proposed amendments to claim a deduction for 1992 for the amount of the income, even if the employer failed to withhold in accordance with section 3402 and could not demonstrate actual inclusion in income by the employee. If that employer did not claim a deduction for the amount of the income on its 1992 tax return, it could file an amended return for 1992 claiming such a deduction pursuant to the proposed amendments, provided that 1992 is still an open year.
