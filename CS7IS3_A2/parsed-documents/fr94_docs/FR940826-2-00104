FR940826-2-00104 FR940826-2-00055 While the dangers of discrimination in these local landline exchange facilities is present, that danger can be constrained by injunction. The Department's proposed order specifically enjoins discrimination by the local exchange, directed either at competing wireless providers or at competing interexchange providers. Proposed Order, §VIII(L)(3)(a) (1), (2). In addition, Section VIII(L)(1)(c) and VIII(L)(2) make clear that the authority to provide interexchange services is limited to the BOC's Wireless Exchange Service, which must be physically and structurally separate from its local telephone operations. The long distance sales force in particular must be a distinct sales force, with separate managers, from any sales force that sells products or services of any local telephone company. Proposed Order, §VIII(L)(3)(g)(1). These requirements are sufficient to prevent discrimination in this narrow circumstance. Not only would such discrimination be prohibited explicitly, and subject to civil fine and loss of the authority to provide wireless interexchange services, Proposed Order, §VIII(L)(5), but it would also be quite difficult to accomplish effectively, under the restriction that the BOCs be limited to reselling other carriers' switched interexchange services. The resale requirement reduces the risk of discrimination in the local exchange, possibly even more than in the cellular switch. The BOCs will be sending their own long distance traffic over several carriers' facilities, which are also handling traffic originating in the local exchange (for which the BOCs may not compete). In addition, the BOCs will be sending their interexchange calls to interexchange carriers that will presumably also be serving their own customers that are subscribers of the BOC wireless service. If the quality of transmission, for example, was significantly better for the BOC's customers, it would be readily apparent to the interexchange carrier. In fact, any effort by the BOC to degrade the transmission of competitors' traffic might well result in adversely affecting its own interexchange customers. Moreover, since there are two cellular providers in each market, a BOC considering a strategy of degrading competitors' interexchange connections might be concerned that customers would not associate their service problems with the interexchange service, and thus might switch cellular carriers. It is also significant that the direct connection option exists for interexchange carriers deciding to obtain exchange access to their wireless customers without routing their calls through the LEC's switched network. The existence of this possibility could well deter discriminatory behavior out of concern that to do so would risk loss of access charge revenues. The benefits of discrimination in these circumstances are slight, and the risks of detection may be more substantial. D. Provisions for Incidental Relief from the Decree's Equal Access Requirements. The BOC's motion also seeks some incidental relief from the Decree's equal access requirements in connection with their paging and radiolocation businesses, and in connection with certain aspects of their cellular businesses. Subject to some minor clarification, the Department believes that these modifications (which AT&T has not previously opposed) are in the public interest. Section VIII(L)(2) of the Department's proposed order, which parallels Section II(a) of the BOCs' proposed order, states that the Decree's equal access and nondiscrimination requirements shall not apply to paging (with acknowledgement) or radiolocation. These are substantially competitive businesses, without the market power of cellular, and the Court has already granted generic interexchange relief for one-way paging. 54 The equal access relief confirmed here was implicit in that paging order, but this order confirms that a BOC paging affiliate may combine interexchange services necessary to provide paging with the paging services itself, and need not hand off interexchange links within the paging network to other carriers. The department's proposed order confirms that this relief does not relive BOC local exchanges of their equal access and nondiscrimination obligations towards unaffiliated paging companies; and that it does not implicitly grant the BOCs' motion for a waiver for 800 access to paging, which is now pending with the Court (and which the Department supports). (U.S. Mem., Feb. 1, 1993) 54 Memorandum and Order, United States v. Western Elec. Co. (D.D.C. Feb. 16, 1989). Paging with acknowledgement does not seem to be any more likely to pose competitive risks than one-way paging. Section VIII(L)(2)(e) of the Department's proposed order, which parallels Section II(b) of the BOCs' proposed order, provides that BOC cellular systems can transmit IS&hyph;41 and comparable administrative messages on a non-equal access basis, so long as they do not discriminate in favor of their own interexchange carrier in doing so. IS&hyph;41 is an industry standard that permits cellular systems to signal each other in order to, among other things, locate roaming subscribers and determine whether their cellular phones are available to receive calls. Only if the signaling messages indicate that the call can be completed is a voice path established to complete the call. The proposed order will permit the BOC cellular systems to use IS&hyph;41 to locate their subscribers; they will then be required to turn over the call to the customers's PIC (which could be the BOC or an unaffiliated carrier) to complete the call. Section VIII(L)(2)(3) of the Department's proposed order permits the BOCs to resell other cellular carriers' cellular services, whether or not those other carriers provide equal access. Today the BOC can resell other BOCs' cellular services, but not the services of cellular carriers that bundle cellular and interexchange services. This relief will permit the BOCs to resell the services of non-BOC cellular carriers, and thereby attempt to provide greater regional or national coverage, in competition with other providers who may seek to offer national presence (such as AT&T). This section also addresses the situation in which the customer of a non-equal access cellular system roams into the BOC cellular system. If that customer does not have a PIC, the BOC may complete that customer's long distance calls by using the BOC's long distance services. 55 55 This section also permits the BOCs to handle these default calls where the roaming customer has selected an interexchange carrier that does not serve the BOC system. The proposed modification, section VIII(L)(2)(f), would permit the BOCs to provide interexchange telecommunications services in connection with the offering of Cellular Digital packet Data Service (``CDPD''). Although not specifically requested by the BOCs, the department is including this service in its Proposed Order in view of the fact that a similar provision was included in the Final Judgment proposed in connection with AT&T's acquisition of McCaw. AT&T/McCaw Decree, §IV.H, see id. §II.F. This provision would allow interexchange transport of packetized data from the cell sites to centralized points before it is routed through a switching or routing device that is capable of handing it off onto separate facilities specified by the customer. At this centralized point the modification specifies that the CDPD provider will hand the message off to (or receive a message from) an Internet Node within the same exchange area, or transfer it to a private network facility or interexchange carrier specified by the customer. Interexchange facilities used by a BOC to transport the messages to and from the centralized points must be obtained from an unaffiliated interexchange carrier and the BOCs are not authorized to provide the interexchange carrier service of transporting the messages from the centralized points. The procedures for specifying the selection of the customer interexchange carrier for CDPD must be specified in the BOC's compliance plans before they may implement this provision. The Department's recommendation for this provision is based on our understanding that it will significantly facilitate the early provision of this important service especially in area of relatively low demand. These provisions give the BOCs the ability to offer and provide cellular services in a reasonably efficient manner, without seriously impairing the objectives of the decree's equal access provisions. None of these modifications will prevent a cellular customer from obtaining interexchange services from the carrier of their choice; these provisions will only permit the BOCs to offer cellular services to more customers more efficiently.
