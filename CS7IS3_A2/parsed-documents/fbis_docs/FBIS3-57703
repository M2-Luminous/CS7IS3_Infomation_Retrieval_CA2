Andrey Pecherov, chairman of the standing commission for issues of planning, finances, the budget, and prices, particularly noted in his speech that a change of parliament would inevitably occur. It is not ruled out that the functions of the president could be changed this year. There is in fact no prime minister or institution for managing the economy. Under these conditions it is necessary to confirm the fundamental indicators of both the plan and the budget. Pecherov proposed that the state budget be compiled for the year, but with confirmation every quarter. He assured the deputies that specialists are guaranteeing the implementation of indicators for both the plan and the budget. Touching on the proposals made by commissions concerning the expenditure part of the budget, Pecherov stressed that expenditure on the Army does not meet today's needs and contradicts military doctrine. This expenditure for 1994 is envisaged at 16,823,610,000,000 karbovantsi. On behalf of the commission, Pecherov proposed that the military part of the budget be reexamined by the Defense Council and presented to parliament for confirmation by 15 April. As regards pensions the commission chairman proposed that the pension fund be transferred from the Ministry of Social Protection to the Ministry of Finance, and that tough controls be established. The Commission for Issues of Planning, the Budget, Finance, and Prices made this proposal: "Until order is brought to the system of payment for labor in the national economy, to make additional payments as from 1 January to specialists in education, science, culture, health care, social security, and physical education, to the level of the average monthly wage of employees in the national economy as a whole, and to finance the said expenditure by general grants from the budget. On average 21 billion karbovantsi per month are needed for this, and approximately 12 trillion per year. The commission proposes that the government elaborates a procedure within two weeks for paying the said increases." Deputy Pecherov subjected the actions of the government to harsh criticism. The government does not want to assume responsibility. If this continues, noted Pecherov, then we will have nothing to discuss with the government.
