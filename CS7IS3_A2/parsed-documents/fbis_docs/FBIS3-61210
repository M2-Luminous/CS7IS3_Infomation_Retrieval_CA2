While Russian mass media reported that a 27-meter segment of the rail line was blown up, Armenian sources reported a 100-meter segment destroyed. It would not be correct to say that the explosion was unexpected, because it is easy to see that with the onset of the cold the gas pipeline and the railway entering Armenia from Georgia should become the favorite target of Azeri diversionists, given that the problem of guarding these lines of vital importance to the republic has not been solved. On 18 November, the Armenian foreign ministry issued a statement in connection with the explosion saying: "This terrorist diversion operation was planned and executed by the authorities of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This criminal act against the Armenian Republic and its people, a new manifestation of the policy of state terrorism endorsed by Azerbaijan, is an attempt by the warmongering circles of that state to bring the Armenian nation to its knees and to force the Armenian authorities to abandon the principle of finding a just and civilized solution to the Karabakh problem by methods that are categorically rejected by the international community. Azerbaijan has once again confirmed that political elements who are bent on solving the current conflict by the force of arms still enjoy strong influence in governing circles." In this particular instance the railway was repaired relatively quickly, and train traffic from Georgia into Armenia has resumed. However, nobody would be especially surprised if the explosions continue. While the explosions had two targets last year, the gas and the railway line, this year they have a third target: the Caucasian electrical power transmission line through which the Sakenergo administration is obligated to supply Armenia with electricity from Russia at the rate of 100 megawatts. It is nice to have trust, but it would not be bad if there were more substantial guarantees on issues that are of vital importance. Experience shows that such guarantees can only be had with the military control of communication routes. Once again we have to broach this issue because, despite various agreements, the gas pipeline and the rail line are generally not protected. Meanwhile, the situation in the republic is much worse than what it was last year despite the assurances given by the authorities. It turns out that the constantly-heard phrase "this is our last winter" also depends on the good will of our neighbors. Of course the Armenian gas repairmen have already rushed to the scene of the explosion. Of course, the prime ministers of Armenia and Georgia are having serious talks and will eventually remember the age-old friendship between our nations. However, those do not change anything and are not likely to change anything ever. The situation in the Azeri-populated eastern regions of Georgia is extremely tense, and the explosion of the railway line is an excellent opportunity to send [Georgian] military forces to protect that segment of the railway. Armenian units could join those forces thus reducing Georgia's burden significantly. After all it is not that hard to protect a 40-kilometer railway segment, and as they say: "If the mountain will not come to Mohammed... [Mohammed has to go to the mountain]."
