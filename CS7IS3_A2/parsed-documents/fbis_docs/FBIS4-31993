In his statement given to CTK, Grebenicek, chairman of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), said that the way in which Benes was being attacked and scandalized "is too reminiscent of the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler and Czech collaborators (with fascism)." "We reject resolutely any challenging of the results of World War Two because similar steps would be not only an offense to the millions of victims of fascism, but a dangerous step leading to the destabilization of the whole of Europe as well," the statement says. It warns that he who "supports the attacks (against the Benes decrees) threatens our national identity and opens up the road towards unlimited property restitution which would lead to the total collapse of not only the economy, but all social life in the Czech Republic." Under the decrees, some 2.5 [million] Sudeten Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia and their property was confiscated. The Sudeten German Landsmannschaft has now been claiming the property and the recognition of the right to homeland. [passage omitted]
