The shelling Saturday that killed 68 people and wounded some 200 in Sarajevo's crowded market, the single worst incident of the conflict, topped the agenda for a two-day meeting of EC foreign ministers. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe urged giving the Serbs an ultimatum to pull back their heavy guns and lift the siege of the Moslem-dominated capital or face the wrath of NATO warplanes. He told his colleagues here that the 22-month-old war in the former Yugoslav republic was "a test of our honour and capacity for action, a test of the European Union itself." Britain, which had been reluctant to back air operations around Sarajevo, seemed more disposed after three rounds of telephone talks Sunday between Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. "The case is very strong for airstrikes as long as it produces more good than harm," Hurd said. Other countries were more cautious, and stressed the need to keep the peace negotiations alive. UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has asked NATO to confirm its authorization of the use of its warplanes for airstrikes on artillery positions around the Serb-besieged city. North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ambassadors were meeting Monday and Dutch officials spoke of an emergency ministerial session of the 16-member alliance, possibly Tuesday. Diplomats here said the EC ministers would do little more than issue a statement which might refer to Juppe's proposals, and then wait for the U.S.-dominated NATO to decide its action. The market massacre aroused indignation to a pitch unprecedented in the Bosnian conflict which has left more than 200,000 people dead and the West's credibility in tatters after a string of empty threats. NATO has offered its air power to break the strangulation of the capital and other Moslem areas, to protect UN troops on the ground and to reopen Tuzla airport to relief flights. But it has yet to receive the green light from Boutros-Ghali. The Serbs deny responsibility for Saturday's mortar attack and UN experts say it is impossible to determine from where the shell came. But a British spokesman said the carnage had "increased the collective willingness to consider military action around Sarajevo." Hurd told reporters that any airstrikes must take in account the humanitarian operations and need to safeguard UN forces from reprisals. They must also advance peace prospects, he said. "That is not to rule out the use of air power...in principle we are willing to use it," the chief British diplomat said. Italy and Belgium strongly backed the French call for action if the Serbs do not withdraw their big guns more than 30 kilometeres (19 miles) from the city and put them under UN control. "I believe this time our dignity and credibility are at stake," said Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. "I am convinced that this time we are not in a position to step back." Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino called for use of all political and military means to avert looming spring offensives in Bosnia. "Without the use of force it would be impossible to resolve differences between Serbs and Moslems," he said. But other countries such as Spain, Denmark, Portugual and Greece were more cautious on the possibility on using military force in the Bosnian conflict. "The soution will be a negotiated solution, a non-military solution, so that a durable peace can be achieved," Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said. U.S. President Bill Clinton said Sunday that airstrikes would have to wait until U.S. allies reached a consensus. He also put the accent on achieving a negotiated peace settlement.
