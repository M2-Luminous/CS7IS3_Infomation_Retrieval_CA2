There is always great hope that you and your brother workers will make your people really feel that everyday you extend to them a higher level of service than others in the same circumstances could offer them. Among the things that we know is the fact that when one supposes that he has done his best and cannot offer a higher level of service he will stop both his intellectual development and the introduction of new challenges or incentives for himself. In this country, the state of Iraq--knowing that you are its ministers--such a feeling should be unknown to us all. We should feel satisfied--should anything we do actually call for satisfaction--with what we have offered, along with the strong feeling that we can offer something still better in quality and taking into account the calculations of quantity or numbers. The circumstances of your people are difficult. They have been imposed on us by the unjust despot. Leading those who are taking the position of doing harm to and premeditated malice against the Iraqi people are the United States and Zionism. The blockade has been continuing for four years, that is since the cease-fire went into effect after a decision made by the former U.S. President on 28 February 1991. We have thus far dealt with the Security Council resolutions as part of the diplomatic efforts and what they suggest in terms of possibilities designed to overcome any obstacle and deal with the unfair resolutions in a way that achieves a better level of understanding by the Security Council. We hoped, and perhaps we expected or rather many people in our country and the world expected that this level of dealings on the part of Iraq, although the resolutions are unfair and unjust and carry a measure of premeditated malice by known people in the Security Council who have an effective role in passing the resolutions, including the United States, would realize a level of achievement--despite the unfair resolutions--that would make some people, whose hearts have no feeling, show a flexible position and open the doors again to the Iraqi people so they can live in freedom, as they should. However, others were quite convinced that the criminal level of the aggression and the way sanctions were implemented on Iraq, including the embargo resolution, came from minds without any conscience. Therefore, despite Iraq's offers and responses, those concerned will discover that there is nothing being given in return. Besides, what was talked about in terms of Security Council obligations is nothing more than a tactical cover to make Iraq fulfill its obligations without the Security Council having to fulfill its own obligations. This is because members of the Security Council do not have enough freedom to say what they want to say. Moreover, the Security Council does not have standards based on fairness and justice because there are those who oppose such standards and can influence them in the opposite direction. As I have repeatedly said, there is a daily instigator that encourages America and Zionism to conspire against the Arab nation. According to the treasonous and tendentious ones, Iraq is among the first against whom they should conspire. This is because of Iraq's stand toward the principles which make the Arab nation gain more honor--after it further enhances its honor based on our nation's inherited high standards and behavior. Iraq is working in this direction and is known for its stand on entrenching these values. Everyday one commission comes and another one goes. They have destroyed the weapons, the plants, and the factories they wanted to destroy--apart from what had already been destroyed by their warplanes and missiles. They got all the information they asked for. They said they wanted future guarantees before fulfilling their obligations toward Iraq. Despite this, Iraq agreed on the so- called long-term monitoring. All the resolutions that deal with Iraq's obligations were implemented according to the sequence set by the Security Council and in accordance with the priorities of these resolutions. Despite all this, they still tell Iraqi diplomats that if you did this then it will be possible to lift the embargo or at least implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. We mean section C of Resolution 687. After the initial resolutions, they issued a series of resolutions, some of which do not represent the essence of the initial resolutions. At times, the latter resolutions were even in contradiction with some paragraphs of the initial resolutions, on which the conditions for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and Iraq's compliance with the destruction of the so-called weapons of mass destruction were built. This includes Resolution 715. At last, we asked: What is left? They said: Only this resolution, no. 715, is left. As soon as you approve it, we will write a report to the UN Security Council. We said: Iraq's obligations have been fulfilled, you should fulfill yours, starting with the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. In short, this paragraph provides for allowing Iraq to export its products, chiefly oil. Iraq said: We are not convinced that this resolution should be discussed now. We should work in accordance with the sequence of the clauses of Resolution 687 and its mutual obligations. However, we approved that resolution in order to end our people's suffering. They responded: What? No. First, we will start monitoring and make sure that Iraq is implementing it the way we want--the way Ekeus wants--in order to make sure that Iraq is committed. Afterward, we will consider submitting a report to the UN Security Council so that it would look into Paragraph 22. Well, we asked, when will you start? You have already started monitoring, have you not? What is monitoring? Does it require anything more than installing cameras? We asked: In your assessment, how long would this process take? You have already started it. The cameras are installed and recording. We said: Fine, when will you start to count time? Ekeus said the operation may take six months. After he departed, he said that some say six months, some say one year. Who are those some? Well, when will we start? What about those months that you have already spent monitoring? Are not they counted? When will you tell us that you have started, so that we can start counting? How long do you need? Three months, four months, six months? When can we say, for example, one or two months have passed, four months to go? This is needed so that the Iraqi people will be able to make their plans, see what they can do, and prepare themselves psychologically and economically for the required duration. He kept coming and going, everyday emerging with statements without a clear specification of the time after which the implementation of Paragraph 22 can start. Well, how long will the Iraqi people wait, and how can they accept the diplomacy of the fox of the jungle? We and the Iraqi people have spent much time hearing this and contacting and seeing people. It is their right to choose alternatives if they discover that this way will not lead to a positive result that can save them from this injustice or put them in a better position to be able to deal with life without this injustice; namely, the blockade and the parallels imposed on northern and southern Iraq. On this occasion, the Security Council says in one of its resolutions that it is obliged to do everything that will secure Iraq's sovereignty. Isn't that true, specialists? Well, where is Iraq's sovereignty? It is the Security Council's permanent member states that imposed these parallels in violation of Iraq's sovereignty. They issue resolutions but they do not apply them when it comes to their obligations and they even violate them in public. Deputy Prime Minister comrade Tariq 'Aziz is scheduled to leave for the UN Security Council. He will clearly explain to them that we have fulfilled our obligations. According to logic and fair and just treatment, they have to fulfill their obligations. If they do not implement their obligations now, they will not have the simplest excuse with which to cover their delay. They should implement Provision 22 immediately and without any conditions. If comrade Tariq 'Aziz returns without obtaining the Security Council's agreement to meet its obligations and if there is no hope that the injustice will be lifted from the Iraqi people, then the Iraqi people and their leadership can do nothing else but decide what they believe will give them hope, God willing, in the direction they believe is sound. Therefore, the ministers should take steps to prolong their people's patience as much as much possible and to speed up efforts to achieve as much public service as possible. Rely on God.
