[Zhirinovskiy] The polls are rubbish. Before the elections they said Zhirinovskiy would hardly make the minimum required quota, but I won. The press publishes those polls because it is paid to do so. It is paid to do me in. However, nobody will do me in, and I will destroy them all. [Prokofiev] Who is paying and who wants to destroy you? [Zhirinovskiy] The mafia wants to do me in, because I will exterminate it the day after the elections, when I become president of the state. As soon as I enter the Kremlin, I will issue a decree to exterminate organized crime. Ten thousand gang leaders will be arrested and executed in public ceremonies. That is what I will do to them. So, the mafia is afraid and is paying for this character assassination. And you, the journalists, publish it. You are turncoats. You are constantly inciting. And then you are surprised when a journalist disappears here and another is murdered there. If you go on inciting and slandering, everybody will start killing you off. [Prokofiev] Are you sure you will become the next president of the state in spite of what you call the incitement and slander against you? [Zhirinovskiy] No doubt about it. There are no other candidates. If elections are held this year, I will get 55 percent of the vote in the first round. If the elections are held in two years, then all the better. By then I will be 50, the voters will give me a present, and I will probably get 70 percent. There are no other candidates. There simply are not. All the politicians who are identified with the government do not stand a chance because they are responsible for the poverty, inflation, and organized crime. A genocide, that is what is happening here. Sexual deviation and death throes. The health minister says there are fewer abortions now. Sure there are less. After all, almost all the women who can still have abortions have already emigrated from Russia. That is what the current regime has done. And, there is nobody in the opposition who the people know as well as they know me. When I visit the Russian countryside, people kiss my hands. They truly overwhelm me with their kissing. They know I am the only one here protecting the rights of the Russian people. Nobody believes the libel you spread about me, such as that I am a fascist, a Jew hater, and whatnot. The name of my party is the Liberal Democratic Party. So, I am a liberal and a democrat, and cannot be either a fascist or an anti- Semite. [passage omitted] [Prokofiev] So, you do not have any problems with the Jews? [Zhirinovskiy] There are no problems. I am neither an anti- Semite nor a Zionist. That does not interest me at all. Many Jewish journalists claim that I am anti-Semite, but that is only because the mafia pays them off. Other journalists claim that I am a Zionist, and they are also paid by the underworld. [Prokofiev] You also said that the CIA pays. [Zhirinovskiy] Sure, the CIA pays. The Americans do not want Russia to have a strong and intelligent leader who will take care of national interests. But they will fail. Everybody will fail, I will be the next president, and Russia will triumph.
