FR940511-2-00070 FR940511-2-00046 6. Closure and post-closure care requirements (40 CFR 258.60 and 258.61); 7. Financial assurance criteria governing applicability and effective date, and allowable mechanisms (40 CFR 258.70 and 258.74). Not all States/Tribes will have existing permit programs through which they can ensure compliance with all provisions of the revised Federal Criteria. Were EPA to restrict a State/Tribe from submitting its application until it could ensure compliance with the entirety of 40 CFR part 258, many States/Tribes would need to postpone obtaining approval of their permit programs for a significant amount of time. This delay in determining the adequacy of the State/Tribal permit program while the State/Tribe revises its statutes, codes or regulations could impose a substantial burden on owners and operators of landfills because the State/Tribes would be unable to exercise the flexibility available to States/Tribes with permit programs which have been approved as adequate. The Campo Band needs to revise aspects of its permit program to ensure compliance with the following provisions of the Federal Criteria: 1. Groundwater monitoring and corrective action criteria for groundwater monitoring systems, sampling and analysis requirements, detection monitoring program, assessment monitoring program, and corrective action implementation (40 CFR 258.51, 258.53, 258.54, 258.55, and 258.58). Although existing CEPA regulations ensure compliance with the federal assessment of corrective measures and selection of remedy requirements (40 CFR 258.56 and 258.57) in and of themselves, it would be impossible to separate compliance with these portions of CEPA's regulations from the rest of CEPA's groundwater monitoring program. Therefore, if CEPA does not fully adopt draft regulatory changes to the groundwater monitoring systems, sampling and analysis requirements, detection monitoring program, assessment monitoring program, and corrective action implementation requirements, EPA cannot approve CEPA for the assessment of corrective measures and selection of remedy portions of its program. 2. Financial assurance criteria for closure, post-closure and corrective action (40 CFR 258.71, 258.72, and 258.73). The Campo Band submitted an amendment to its application for program adequacy determination on April 18, 1994. The Campo Band's amendment included draft revised requirements for those parts of the Campo Band's existing program that are not adequate to ensure compliance with the federal criteria. EPA Region 9 reviewed the Campo Band's amendment to its application and determined that these draft regulatory requirements would be adequate to ensure compliance with the Federal Criteria. If the draft regulatory requirements submitted to EPA on April 18, 1994 are fully adopted before EPA makes a final determination, then EPA proposes to fully approve the Campo Band's MSWLF program. If all the necessary draft regulatory requirements are not adopted with the relevant effective dates or are adopted with altered language that would not clearly assure compliance with the Federal Criteria, then EPA proposes to partially approve the Campo Band's program. Partial approval would only be for those portions of the Campo Band program that assure compliance with the Federal Criteria. In addition, before EPA grants partial or full program approval, the Campo Band must reaffirm the February 13, 1994 promulgation of the emergency regulations submitted with the Campo Band's February 15, 1994 final application. Although the Campo Band's emergency regulations are currently in effect, they remain in effect only 180 days after February 13, 1994 unless the original promulgation is affirmed. The emergency regulations must be affirmed without altered language that would not clearly assure compliance with the Federal Criteria in order for EPA to approve those portions of the Campo Band program governed by the emergency regulations. The Campo Band has demonstrated that the Campo Band of Mission Indians is a Federally recognized Tribe. See 53 FR 52830 (December 29, 1988). The Constitution (the ``Constitution'') of the Campo Band of Mission Indians establishes a General Council that serves as the Campo Band's governing body and enumerates the Council's powers and responsibilities. Among the enumerated powers, the Constitution authorizes the General Council to establish subordinate entities for the Band and, by appropriate ordinances and resolutions, to delegate to such subordinate entities any of the powers and duties of the General Council. Pursuant to this power under the Constitution and by Resolution No. 88&hyph;005, the General Council established the Campo Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA) for the purpose of protecting public health and safety and the environment. CEPA is charged with the administration and enforcement of the solid waste management permitting and regulatory compliance programs. All land within the Campo Reservation is tribal trust land. The Campo Band has established that the Campo Band of Mission Indians has adequate jurisdiction over the land of the Campo Reservation based on general principles of Tribal sovereignty, the Band's status as a ``federally recognized Indian Tribe,'' the Tribal Constitution, a map and narrative description which established the boundaries of the Reservation and copies of Tribal codes and regulations. In making today's tentative determination that the Campo Band's MSWLF permit program is adequate, the Agency has tentatively determined that the Tribe has adequate authority over the activities regulated by such a program. In its application, the Campo Band has also demonstrated that it has adequate resources to manage a MSWLF permit program and adequate authority to issue permits, ensure compliance monitoring and enforcement, and to provide for intervention in civil enforcement proceedings. Region 9 will hold a public hearing on this determination from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. June 30, 1994 at the Alpine Elementary School Auditorium, 1850 Alpine Blvd., Alpine, California, 91901. An open house is scheduled for 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. on June 30, 1994 at the Alpine Elementary School Auditorium to give the public an opportunity to discuss the tentative approval before the hearing. The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until the close of the public comment period July 14, 1994. Copies of the Campo Band's application and supporting documents are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of adequacy or inadequacy for the Campo Band's program. EPA will make a final determination on whether or not to approve the Campo Band's program and will give notice of it in the Federal Register . The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that approval of the Tribal MSWLF permit program will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Authority This notice is issued under the authority of sections 2002, 4005 and 4010(c) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended; 42 U.S.C. 6912, 6945, 6949a(c). Dated: April 29, 1994.
