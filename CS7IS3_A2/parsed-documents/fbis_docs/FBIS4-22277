Specialists believe that SibNet will institute superior computerized communications within the Russia-U.S.-China triangle through the American Intelsat communications satellite. Yesterday the chief executors of the project--Datron Systems, Inc., an American company; Gorizont, a scientific and technical firm in Shushenskoye (Krasnoyarsk Kray); and several Siberian communications enterprises--announced the formation of a joint venture to establish the satellite communications system in Siberia. The articles of incorporation had been signed the day before. The cost of the first phase of the project has been estimated at 2.5 million dollars. The involvement of American firms--Pentagon contractors--in the work on technological projects in Russia apparently has already become a standard of performance. In any case, in a conversation with the KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Chairman Sergey Yemelyanov of the Telecommunications Coordinating Council of the Sibirskoye Soglasheniye Interregional Association did not neglect to underscore the prestige of the Datron Company (the supplier of the electronic equipment which proved to be so dependable in Operation "Desert Storm" in the Persian Gulf) and the firm's 25 years of experience working for the U.S. military establishment. The participation of local investors and producers is also becoming an essential condition of large communications projects in Russia. According to this plan, for example, the station transmitting the coded data through the Russian Gorizont satellite will be equipped with antennae made in Russia with Russian technology. The only American components will be the electronic equipment of the five stations that are to be located in the Siberian mountains and one station in the Far East, capable of transmitting data to Datron in the United States through Intelsat. Mr. Yemelyanov promised that the installation and user fees of the SibNet communications system would be much lower than the Moscow rates for comparable systems. In the near future the new joint venture also plans to enter the world market, offering similar stations to consumers with a need for high-caliber communications. China's interest in participating in the SibNet project is a result, according to the council director, of the activities of Chinese firms in Siberia and the Far East, where telephone communications still leave much to be desired. That is why the possibility of opening a teleport in Singapore is now being discussed in earnest.
