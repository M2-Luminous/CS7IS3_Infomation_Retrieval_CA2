Condemning Ozawa's outburst as an unpardonable insult and challenge to the Korean people, he in the statement said: "We demand that Ozawa immediately withdraw and apologize for his grave remarks that insulted the DPRK and the Korean people and threatened peace and security on the Korean peninsula. "We hope conscientious politicians including those of the ruling party and broad Japanese people will not overlook Ozawa's remarks but make efforts to get the Japanese authorities' Korea policy rectified. "The Korean citizens in Japan will in the future, too, develop friendly relations with the Japanese people on the basis of the idea of independence, friendship and peace."
