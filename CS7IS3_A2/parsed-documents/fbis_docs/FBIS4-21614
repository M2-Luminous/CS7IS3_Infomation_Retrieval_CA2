"Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told his South Korean counterpart Han Sung-chu that if the international community applied pressure on North Korea, then North Korea would have no choice but to take military action," the source said. Qian was quoted as stressing China's belief that the situation should not be allowed to deteriorate and that dialogue among the countries concerned must continue. Qian reportedly admitted that China would be put in an awkward position if North Korea were slapped with economic sanctions through a United Nations Security Council resolution. The official quoted Qian as saying, "China does not want to see a UN observation party deployed at the Chinese border with North Korea to monitor whether economic sanctions on North Korea are being implemented." Qian, adding that such action might trigger an exodus of North Koreans into China as well as compel North Korea into provoking a war, suggested that China would oppose economic sanctions against Pyongyang, the official said. Meanwhile, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stressed at his summit with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam the "four-party, three-channel" solution -- that is, resolution through three channels of talks between South and North Korea, between North Korea and the United States, and between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Jiang told South Korean journalists that if tension continued to mount on the Korean peninsula, the first to suffer would be the Korean people.
