AL-BAYAN cited Palestinian sources as saying that this request came in the wake of reports that reached the Palestinian command that some of the armed Fatah members in the occupied territories are planning with elements from Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] to stage widespread acts of revenge in retaliation for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. On the other hand, the same paper cited Hamas sources in Amman, Jordan, as saying that the group has agreed not to take military action at present and limit itself to civil disobedience and popular rebellion. The sources added that Hamas agreed to this on the conditions that it be for a limited period of time and that this agreement would come after the PLO command informed it that there is an imminent agreement with the United States to provide international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories.
