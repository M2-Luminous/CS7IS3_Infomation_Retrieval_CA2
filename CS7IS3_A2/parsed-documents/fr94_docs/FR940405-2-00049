FR940405-2-00049 FR940405-2-00025 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;306&hyph;000] Texas Utilities Fuel Co.; Petition for Declaratory Order March 30, 1994. Take notice that on March 22, 1994, Texas Utilities Fuel Company (TUFCO), 400 North Olive Street, Dallas, Texas 75201, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;306&hyph;000 a petition for declaratory order requesting that the Commission declare that TUFCO's transportation and delivery of natural gas to a Hinshaw pipeline that engages in transactions under an Order No. 63 certificate would not render TUFCO, its facilities, any gas flowing through its facilities or any facilities or natural gas in the facilities with which TUFCO is interconnected, subject to the Commission's Natural Gas Act (NGA) jurisdiction, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. TUFCO states that it is an intrastate natural gas pipeline operating solely within the State of Texas. TUFCO further states that it is presently exempt from NGA jurisdiction by reason of section 1(b) of the NGA (15 U.S.C. 717(b) (1993)) and is an intrastate pipeline under section 2(16) of the NGPA (15 U.S.C. 3301(16) (1982)). TUFCO says that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Texas Utilities Company, an investor-owned holding company for an electric utility system. TUFCO's primary function is to provide a reliable and secure supply of gas to its affiliate, Texas Utilities Electric Company (TU Electric), an operating electric public utility company, which is regulated by the Public Utility Commission of Texas. TUFCO indicates that it purchases gas directly from Texas producers, intrastate pipelines and other marketers of natural gas in the State of Texas. Gas purchased by TUFCO is delivered into its intrastate pipeline system and is redelivered to the electric generation stations of TU Electric, it is stated. TUFCO also provides intrastate transportation services to shippers at times when capacity is available in its system in excess of that required to serve TU Electric. TUFCO says it does not provide interstate transportation service under NGPA section 311. TUFCO states that it has been requested by potential shippers to transport gas through its system for delivery to Seagas Pipeline Company (Seagas). It is further stated that these shippers would then arrange for transportation by Seagas to markets located within Texas, either directly or through additional interconnecting pipelines. TUFCO submits that all of the gas transported by TUFCO would be contractually committed to consumers in Texas. TUFCO says it also desires to exchange gas with Seagas. As proposed, TUFCO would deliver gas to Seagas at various points on Seagas' system in exchange for a like quantity of gas at other points. However, TUFCO states it would not receive any interstate gas from Seagas. Each point of redelivery to TUFCO would be from gathering or production facilities in Texas to ensure that all of the gas received by TUFCO would be intrastate gas, not commingled with the interstate gas in the Seagas system. TUFCO states that Seagas is a Hinshaw pipeline in Texas, exempt from Commission jurisdiction under NGA section 1(c). Phillips Natural Gas Company, 43 FERC Â¶62,049(1988). TUFCO further states that Seagas also holds an Order No. 63 certificate that allows it to transport gas that will be delivered out of the state of Texas, without losing its NGA section 1(c) exempt status. Id. TUFCO says that none of the gas received by TUFCO from Seagas will have been transported in, or commingled with gas transported in interstate commerce. However, TUFCO states that because the gas delivered by TUFCO to Seagas in each of the above transactions may be commingled with gas in Seagas's line that will be delivered out-of-state under an Order No. 63 certificate, TUFCO seeks a declaration from the Commission that its transportation of that gas before delivery to Seagas, or other Hinshaw pipelines under similar circumstances, would not subject TUFCO, its facilities, any gas transported by TUFCO, or the facilities of others, to NGA jurisdiction. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should on or before April 20, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8100 Filed 4&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
