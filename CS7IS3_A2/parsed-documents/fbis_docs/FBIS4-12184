It was another test balloon through which the Tel Aviv rulers aimed to measure the international community's reaction to and influence on the course of events. Despite the existing peace process and all attempts at self-restraint by the Arabs, these events are becoming increasingly tragic and bloody and -- due to the Israeli policy -- are placing the region at the point of no return, moving it toward a catastrophic conflagration that could take place at any moment. All news agencies and political observers were unanimous that the events that have taken place in Hebron during the past 24 hours and the large-scale Israeli military operations carried out by thousands of occupation forces -- operations which turned the city that has been besieged for one month into a battlefield targeting congested Palestinian areas and in which houses next to the mosque were destroyed by rockets and anti-tank missiles -- are a new massacre. These events and military operations show that last month's massacre was only the beginning and that the perpetrator is different only in name. There is no difference between a regular soldier wearing a helmet and an armed settler. The settlers are the backbone and the reserve of the Israeli military force; they are also the spearhead and tool of expansion, aggression, terrorism, and organized crime. The new massacre in Hebron coincided with the endeavor of the Clinton administration, in the form of moves by U.S. coordinator Dennis Ross in the involved capitals, to activate the peace process and to give momentum to the obstructed peace process, as well as in the wake of Security Council Resolution 904. In addition, the new massacre coincided with the feverish Israeli military escalation against the cities and villages in southern Lebanon. Israeli crimes and killings have reached even school children. All this does not hold out any hope that Israel will succumb to the will of peace, that it will respect the points of reference, that it will respect the resolutions of international legitimacy and its charters, that it will abandon belligerence and racist terrorism, or that it will restore the Arab's usurped lands and rights. These events present new evidence of the aggressive nature rooted deeply in the Zionist strategy and of its impossible coexistence with peace. These events also emphasize the need to exert international pressure, to abandon quiet diplomacy, and to adopt the language of force in order to make the rulers of Israel follow the right path and accept the requirements of a just and comprehensive peace with which all occupation injustice and evils will end and rights will be returned to their owners. Israel's practices and continued bloody terrorism have raised many important questions regarding peace, its feasibility, and the credibility of those responsible for implementing the resolutions of international legitimacy and for maintaining world peace. Israel's practices and bloody terrorism constitute a serious threat that needs a firm and swift response from the international community and the U.S. sponsor -- whose role, initiative, and interests are being targeted -- to champion credibility and resolutions that are still being violated openly so that Israel will not remain above the laws of the international community and above questioning and punishment. We do not need to wait longer to see more massacres and slaughtering by the Tel Aviv rulers who kill every opportunity for peace. We, as well as the world, want to see the resolutions of international legitimacy implemented expeditiously in order to protect and secure the citizens in the occupied territories. A firm stand should be taken to curb Israeli aggression and to force it to withdraw from all occupied Arab territory.
