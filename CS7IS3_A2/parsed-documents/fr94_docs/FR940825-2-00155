FR940825-2-00155 FR940825-2-00098 Specialized Small Business Investment Companies AGENCY: Small Business Administration. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This Notice clarifies SBA's position on the permissible sources of funds for the repurchase of 3% preferred tock from the Agency by specialized small business investment companies. Under the narrow circumstances described in this Notice, the stock may be repurchased with ``idle funds'' of the company. DATES: This Notice is effective on August 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Edward L. Cleveland, Special Assistant to the Associate Administrator for Investment, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20416, (202) 205&hyph;7581. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 1, 1994, SBA published a Notice in the Federal Register setting forth the guidelines SBA would follow in its implementation of the 3% Preferred Stock Repurchase Program for Small Business Investment Companies licensed under section 301(d) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (SSBICs). See 59 FR 15491. SBA has determined that those guidelines require further clarification as they relate to the use of ``idle funds'' to finance a repurchase transaction. SBA reiterates its position that the financing of a repurchase with cash already in an SSBIC is inconsistent with the policy of avoiding the transfer of cash flows from SSBICs into the Agency. Under certain unique circumstances, however, an SSBIC's idle funds may be a permissible temporary source of funds. If an SSBIC (i) has retained earnings available for distribution which, when capitalized, would be insufficient to pay the full repurchase price, (ii) has no outstanding indebtedness to SBA or any other party, and (iii) holds unencumbered publicly traded and marketable securities with an unrealized gain (after deducting any allowances for prospective income taxes and other contingent liabilities such as incentive compensation) equal to at least 20 percent of the difference between the repurchase price and the capitalizable retained earnings, SBA will permit the SSBIC to use its idle funds in the financing of its repurchase transaction provided that, based on its most recent financials submitted with its application for repurchase, cash and idle funds remaining in the SSBIC after the repurchase would be more than the total loans and investments made by the SSBIC during the prior two fiscal years. SBA's permission would be conditioned upon the following: (1) The SSBIC would be required to capitalize its retained earnings available for distribution. Idle funds would be used only to fund the difference between the repurchase price and the capitalizable retained earnings. (2) The use of idle funds in the financing of a repurchase transaction would be a temporary measure only. Within two years of using idle funds in its repurchase transaction, the SSBIC must ``replace'' those funds by increasing its private capital through the sale of stock for cash to non-SBA sources or through a capitalization of retained earnings available for distribution. (3) Until private capital is increased in the manner described in the preceding paragraph, the SSBIC must continue to hold unencumbered publicly traded and marketable securities with a value, after allowances, of not less than two times the amount of capital yet to be raised by the SSBIC. Failure to comply with this paragraph or the preceding paragraph could result in the transfer of the SSBIC to the Office of Liquidation.
