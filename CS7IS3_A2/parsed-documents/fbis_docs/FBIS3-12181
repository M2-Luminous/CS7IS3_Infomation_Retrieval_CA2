In the cabinet session today, Meretz ministers will demand that all the extreme settlers who advocate murder be arrested at once; that extremists be taken out of Tal al-Rumaydah, Hadassah House, and Romano House in the heart of Hebron; that the Army be instructed not to shoot at Palestinians in the territories; and that all that has so far been agreed on in the talks with the PLO be implemented at once. Minister Shulamit Aloni told our correspondent Sheli Yehimovich that Meretz will also demand that the Kakh Movement be outlawed. According to her, we should make a distinction between idiots who speak out of their stupidity, and real instigators. She added that the remarks by Police Minister Moshe Shahal that the police are dealing with Arab and Jewish murderers along the same criteria are not true, and there is discrimination. At the same time, she opposes the demand that the house of Barukh Goldstein be sealed, just as she opposes sealing the homes of Arabs. Minister Aloni added that the reserved condemnation of the Hebron massacre by the settler leaders borders on racism and viciousness. She added that Goldstein was not operating in a vacuum. In Israel, there is a nursery of Arab-hating racists who are after Arabs' lives and property, she said.
