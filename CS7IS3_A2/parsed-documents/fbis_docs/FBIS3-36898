Our correspondent asked him to comment further on this. [Chanturiya] We have lost the war. This is a fact. Moreover, Georgia is not in a position today to wage a full-scale war. We will be ready to do this only when we have a full-fledged state and, as a consequence of this, a real battleworthy army. The only thing that we can really do is to wage a partisan war. We should not allow our enemies to relax for a minute. Otherwise, in a year or two, we will be faced with new realities with which we will have to come to terms and then Abkhazia will also be lost from the legal point of view. [Tskhoragueli] What about the peace talks, the peacekeeping forces, the return of the refugees...? [Chanturiya] I am not against peace talks so long as they enable us to win time. As for peacekeeping forces, this is a tall story with which they are trying to console us. There will be no UN troops there. The role of peacekeepers will be fulfilled by the same forces that were there before. Only those people who agree to register themselves as Abkhazians can return to Abkhazia today.... If we want to lose Abkhazia forever and accelerate the process of the Abkhazation of Georgians and, finally, legalize the results of the war, we should agree to the introduction of Russian troops into Abkhazia. If not, I once more repeat that the only way out, proceeding from current realities, is a partisan war. [Tskhoragueli] You spoke of antigovernment actions that are being prepared. Do you have grounds for making such a statement or is this just supposition? [Chanturiya] The new government is repeating many of the mistakes that Gamsakhurdia made. The mass media has again been monopolized. The population is on the brink of a social explosion and there already exist specific forces that are ready to take advantage of this. Our party is opposed to any kind of confrontations since this would be the final blow for Georgia. However, events are developing precisely in this direction. "Dark" forces are just waiting for the right climatic conditions.
