FR941028-0-00018 FR941028-0-00007 This stay affects only those sources that had been required to comply with 40 CFR 63.164 and 63.170 as of October 24, 1994 ( see 40 CFR 63.100(k)(3)(i) and 63.190(e)(2)). It does not affect those sources required to comply as of January 23, 1995, or later ( see 40 CFR 63.100(k)(3)(ii) through (k)(3)(v). In the proposal contained in today's Federal Register , however, EPA is proposing a compliance extension for the sources required to comply as of January 23, 1995, or later, as well as the sources required to comply as of October 24, 1994. Accordingly, today's stay does not affect all sources with compressors or surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. II. Issuance of Stay The EPA hereby issues a 3-month administrative stay of the effectiveness of the HON equipment leak provisions applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers for sources required to comply beginning on October 24, 1994. The EPA will reconsider the compliance dates in the rule and, following the notice and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, will take appropriate action. III. Authority for Stay and Reconsideration The administrative stay and reconsideration announced by this notice are being undertaken pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B). That provision authorizes the Administrator to stay the effectiveness of a rule for up to 3 months in order to consider a request for reconsideration. Reconsideration is appropriate if the grounds for an objection arose after the period for public comment and if the objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule. The grounds for reconsideration of this rule arose after the public comment period. The problems attendant to requiring compliance with the equipment leak provisions applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers only became apparent after the close of comment on the rule. Therefore, the EPA is staying the effectiveness of the rule for 3 months in order to allow time to reconsider this issue. IV. Proposed Compliance Extension The EPA may not be able to complete the reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rule stayed by this notice within the 3-month period expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). If the EPA does not complete the reconsideration in this timeframe, then it will be necessary to temporarily extend the applicable compliance dates. In the Proposed Rule Section of today's Federal Register , the EPA proposes a temporary extension of the compliance dates beyond 3 months if necessary in order to complete reconsideration and revision of the rules in question. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities.

Browner, Administrator.
