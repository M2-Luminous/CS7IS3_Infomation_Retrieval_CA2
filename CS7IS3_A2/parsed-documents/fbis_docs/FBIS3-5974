Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters in Jakarta today that a trade law like Super 310 should not be imposed because it amounts to an unilateral act. The U.S. policy of reenacting the trade law has also been criticized by France. French Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet said the U.S. decision was unjustifiable as it was directed against a certain nation like Japan. According to Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, it is improper for the United States to use political, military, and financial influence to serve its business interests. Minister Ali Alatas swore in the consuls general of the Republic of Indonesia for New York and Berlin in Jakarta this afternoon. Accordingly, the minister asked the Consulate General of the Republic of Indonesia in New York to consistently monitor any problems in relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the United States, including the issue of workers, to maintain good bilateral relations.
