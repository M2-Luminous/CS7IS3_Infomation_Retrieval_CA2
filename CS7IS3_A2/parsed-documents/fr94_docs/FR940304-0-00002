ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to establish the method used to add cost-of-living adjustments (COLA's) to recomputed annuities of former Members of Congress who perform additional service after retirement as Members and the method for determining that cap on COLA's as it affects these former Members and under the Civil Service Retirement System. These regulations interpret section 8340 of title 5, United States Code, as it affects these computations. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 4, 1994. These regulations apply to benefits based on reemployment that begins on or after the effective date. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harold L. Siegelman, (202) 606&hyph;0299. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 10, 1993, we published (at 58 FR 59658) proposed regulations to establish the method used to add cost-of-living adjustments (COLA's) to recomputed annuities of former Members of Congress who perform additional service after retirement as Members and the method for determining the cap on COLA's as it affects these former Members under the Civil Service Retirement System. We received no comments on the proposed regulations. E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation I have determined that is not a major rule as defined under section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the regulation will only affect former Members of Congress who are reemployed by the Government and their survivors.
