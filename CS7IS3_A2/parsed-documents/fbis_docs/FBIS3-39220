According to a spokesman for the Belgian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Claes believes "the debate is closed," and that the NATO decision constitutes a response to a request made by the United Nations. "Moscow duly went along with the relevant Security Council resolutions (Resolutions 824 and 836 -- BELGA database editor's note) which provide for the possibility of military actions in Bosnia," was the message brought across by Mr. Claes, as quoted by the spokesman. Furthermore, in an interview given to the television channel RTL-TVI [Luxembourg Radio and Television], the Belgian foreign minister pointed out that a partial withdrawal of Serbian artillery less than 20 km from Sarajevo would not alter NATO's willingness to launch attacks against Serbian positions.
