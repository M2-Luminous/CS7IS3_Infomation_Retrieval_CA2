The rocket struck as scores of people gathered at the checkpoint in the Chelsitoon area in south Kabul, waiting to stock up with supplies in the Hezb-held part of the city, ahead of this weekend's Moslem Eid festival. Locals said the rocket was fired from a hill controlled by troops loyal to Hekmatyar's rival, President Burhanuddin Rabbani. Scores of people had rushed to the checkpoint following an announcement on Hezb radio that a blockade of routes to the centre of the capital had been lifted because of the religious festivities. "I decided to shop at Chelsitoon in the hope of getting essentials for our family at cheaper rates and look what has happend to me," cried a 35-year old woman, who lost one leg. Meanwhile, fighting was reported around Maidan Shahr, a city about 30 kilometers west of here, in the Wardak province. The defence ministry said Wednesday that pro-Rabbani forces had overrun the city, but the claim was denied by the Hezb-i-Islami. A fighter from Ittihad-i-Islami faction, which is allied to Rabbani, said: "Our forces hold the key hills around Maidan Shahr." The man, who was undergoing hospital treatment here, said he arrived from Maidan Shahr area Thursday after being wounded in the fighting. "We got orders to withdraw from the city, even though we had captured the it in a very easy fight," he said. The International Commitee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in April that 2,500 poeple had been killed and 17,000 injured in the fighting betwe@n the forces of Rabbani and the combined troops of Hezb and Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostam, since the beginning of January.
