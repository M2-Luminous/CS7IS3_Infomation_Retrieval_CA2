The two youths killed perfidiously were teachers in the elementary school of their village, Pogaj of Has district, near the Kosova border. A day before they had gone to meet their relatives in the Prizren commune in Kosova, and on their way back, they fell victim of the volley of shots by the Serbian border forces. On April 16, the local mix commission, as well as the group of the Albanian and Serbian experts went on the spot. They observed that the victims carried no weapon or any other defensive means. The places of the wounds showed that the Albanian citizens were first shot in the legs in order to halt them. Later, the Serbian border guards approached them, and in a very short time, although wounded in the leg, the victims were shot in the head and chest. The Ministry of Public Order, once again, calls on all the Albanian citizens not to cross the border illegally for any reason. They must be equipped with the necessary documentation and move only through the border crossing points.
