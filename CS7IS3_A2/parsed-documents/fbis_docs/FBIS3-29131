Hosokawa said, "the basic relationship between Japan and the U.S. will not be impaired if trade ties deteriorate a bit." In the wake of the breakdown of the bilateral "framework" trade talks, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday he is weighing up the possibility of introducing sanctions against Japan, because of its restricted foreign entry in the cellular phone market.
