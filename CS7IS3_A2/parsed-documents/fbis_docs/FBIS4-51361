Since May 27, 1949, when the government of the New Republic took over the city from the Kuomintang, the fixed assets investment in state-owned enterprises here has accumulated to 250.4 billion yuan, a more than 40-fold increase over 1952. Its annual increase has reached 19.8 percent, The traditional industries, such as textiles, shipping, power and iron and steel, have expanded their production capacities -- in some cases even hundreds of times. The modern pillar industries like automobiles and telecommunications have grown rapidly from the ground up. Statistics show that in the 1953-1993 period the city registered an annual growth of 8.6 percent in output value, 11.7 percent in local finance, 9.7 percent in industrial output value and 8.9 percent in retail turnover. Compared with 1952, the city's export volume shot up 61-fold, and imports, 888-fold. This rising economic strength has given a push to the sectors of science, education, medicine and health. Now, the city boasts a strong technical force of 888,800 professionals and a comprehensive medical care system. Citizens' incomes, excluding inflation indices, have increased by an average of four percent a year since 1952. The dynamic market economy, featuring rising industries such as securities, telecommunications and real estate, and the development of the Pudong New Area, has been strongly backed by the ongoing infrastructure construction, which is forging ahead with 60 billion yuan poured in this year. It is expected that the 1990s will be a take-off decade for Shanghai to become a financial and trade center for the whole Asia-Pacific region.
