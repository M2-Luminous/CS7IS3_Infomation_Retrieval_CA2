It has been ascertained that Hasan Dag, head of ERNK [Kurdish People's Liberation Front], which is the PKK's political wing, and Retired Admiral Andonios Naksakis, who facilitates PKK's activities in Greece, appealed to the Governor's Office in Athens to approve the establishment of the society. It has been reported that the society will be based in building Number 72 on Ipokratis Street in Athens if the appeal is approved. Turkish officials have been informed that the Governor's Office has not yet responded to the PKK's appeal. However, they assessed the initiative as being aimed at "facilitating Greece's financial aid to the PKK by having ERNK recognized by the Greek Government." Stressing that the approval of the appeal for the establishment of that society for humanitarian purposes will create an opportunity for Greece to support the PKK more easily, the officials said: "The realization of their project will facilitate Greece's contacts with the PKK through that society, which will supposedly be a humanitarian establishment. Consequently, Greece will find it easier to resist international reaction." It is common knowledge that Greece has given material aid to the PKK and allowed it to establish camps in that country for a long time. The file that was submitted to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on the PKK in December 1993 said that Greece paid 30,000 drachmas monthly to ERNK members. It also said that Greece has supplied Aris antitank missiles to the PKK and deposited 100 drachmas in the National Bank for each PKK member. The file informed Ciller that Greece provided $10,000,000 for the PKK in the form of aid in accordance with former Foreign Minister Andonios Samaras' instructions. Meanwhile, the PKK received another $1,000,000 to undermine tourism in Turkey. The file also informed Ciller as follows: A. The Lavrion refugee camp, which is 70 km southeast of Athens, has been given to the PKK. PKK activities in Greece are carried out by ERNK and the Kurdistan Committee in Athens. B. An account has been opened in the Kaningos branch of the National Bank of Greece for PKK members in the Lavrion camp. The account number is 129/62639077. PKK members Samil Asmaad and Sinan Aslan are responsible for the affairs of Kurds in Greece. C. The radio channel known as "Phonitou Kourdhistan" [Voice of Kurdistan] is operated by the PKK in Greece. D. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given scholarships to 33 PKK members in Greece.
