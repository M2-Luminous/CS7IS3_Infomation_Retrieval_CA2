This approval percentage is the third highest ever for a Japanese cabinet, following 71.9 percent for the Hosokawa cabinet last August and 60.5 percent for the tanaka cabinet in 1972. The telephone poll was conducted by the YOMIURI daily earlier this week. The disapproval rating for the cabinet stood at 25 percent. About 45 percent of the respondents favoring the cabinet said it "can do something new," and 24 percent said Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata "can be trusted." The major drawback cited for the cabinet was its fragility, the paper reported. Hata's cabinet was formed earlier this week to replace that of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned on April 8 because of controversial personal finances.
