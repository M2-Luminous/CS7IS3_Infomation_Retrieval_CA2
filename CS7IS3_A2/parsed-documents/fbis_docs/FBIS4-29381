In the statement published in the name of the reunification committee it said the recent tension on the Korean peninsula is attributable to the wrong international order orchestrated by a nuclear power. The "nuclear issue" should be solved through dialogue, not by means of pressure or "sanctions", it stressed. The statement urged that "the United States should give up its dream of settling the North's `nuclear issue' through sanctions and war." It also urged the "government" authorities to make sincere efforts for reconciliation and unity, understanding that those in the North are fellow countrymen with the same blood and brothers who should work together to build a reunified country.
