Ironic as it may sound, this time the code name is "Khan Kubrat" -- the vessel named after the founder of the Bulgarian state. This name can now be found in the UN Security Council's protocols. However, to judge by the noise made by some people ignorant of geography, one would think that the violator of the embargo on what is left of Yugoslavia did not sail along the Danube but along the Hudson River. Only on 15 March, after the world organization had already expressed its opinion on the case, did Sofia remember to convene the Government Commission on UN Sanctions, and charge various departments with related tasks. From the official statement after the meeting it is now clear that the officials who allowed the scandalous escape or kidnapping of the vessel and the oil tankers will be held responsible. The incident took place on 3 March. There is a saying that fits this situation -- it is called locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. What Sofia's reaction would have been if the UN Security Council's statement had not been in our favor is interesting. Perhaps we would again have adopted measures and programs on observing the Yugoembargo. The waiting position of the official authorities was evident throughout the entire case of the fugitive vessel -- from the first clear signs at the end of January that something was amiss with the vessel and its cargo to the strange circumstances surrounding the arrest and release of the majority of the crew. Even more questions arise if you believe the stories of the sailors who made the pleasure trip to Prahovo and returned home unencumbered. Something is wrong with the whole scenario. The Yugoslav side could not provide a satisfactory explanation either, but of course this is understandable. More than 5,000 tonnes of oil are important for the state subjected to the embargo, and in the eyes of the Serbs the high price is justifiable. The question, however, is what is the Bulgarian point of view? Officially we declare that we observe the embargo, but, on the other hand, our position regarding the criminal violations that take place from time to time is, to put it mildly, a position of purely registering the violations. We even reached the point when foreign observers of the Yugoembargo claim that Bulgarian customs officials are corrupt. So far no one has officially confirmed these accusations. In addition, no one has explained why the customs officials allowed the Khan Kubrat, for which they were responsible at the port of Somovit, to escape. On 15 March the port was closed to oil transporters. DUMA has learned that there are at least 40 additional tanker-tugs in this port, all of them of unclear origin and final destination. Hundreds of railroad tanker cars, the property of phantom companies, are traveling between various railroad stations. The time bomb is ticking away, and when it explodes, the echo will be heard in the city on the banks of the Hudson. We have already been positively mentioned once in New York, something that made us famous. Should we risk a second assessment because of purely domestic reasons? We have no solid guarantee that we will be praised again.
