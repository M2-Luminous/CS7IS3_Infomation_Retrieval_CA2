Lacalle demanded a political definition from Santoro, who said he supports the presidential candidacy of Dr. Alberto Volonte. Santoro spoke to CX-8 Radio Sarandi shortly after the meeting. He said he had been summoned by the president who, in his capacity as leader of the Herreraist sector, wanted to know Santoro's choice among the presidential candidates. The president mentioned the two alternatives (Juan Andres Ramirez or Alberto Volonte). Santoro said he informed Lacalle that his choice was Volonte. The Canelones Herreraist leader was then asked if this involves "a departure." He replied that he always considered Lacalle the true leader of the Herreraist faction, and that for this reason he also resigned the presidency of the Herreraist executive board. As for his political future, Santoro said he has for a long time been in touch with Volonte, adding: "I practically created his political position: I discovered him, I urged him, and now I have the satisfaction of seeing the level to which he has risen." He said: "I have no problem in supporting his candidacy." As to the chances that the candidacy of Volonte might have outside the Herreraist sector, he said the answer will come with time. "We have so far maintained our party activities and our work for presidential candidates within the Herreraist faction, and we have never conversed with anyone outside this faction," he added. "We have always tried to resolve the issue within the Herreraist faction, to which we have always belonged and in which we remain, because we believe that Herreraism goes beyond merely electoral matters or personal positions," Santoro explained. He concluded: "We maintain that Volonte is a Herreraist candidate and that we remain Herreraist faction members." [passage omitted]
