Our reporter Edit Schranz asked him about this. [Begin recording] [Schranz] Lajos Fur, you are the chairman of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]. In the speech you delivered after your election, you said that the stakes at the elections in May will be the same again -- that was how you put it: Will there be democracy, or to be more precise, will democracy remain? Because, you said, the left wing today wants to regain power. Would you tell us what you meant by that? Or rather, could we understand it to mean also that if the left wing were to win in the '94 elections, then democracy could be endangered in Hungary? [Fur] Yes, that is precisely what it's about. I said here too that they could hijack -- they could divert from its path -- the process that we began, which, with its circumspect policies, I am convinced serves the country's real interests. And with the left wing, unfortunately, ideological factors always come to the forefront -- some kind of ideological things -- and these ideological matters usually divert the truth from the channel in which it usually flows naturally. [Schranz] Just one question: Even during the MDF period, accusations were been leveled at it that, from certain points of view, it [word indistinct] in, or it brings in ideology into this or that decision. What is your opinion? [Fur] They were wrong, false accusations and slanders. [end recording]
