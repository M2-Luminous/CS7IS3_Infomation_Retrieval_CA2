During this and next week, they will write the spring survey on Germany's overall economic prospects, eagerly awaited by industry and politicians. The six participating institutes, Ifo, IfW, HWWA, DIW, RWI and IWH, host in turn the two decisive weeks of meetings. This time, it is Ifo's turn. The struggle for a common line often lasts until after midnight; this is how Gernot Nerb, head of the overall economic analysis department of Ifo, describes his experience of the past years. But very often, it already becomes clear at half-time whether they can agree, or whether an individual institute, such as the DIW in spring, will cast a minority ballot. In a week and a half, the institutes' presidents in Bonn will present the joint analysis to the public. Senior among the six gentlemen is Professor Karl Heinrich Oppenlaender. The 62-year-old has been heading the Ifo Institute, whose name stands for information and research, since 1976. After a business apprenticeship, he studied in the Bavarian land capital and joined Ifo in 1958. Since 1983, he has also been teaching at the University of Munich. Oppenlaender challenges his colleagues not only in scientific disputes, but also in regular table tennis rounds. Work on the joint survey is only a small part of the institute's work. It has become famous, and even familiar to some economic laymen, for its enterprise polls. Since 1950, the Munich researchers have been polling up to 12,000 enterprises each month on their assessment of the situation and prospects for the coming six months. In January and February 1994, for example, the enterprises predominantly considered the situation still bad, while for the first time in many months their majority assessed the prospects for the coming six months to be positive. With this reflection of the mood at the grass roots, Ifo wants to advance economic theory. Oppenlaender emphasizes that science still has no pertinent explanation for the ups and downs of the business cycle, thus making it difficult to predict. The Ifo procedure has found adherents worldwide. At present, over 1,000 institutes in 43 countries poll enterprises using the Munich method, reports Oppenlaender. Oppenlaender Is the Most Senior of the Institutes' Presidents United in the Centre for International Research on Economic Tendency Surveys (Ciret), the specialists for enterprise polls meet every two years. In 1991, the exchange took place for the first time in East Europe, in Budapest to be precise. For a very good reason: At the time of planned economies, enterprise polls were largely unknown in East Europe, but now interest is growing. For instance, members of Yeltsin's staff have already had the handbook for Ifo polls translated--but without first asking for permission in Munich, notes Oppenlaender. The Chinese also interviewed 2,000 enterprises using the Ifo questionnaire. To evaluate the data, they turned to Munich for help. According to Oppenlaender, the department for developing countries rendered them this "service of friendship." Not only researchers of the formerly communist world change their thinking; Ifo also had to reorient itself. "Actually, you don't quite know what is really going on here in eastern Germany," Saxony's Finance Minister Milbradt rebuked the Ifo president in 1992. Oppenlaender reacted promptly and talked the Saxons into giving financial support for a branch office. So since September 1993, there exists now a Dresden Ifo. Since January 1994, the magazine IFO DRESDEN REPORTS provides information on the new laender, based among other things on the economic tests done in Saxony. Also new, since the beginning of 1994, is the East Europe department. Six researchers deal primarily with Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. A further focal point of Eastern research centers on observation of Kazakhstan, commissioned by the federal economics minister. The Dresden Branch Office Received Impetus From Saxony's Finance Minister Also this year, Ifo will establish a department for the labor market and social policy which is to devote itself to overall health research. Two-thirds of Ifo researchers deal with microeconomic issues; most departments belong to the division "sectors, regions, and enterprises." The remaining capacity deals with the foreign and domestic economy. In addition to the branch office in Dresden, the researchers at the parent office will also continue to focus on the new laender. For instance, they study construction activity separately, for integrating the east in the "overall German construction preestimate" of Ifo does not yet make sense "for years to come." For the German railway they are supposed to find out, for example, to what extent the eastern construction boom will bring additional transport orders for building materials and waste removal. Ifo presents scientific results in numerous publications. The SCHNELLDIENST [express service] appears three times a month; the WIRTSCHAFTSKONJUNKTUR [business cycle], KONJUNKTURINDIKATOREN [economic indicators], and the BRANCHENSERVICE [branch service] once a month; the Ifo DIGEST in English four times a year; studies; and SPIEGEL DER WIRTSCHAFT [Economic Mirror] annually. Oppenlaender appears content with the devlopment of Ifo itself. In 1993, its budget rose by 6.5 percent to almost 28 million German marks [DM]. Of this amount, DM11.7 million were earned by surveys. Thus the institute achieves an outside funds ratio of 42 percent. Only the DIW can show a similarly good result (43 percent); IfW, HWWA, RWI, and IWH lag far behind. Forty-two Percent of Revenues Earned by Surveys The basic subsidy, shared by the Federal Government and Bavaria, amounted to DM13 million in 1993. In absolute terms, the institute received noticeably less than IfW, HWWA, and DIW, and more than RWI and IWH. Per staff member (DM58,000), however, Ifo costs the public authorities the least. Overall, 223 people work in the institute; 105 of them are scientists. The federal economics minister is the largest client of Ifo; in 1993 he commissioned surveys for DM3.3 million. The EU [European Union] Commission is becoming more and more important. Yet the orders from Brussels are less lucrative than others, since the Commission frequently finances only 50 percent of the cost of surveys. If Oppenlaender cannot find a cofinancer, he accepts only subjects of scientific interest. In general, competitors from Great Britain and France have a better "old boys' network" in Brussels, and furthermore, British institutes are less expensive, complains the Ifo chief. In addition, there is competition from business consultants such as Price-Waterhouse or McKinsey. To improve the position in the EU-wide competition, in 1990 Ifo merged with six European economic research institutes in the Ereco consortium. Not least of all because of the intensive work with enterprises, Ifo is less exposed to economic policy disputes. Between regulative and distribution politicians, supply and demand orientation, "we hoe a middle line," says Oppenlaender. The division of tasks is clear: "Our goal is also advising policymakers, but they must set priorities--we only point up the alternatives."
