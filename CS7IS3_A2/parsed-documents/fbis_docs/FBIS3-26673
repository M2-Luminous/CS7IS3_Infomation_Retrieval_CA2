The spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry said since the U.S. had violated the agreement between the two countries, DPRK will not put much hope on its dialogue with the U.S. and will not bind by its previous promises. He said the U.S. has recently told the DPRK that the nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be carried out with the sole aim of ensuring the continuity of the nuclear safety agreement and that the U.S. is willing to continue the talks between the two countries. At the same time, the IAEA has also indicated that they would give up the demand for a comprehensive inspection and will only conduct those necessary for ensuring the continuity of the nuclear safety agreement, the spokesman said. If these attitudes of the U.S. and IAEA are true, it will be a matter for rejoicing, the spokesman said.
