According to the white paper's chapter on investment, the world's direct foreign investment (on the basis of international balance of payments) for 1992 decreased by 14.2 percent over the previous year to $158 billion two years in a row due to an investment drop in Japan and Europe where the economy has been sluggish. Japan's direct foreign investment (on the basis of international balance of payments) drastically dropped by 43.9 percent from the previous year to $17.2 billion. Japan, which had enjoyed first place in direct foreign investment for three years since 1989, sharply slid to the fourth place. Meanwhile, the United States, which positively invested in Latin America and Asia, ranked first for the first time in six years since 1986. U.S. direct foreign investment (on the same basis) increased by 19.5 percent to $34.7 billion in 1992. Among the reasons cited by JETRO for the decrease in Japan's direct foreign investment are: 1) the financial condition of companies has worsened following the collapse of the so-called bubble economy; 2) profitability of investment has deteriorated in Europe and America; and 3) Asian NIES (newly industrializing economies) are losing their advantages as a production base because of a sharp increase in wages.
