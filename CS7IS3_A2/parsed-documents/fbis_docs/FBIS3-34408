Interior Minister 'Ali Mohammad Besharati, in an interview with our correspondent, also said: The task of closing the borders in the vulnerable areas began from four months ago. The job was completed by digging canals of four meters deep and four meters wide, erection of many watch towers, and planting of mines along the routes used by the drug trafficking convoys. At present there is no possibility of such convoys finding their way into the country. About the recent disturbances in Zahedan, which took place with provocation of the drug traffickers, the interior minister praised the Muslim and revolutionary people of Zahedan for staging a rally on Sunday to condemn the action of these saboteurs. He said: The Shiite and Sunni brothers and sisters, by staging a march in Zahedan to protest against the drug traffickers, have once again demonstrated their support for the Islamic revolution, the esteemed leader, and the president, and they have terminated all the conspiracies spread by internal and foreign enemies.
