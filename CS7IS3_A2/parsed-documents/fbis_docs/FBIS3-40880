This view was expressed by Kwik Kian Gie, an economic observer; Tadjoeddin Noersaid, a member of Committee VI of Parliament; and Fadel Muhamad, a businessman. They were commenting on the reduction of the export tax, as mentioned in the speech of President Suharto on 6 January regarding "Economic Notes" and the RAPBN [Draft State Budget] for fiscal year 1994/1995 before members of Parliament in Jakarta. In the draft state budget (RAPBN) for fiscal year 1994/1995 which was submitted by the president to Parliament, it is estimated that government income from the export tax will amount to only 16.4 billion rupiahs, or 45.3 percent less than it was in the state budget for fiscal year 1993/1994, when it amounted to 30 billion rupiahs. According to Kwik Kian Gie, the increase in the volume of exports was influenced by several considerations, most of which involved the needs of producers for infrastructure to turn out goods. He said: "The availability of adequate infrastructure is more important than a reduction in the export tax because it directly influences industrial efficiency." A similar view was also expressed by Fadel Muhamad. He said that without the infrastructure needed by businessmen to hold down production costs, it would be difficult for them to penetrate the international market which, at the present time, demands high competitive ability. He declared: "If I were asked about the impact of a lower export tax, I would say that there will be an increase in exports, but it will be very small. The reduction in the export tax is a small consideration among the factors required by the business world." Tadjoeddin, a member of Committee VI representing the Functional Development Faction (FKP), considered that if the reduction in the export tax is intended to increase export volume, the government will not get the results it hopes for. He said: "What is more directly needed by businessmen is easing the regulations on productive activity. The reduction in the export tax is something which will not have much of an influence on the present situation." Therefore, he said, if a businessman says that he would be able to increase export volume if his need for infrastructure is met, the government should place greater emphasis on efforts to build such infrastructure. Without Protection Both Kwik, as well as Fadel and Tadjoeddin, agreed that if the government wants to increase export volume, which surely will require a high level of product competitiveness, all existing forms of protectionism should be abolished. Kwik said: "The business world must be taught how to carry on its business without protection, because protection, as it has been provided up to now in a number of industrial sectors, in fact only makes the business world more dependent on the government." He added that such protection ensures that Indonesian domestic industry never grows up and never wants to try to grow up. He stated: "This is a not a good sign for economic growth." According to Tadjoeddin, although there is general agreement on tariffs, and newly established business firms will operate effectively for several years more, the government by now should have anticipated developments with greater imagination, particularly in preparing the business world "to function on its own," rather than "to be guided" by the government. Tadjoeddin declared: "If businessmen are able to compete internationally, export volume will also increase automatically, because in an indirect way, demand for Indonesian products will also increase." Sukamdani Meanwhile, Sukamdani S. Gitosarjono, chairman of the Board of Directors of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN), said that the tax receipts target of 42.6 trillion rupiahs in the state budget for fiscal year 1994/1995 is too ambitious because at the present time a climate conducive for stimulating an increase in taxes has not been properly created. Sukamdani said: "This large a target can only be achieved if the government is able to create a climate which is conducive to business activity." He was answering questions from reporters after attending the ceremony in Jakarta on 6 January at which the president spoke on "Economic Notes" and the draft budget for fiscal year 1994/1995. According to Sukamdani, the question is not the ability or inability of the government to reach this target, but, rather, how the government can create conditions to encourage private businessmen as the agents of development to provide support for large taxes. He said: "Previously, the government was the agent of development, and the private sector was only a participant in the process. However, now the government hopes that the private sector will be able to provide 73 percent of the target of 600 trillion rupiahs to be invested during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. This means that the private sector has a major role." Sukamdani hoped that the government, as well as KADIN, will serve as the engine of the business world in the effort to make a success of planned programs. He did not think that an increase of 9.0 trillion rupiahs in the non-oil and gas sector, from 37,641 trillion rupiahs in fiscal year 1993/1994 to 46,886 trillion rupiahs in fiscal year 1994/1995, is too fanciful. He stated: "I think that this increase is appropriate because our manufacturing sector is sufficiently developed, and there will always be further expansion of production. Moreover, the quotas for developed countries have been watered down since the negotiation of the original GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement. Now it remains to be seen how courageous we are in taking advantage of our opportunities." According to Sukamdani, the most important thing for Indonesia to do is to have a sort of company called "Indonesia Incorporated," as was once proposed by Arifin Siregar. That is, pressure for cooperation between the government and the business world. He said: "Then the government will only act as policymaker and facilitator, while the business world functions as the economic agent or implementer."
