The implementation of the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- adopted at the recent session of the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- was discussed, inter alia, at the session. It was concluded that Mr. Alija Izetbegovic should be incorporated into the institution of the presidency of the future federation, and he would have the first presidential mandate. The SDA Executive Committee believes that there are very significant reasons -- arising from political and moral interests of the Bosniak Muslim people -- that demand such a solution. Regional and communal committees of the SDA in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be informed about this decision. [passage omitted]
