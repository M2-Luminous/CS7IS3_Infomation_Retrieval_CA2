Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-18MAR94-IRAQ Saddam Threatens Confrontation To Split Coalition SUMMARY Seeking to exploit what he perceives to be a rift in the coalition that liberated Kuwait, President Saddam Husayn has presented the UN Security Council with a virtual ultimatum, threatening implicitly that if it fails to take significant steps in coming weeks toward lifting the sanctions, Iraq may cease to cooperate with the UN Special Commission and adopt a confrontational posture. Coming amid signs that the sanctions are causing increasing economic difficulties in Iraq, Saddam's move reflects his impatience with the Security Council's failure to lift the sanctions in response to Baghdad's diplomacy and selective compliance, his desire to frustrate effective future monitoring of Iraqi weapons programs, and his unwillingness to make further concessions in compliance with UN resolutions -- such as recognizing the border with Kuwait. END SUMMARY In a 13 March speech, which Iraqi media played up as an ultimatum threatening confrontation if a date for lifting the sanctions is not set, Saddam demanded that the Security Council implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 -- allowing Iraq to resume its oil sales -- "immediately and without any conditions." He warned that if Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz returns from the UN Security Council session without the Council's agreement to activate Paragraph 22, then Iraq's people and leadership would have "no choice but to decide what they believe will give them hope . . . in the direction they believe is sound" (Baghdad radio). Media Highlight Speech Tightly controlled Iraqi media immediately began to portray Saddam's speech as an ultimatum and to prepare the Iraqi public for confrontation. For example: -- The daily Babil, owned by Saddam's son 'Udayy, said that Saddam's speech "defined the contents of the decisive Iraqi confrontation with the enemies" (Iraqi News Agency [INA], 17 March). -- The daily Al-Qadisiyah (See Note 1) claimed Saddam's speech gave the Security Council "the last chance . . . to lift the sanctions without delay or conditions" (INA, 15 March). (Note 1) Around mid-September 1993, Al-Qadisiyah was removed from the supervision of the Defense Ministry and affiliated with the Information Ministry, which now controls this paper as well as Al- Jumhuriyah (Al-'Iraq, 18 September 1993). Probably more than an economy measure, this change, made by a Revolution Command Council decree, may have been designed to limit the political power of the Defense Ministry. -- Interpreting Saddam's speech as threatening an end to or reduction in Iraqi cooperation with the United Nations, the Ba'th Party daily Al-Thawrah said that if the Security Council does not lift the sanctions, Iraq will choose "a new road, different . . . in terms of its approach to [UN] resolutions and committees," a road that will prove Iraq has "other options" aside from cooperating with "colonialist interpretations of UN resolutions" (INA, 15 March). Earlier Signs Saddam had already foreshadowed a possible change of policy in his 16 January Gulf war anniversary speech, in which he pledged that "we will not relinquish our people in the northern part of the homeland, nor will we stand idle toward the continuation of the blockade and the violation of our sovereignty in southern Iraq." In that speech, he also warned "all evildoers, masters and satellites" - and especially "some evildoers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait" -- not to "miscalculate" because "the punishment of the criminals is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" (Baghdad radio). Explaining the Shift In his 13 March speech, Saddam explained that a shift from diplomacy to confrontation may prove necessary because Iraqis who advocated concessions seem to have been wrong while Iraqi hardliners seem to have been right. He said Iraq had "thus far" employed "diplomatic efforts" to achieve "a better level of understanding by the Security Council" because "many people in our country" had "expected" that this policy "would make some people, whose hearts have no feeling, show a flexible position and open the doors again to the Iraqi people." Saddam contrasted Iraqis who favored the diplomatic policy with other Iraqis who were "quite convinced that the criminal level of aggression and the way sanctions were implemented . . . came from minds without any conscience." He said these Iraqis, evidently now including himself, believed that "despite Iraq's offers and responses," its diplomats would discover that "there is nothing being given in return" and that the Security Council's Paragraph 22 is being used merely as a "tactical cover to make Iraq fulfill its obligations" while the Security Council fails to fulfill its own obligations. Minimum Demands Indicating his minimum demands, Saddam castigated UN Special Commission Chairman Rolf Ekeus for failing to provide a timetable stating when the probationary period for monitoring Iraqi weapons production would begin and end. Saddam insisted that the Iraqis must know when they can start selling oil so that they "will be able to make their plans, see what they can do, and prepare themselves psychologically and economically for the required duration." Saddam also revealed his resentment that Ekeus was working to turn UN Security Council Resolution 715 into an effective monitoring instrument. He claimed Ekeus had said that as soon as Iraq approved of 715, he would write a report to the Security Council, but when Iraq approved it, Ekeus said, in Saddam's words, "we must first start monitoring and make sure that Iraq is implementing 715 the way we want -- the way Ekeus wants -- in order to make sure Iraq is committed." Saddam claimed that the probationary monitoring period should have started as soon as the two cameras to monitor missile testing were installed and turned on. 'Aziz Letter In a letter to the UN Security Council president on 16 March, 'Aziz reiterated that Iraq "demands" that the Council apply Paragraph 22 "immediately and without any additional restrictions or conditions" and that it "reject the tendentious political interpretations of its resolutions that some states are seeking to impose on the Council." Rejection of Iraq's demand, he said, would "certainly lead to a reassessment of the situation and to an action [tasarruf] that will protect the Iraqi people from the harm to which they are being exposed." Indicating that at least for now Iraq will not recognize Kuwait and the Iraq-Kuwait boundary, as required by UN Security Council Resolution 833, 'Aziz said that if the sanctions and the no-fly zones are lifted, the issue of Kuwait "could then be discussed in accordance with the rules regulating relations among states" (Baghdad radio, 17 March). (See Box 1) Perceived Rift Baghdad appears to believe that now is an opportune moment to exploit what it perceives as a serious rift within the alliance that liberated Kuwait. For example, the Information Ministry's mouthpiece Al-Jumhuriyah has claimed that the United States has become "virtually isolated in its calls for the continued enforcement of sanctions against Iraq, particularly since it has seen with its own eyes the disintegration of its international coalition" (INA, 6 March). Iraqi media have recently listed France, Russia, and China as among the countries showing understanding for Baghdad's position. In a recent article, Saddam's press secretary 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin advocated using a policy of "intimidation" and "temptation," denying trade benefits, priority in debt payments, and other benefits to "any country not currently adopting a just and equitable stand" and offering corresponding benefits to countries now helping Iraq to lift the sanctions (Babil, 24 February). Information Ministry First Under Secretary Nuri Najm al-Marsumi argued in Al-'Iraq -- the daily of the pro-Saddam Kurds -- that Iraqi diplomacy and U.S. mistakes had helped create "a serious fissure within the anti-Iraq alliance" and that "current international and regional circumstances" provide Iraq with "a serious and true opportunity for lifting the unfair embargo." Therefore, he said, Iraq must "draw the world's attention" to its determination and capability "not to remain idle" if the sanctions continue and to its current "rallying" around Saddam "to thwart the aggression once and for all and to achieve the decisive victory" (8 March). (See Box 2) Implications Saddam clearly is unwilling to recognize Kuwait, as required by UN Security Council Resolution 833, unable to stay in power without repressing his people, as required by Resolution 688, and surprised by Ekeus' determination to treat Resolution 715 as an effective means of monitoring Iraqi weapons. Nevertheless, he seems to believe that to protect his proclaimed status as "Iraq's historic leader" and to avoid being perceived as weak, he needs to manipulate the Security Council into setting a date for Iraq to resume selling its oil. He is therefore hoping that his threat to adopt a new, presumably more confrontational policy will break up the U.S.-led coalition and erode the sanctions. If his ultimatum is rejected, Saddam will almost certainly feel compelled to do something to carry out his threat. He may be content with an intensified propaganda campaign, directed in particular to Arab and Islamic countries, and with repeatedly threatening and then carrying out a gradual reduction or sudden cessation in Iraq's present degree of cooperation with the United Nations. However, one cannot rule out Saddam's giving up on efforts to lift sanctions and therefore seeking a victory in another area, such as a move to regain control of Iraqi Kurdistan. Box 1: Denying Kuwaiti Legitimacy Saddam's consideration of a change of policy is based partly on his unwillingness to go any further to comply with UN resolutions. For example, Iraqi leaders and media have signaled their continuing intention not to recognize the legitimacy of Kuwait, its government, or its border with Iraq. -- In an address to pro-Saddam foreign visitors on 18 January, Saddam personally denied the legitimacy of the Kuwaiti rulers, claiming that by their own actions they had lost the right to rule. After accusing them of lying in 1990 in order to make the U.S. public "accept the idea of war" against Iraq, he said that "when a Muslim ruler lies, then he has lost every legitimate right to be a ruler" (INA). -- Commenting on Saddam's statement in his 16 January Gulf war anniversary speech that "we will not turn wisdom into a prelude for weakness and despair," Information Ministry First Under Secretary al-Marsumi explained that, while "wisdom and necessity" have led Iraq to accept UN Security Council resolutions, Iraq will not simply agree to "whatever it is asked for." In particular, it will not "guarantee the security of the bandits, the rulers of the Kuwait governorate and Saudi Arabia" despite the fact that this is what "the Americans want" (Babil, 2O January). -- The practice of referring to Kuwait as the [Iraqi] "governorate of Kuwait" has continued (for example, Al-Jumhuriyah editor Salah al-Mukhtar in an article in Babil, 3O January; Babil, 1O and 12 February). More recently, Saddam's press secretary 'Abd al-Jabbar Muhsin has repeatedly referred to Kuwait as "Kazimah," the Iraqi-imposed name for Kuwait City under the occupation (Babil, 10 March). End of Box 1 Box 2: Economic Deterioration Official efforts to prepare the public for a change in policy have come amid signs of increasing economic deterioration that Baghdad perceives as a threat to Iraqi steadfastness and morale. For example: -- A Babil editorial under a pseudonym used by Saddam's son 'Udayy castigated the Cabinet for decisions that allegedly caused the dinar's exchange rate to plummet between September 1993 and January 1994, thereby allowing Iraq's "enemy" to make "some gains in the arena of the economic battle." The editorial, citing a UN statement that called for deferring any discussion of lifting the embargo until Iraq's good will had been tested for a year, implied that Iraq could not last another year unless the dinar's slide is reversed. It therefore suggested that the success or failure of a ministry should be judged by its contribution to the strength or weakness of the dinar (2O January). -- Saddam's press secretary 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin attacked "a handful of misled Iraqis" who "raise prices whenever the enemy escalates its onslaught and its conspiracies" and who have become a danger to Iraqi "morale and steadfastness" (Al-Qadisiyah, 22 February). -- The 1994 budget and investment plan was 25 percent below the 1993 figures (Baghdad radio, 29 December).
