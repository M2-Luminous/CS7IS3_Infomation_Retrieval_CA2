And so, at a meeting of leaders of the Russian Union of Local Self-Government (RSMS), everything went according to the standard arrangement with journalists--questions and responses on the aims of the new sociopolitical movement, on near-term objectives. It would seem to be too early to judge what kind of force has appeared in our society--better to wait and see. All the same, however, this first meeting with RSMS left the impression that the organization might be able to appreciably influence our lives, becoming a significant counterweight to the super-centralization of government. While trusting the plain truth of our first impression, it does no harm to delve into where it comes from. RSMS is not the fruit of a dozen capital politicians who drafted a program and approached people with populist slogans. The emergence of this union is the logical development of a self- organization of cities. Already 15 diverse city organizations-- unions and associations--are involved, from which many of the leaders of the new movement come. Convinced of the productivity of jointly resolving various economic and management problems, they became convinced of something else as well--that the rights and interests of city and village residents must be protected by political methods, in developing and consolidating local self- government. Appearing in a natural way, the movement immediately acquired a solid foundation. Its constituent assembly was held in June of last year, and its first (constituent) congress--in October. Presently there are 80 branches of the RSMS in 48 Federation entities. They unite people who hold dear realization of the concepts of decentralization of authority, and the dominance of law over arbitrary rule by the state apparatus. The main objective of the RSMS--implementation of the rights of citizens to participate in management of the life of society and the state on all levels, from block, street, and city, to Federation-- determines its specific tasks: protection of the rights and interests of local self-government entities, participation in the lawmaking process, the nomination and provision of support to candidates in elections of the organs of local and state authority... Who are the leaders of the RSMS counting on seeing among their supporters, as their allies? They are relying on employees of the organs of local and state authority who have become convinced, on the basis of personal experience, of the need to develop self- government; active citizens from block and community committees, and veterans' unions, who have always protected the interests of territorial associations and diverse groups; employees in the municipal sphere--public health, education, culture; and representatives of small and mid-size business whose interests are directly related to a specific territory. The RSMS is prepared to engage in extremely close cooperation with unions and all regional associations of cities, with the Zemstvo Union... I believe this alone is sufficient to overcome any doubt that this movement is a significant one, with a grand future. And Karamzin's concept to the effect that Russia is strong by virtue of its provinces occurred not just to me that evening, apparently. After all, the leaders of RSMS are primarily representatives of the provinces (if, of course, you consider that the provinces begin just beyond the Moscow Ring Road). Viktor Ivanovich Dorkin, chairman of the RSMS Central Council, is mayor of the city of Dzerzhinskiy, outside Moscow, a city under rayon jurisdiction. Along with city residents, he has come to feel the entirety of the injustice incorporated in this status. And being a Russian people's deputy, he sees another "disconnect" between the life of the localities and the lawmaking process. "In the former Supreme Soviet only a third of the deputies voted with a knowledge of the business of problems of self-rule..." Svetlana Nikolayevna Yurkova, deputy chairman, is also the mayor of a city well known to all--Shlisselburg. But whereas for us this city represents history primarily, for her it is a burden of troubles and cares about what is most essential. "In a small territory, every citizen feels the ill effects of legislation on local self-government," she believes. "The city is deprived, its residents are deprived, and the local authority is too feeble to help. Today it is important for people and groups of people to learn to defend and stand up for their interests. Then we will be able to talk about the development of a civic society, then the most diverse forms of self-government will emerge on their own and develop. In our city, for example, the committee for community self-government emerged in the territory of a former departmental kindergarten which was intended for sale to private owners. The parents rose up and defended their interests and the interests of their children..." Vasiliy Fedorovich Andreyev, member of the Central Council, historian from Novgorod, chairs the Russian History Department at a university. "Is it possible to revive the zemstvo?"--he repeated the question in a resounding manner. No, probably not. But we must study the zemstvo. We must find guidance as much in our rich, productive experience as we do in our sad, national experience. The history of the zemstvo movement reminds us of the short history of contemporary self-government--pressure, a cry from above..." Naturally a question was also asked about the numerical strength of the new movement. Membership in the movement is not stipulated, RSMS leaders explained, and no one is fighting to get membership in the multi- millions. The important thing is rather that RSMS slogans permeate the minds of as many people as possible, and that they vote for them--for democracy based on local self-government. There simply cannot be any other kind of democracy. RSMS leaders consider this introduction of the organization as the beginning of their preparation for the elections to the State Duma, Second Convocation.
