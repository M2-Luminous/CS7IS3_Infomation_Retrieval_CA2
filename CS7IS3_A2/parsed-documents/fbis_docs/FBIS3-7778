One HVO soldier was killed and three wounded in these attacks. In his letter General Roso says that Muslim forces organized and staged an HVO attack on their positions on the eastern side of Mostar. They had in advance positioned TV cameramen who were supposed to film this artillery action, thus gaining a certain political as well as military advantage.
