[Wang] Comrade Deng Xiaoping's truth-seeking and realistic spirit made the deepest impression on me. Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts is a proposition full of dialectical materialistic spirit. I believe that it is difficult to grasp this way of thinking but it is even harder to adhere to this ideological line in practice. Whether one can succeed in being "true to the end" is a real test of the level and awareness of every leader. It not only tests our comprehension and ability to solve problems but, in particular, it tests our party spirit, work style, and personal character. [Song] What is your connotation of Deng Xiaoping's truth-seeking and realistic spirit of which you speak? [Wang] I think it has three aspects, that is, to be an honest man, an intelligent man, and a brave man. The first is to be an honest man. "One has to be a man before being a writer." This saying tells us that one's writings reflect one's character. Without a certain character, it is impossible to produce first class work. Similarly, I believe that "one has to be a man before being an administrator." Compared with writing articles, a person's character is more directly significant for an administrator. A person without a first class character as a foundation will never make a good official. To emulate the truth-seeking and realistic spirit, the number one priority is to do things honestly according to scientific and objective laws, keep in constant touch with reality, maintain extensive links with the masses, find out the changes in the objective situation in a timely fashion, accurately tune in to the pulse of the masses, and grasp the opportunities which our time gives us, so that our decisions are in keeping with reality. Here, one must resolutely overcome the bureaucratic work style that is detached from reality and resolutely abolish the attitudes and ways of playing petty tricks or acting upon assumptions. We must try to be the kind of honest persons that Chairman Mao often praised. In Chairman Mao's eyes, Marx was an honest person, Lenin was an honest person, and scientists are honest people because they act honestly according to a scientific attitude. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is exactly such an honest person. He has always advocated a realistic spirit and has always put it into action himself. His writings and speeches are of the simple style, without empty talk that is detached from reality. His decades of political practice and his simplicity and diligence are even more of a glorious model and vivid textbook of the realistic spirit. There is now a very bad trend and that is, taking an attitude of copying and mechanically transplanting, without change, a superior's instructions or experience from other places. When documents arrive, some people carelessly read them once without serious studies, discussions, and thinking. They don't know to ask a few "whys" and "hows," nor do they come up with ideas for implementation that suit the reality in their localities and so, they are only able to copy and mechanically transplant them without change. People who take this kind of irresponsible attitude will always fail, 10 times out of 10. [Song] This phenomenon still exists today. [Wang] Since the reform and opening up, the economic and social features of many places have seen great changes. In some places, it is a new plateau every two or three years. It makes one excited to watch. However, some places have seen very little change; up to today, some still haven't found the right way to develop their local economy but only repeat formalistic slogans. This kind of irresponsible attitude by leaders is a manifestation that their party spirit and enterprising spirit are weak. If they do not change their attitudes quickly there will be no hope for these places. In actual work, of course it is important to come up with realistic decisions but it is equally important to turn correct decisions into people's actions through actual hard work. Without the latter, no matter how good the decisions, they will never materialize. Actual hard work is both a work style and a basic method to implement policies and it is even more so a test for the party spirit and sense of responsibility of each leader. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always advocated actual hard work. In recent years he has repeatedly demanded that we "squeeze time to do more practical things and do more and talk less"; "do a few solid things, accomplish something, make oneself credible to the people"; "concentrate and do a few things that will make the people satisfied and happy"; and "quietly immerse ourselves in work and do our own business well." He has especially emphasized: "Leaders must do more practical work. The bad work style of passing one's days by giving orders and spouting empty words must be changed." The teachings and models of Comrade Deng Xiaoping are the force that impels us to do solid work. [Song] What is an "intelligent man?" [Wang] Modern society is very complex. Especially in China, which is in a transitional process moving towards a socialist market economy, the society is unsettled and there are many new problems, new situations, and new contradictions. Under such circumstances, a leader will never make it without a certain level of intellect. For a leader to establish the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts and being truthful and realistic, an important issue is to learn to analyze and handle problems dialectically and overcome one-sidedness or thinking in absolute terms. This is both an important theoretical problem and a practical problem which occurs often in leading work. I believe that the higher one's position in the leadership, the more important this problem becomes. [Song] Please elaborate on this in specific terms. [Wang] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has made a very important point, that is, "take the overall situation into account," "yield to the interests of the whole," "minor principles should be subordinated to major ones," and consider issues from the perspective of the whole. Here, the "overall situation" and "major principles" are none other than the "reality of the whole," while partial considerations are no more than "partial reality." To start from the perspective of the whole means to start from the reality of the whole. Most people acknowledge this principle but, when concrete problems occur, not everyone can keep a clear head. During the 15 years since reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has handled many complex problems with his political wisdom and set up a glorious model for us. [Song] Please give an example. [Wang] For instance, the handling of the "fools' seed" case. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recalled: "At that time, many felt uneasy, saying that he [a person who became rich by selling `fools' brand pumpkin seeds] had made a million. And they wanted to take him down. I said we cannot take him down. If we do, people will say that policies have changed and what we gain is not worth what we lose. There are many similar problems. If we don't handle them properly, they will very easily deflect our policies and affect the whole reform." In Comrade Deng Xiaoping's perspective, failure to handle the "fools' seed" case did no harm to the whole situation; if we had handled the case it would have been detrimental to the whole situation. [Song] The outstanding significance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's analysis of the "fools' seed" case lies in its exemplary role. In the process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, complex problems will certainly often occur and our leading cadres will certainly be often tested in whether they can correctly handle complex problems or not. The demonstration by Comrade Deng Xiaoping is no doubt classic for all levels of leading cadres. [Wang] Political experience is accumulated gradually. The political experience which comrade Deng Xiaoping provides for us is very precious. Not only in the "fools' seed" case but in many other problems, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has provided classical models for us. For instance, in both taking our own road and opening to the outside world; in both paying attention to the construction of material civilization and to the construction of spiritual civilization; in both opposing the right and opposing the "left"; in diplomatic strategy, his "we still have to make friends but must keep a clear head," etc. Whenever faced with important problems and crucial moments, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is always so clear-headed; his analysis of things is always so profound, comprehensive, and to the point; his handling of problems is always so appropriate, differentiating the important from the unimportant and the emergency case from nonemergency ones. Without the skilled dialectical thinking of a politician, and without the penetrating vision and tactics of a strategist, this would be impossible. We must emulate comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking and learn to consider and handle problems with materialist dialectics. Many things in the field of politics indicate that once the leader's way of thinking goes wrong, his mind will not be clear before major issues of right and wrong and he will lose direction, leading even to political mistakes and bringing irreplaceable losses to our cause. [Song] It seems to me that what comrade Deng Xiaoping advocates is a spirit of political reasoning. From his theory of "white cat and black cat" to his analysis of the "fools' seed" case, his rational spirit permeates his career of political practice. [Wang] You have a point. [Song] Apart from "being an honest man," and "being an intelligent man," why does comrade Deng Xiaoping's truth-seeking and realistic spirit also contain "being a brave man"? [Wang] The spirit of innovation and risk-taking is the character a modern leader must have. The theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the most creative theory; the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts contains in itself the content of creating new things all the time. The achievements in reform and opening up and in the modernization construction of China in the past dozen years or so are exactly the result of the constant creation and aggressive advancement of the hundreds of millions of people under the leadership of the party. Without a brave spirit, we will be unable to accomplish anything, unable to advance even a single step. [Song] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always encouraged innovation. [Wang] That senior leader once made a very encouraging statement: "Without a little spirit of breaking through, without a little spirit of `risking,' without a little energy and force, one cannot find a good road, or a new road, and cannot accomplish new things. Who dares to say that their business has a 100 percent guarantee with no risk at all." He repeatedly emphasized: "We certainly have to have innovation." What Comrade Deng Xiaoping advocates here is a spirit of innovation and risk-taking. The "energy" and "force" he mentioned is a kind of revolutionary courage, heroism, and boldness. It originates from lofty ideals and infinite loyalty to the people. In the practice of reform and opening up, the spirit of innovation and risk-taking is very precious and needs to be advocated. People with a lot of prudence and who do not dare to take responsibility cannot do it; people who do not seek accomplishments but only seek to make no mistakes cannot do it; as for those who have no people, no ideals, and no enterprising spirit but only themselves in their minds, they not only cannot do it, they can't even understand this spirit of innovation and risk-taking. [Song] Brilliant! [Wang] The ideological line of the party is a thoroughly materialist one. Only thorough materialists can completely understand it and adhere to it to the end because adherence to this line is risky, requiring people to pay a price and make some individual sacrifices. Those who lack the sense of responsibility towards the prosperity and happiness of the people, and those who lack enthusiasm towards the vigorous new cause, will be unwilling to pay this price. In reality, many things demand that leaders have the courage to persist in seeking truth from facts. For instance, the masses are very critical of unhealthy trends, corruption, and of the serious political liberalism which exists within the party. However, it is very difficult to correct. One of the major reasons is that some leading comrades lack the courage to seek truth from facts and they are unwilling to shoulder individual risks. These comrades don't understand that if we ourselves are unwilling to pay a small price, our party will have to pay a high price. Again, we often face the following situation in leading work whereby two diametrically opposite views and evaluations arise concerning the same thing, the same person, the same history, or the situation in the same region and where both sides claim that they are seeking truth from facts. This can be due to many factors. Perhaps there is a problem of ability and the level of comprehension, or a problem of different degrees of understanding the situation, or different perspectives in looking at things. Often there are problems of different ideological viewpoints and the criteria of right and wrong. This should be called normal. The problem is, as a leader of a locality or unit, one must take the party standpoint. On the basis of seeking truth from facts, one must talk and act justly, correct the prejudices of some comrades, and encourage those comrades who persist in seeking truth from facts. This is nothing like "life and death" issues but, if we cannot even do this, then how can we handle it when real "life and death" situations occur? [Song] The question of placing our individual "self" in which position is indeed a crucial one. [Wang] The basis of the party's ideological line, the soul of the truth-seeking and realistic spirit, is to place the people's interests above all else. The source of courage and strength in upholding this ideological line lies in the people. In his long revolutionary career, Comrade Deng Xiaoping considered himself a "son of the Chinese people." He has always respected and loved the people and has paid constant attention to the people's interests and wishes. He places the starting point and goal of all policies and criteria for judging right and wrong on "whether the people are happy or not," "whether the people agree," and "whether the people support it." It is exactly because of this that he is equipped with great courage in theory and practice, his correct decisions naturally become the willing actions of the hundreds of millions of people, and he himself can lead the people fearlessly in battle in the great process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. [Song] It seems that whether one can be truth-seeking and realistic and whether one can uphold truth is inevitably linked to the level of character of the individual. [Wang] This is indeed so. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's rough and ragged experience, his revolutionary character of paying no attention to personal fame and safety, or gain and loss, but constantly upholding truth and principles, truly reflects his lofty awareness of unswervingly seeking truth from facts. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great experience educates us that Communist Party members who view the people's interests as higher and weightier than anything else, are not afraid of anything. In his article commemorating Comrade Liu Bocheng, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a moving statement: Comrade Liu Bocheng "exerted himself to the utmost, despite 10,000 deaths, in order to realize that in which he believed.... Whether in successful times or in difficult times, irrespective of time and place and changes in the objective environment, he consistently contributed his all to the party, submitted his all to the needs of the party, and immersed himself in the cause of the party, without the slightest consideration for personal fame and gain. He truly reached the realm of selflessness." I often think if all our leaders, generation after generation, could reach this "realm of selflessness," then the leading bodies of the party at all levels would certainly become the strong battle headquarters, create a good trend, and carry forward the truth-seeking and realistic spirit. Thus, in the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, our ship will be able to advance along the correct path toward the glorious goal in any kind of turbulent sea.
