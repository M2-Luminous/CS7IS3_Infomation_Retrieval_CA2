The diagnosis of the crisis hanging over the PT comes from political scientist Francisco Weffort, 56, a professor at USP [Sao Paulo University] and member of the political council that drafted the platform for Lula's campaign for the presidency. A founder of the PT, its former secretary general (1984-87), and a former member of its Executive Board (1980-89), at 1500 today Weffort will attend a public meeting at PUC [Pontifical Catholic University] in Sao Paulo, an event convened by intellectual and labor union members who see in the "castling" of the PT leadership a threat to Lula's election. Weffort says he is rooting for the FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso] plan. [Barros e Silva] What do you think of the FHC economic plan, and the administration? [Weffort] Fernando Henrique is the government. I hope the plan is successful and achieves the stability it seeks. That could be a better starting point from which the next administration can implement a policy of growth. Any reservations one might make at this point are secondary, in my opinion. The policy of "the worse things get, the better" does not help anyone. [Barros e Silva] The PT calls itself a socialist party. Would a Lula administration pave the way for socialism? [Weffort] No. Lula's program seeks to democratize and modernize capitalism. This means redistributing income, finally implementing agrarian reform, correcting the imbalances in regional distribution, and carrying out a series of economic reforms, including a reform of the State, that will permit resumption of growth. Brazil is so conservative that the capitalists are unable to democratize capitalism. [Barros e Silva] What effect does the fact that the most orthodox faction of the party holds a majority of the leadership posts have on the PT program? [Weffort] I do not know what you mean by "orthodox faction." Orthodox as regards what? [Barros e Silva] The dogmas of the Left. [Weffort] That does not exist in the PT. The backwardness people talk about today does not lie with the PT's Left; it is in the eyes of those who are looking at the party. The problem is something else: the PT is a national party that expresses the inequalities and heterogeneities of Brazilian society. One cannot imagine Brazil having a national party of the Left that does not express the protest sentiments that are at work in society. Sometimes the party has trouble understanding certain requirements of development policy in Brazil today. [Barros e Silva] So what are the party's "blind spots?" [Weffort] The PT's biggest problem lies in the fact that it ends up making room for some of the corporativism we have in this country. Sometimes you think a fellow is defending the government monopoly on petroleum because he is a radical. Actually he is connected with the corporativist interests in the petroleum business. What passes for radicalism is a sectoralist view of the policy, held by those who cannot see the country as a whole. [Barros e Silva] Lula's electoral base at this point is larger than that of the PT. If he becomes president, who will govern--Lula, or the party? Does Lula risk becoming a new "savior of the nation," thus reviving the old messianic tradition of Brazilian politics? [Weffort] It is neither the party nor Lula that will govern. It is the government of alliances that Lula will preside over. Even if he does not forge alliances for purposes of the election, it is clear that he needs to build alliances in order to govern. As regards the messianic tradition, I do not think such a risk exists. Lula is a charismatic leader who has been working for years to build up the institutions. That runs counter to the messianic route. [Barros e Silva] Is the current configuration of the PT leadership the result of the weakening of the social movements that played a central role in the formation of the party? Has the petista culture been lost? [Weffort] In part this is due to a decline in the ability of the social movements to exert pressure, but mainly it is an expression of the changes in the national political picture. When the PT was born, at the end of the military regime, people were convinced it would be possible to build democracy from the ground up. An antigovernment sentiment was spreading throughout the society. As the dictatorship was on its deathbed, the social movements became weaker, while the channels of representative democracy with its extremely powerful attraction were opening up. The PT threw its grass-roots leaders onto the scenario of representative democracy. The consequence was a certain strangulation of the fellow who simply wanted to be a petista militant, the guy who has no political ambitions and does not take part in the internal tussles among the different camps in the party. It is not the leadership's fault. [Barros e Silva] Has the PT become a party of cadres? [Weffort] It has become a party of officeholders and internal camps. It has some fairly well-organized partisan factions within it. I am not against this, but I think that by itself this is not enough. You have to have people who are not aligned with any camp and not interested in running for elective office. What is missing are those militants whom we used to call PT-PT, those who do not belong to any faction. [Barros e Silva] The PT leadership reacted vehemently to the manifesto that called on the militants to discuss the gap between the leadership and the rank and file of the party. As one who signed the text, what do you think of that reaction? [Weffort] There is a mistake in all that. I signed that text with the intent of discussing how the PT could go back to being a party of the masses. I did not sign off on criticisms of the leadership, and I tell you that if that was the intent, I would not have endorsed it. I believe this could hurt not only Lula's campaign, but the objectives I want to achieve. [Barros e Silva] What are the PT's boundaries in terms of political alliances during the presidential campaign? [Weffort] The chances of an alliance during the first round are very limited. Now the chances of an alliance of masses during the runoff are great, if the PT keeps an open mind from now on. In regard to the boundaries, I believe the classical parties of conservatism--the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], the PFL [Liberal Front Party] and, secondarily, the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]--are beyond the realm of possibility. Alliances could be formed on the other side. [Barros e Silva] Even with Quercia? [Weffort] It is unlikely, but I think it has to be discussed separately. We must not think only of the leaders; we must consider the masses they represent. [Barros e Silva] Do you concur with the PT leadership's ban against party participation in the constitutional revision? [Weffort] I think the PT got itself into a mess on that. The party had every right to oppose the revision but, once it was approved, it had a duty to participate. It lost more by not joining the revision than it would have had it taken part, even if it always voted against the changes. Staying out helps isolate a party that needs to leave itself open to alliances.
