According to Montoro Filho, the process' complexity made the privatization commission and Ministers Veras and Stepanenko decide to divide the sector into three areas -- electricity generation, transmission, and distribution -- under the coordination of one self-financed public company. The government concluded that by simply selling the electricity industry companies, it could leave regions that have no commercial appeal without electricity.
