FR940318-0-00167 FR940318-0-00023 (c) HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b. HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b blends are acceptable, for reasons described and the caveats outlined above, as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12 and CFC&hyph;114 in polyolefin foam. Under the section 610 Non-Essential Use Ban, HCFC use in polyolefin foams is restricted to thermal insulating applications of polyethylene foams where such foam is suitable in shape, thickness and design to be used as a product that provides thermal insulation around pipes used for heating, plumbing, refrigeration, or industrial process systems. (d) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and CFC&hyph;114 in polyolefin foams. HFC&hyph;134a offers the potential for a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and CFC&hyph;114 in polyolefin foams. HFC&hyph;134a, because of its low flammability and encouraging performance in toxicological testing, exhibits definite advantages from the standpoints of worker and consumer safety. HFC&hyph;134a does, however, contribute to global warming. (e) HFC&hyph;143a. HFC&hyph;143a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and CFC&hyph;114 in polyolefin foams. HFC&hyph;143a has a higher global warming potential than other acceptable substitutes in this end-use. (f) HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;152a, for the reasons described in the section on extruded polystyrene sheet foam, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and CFC&hyph;114 in polyolefin foams. Plant or process modifications may be needed to accommodate the flammability of HFC&hyph;152a. (g) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and CFC&hyph;114 in polyolefin foams. (h) HCFC&hyph;22/Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. HCFC&hyph;22/Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 blends, for the reasons described and with the caveats outlined above, are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12 and CFC&hyph;114 in polyolefin foams. Under the section 610 Non-Essential Use Ban, HCFC use in polyolefin foams is restricted to thermal insulating applications of polyethylene foams where such foam is suitable in shape, thickness and design to be used as a product that provides thermal insulation around pipes used for heating, plumbing, refrigeration, or industrial process systems. (i) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and CFC&hyph;114 in polyolefin foams. b. Unacceptable substitutes. The final rule listing a foam blowing agent as unacceptable in a specific foam use sector constitutes a ban on the use of that alternative to Class I compounds. This decision will be effective 30 days after publication of this final rule. (1) Polyolefin foams. The use of HCFC&hyph;141b (or blends thereof) is unacceptable as an alternative blowing agent in polyolefin foams. HCFC&hyph;141b has an ODP of 0.11, almost equivalent to that of methyl chloroform, a Class I substance. The Agency believes that non-ozone depleting alternatives are sufficiently available to render the use of HCFC&hyph;141b unnecessary in this application. F. Solvent Cleaning 1. Overview On an ozone-depletion weighted basis, solvents constitute approximately 15 percent of the chemicals targeted for phase-out under the Montreal Protocol. In the U.S., the two class I chemicals used as industrial solvents are CFC&hyph;113 (C2F3C13_trifluorotrichloroethane) and methyl chloroform (C2H3C13_1,1,1-trichloroethane). The SNAP determinations issued in the solvent cleaning sector focus on substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and methyl chloroform (MCF) when used in industrial cleaning equipment, since this application comprises the largest use of ozone-depleting solvents. Other cleaning applications for ozone-depleting solvents exist as well, such as in dry cleaning of textiles or in hand cleaning or maintenance cleaning as a spray. In addition, these solvents are used as bearer media (such as lubricant carriers), mold release agents, component testing agents, or in other non-cleaning applications. CFC&hyph;11 is also occasionally used as a cleaning solvent in specialized applications. For the reasons described earlier in this Preamble, the Agency intends to exclude cleaning substitutes for CFC&hyph;113, MCF and CFC&hyph;11 in these applications_with the exception of aerosol substitutes_from the SNAP determinations at this time. As a result, the Agency is not at this time issuing any determinations on acceptability of such substitutes, and will neither approve nor restrict their uses. Aerosol substitutes are covered in a separate section of this Preamble.
