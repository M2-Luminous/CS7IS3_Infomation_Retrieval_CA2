First of all, two new saxophones. He received one in Belgium and one from Vaclav Havel. What else? Clinton again staged a perfect show in front of skeptical Europeans and half-interested Russians. What was the substance of his visit? Clinton made the East Europeans accept the second-best solution (Partnership for Peace) instead of NATO membership (they really had no choice). He dodged the issue of Bosnia; he made Ukraine renounce its nuclear weapons (for the time being), and he promised Yeltsin a great deal of money. All in all, this is not a bad result. However -- and this is typical of Clinton -- numerous issues remain unsettled. How much is the Partnership for Peace really worth? Will the agreement with Ukraine hold? And: How important is Yeltsin still?
