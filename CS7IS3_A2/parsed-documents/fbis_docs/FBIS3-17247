At Workers' Request, Naturally"] [Text] At the briefing for journalists Sunday morning, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, the head of the kray administration, and the Vladimir Ignatenko, the president's Maritime Kray representative, announced that the date for elections to the Maritime Kray Duma and local self-rule bodies has been changed. Yevgeniy Nazdratenko said that on 19 March he signed Decree No. 116, which moves the date of elections from 27 March 1994 to 23 October 1994. Point 3 of this decree instructs the kray administration's financial services to redirect the money appropriated in the kray budget for conducting elections to Maritime Kray cities and rayons to be used for social protection of low- income citizens. Nazdratenko said the cost of these elections to the Maritime Kray budget amounts to R3 billion. The Central Electoral Commission allocated only R600 million. "We absolutely cannot take R2.4 billion out of the local budget on the threshold of spring sowing," said Nazdratenko and, in reply to journalists' questions, added: "If there is no money for elections in the fall, we will have to move them again." In addition, Nazdratenko reminded the gathering that a succession of court actions by a number of Maritime Kray political parties against the kray administration had been caused precisely because the parties considered it necessary to move up the elections. The kray court rejected the claims, but the parties which did not agree with the outcome appealed to the Supreme Court. "Therefore," said Nazdratenko, "we accommodated the wish of these people." It was especially emphasized at the briefing that Decree No. 116 had the concurrence of the Central Electoral Commission. At the same time, in the opinion of Ye. Nazdratenko and V. Ignatenko, the rights of already-nominated candidates for deputies are not violated in any way. In the fall they will have the same legal status as now, but in addition will be able to familiarize the voters much better with their views and programs. "This time will allow us to avoid the element of chance that was present in the short State Duma election campaign," said Nazdratenko. In short, the election campaign continues. As was announced at the briefing, Maritime Kray is not alone in its decision to move up the elections--17 Russian oblasts already have done so. Presidential representative Vladimir Ignatenko said that postponement of elections was to a considerable extent also prompted by forecasts of lower political activity of the population, which already had manifested itself during the 12 December elections. Ignatenko particularly emphasized that the decision to move the elections is not linked in any way to official charges the kray procuracy had brought against some officials in the Vladivostok administration and their suspension from their job for the time of inquiry. Moreover, in Ignatenko's opinion, those who are registered as candidates for deputy seats now get an excellent opportunity to explain in detail their political views and programs.
