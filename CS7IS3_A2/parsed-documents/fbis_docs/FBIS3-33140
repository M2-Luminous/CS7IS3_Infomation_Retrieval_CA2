The confirmation of the report made by economist Jose Carlos Alves dos Santos forestalled the political deaths of some important congressional leaders such as Deputy Ibsen Pinheiro (RS [Rio Grande do Sul]), Genebaldo Correia (BA [Bahia]) of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Jose Luis Maia (PI [Piaui]) of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], and Ricardo Fiuza (PE [Pernambuco]) of the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and knocked down Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena (PMDB-PB [Paraiba]) and the PMDB leader in the Senate, Mauro Benavides (CE [Ceara]). The political space created by the CPI's tarnishing of these leaders' image ended up opening room for a group of young politicians who today head the political negotiations. Ideology, different origin, and different political backgrounds are not obstacles to the new congressional foxes in understanding each other. In the conservative field, the most organized house is that of the PFL bloc in the Chamber of Deputies headed by Deputy Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes (BA). Magalhaes is serving his second term. He was elected to Congress with the help of his father, Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, but he shines because of his own merits. His most courageous move was to accept Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS), another emerging star serving his second term, as general coordinator of the constitutional revision process. "It was brilliant. Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes' decision prevented the articulation of a scheme by people opposing the revision, and guaranteed the beginning of the process," said former Minister Gustavo Krause (PFL-PE) in praising Magalhaes. Krause is serving his first term in Congress. Magalhaes' counterpart in the leftist field is Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-SP [Workers Party-Sao Paulo]), the oldest public servant (he is serving his third term) in the new generation of foxes. In association with Paulo Delgado (PT-MG [Minas Gerais]), Genoino paves the way for leftist proposals with a style entirely different from that used by his party's dogmatic executive board. Miro Teixeira (PDT-RJ [Democratic Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro]) and Jose Serra (PSDB-SP [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]) complete the group of the new cardinals association -- or the "Sacred College," as former President Jose Sarney defines it. "It is only natural for new leaders to appear and face new difficulties. The CPI affected Congress like the stripping of political rights changed it at the beginning of the military regime. The political space left empty by the latest changes must be occupied and the process is not easy," said Civil Household Chief Henrique Hargreaves, who has served in Congress since 1961. The process is more painful at the PMDB, which has the largest congressional representation. Before the CPI, party bloc leadership members were all supporters of former Governor Orestes Quercia. Today, the three most visible PMDB deputies are bloc leader Tarcisio Delgado (MG), CPI Vice President Odacir Klein (RS), and Luis Carlos Santos, government leader in the Chamber of Deputies. The three are opposed to Quercia and lead a congressional bloc where the former governor still has great influence. "My single most important working tool is dialogue. I am not the result of any agreement, and all I can do try to convince my colleagues. That is my style," Tarcisio Delgado said. He is a strange case among a group of legislators who were already involved in politics (in Juiz de Fora) before 1964. The young cardinals do not have a habit identifying them -- such as the "pears" [preceding word in French] liquor bottle made famous by [late senior Deputy] Ulysses Guimaraes' group -- and prefer to talk about common objectives. Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes, Genoino, Miro, and Klein were the main proponents of an important decision made by CPI coordinator Roberto Magalhaes (PFL-PE). They convinced the deputy -- who also feels comfortable with the group -- to abstain from making a partial report. "Roberto Magalhaes had the greatness of taking a step back. The partial report would have created such big pressure on the CPI that the investigation would have had to be cut short," Genoino recalls.
