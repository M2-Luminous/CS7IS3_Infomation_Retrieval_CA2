FR940323-0-00090 FR940323-0-00023 The Holy Ghost ipomopsis was included as a Category 2 candidate species in a February 21, 1990, notice of plants under review for classification as threatened or endangered species (55 FR 6184). Category 2 includes those taxa for which available information indicates that proposing to list them as endangered or threatened may be appropriate, but for which there are insufficient data to support listing proposals at this time. A status report was completed on the Holy Ghost ipomopsis in 1991 (Sivinski and Lightfoot 1991). This report, along with other available data, provided sufficient biological information to justify proposing to list the Holy Ghost ipomopsis as endangered. On September 22, 1992, the Service published in the Federal Register a proposed rule to list this species as endangered (57 FR 43682). A notice of public hearing and reopening of the comment period was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 4144) on January 13, 1993, and a public hearing was held on January 27, 1993. Summary of Comments and Recommendations In the September 22, 1992, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final action on this species. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment was published in the Santa Fe New Mexican on September 30, 1992. The public comment period was reopened and extended until February 23, 1993, in order to accommodate a request for a public hearing. Newspaper notices announcing the public hearing and extending the comment period were published in the Las Vegas Daily Optic on December 23, 1992, and in the Santa Fe New Mexican on January 1, 1993. A total of 11 written comments were received within the proposed rule comment period. One Federal agency and one State agency supported the proposal. Of the four individuals who commented on the proposal, three supported it and one opposed it. Five private organizations commented on the proposal; three supported it, one opposed it, and one was neutral. A public hearing was requested by Mr. Bert Turner, President of the Mora/San Juan County Farm and Livestock Bureau, Wagon Mound, New Mexico. The hearing was held at the Public Employees Retirement Association Building, Santa Fe, New Mexico, on January 27, 1993, with 21 people attending. Nine oral comments were presented at the hearing. One comment was supportive, three were in opposition, and five were neutral. Written comments received during the comment period and oral statements presented at the public hearing are covered in the following summary. Comments of a similar nature or point are grouped into a number of general issues. These issues, and the Service's response to each, are discussed below. Issue 1: Why was the public hearing held in the middle of winter rather than in the summer, when more of the nonresident owners of the summer homes could attend and people could see the plant? Response: The Act requires that a public hearing be held promptly if requested within 45 days after the date of publication of the proposed rule. The Service received a public hearing request on October 21, 1992, and scheduled the hearing for January 27, 1993. A delay would have violated the requirement to hold the hearing promptly and would have made it difficult to prepare a final action on the proposed rule within the 1-year deadline mandated by the Act. Issue 2: Why wasn't the public hearing held in Pecos, New Mexico, instead of Santa Fe, New Mexico? Response: Service policy dictates that, if requested, a public hearing will be held within the general area in which the species occurs. Santa Fe was thought to be the most convenient location for the public hearing. Issue 3: Why were the homeowners' association and adjacent landowners not notified about the upcoming public hearing?
