KZP Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During slammed the late night raid as "highly suspect, provocative and unacceptable", adding that it had jeopardised KZP/SAP relations. SAP spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said on Wednesday morning he was not aware of any raid, but promised to investigate the claim. Gen During said the move was initiated by Mac Maharaj, senior African National Congress representative on the Transitional Executive Council and lawyer Howard Varney who is investigating alleged KZP hit squads. Gen During said the SAP had told him the raid was executed because training at the Mlaba camp was in contravention of the state of emergency, declared in Natal/KwaZulu almost a month ago. The SAP was also apparently seeking suspected members of alleged hit squads who were supposed to have been harboured at the camp, Gen During said. Several arms, ammunition, a "large number" of manuals and documents were seized in the raid, he added. But, "no evidence of unlawful military or paramilitary training was found and neither was there any trace of the so-called hit squad suspects", Gen During said. The general criticised the timing of the raid, saying it was bound to affect goodwill which existed between the KZP and SAP. "In many quarters this incident will no doubt be regarded as an invasion and an aggression against the KwaZulu government and people," he added. The Mlaba camp has trained thousands of recruits to form "self-protection units" throughout Natal and in the Transvaal, but the ANC alleges its graduates have been involved in fomenting violence.
