The news came at a working-level contact held in New York Wednesday between Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korea's mission to the United Nations, and Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian and Pacific affairs, diplomatic sources said. Ho told Hubbard that Pyongyang would issue visas for the IAEA inspectors as soon as possible, the sources said. In this connection, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Wednesday that he believed North Korea would allow the IAEA team to inspect seven reported nuclear sites in Yongbyon soon. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said that Pyongyang had told the IAEA it would welcome the inspection team's visit. At the meeting in New York, North Korea is understood to have relayed a reply from Kang Sok-chu, its representative at the first two rounds of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, to a letter from his U.S. counterpart Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs. The sources noted that the two sides have already agreed that the U.S. and South Korean Governments would announce the suspension of the joint military exercise "Team Spirit" and set the date for the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks after the IAEA inspection and resumption of inter-Korean dialogue. If South and North Korea agree to exchange special envoys, Washington plans to hold further high-level talks with Pyongyang in mid-March, the sources said. And with North Korea's professed willingness to issue visas for the IAEA inspectors, the team would likely arrive in Pyongyang early next week at the latest, barring any unexpected developments in the meantime, the sources added.
