Will It Be Better Than the Old?"] [Text] The non-party bloc Nova Khvylya [New Wave] consists of people who are well known in the Lvov area and Ukraine generally: present people's deputies I. Yukhnovskyy, M. Kosiv, I. Hryniv, V. Pynzenyk, and T. Stetskiv, also I. Koliushko, L. Zakharchyshyn, O. Kryvenko, Yu. Kolotiy, O. Pavlenko, Z. Hladun, and Z. Romovska. It's no wonder that the press conference the bloc held in Lvov caught journalists' interest. Mykhaylo Kosiv explained the bloc's name this way: right now Lvov is represented in Parliament by the "Sixtiers," and it's time someone worthy replaced replaced them, promising young politicians, professional jurists, economists and political scientists. It was emphasized that the New Wavers are by no means unanimous. Ihor Hryniv, for example, thinks the only way to solve the problem of late wages is to print more money, which the Supreme Council has to approve at the current session. Viktor Pynzenyk definitely disagrees, and said in his usual colorful manner just what steps need to be taken. First, eliminate that pseudo-bank, the Ukrainian National Bank. Next, put the head of the bank in one of the shafts where strategic weapons have been stored, guarded by at least one division. Third, fix the exchange rate of the karbovanets to the U.S. dollar at 50,000 to 1. Fourth, keep strictly to the rule that the budget is exclusively for budget-funded organizations. No enterprise or organization has any claim to budget funds. Press conference participants also disagreed on the role of people's deputies role in handling problems of the regions they were elected from. Viktor Pynzenyk believes all local problems are the job of rayon and oblast deputies. A Ukraine people's deputy should deal exclusively with republic-level problems. Ihor Hryniv's view of the situation in Parliament is that deputies from the eastern oblasts have formed a lobby resulting in a strong imbalance in subsidies. Regarding cooperation between Ukraine and other countries, V. Pynzenyk thinks we do not lack for ties. We have them. What we do need is rubles, dollars, and... wisdom. Former members of the CEMA and USSR want to cooperate with us, and they will. All we need to do is abolish the artificially high exchange rate of the Ukrainian 373 karbovanets and the U.S. dollar. Our policy's strategic line should follow the path our forefathers blazed, of their Varangians to the Greeks, say M. Kosiv, T. Stetskiv, and O. Kryvenko. Our foreign policy and geographic position will serve day by day to strengthen our position in the Black Sea reagion. Building a terminal in Odessa will reduce our dependency on our northern neighbor. The recent treaty between Russia and Georgia is nothing but a shotgun wedding, hence unstable. At the end of the press conference, T. Stetskiv assured journalists that Nova Khvylya is willing at any time to coordinate the bloc's lists with those of democratic parties, and if a Nova Khvylya candidate's rating is lower, he will withdraw from the campaign.
