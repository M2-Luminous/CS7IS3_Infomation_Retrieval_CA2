Qian said the two prime ministers held very good talks Thursday [7 April] and had reached an extensive agreement on many issues while Juppe described the talks as very positive and constructive, saying the French side was satisfied with the results. The two foregin ministers agreed that China and France have cooperated very well on the question of Cambodia and both have made contributions to the settlement of the issue. Such cooperation should continue, Juppe said. Qian noted that the United Nations' actions were successful in Cambodia where a new government has been formed. He pointed out that the Cambodian issue has now been settled as an international issue, therefore the domestic issues are internal affairs of Cambodia and those issues should be settled by the Cambodian people themselves. Juppe shared Qian's view. Qian reaffirmed China's continuing support to King Sihanouk as the leader of Cambodia. Briefing Qian on the latest development in the Bosnia and Herzegovina region, Juppe said a new situation has emerged in Sarajevo where the residents have begun to live a normal life. However, there is still a long way to go before the final settlement of the problems, and an overall view is needed by all the parties concerned, Juppe said. Qian hoped that the efforts for a settlement of the Bosnia and Herzegovina question make new progress through negotiations. Qian briefed Juppe on China's position on the question of Hong Kong.
