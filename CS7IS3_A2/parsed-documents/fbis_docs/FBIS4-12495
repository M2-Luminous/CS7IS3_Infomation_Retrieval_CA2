From the very outset, the Islamic Republic has used all of its hellish strength to crush the national-democratic movement of our people and has not spared any crime or any violence -- neither military, police, nor political -- in this effort. Nevertheless, we see how, after 15 years of suppression, the Kordestan movement continues to stand strongly and powerfully in the struggle against reaction, and that the banner of this struggle continues to be in the powerful hands of the Democratic Party of Kordestan. The Islamic Republic sees itself at an impasse any way it turns and it also is well aware that one day Kordestan will explode like a bomb and will shake the unpopular rule of the regime. Thus, thinking that it can prevent such a fate, it once again wants to send even more forces to Kordestan to further militarize this area and to display its military strength in this part of our country. However, such a military expedition and such an amassing of forces in Kordestan not only does not show the strength of the Islamic Republic of Iran but, on the contrary, shows the regime's helplessness vis-a-vis the problems of Kordestan and the other (?national problems) in the country. The regime is facing many problems because of the reduction in oil prices, its lack of credibility stemming from its inability to repay its foreign debts, the private sector's control over the foreign exchange market, the devaluation of the rial, because of the closure of a large number of (?plants and factories), and because of [word indistinct] (?shortages). Meanwhile, the people's dissatisfaction and aversion are growing. Unemployment and high prices are (?threatening) [words indistinct], and the regime's isolation on the international scenes and the West's pressures on the regime have [words indistinct] the ruling regime. It is because of all these things that the Islamic Republic has decided to equip its armed forces more than ever and to prepare itself to confront possible incidents. The military maneuvers that were recently carried out by the law-enforcement forces were also because of this. Clearly, there is a powerful popular movement in Kordestan. The regime lacks a (?political) base in this region, and Kordestan is the weakest link in the chain of the Islamic Republic's rule. So now the regime thinks that by a military expedition and by accelerating the militarization of Kordestan it can (?overcome these problems). However, the experience of the past 15 years has shown that supression and violence cannot destroy the struggle by the Kurdish masses, but that this struggle will become stronger each day. We firmly believe that one day the military and police forces of the regime will melt like snowmen from the heat of the struggles by the Kurdish people. We thus assure the regime's officials that this time too, as in the past, they are making a mistake in their calculations on the Kordestan problem.
