FR940126-2-00068 FR940126-2-00031 Geological Survey Application Notice Establishing the Closing Date for Transmittal of Applications Under the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 AGENCY: U.S. Geological Survey, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Applications are invited for research projects under the NEHRP. Authority for this program is contained in the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977, Public Law 95&hyph;124 (42 U.S.C. 7701, et seq. ). The purpose of this program is to support research in earthquake hazards prediction to provide earth-science data and information essential to mitigate earthquake damage. Applications may be submitted by educational institutions, private firms, private foundations, individuals, and agencies of State and local governments. The NEHRP supports research related to the following general areas of interest: I. Understanding the earthquake source: Determine the physical properties and mechanical behavior of active crustal fault zones and their surroundings; and develop quantitative models of the physics of earthquake processes. II. Evaluating earthquake potential: Determine the geological and geophysical setting and characteristics of seismically active regions; determine the occurrence, distribution and source properties of earthquakes, and relate seismicity to geologic structures and tectonic processes; determine the nature and rates of crustal deformation; characterize the earthquake potential of the United States on a regional and national basis; identify active faults, define their geometry, and determine the characteristics and dates of past earthquakes; conduct research to facilitate long-term probabilistic forecasts of the likelihood of large earthquakes on active fault; conduct intensified monitoring experiments in selected regions of high seismic potential; and develop and evaluate short-and intermediate-term earthquake prediction methods. III. Predicting the effects of earthquakes: Acquire data needed for the prediction of ground shaking, ground failure, and response of engineered structures; predict strong ground shaking at local, regional and national scales; predict ground failure at local and regional scales; and evaluate earthquake risk and losses. IV. Applying and utilizing research results: Application of research results; transference of hazards and risk information and assessment methods to users. ADDRESSES: The program announcement is expected to be available on or about February 14, 1994. You may obtain a copy of Announcement 8064 by writing to Mary Burkett, U.S. Geological Survey, Office of Procurement and Contracts_Mail Stop 205C, 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, Virginia 22092. Organizations that applied for an FY 1994 award, and organizations that requested to be retained on the mailing list since the last announcement will be mailed a copy of Announcement 8064. DATES: Applications must be received on or about April 14, 1994.
