At the meeting Yi Sang-nak, vice-chairman of the State Environmental Commission, gave a lecture under the title "One Globe, One Family." Noting that environmental protection has become an important common task facing the mankind in saving it from environmental pollution and degradation and making a sustained development, he said the developed industrial nations have thrown away a fabulous amount of polluting materials, seriously polluting the environment of the globe and causing irrevocably grave damage to the lives and health of the people. "In our country, the best socialist system of Korean style centred on the people has been built and an environmental policy for the people has been pursued under the wise guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, with the result that enormous achievements have been registered in environmental protection in the country", he said, and continued: "The great leader's idea of environmental protection has been successfully carried forward by the dear leader. In the days when he began leading our revolution, the dear leader expounded an original idea that environmental protection is not merely a technical and working matter but an important political one for improving the people's health and providing them with conditions for an independent and creative life, and clearly indicated the way of carrying it into practice. "The adoption of `the law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Environmental Protection' has led to the codification of the idea of the great leader and the dear leader for environmental protection and the achievements in this domain." Referring to the tasks for environmental protection, he declared: "We will as ever remain faithful to the international obligation for environmental protection by honestly discharging the national duty for it." The chief of the United Nations Development Program [UNDP] mission also spoke at the meeting. A friendship gathering between officials of the state environmental commission and members of the UNDP mission took place.
