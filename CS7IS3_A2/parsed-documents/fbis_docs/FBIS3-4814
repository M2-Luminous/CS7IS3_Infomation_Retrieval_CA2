"As the world has changed dramatically after the collapse of the Cold War structure, our country's handling of defense and security must change as well," Hosokawa said at the outset of the inaugural meeting of the panel. The premier called on the forum to debate new defense policies "from a stance that takes into account the changed international situation, technological progress and economic and human resources." Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of ASAHI Breweries Ltd., was elected as chairman of the nine-member group, with Ken Moroi, chairman of Chichibu Cement Co., as acting chairman. Higuchi later told reporters the panel will discuss the background and the underlying philosophy of the national defense program outline, which has served as Japan's basic defense policy since 1976, as well as the current international situation. The next meeting of the panel is scheduled for March 9. The group will offer recommendations to Hosokawa by around summer for a revision of the national defense program outline after debating overall defense matters once a week, Higuchi said. The program calls for the government to maintain security arrangements against large-scale attacks and also to build up Japan's own defense capabilities to repel limited-scale invasion. Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies, including Japan's future role in United Nations-led peacekeeping operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the Defense Agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995. The nine members include Kuniko Inoguchi, a Sophia University professor, Yoshio Okawara, former ambassador to the United States and currently special adviser to the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Bank of Tokyo Chairman Toyoo Gyohten, and Makoto Sakuma, former Joint Staff Council chairman and currently special consultant for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. The other members are Seiki Nishihiro, former vice minister for the Defense Agency and currently adviser to Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Shinji Fukukawa, vice president of Kobe Steel Ltd., and Akio Watanabe, an Aoyama Gakuin University professor.
