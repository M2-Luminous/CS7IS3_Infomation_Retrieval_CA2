FR940803-0-00019 FR940803-0-00007 Table 1._ Money Market Interest Rates 1Maturity 1Yields as of July 5, 1994 1Change since Jan. 1, 1994 in basis points 3-month 4.29 121 6-month 4.82 148 1-year 5.49 186 2-year 6.15 184 3-year 6.46 185 5-year 6.94 165 10-year 7.32 141 30-year 7.61 192 The first factor is low average loan balance. For example, the credit unions with under $2,000,000 in assets have an average unsecured balance of $1,314, with many loans below $1,000. There are fixed costs of granting and processing a loan. Many of these costs are incurred regardless of the size of the loan. Expressed as a percentage of the loan balance on which interest will be collected, these costs can be very high on small loans. As one credit union states, ``The total interest earned on a $200 loan at 17 percent for 12 months is $34. Even at 17 percent it costs us more to make the loan than we recover in interest income, assuming it does pay to maturity and is not charged off.'' The Functional Cost and Profit Analysis by the Federal Reserve System calculates the average cost to a credit union for making an installment loan to be $95.66 plus $5.49 per payment. The $34 does not even cover the cost of accepting the twelve payments. Many banks will not even consider loan applications for less than $1,000. Lowering the interest rate ceiling for credit unions will discourage credit unions, too, from making these loans. Credit seekers' options will be reduced, with most of the affected members having no choice but to turn to neighborhood lenders. The second factor is credit risk. Loans to young members who have not yet established a credit history and loans to those who have built weak credit histories both carry high credit risk. Credit unions must charge rates high enough to cover higher-than-usual losses for such loans. There are undoubtedly more than 1,477 credit unions charging over 15 percent for unsecured loans to such members. Many credit unions have ``Credit Builder'' or ``Credit Rebuilder'' loans but must report the ``most common'' rate on the Call Report for unsecured loans. The third factor is credit union size. Small credit unions have fewer loans over which to distribute their overhead costs. Thus, small credit unions making small loans to borrowers with poor or no credit histories are struggling with far higher costs than the typical credit union. Both young people and lower income households have limited access to credit and, absent a credit union, often pay rates of 24 to 30 percent to small loan companies. Or they may be forced to resort to the check-cashing outlet where a post-dated check will be cashed at effective rates of 200, or even 300, percent. Rates between 15 and 18 percent are attractive to such members. The higher rates are necessary to help cover the credit unions' costs of providing this kind of credit. Table 2 shows the number of credit unions in each asset-size group that charge more than 15 percent for unsecured loans. It also shows the percent of credit unions in each group that do so. NCUA staff are not aware of any complaints from members of those credit unions offering high-risk, high-interest rate loans.
