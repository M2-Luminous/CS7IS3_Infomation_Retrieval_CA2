So far, 14 large and medium-sized iron and steel complexes along the Chang Jiang river and interior parts of the country have imported iron ore via the port. The special wharf of the port began to serve the Shanghai Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex, a large modern enterprise, in 1982 and later the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex. To meet the needs of different iron and steel plants, the Beilun Port has expanded its stockyards three times to raise its storage capacity from the original 500,000 tons to one million tons at present. A survey shows that the port has handled 40 million tons of imported iron ore in 20 varieties so far. At present, construction of another iron ore wharf able to accommodate 300,000-dwt [deadweight ton] ships is proceeding well. It will be able to handle between 28 million tons and 30 million tons of iron ore a year upon completion.
