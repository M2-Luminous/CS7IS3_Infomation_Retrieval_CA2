The agreement was signed between China Gongan Industrial Development Company and Nordex Group Ltd. -- a multinational corporation exploring business primarily in the former Soviet Union republics. Rent totalling 29 million U.S. dollars will be paid in installments over five years. Afterwards China may take ownership of the jumbos. Last year China rented passenger aircraft from Uzbekistan on wet lease, sharing profits with the lender. This time China can pocket all profits during the lease period.
