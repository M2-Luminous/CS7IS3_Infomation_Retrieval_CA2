That is not to argue that the British and Irish governments should not have put forward the Downing Street Declaration on Northern Ireland. The province's problems are such that any well-based and well-intentioned attempt to overcome them should command a sympathetic and patient hearing. But the Ulster impasse is so intractable that the risk of failure is always likely to outweigh the prospects of success. It is still too early to say that the declaration has failed completely in its main aim of persuading Sinn Fein and the IRA to renounce violence and enter the normal political process. The Republican high command appears genuinely tempted by the opportunity it offers it to get off the treadmill of violence on which it is trapped. On Wednesday [2 February] in these pages Paul Vallely reported on the mood among Sinn Fein activists across the province as they debated their response. A majority seemed to favour acceptance. But Sinn Fein, of course, has little inherent respect for majorities. In an organisation that accords more weight to the Armalite than the ballot box, and in which death at the hands of one's colleagues is an ever-present possibility, even a majority of 75 per cent is not necessarily conclusive. In these circumstances it could be very many months before the Sinn Fein/IRA leadership is ready to risk any move, for or against the declaration. For Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, this prevarication is anyway paying handsome dividends. Not only has it enabled him to claim a specious aura of political respectability, but he also hopes it will now elicit either concessions from London and Dublin (in which case the Republicans will have effectively entered negotiations without having to renounce violence) or gain him what amounts to a veto on all other political activity in the province while Sinn Fein and the IRA make up their minds. Either scenario is clearly intolerable for the rest of Northern Ireland, for London and for Dublin. The problem that immediately faces the two governments is how, having failed to impose a deadline earlier, they now respond. As a stratagem for putting pressure on Mr Adams, the intention of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, to table outline proposals on devolution and ways of increasing co-operation with the Republic, and to restart his bilateral talks with the province's parties, looks weak. Coming just as the Sinn Fein leader steps off the plane from America, the announcement smacks of panic. And since both governments are agreed that the declaration will stay on the table, it is likely to be seen as at best a stop-gap. Faced with Sinn Fein's snubs and prevarications, however, it is important that Sir Patrick's initiative be given as much credibility as possible. A great deal will now depend on Dublin. When both the Sunningdale and Anglo-Irish accords ran into trouble, its interest in the province waned. Now that the declaration shows signs of going the same way, Dublin must not be allowed to wash its hands for a third time. Up to now it has invariably cast itself as the champion of the nationalist SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party] and its leader Mr John Hume. In the wake of the declaration, a more dispassionate stance would be more constructive. Dublin should vigorously reassure the Unionists, with action as well as words, that it is not in Mr Hume's pocket and that it takes their concerns as seriously as it does the Nationalists'. It must make clear to the SDLP that they should take seriously British efforts to make political progress within the province. This time Dublin must stand shoulder to shoulder with London, otherwise the declaration will surely fail.
