Overseas information shows that mainland China has ordered three large kilo-class K110 diesel-powered attack submarines from Russia. Their operational level of silence is quite high, and they will constitute a threat to shipping safety in Taiwan waters and the entire western Pacific. Sources pointed out that the unit price of the three K110 submarines ordered by the mainland is possibly around $250 million, and three quarters of the payment will be made in the form of barter trade. The mainland also used this form for most of the payment in buying 26 Su-27 fighter planes from Russia. Since this transaction includes importing Russian technology and personnel to develop the capacity to produce K-class submarines, the main force of submarines using traditional motive power of the mainland navy may possibly be K-class submarines. However, Russia is not satisfied with the mainland's "buying only" three submarines and is ready to ask the mainland to buy more "to show sincerity," and may expresse reservations about the transfer of technology during the upcoming visit to Russia of Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and admiral of the mainland navy. A national report published at the end of March this year predicted that the mainland may put the K-class submarines on the list of arms to be obtained from Russia. However, when asked about the matter, Taipei naval officers were still quite surprised and pointed out that at present the mainland has only six "quite modern" Han-class nuclear-powered attack submarines and that although it has over 80 Ming-class (model 035) and R-class (model 033) traditional diesel-powered submarines, more than half of them cannot not perform on the high seas, and they are old and make a great deal of noise in operation. If in addition to the nuclear-powered submarines, the mainland obtains K-class submarines from Russia, and if Taipei wants to carry out a counter-blockade to safeguard shipping, the two existing Stegosaur submarines are not enough in terms of fighting capacity.
