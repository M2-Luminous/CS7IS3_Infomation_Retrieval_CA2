FR940719-0-00004 FR940719-0-00001 VI. Regulatory Analysis With respect to 10 CFR Part 171, on November 5, 1990, the Congress passed Public Law No. 101&hyph;508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA&hyph;90). OBRA&hyph;90, as amended, requires that for FYs 1991 through 1998 approximately 100 percent of the NRC's budget authority be recovered through the assessment of fees. To accomplish this statutory requirement for FY 1991 and FY 1992, the NRC on July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31472), and on July 23, 1992 (57 FR 32691), in accordance with §171.13, published in the Federal Register schedules of the FY 1991 and FY 1992 annual fees for operating reactor licensees, fuel cycle licensees, materials licensees, holders of Certificates of Compliance, registrations of sealed source and devices and QA program approvals, and Government agencies. In FY 1991 and FY 1992, the NRC allocated low-level waste (LLW) costs by the amount of waste disposed per class of licensee, dividing the costs equally within each class. This method of cost allocation was challenged in court. On March 16, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided Allied-Signal, Inc., v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States of America, 988 F.2d 146 (DC Cir. 1993). The court questioned the Commission's decision to allocate generic costs associated with low-level waste (LLW) disposal by classes of licensees, rather than by individual licensees. The Court remanded only the FY 1991 rule; however, the FY 1992 rule raised identical questions. The same petitioners who challenged the FY 1991 rule in court also brought a judicial challenge to the FY 1992 rule. In response to the court decision, the NRC in its proposed FY 1993 annual fee rule published on April 23, 1993 (58 FR 21662), requested comments on four alternative methods of LLW cost allocation and possible variations of those alternatives. A number of comments were received. There was no consensus among the commenters regarding a preferred option. In response to the Court's directive, the NRC, in its final fee rule for FY 1993, published on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38669), changed its method of allocating LLW costs to NRC licensees. The NRC, for FY 1993, created two groups_large waste generators and small waste generators. Licensees within each group are charged a uniform flat fee. In the final FY 1993 rule, the NRC also adopted this approach for FY 1991 and FY 1992, indicating that it would separately publish a final rule revising the FY 1991 and FY 1992 surcharges resulting from the changed allocation of NRC LLW budgeted generic costs. This final rule establishes the revised surcharges for FY 1991 and FY 1992. VII. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this final rule as adopted does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule establishes revised surcharges for FY 1991 and FY 1992. These revised surcharges will not impose new financial burdens on any class of licensees for FY 1991 and FY 1992. Rather, certain licensees will be eligible for either refunds or credits based on the differences between the amount of the revised surcharges and the amounts initially paid in FY 1991 and FY 1992. VIII. Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule and that a backfit analysis is not required for this final rule. The backfit analysis is not required because these amendments do not require the modification of or additions to systems, structures, components, or design of a facility or the design approval or manufacturing license for a facility or the procedures or organization required to design, construct or operate a facility.
