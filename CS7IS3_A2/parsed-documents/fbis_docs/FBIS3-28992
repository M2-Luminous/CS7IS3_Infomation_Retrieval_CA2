They said Hata used the meeting to emphasize to the United States that Japan has no intention to arm itself with nuclear weapons. In response to calls by some U.S. lawmakers for Japan to halt cash remittances by North Korean residents in Japan, Hata said without elaboration that he understands some money is sent from Japan to North Korea via a third country, the officials said.
