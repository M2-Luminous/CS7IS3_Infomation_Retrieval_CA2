He emphasised his 4 million dollars aid for Macedonia is aimed to alleviate losses resulting from the Greek embargo. Mr. Soros met with top-level politicians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and with parliament groups' representatives. Yesterday afternoon he had a meeting with President Gligorov, followed by a joint press-conference. President Gligorov underlines Mr. Soros' contribution and his readiness to help at these difficult times in Macedonia. We have very useful discussions, Gligorov said, primarily on the embargo and possible ways to endure it, as well as on the media in Macedonia, possibilities on more frequent programs on minority languages, etc. Soros condemned the embargo in front of the press, warning against a possible wider conflict in the region to involve neighbouring countries, unless the embargo is lifted. Those are the reasons, he explained, Macedonia presently needs economic aid to survive. Asked by Greek paper "Elefterothipia" whether he would send a letter to UN mediator Cyrus Vance in the same way Athens did, President Gligorov answered positively. Mr. Soros stated he had not had an did not plan any contacts with the Greek government at present.
