After a joint meeting of the council and the campaign management, the council sent a letter to settlement leaders in the territories saying that after an in-depth review of the issue, it was decided not to implement the campaign because of the many problems that have cropped up. Our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that settlement leaders are concerned that a campaign in which dozens of outposts are set up in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip will not gain public support. At the same time, settlement leaders are planning a campaign to locate and demarcate state lands in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip with the aid of authorized surveyors.
