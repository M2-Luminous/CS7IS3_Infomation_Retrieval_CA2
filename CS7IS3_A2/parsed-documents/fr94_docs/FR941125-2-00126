FR941125-2-00126 FR941125-2-00083 INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION [Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;663 (Final)] Certain Paper Clips From China Determination On the basis of the record 1 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines, pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)) (the Act), that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports from China of certain paper clips, provided for in subheading 8305.90.30 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 2 that have been found by the Department of Commerce to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). 1 The record is defined in ยง207.2(f) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR ยง207.2(f)). 2 The imported paper clips covered by this investigation include paper clips made wholly of wire of base metal, whether or not galvanized, whether or not plated with nickel or other base metal (e.g., copper), the foregoing with a wire diameter between 0.64 and 1.91 millimeters (0.025 and 0.075 inches), regardless of physical configuration, except as specifically excluded. Such products may have a rectangular or ring-like shape and include, but are not limited to, clips commercially referred to as ``No. 1'' clips, ``No. 3'' clips, ``jumbo'' or ``giant'' clips, ``gem'' clips, ``frictioned'' clips, ``Perfect Gems,'' ``Marcel Gems,'' ``universal'' clips, ``nifty'' clips, ``peerless'' clips, ``ring'' clips, and ``glide-on'' clips. Specifically excluded from the scope of this investigation are plastic and vinyl covered paper clips, butterfly clips, binder clips, or other paper fasteners that are not made wholly of wire of base metal and are covered under a separate subheading of the HTS. Background The Commission instituted this investigation effective May 16, 1994, following a preliminary determination by the Department of Commerce that imports of certain paper clips from China were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. ยง1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the Federal Register of June 8, 1994 (59 FR 29614). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on October 4, 1994, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on November 14, 1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2829 (November 1994), entitled ``Certain Paper Clips From the People's Republic of China: Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;663 (Final).'' By order of the Commission. Issued: November 16, 1994. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28951 Filed 11&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
