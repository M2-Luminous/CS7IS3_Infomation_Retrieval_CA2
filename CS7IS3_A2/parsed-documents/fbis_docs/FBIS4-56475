I decided to ask Gustavo Roosen directly. This was how the interview developed. [Croes] What has happened? [Roosen] We thought that with peace in this large area, the others would ease up a bit, but this has not been the case. It did not work out this way. The situation has become very complicated. I hope my familiarity with the financial sector and the relations I developed as president of the Central Bank of Venezuela will allow me to find an agreement that will change our current image, which has been nefarious to the confidence of account holders and users of the intermediation system. This situation has led us to figures of such magnitude that it really should worry all Venezuelans. [Croes] What is your role? [Roosen] Look, basically, I would say I am a facilitator. The moment one thinks one has a task that is different from other government institutions, one is condemned to failure. There are four government tasks that have to prevail in time and two of them have been bolstered in the recent Bank Law: the General Bank Superintendency and Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund]. I would say the first point of agreement has to be with all sectors, including the financial ones in this case, to strengthen the government's supervisory ability, which has been the true cause of this problem. The second is a thorough reorganization of Fogade to allow it to capitalize appropriately, justify its accounts with the Central Bank, and balance those accounts in the public deficit. [Croes] What does this reorganization imply? [Roosen] The Public Credit Law has not been implemented. All the subsidies have been awarded through advances on future bank contributions. The Public Credit Law has to be implemented for Fogade to capitalize efficiently and for those documents to be placed in the banking sector. Those Fogade documents [words indistinct] in the system, will attenuate the impact of the advances made on the Central Bank where they appear as insolvent balances accruing interest. Fogade's financial structure now has to be reorganized with the help of experts and with a bit of backing by this superintendency. I also hope other Venezuelans of goodwill will help. In addition, the rest of the banking sector must lend its support by providing top-notch executives that will allow us to harmonize the administrative councils of the banks that are being subsidized. The reports on the distressed banks, which are to be issued by those councils, will determine if they are to be reorganized or liquidated. Up to now the group of people who have been helping in the Banco Latino case have dedicated entire days, the Holy Week holidays, and more to this endeavor. We have to strengthen this work with people from other banks as this will give the group a much more heterogeneous character. [Croes] Now from the information that you have, do you think there are banks in this group that can recover? [Roosen] I don't know because the information I have is very contradictory. From Fogade I received a report in the evening, and we were discussing these things at Miraflores. It is presumed these banks still maintain more or less 40 percent of their base of deposits. We believe this is not even true, based on comments in hallways, cocktail parties, and funerals, which is where people learn about things in Venezuela, but there is no accurate information. Therefore, any speculation on my part would be inappropriate. [Croes] Don't the papers they have given to Fogade to support those contributions have important economic backing? [Roosen] I cannot evaluate a situation based on assumptions. I am under the impression they have given out so many papers, they must be delivering papers that do not have a partial value of 100 percent. I personally think--my intuition tells me--I do not know today that the level of subsidies is such a number and, therefore, the disbursement of the portfolio should be so much. Already the loan portfolio that is most difficult to recover must be disbursed to Fogade as a guarantee. Thus, those holdings cannot have the same value as "top loan portfolios" ["lomito"]. By now, it must have different kinds of portfolios and that, of course, represents in the end a problem those banks will have to account for in their reorganization processes. Now, if the reorganization shows there is a possibility the bank will float, that it can be effectively managed, well, let us hope for this. However, I am afraid some of them will not have.... [Croes] What is the solidarity agreement? [Roosen] It is a solidarity agreement on the financial issue particularly. It must determine the support bases required from the rest of the banks; the intermediation mechanisms that could be used to replace the zero-coupon bond, totally or partially. What kind of cooperation will be asked from the rest of the banking sector in terms of human resources; what type of structure must we implement to organize Fogade financially; what kind of foreign support must we seek to give meaning to the spirit, purpose, and objective of the Bank Law regarding the supervision or autonomy capacity of the Superintendency. These would be needed bases to achieve consensus that could make progress tomorrow in a meeting with a group of bankers. This could perhaps crystallize Sunday in some kind of agreement establishing the intention to make specific things, restoring confidence, and ending this pattern that led us to a crisis. [Croes] What specific things, for instance? [Roosen] In addition to the reorganization of Fogade and the Superintendency, those specific things are the on-loan transfer of top-notch executives to create administrative boards at the assisted banks, the search for alternatives such as treasury bills to sell financial surpluses, the objective discussion of interest rates, the current margin of intermediation and how to tackle them. Others are the level of delinquent loan portfolios that may exist in a bank, in all banks, and what are the possible solutions. These should be the basis of the agreement to deal with the situation we are faced with today. [Croes] Those banks have, in fact, undergone intervention. [Roosen] Those banks, if you will, have been nationalized. They have not undergone intervention because, Carlos, that is a very specific legal word. [Croes] Of course. They have been nationalized. However, the question I keep asking myself is if all of these banks are salvageable or if all of them are liquid? What are we going to do about this...are we going to continue spending money? [Roosen] I cannot give you an opinion on something of which I am not aware. I am under the impression, if my intuition is accurate, that some of the banks might be salvageable through mergers, some of them may have critical assets of their own to survive and others may have no other alternative but liquidation. [Croes] What is your perception of the system's situation in general? [Roosen] My perception is that it is lethargic; on the one hand, you have subsidies [auxilios] and on the other, the zero coupon bonds, which have eliminated financial intermediation in the country. [Croes] But what would the banks do without the zero coupon bonds? [Roosen] I would prefer at any given time to seek a concerted effort regarding the issuance of treasury bonds that would give the state the liquidity to undertake public projects or pay debts so the economy will begin to move again, instead of uselessly sterilizing money at a rate of 54 percent at the Central Bank. [Croes] Is that not what is currently saving those banks that are totally inactive because of the productive apparatus's recession? [Roosen] Suppose for a minute that you could update all of the treasury bonds, which have fallen behind and that the banks agree to purchase the treasury bonds as a mechanism for placement of their excess cash; the treasury bonds are intended to foster investment or public spending, right? While the zero coupon bonds are intended by definition for sterilization at the Central Bank and will serve no purpose at all. [Croes] This means you would replace the zero coupon bonds with the treasury bonds? [Roosen] That is one example. [Croes] Is the atmosphere within the government appropriate for that plan? [Roosen] I believe so. [Croes] Does the post of commissioner entail special duties? Are they established in any decree? [Roosen] They are not established. I told you at the beginning of our conversation that in my opinion the commissioner should be a person who will facilitate the unity of the four state institutions that are in charge of financial matters, who will have a nonfinancial, nonbanker view of the interior of the financial institutions, who will attempt to achieve certain basic agreements...a course of action to regain confidence in the system. [Croes] How is Banco Latino doing? [Roosen] Very well. Truly very well. The final great test came on 20 April when, as you may recall, we opened the Liquid Assets Fund in which we had 147 billion bolivares in deposits and from which we expected a considerable flight of money prompted by uncertainty. Contrary to international experience, however, that was not the case. People came in to renew their accounts, they closed some of them, but the following day's compensation rates were quite modest compared to the withdrawals we expected. [Croes] Have withdrawals by people who had less than 10 million bolivares stopped? [Roosen] That situation has totally normalized. [Croes] What percentage of the deposits remains? [Roosen] I cannot say exactly, but it is very high. I had even said publicly that international experience shows that up to 40 percent of the deposits would be lost. I do not have our figures but I would say that very little of the deposits were lost. [Croes] When one sees, for example, a document from the General Bank Superintendency which states that there are subsidized banks that have lost 14 times their capital...how can a bank like that be saved? [Roosen] No. I do not see how their current shareholders can believe so...unless these gentlemen are willing to bring in 14 times their capital and reincorporate it here. I am looking at this from the viewpoint of something similar to what the Banking Superintendency did; the state takes over the losses, saves the shares that can be recovered, and then sells them. [Croes] It would take the place of all the shareholders? [Roosen] Of course, from my viewpoint that is an obvious condition.
