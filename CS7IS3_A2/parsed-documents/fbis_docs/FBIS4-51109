Sung in Beijing] [Text] The Hong Kong Government will take a hardline stance on Chinese dissidents wanting to visit the territory next month. It's a bid to fend off China's fears the territory will be used as a base for "subversive" activity during the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The government, it is believed, will reject visa applications from a growing number of prominent Chinese political activists preparing to gather here for the fifth anniversary of the June 4 crackdown. The move is designed to block any row with China. Sources close to the Beijing government told the Hong Kong Standard that a planned visit by dissident leader Wuer Kaixi at about the time of the Tiananmen anniversary would be regarded as confrontational. A government spokesman said yesterday that no application had yet been received from dissidents wanting to visit the territory but several dissidents, including Wuer Kaixi, the leader of the Tiananmen Square movement, have already announced publicly their intention to come here. Another prominent dissident, Chai Ling, is also believed to be planning a visit for the June 4 anniversary. The Hong Kong Government believes the visits are part of an orchestrated move by Chinese dissidents, a move which would not be welcomed by local authorities. The government is likely to use its powers to reject visa applications to abide by the one country, two systems policy and avoid becoming involved in China's internal affairs. A Chinese official said any approval by the Hong Kong authorities for Wuer Kaixi to visit the territory would be seen as a provocation and would threaten already tense relations with Beijing. The source said it was of great concern to China that Hong Kong does not become a base of subversion against the communist regime. "His visit will not benefit Hong Kong. On the contrary, his relation to the territory will jeopardise Hong Kong's stability and prosperity," he said. "The purpose of (Wuer Kaixi's) visit is considered to be provocative in Chinese eyes," the source said. Wuer Kaixi, who is still on China's most-wanted list, has been living in exile in the U.S. since the 1989 crackdown. He was reported to have escaped from China and fled to the U.S. via Hong Kong and is now a student in San Francisco.
