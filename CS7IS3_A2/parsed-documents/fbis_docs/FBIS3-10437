[Cardoso] Prices will not be converted into URV. The reason is that if prices are converted into URV the initial advantage I am granting salary earners will disappear because prices will also be subject to a unit that may increase on a daily basis. It is worse because salaries are corrected on a monthly basis while prices vary on a daily basis. [Romero] If the businessmen choose to convert their prices into URV, will they be able to do so? [Cardoso] No. The prices can only be set in real cruzeiros. Of course, they can say how many URV's the product is worth, but then the URV has to be a fixed unit. An example: It is worth 10 URV's. They could say what 10 URV's are worth every day. The URV would have to be fixed but we are not encouraging the conversion of the URV into a real cruzeiro because that is going to happen later on when we implement the real. [Romero] The businessmens' price lists are dollarized. Suppose they decide to adopt the URV, will they able to do so freely or will they have to go to the Finance Ministry beforehand to negotiate the conversion value? [Cardoso] Nobody will have to go to the Finance Ministry. Because they will, among each other, among parties, adopt the dollar or whatever they want as they do now. What they cannot do is to exhibit the price only in URV's. [Romero] What about speculative increases? [Cardoso] Look here, speculative increases will make no sense from now on because speculating automatically causes salaries to increase. [Romero] Will there be any means to fight speculation? [Cardoso] There is no need due to the method we will use. We are fully protecting salaries. From now on there will be no more discussions. I see so many worried labor union leaders but from now on they will have to worry about something else because the argument, which has been valid up to now, about "the government having to adjust, about the peak, the average," will disappear with this. From now on salaries will adjust automatically. [Moreno] How is the government going to control price abuses? [Cardoso] You will see what mechanism we use when the problem surfaces but in a competitive market the market itself takes care of this problem. The problem is the public monopolies, the existing monopolies, the oligopolies, and for these we have adequate tools. [Romero] How was the minimum salary value established? It seems that during yesterday's meeting, the president himself requested an effort to improve the minimum salary value? [Cardoso] Nothing of the sort. There was no specific discussion on the subject. The minimum salary issue does not fall directly under the Finance Ministry, it concerns the Social Security Ministry. Brazilian laws tie one thing to another. Therefore, every time the minimum salary increases a bit it causes a serious problem for the Social Security Ministry. I believe we must struggle very hard now and during the constitutional revision to break these ties and give the pensioners another type of guarantee. [Romero] Will the minimum salary remain at $64 at the commercial exchange rate? [Cardoso] I do not know. I do not know what the exchange rate will be on the day they are fixed. We have not finished discussing this issue. I only want to point out that the Finance Ministry is not causing any difficulties. The difficulties stem from that real impasse. [Romero] What about the disagreements between the Labor and Finance Ministries? [Cardoso] There are no disagreements between these ministries. Yesterday the Labor Ministry experts produced a list but it was wrong. I will explain this once again because it is very simple. What we are telling the country -- and we are going to stress it tomorrow -- is: look, prices are increasing, therefore, we must protect salary earners. What is the best guarantee you can give salary earners? Transform their salaries into something that varies as the cost of living varies. That is the URV. From now on, once the URV has been approved, nobody needs to worry about the adjustment any more because it will be automatic. [Romero] Yesterday experts left the Finance Ministry commenting that February inflation would be absorbed? [Cardoso] Look, I do not know because I am not an expert on the subject. I do not know what that means. I think I can guarantee what will happen from 1 March on. What happened before then is something that must be discussed by the labor unions, businessmen, and the business chambers. The government is more than willing to solve the problem but it is not something that can be solved by law. We must say that, from now on, we have changed the rules. We have changed the rules to benefit the workers. People must understand this. There is no point in talking about the past to forecast the future, which is going to be different. [Romero] Will some job categories lose money? [Cardoso] If any category has a small loss, an adjustment can be made and this varies from one category to another. There can be losses in the first month, only in March, but there will be gains in the following months. But how can the adjustments be made? Through business organizations, labor courts. The government favors an adjustment if there are losses in some categories. Others will have gains. What will happen to those? [Romero] Will a bill be submitted to Congress to discuss how to replace the losses? [Cardoso] No. This is not a question of law. We are here from now on to make sure this kind of issue is over. I cannot be responsible for what happened in the past. I am responsible from now on. From now on, no worker's salary will ever be below the cost of living. [Romero] What about the public servants? [Cardoso] The situation of the public servants is the same. I know they have an advantage. The public servants law readjusts salaries in January with zero deficit, then it loses 10 percent and continues to lose. This is no longer the case. The public servants will have the same monthly adjustment as the private workers. [Romero] Members of the Armed Forces were demanding 50 percent in March and will end up gaining 25 percent. [Cardoso] That is not true. Take the following into account. In March, the readjustment for public servants will be 50 percent. If the March inflation rate is 50 percent, they will come out even. You can then imagine: if the inflation rate was 47 percent in March, the workers would gain 3 percent. If the inflation rate in April was zero, they would get 50 percent. [Romero] The big question is, what was left behind? [Cardoso] A portion of the inflation left by other salary laws resulting from free negotiations. Otherwise, we would fully adjust salaries from now on and I want to do away with that. From now on there will no longer be the difference between cost of living and salaries. Therefore, the portion left behind is very small and should be negotiated in the business organizations. The government agrees. [Romero] Will the losses be negotiated freely? [Cardoso] Yes, if there are any ... [Romero] What will the priorities be for converting the minimum salary: not bankrupt the social security or give purchasing power to the workers? [Cardoso] It will give purchasing power to the workers. Why? Because mainly the ones who earn the minimum salary are pensioners, 11,000 million pensioners earn the minimum salary. Minister Cutolo said they will get a real increase of 17 percent when the salaries are fixed in URV. Some of them will get 30 percent. [Romero] Even with the prices in dollars? [Cardoso] Yes. Therefore, it is a monetary illusion for an individual to think: "I will earn $80." That is not true. He will get it 30 days later and that money will be worth much less. Not now. Now, he will gain. Therefore, that is the difference. The country must understand that difference to be able to see that we are really doing something, a proposal. Moreover, I heard from Deputy Paim and other union leaders who, putting aside the February issue said: Look, that proposal is very good." [Romero] If the government does not transform its utility rates into URV and does not use it to correct taxes, how can you expect to give credibility to that index in the market? [Cardoso] No, the government will use the URV to correct taxes because the URV is produced by three indexes, and one of the indexes is the Ufir [reference fiscal unit]. [Romero] Will the UVR have parity with the Ufir? [Cardoso] It will. [Romero] From the beginning? [CArdoso] From the very beginning. [Romero] And utility rates? [Cardoso] If I fix them in URV, what will happen? They will increase every day. Then, in order to be on the side of consumers I will adjust utility rates in a normal way, that is, by the real average of the past four months. [Romero] Will there be rules for the conversion of rents, school tuitions, and health plans? [Cardoso] We think the idea of the URV is to give a certain time for the adjustment of contracts between the parties involved. If they can adjust their contracts in that period and make them in URV that contract will no longer change. It will no longer change if it is written in URV. If contracts are not adjusted for the established deadlines to implement the real, then we will issue regulations.
