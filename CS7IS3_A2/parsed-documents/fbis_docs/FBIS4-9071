"Prof. Berov is in a good state of health. His stomach complaint and the slight yellowing of his eyes have passed," says a communique issued today at noon by Dr. Todor Gerasimov, chief of the Lozenets Hospital. Berov's liver function is returning to normal, biochemical tests carried out in Bulgaria show. Blood serum has been sent to Germany to be tested for hepatitis type C but the results are not out yet. A month ago Berov had a quadruple bypass operation from which he recuperated enough to attend a government meeting. Early last week he was hospitalized again as he developed the symptoms of an acute liver condition. The diagnosis has not been specified yet. Medics assume that Berov either had a passing mechanical obstruction of the bile ducts or suffered from a light form of viral hepatitis type C.
