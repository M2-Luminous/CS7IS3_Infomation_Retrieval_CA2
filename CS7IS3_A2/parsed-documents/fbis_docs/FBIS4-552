When Rwandans learned about the sad death of President Habyarimana, professional killers started executing the plan that they had been drawing up for a long time, which was to assassinate all the politicians who fought for democracy and who were in favor of the implementation of the Arusha peace agreement. They killed Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, some members of her government, heads of opposition parties, nuns and priests, members of opposition political parties, and foreigners who are opposed to the acts of violence. The PDC emphatically denounces [words indistinct] set up on 8 April 1994 by claiming that it was made up of all the concerned parties in opposition with the former government which has been legalized by Article 8 of the Arusha peace agreement. It is also sad and shameful to see the president of the National Development Council, Mr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, calling himself the president of the Republic, basing this on Article 42 of the Constitution. He is among those who abrogated it by decree 18/94 of 3 August 1993, concerning the revision of the Constitution as mentioned in the Arusha agreement. [passage omitted] The PDC calls upon government troops, the RPF, all Rwandans and friends of Rwanda to join together to fight the clique which is devastating the country.
