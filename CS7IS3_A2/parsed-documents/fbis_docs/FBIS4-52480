Ministry officials said the ministry's on-site inspections have found no problems in U.S. quarantine procedures for fire blight, a common apple disease. Ministry sources said that as a result, a Japanese ban on imports of U.S.-grown apples will be lifted from late this year to early next year. Japan has resisted U.S. calls for ending its curbs on imports of American apples despite decades of U.S. lobbying, citing worms and diseases which could spread to contaminate Japanese crops.
