FR940328-0-00005 FR940328-0-00002 This rule also updates the list of military and police entities. This rule adds the company Denel (Pty) Ltd. and certain of its subsidiaries to the list of South African military and police entities, and removes Musgrave, a former subsidiary of Armscor, from the list. Denel was formed from several former Armscor subsidiaries, and produces a variety of products for the South African military as well as the civilian population. Finally, this rule removes remaining restrictions on exports to Walvis Bay. On February 28, 1994, South Africa returned Walvis Bay to Namibia. Rulemaking Requirements 1. This rule was not subject to review by Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. 2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0005, 0694&hyph;0007, and 0694&hyph;0010. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be prepared. 5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military and foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Hillary Hess, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
