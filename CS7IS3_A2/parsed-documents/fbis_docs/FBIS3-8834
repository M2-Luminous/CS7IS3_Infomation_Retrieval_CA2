His comments came as Washington and Paris accused the United Nations of lacking the will to use air strikes, after Serb attacks on French UN troops over the weekend. Cot, the outgoing commander of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia said he noted that authority to order "close air support" had passed from the Secretary General, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, to his special envoy in Zagreb Yasushi Akashi. "I am convinced it is necessary to go further, and in some clearly outlined, clearly defined cases authority should be given to the military, which is not irresponsible," the French general said at a press conference to introduce his successor General Bertrand de Lapresle. Cot has long demanded the right to order airstrikes and his insistence largely prompted his dismissal by Butrus-Ghali in mid-January. De Lapresle, using more guarded language, agreed that "there are cases which justify a very rapid response, not to make war but to guarantee our most important right, that of legitimate self-defence." [passage omitted] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe assailed the United Nations on Monday for its slow response, saying, "One must act faster and be more determined." French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who visited Bihac on Sunday, strongly criticized "the often overly long delays, (and) the too heavy administrative and political procedures" preventing immediate retaliation when blue helmets come under fire.
