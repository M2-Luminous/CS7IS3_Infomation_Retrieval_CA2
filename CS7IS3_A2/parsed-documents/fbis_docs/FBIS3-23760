An amendment to the presidential edict "A Statute on the System of Organs of State Authority in St. Petersburg" drafted by city hall in essence means that the future assembly intended to replace the former soviet will not greatly trouble the existence of the executive branch. Elected for a two-year term, it will be comprised of 50 deputies working on a part-time basis. The city parliament's functions will be limited to approving the budget and establishing legal standards. The mayor will be head of St. Petersburg's government and will be granted the right to independently appoint and fire the heads of the city's organs of state authority. The documents do not set forth any procedures for impeachment of the head of the city administration, yet they set forth in detail a statute on dissolution of the city assembly. Incidentally, the assembly may also dissolve itself -- and all that requires is a simple majority of deputies, whereas overturning a mayoral veto will require a vote of at least two-thirds of the full membership. A two-thirds majority will also be required to reject an amendment made by the mayor to any of the deputies' draft legislation -- otherwise the amendment automatically becomes part of the law. The assembly may hand down a decision of no confidence in a public official -- but only in cases of flagrant violation of the Russian Constitution or Russian law, or violation of government decrees and the city's own legal acts. As in all cases pertaining to city hall, decisions in such cases will require a two-thirds majority vote from the deputies. Even in better days the St. Petersburg City Soviet could barely bring together a quorum (50 percent of its full membership), so it seems quite improbable that the new city assembly will be able to convene the appropriate number of deputies every time. After curtailing the powers of the yet-to-be-established city parliament, the mayor then enacted a statute on elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly, which are slated for 20 March 1994. Assembly elections will take place in a single round of voting. There will be a five-year term limit on elected representatives, as well as a ban on participation in municipal elections by so-called "non-citizens" of the Russian Federation (of which there are officially approximately 1,000 in St. Petersburg). Particularly notable is a passage which states that all unspent money from campaign funds, associations and candidates will be turned over to the city budget after the election campaign is over. Therefore on the eve of the election one should expect massive attempts by candidates to spend their campaign money before it leaves their hands -- including the traditional idea of throwing a big party with the "leftovers."
