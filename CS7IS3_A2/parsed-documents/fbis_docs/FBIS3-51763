Asked how he would react to a No victory, the president said he would accept the people's will and added that he would also obey the Constitutionality Court's resolution if an action against the 30 January event is put forward. If, as a consequence of such an action however, there are public disorders prior to, during, or after the event, the president said he would take the necessary legal and constitutional actions to prevent the country from falling into the crisis promoted by certain groups. The president reported that he had ordered security organizations to increase measures to control terrorist actions such as the ones that occurred last week. "I am not willing to allow actions of terrorism and intimidation against the population, including media sources, to be repeated," he warned. He emphasized that he will adopt the necessary constitutional and legal dispositions which will not affect the referendum or its results. "I will act according to the powers the Constitution grants me to counter acts of terrorism, people who disrupt public order, and illegal demonstrations or actions," he concluded.
