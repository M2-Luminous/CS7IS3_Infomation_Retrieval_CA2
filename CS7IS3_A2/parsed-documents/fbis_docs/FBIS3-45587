The 118 migrants arrived in Xiamen by plane on Tuesday, after a flight from California, in one of the biggest recent repatriations of Chinese from the United States. The official, in a telephone interview, said the group comprised persons who genuinely wanted to emigrate, and organisers who were involved in smuggling them to the United States. "The organisers will be sent to jail, and the sentence will be life imprisonment if they have committed atrocities," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "In principle, people who are victims of people smugglers have to pay a fine" of 5,000 yuan, "but do not have to go into a re-education camp" he said. Reeducation camps are used for people who repeatedly try to emigrate without authorisation. In a similar case last year, 659 Chinese repatriated to Fujian from the United States were sent to a re-education camp, a punishment that can be applied without trial and for a term of up to three years. Chinese sometimes pay up to 60,000 dollars for the clandestine trip to the United States, although the journey often ends in tragedy. Last June, eight Chinese died when they leapt from a boat laden with 300 illegal migrants as it approached New York.
