Is this good news for Belgrade? [Jovanovic] Certainly. We want to see a complete cessation of hostilities without any conditions and have been arguing for this for several months already. [Van Velthem] From the start the Yugoslav Government has defended the European plan for the partition of Bosnia. Is it at the same time exerting pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to induce them to accept this peace process? [Jovanovic] I do not believe this is necessary. The Bosnian Serbs are resolutely constructive in this respect. They accepted the 49 percent allocation of territory several months ago now during negotiations on the British aircraft carrier "Invincible," and confirmed this accord in Brussels when the Twelve submitted their action plan. Today, without making any objection in principle, they are primarily seeking to improve not the quantity but the quality of the territories allocated to each side. Radovan Karadzic reminded Andrey Kozyrev of this when he met with him in Moscow earlier in the week. [Van Velthem] With respect to Russia, there is rather the impression of a coldness between Moscow and Belgrade since the angry outburst against the Bosnian Serbs by Mr. Churkin, Mr. Yeltsin's emissary. [Jovanovic] That is a false impression. What happened between Mr. Churkin and Mr. Karadzic is purely a matter for them, we were only indirectly involved. Our relations with Russia remain good, there is mutual trust, and there is no lack of communication. [Van Velthem] If political dialogue is renewed, are you going to demand guarantees on the lifting of sanctions against Belgrade? [Jovanovic] We have always been calling for this. It is inseparable from progress in any peace process, the one is not possible without the other. We also insist that the question of lifting the embargo should be laid down in the agreement itself. I am not saying that it must be lifted immediately and automatically at the moment of signing, but it must be treated as an unavoidable international obligation. The peace agreement and the lifting of sanctions must be treated as twins in a sense. [Van Velthem] What is today the economic situation of Yugoslavia under the embargo? [Jovanovic] There has been a clear, even spectacular, improvement since the stabilization plan launched by Mr. Avramovic, now the head of the National Bank. We are still a long way from the day-to-day circumstances we would like, but there has been a clear change in the past four or five months. Hyperinflation has been checked, the dinar exchange rate is holding up, and prices are stable. The energetic efforts by the government to maintain this level has met with a much greater serenity on the part of the population than previously. There is also renewed respect for law and order, despite sporadic incidents that are the direct result of the proximity of the war in Bosnia. In short, compared with the tensions we previously saw, there has been a general calming process at work, economic, social, and even political. Most of the parties are coming together in support of a core of national and state interests. That was far from the case before. [Van Velthem] In Bosnia itself, associations of Serb citizens are continuing to demand the preservation of the undivided, multiethnic state. Do you support such initiatives? [Jovanovic] It is not a movement, it simply serves the pretensions of the Muslim authorities to be representative of Bosnia's three communities. There are a small number of Serbs there who are either "little collaborators" or people who are unable to choose their position faced with the Muslim authorities. But it is a marginal phenomenon. In Sarajevo, in Zenica, or in Tuzla, the silent majority of Serbs still present is simply waiting for the first opportunity to leave their ghetto and join the territory of the Srpska republic. It is a sad reality, but it must be acknowledged, and not only on the Serbian side: Among the Croats and the Muslims too, there is growing migration to return to regions controlled by their nationals. These areas have seen a fratricidal war. [Van Velthem] Peace in Bosnia would not be enough to bring calm to the Balkans. Major questions remain open, Krajina or Kosovo in particular. [Jovanovic] The Krajina question is a part of the general Yugoslav crisis. A procedure in three stages, which we support, has already been launched between Knin and Zagreb. The cease-fire has been achieved, the normalization of economic relations will follow within the next few days, and the field will then be clear to attack the most sensitive and most complex objective, a permanent political solution. Kosovo on the other hand is a separate issue, distinct from the present Yugoslav crisis, internal to the Federal Republic grouping together Serbia and Montenegro. It is a problem of separatism that has existed for at least a decade. We have guaranteed wide-ranging cultural, territorial, and administrative autonomy to our two provinces, Voivodine and Kosovo. We have no problem in the north because the populations concerned exercise their prerogatives. In the south, on the other hand, the Albanians refuse all dialogue, reject democratic electoral procedures and boycott the institutions proposed to them. We have always said that national minorities have the right to develop their four principal identities, ethnic, religious, linguistic, and cultural, and these needs are assured by our new constitution. [Van Velthem] Would this go as far as reestablishing the internal autonomy previously granted by President Tito? [Jovanovic] Albanian leaders themselves admit that this is no longer possible. The models of the past have become inadequate for new circumstances. Yesterday's Yugoslavia no longer exists, and the international community that did all it could to achieve that should be the first to realize it.
