Let us assume he wins out over his Netherlands colleague Ruud Lubbers, who is too widely suspected of Atlanticism and bias toward the United States. Let us say that two weeks previously the Belgian coalition in power is rudely shaken by the results of the imminent European elections announced in our Friday editions by our exclusive "LA LIBRE BELGIQUE Marketing Unit" poll, showing the liberal union to be the leading force in the country, the PS [Walloon Socialist Party] to be in collapse, the CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party] not to have undergone the "Van Hecke" effect and now to be suffering a fresh identity crisis. Let us imagine Jean-Luc Dehaene resigning from his prime ministerial duties in early July with a view to taking up his European duties on 5 January 1995. However, he knows that before then he must use subtle mixtures and extensive international contacts to appoint his enlarged team of commissioners. For purely logical reasons, he is also aware that he will have to pass on the baton to his Belgian successor during the summer, when the 1995 budget will be drawn up, with all its political implications. Most Likely Successor The party chairmen hold a meeting. Their first decision is not to hold a general election -- otherwise scheduled for the end of December 1995 -- too early, and above all not to hold it at the same time as the local elections due in October: The stakes are too different... and Christian socialists and socialists risk losing too many municipal citadels if the two types of elections are mixed. Consequently, the resolution is adopted to continue with the same alliance for a limited period of time - say, spring 1995 - and on the basis of a well-defined and stabilizing program which must enable each individual to gain more weight. The most likely successor, the CVP's Herman Van Rompuy, declines the offer. It is too early, his party is way down deep in the doldrums, and he does not (yet) feel cut out for the job. So everyone turns to Melchior Wathelet [deputy prime minister] of the PSC [Christian Socialist Party], the unhappy and unlucky candidate back in the winter of 1991. No more "sand trap" full of treacherous little phrases, however: People turn to him as a symbol of "an alternative, of another way" and as a "great communicator." It is up to him to boost the prestige of the coalition. Melchior Wathelet accepts, but there is no question of him simply serving as a temporary solution: He demands a solid program from his partners. And a formal commitment. Even if he only takes up his post for less than one year, (let us say nine months, because his traumatized coalition partners cannot be asked to do the impossible), the new government will have to govern the country and avoid repeated internal crises. Political fiction? No. The scenario we have just painted is being considered within various party headquarters. And not only within the PSC.
