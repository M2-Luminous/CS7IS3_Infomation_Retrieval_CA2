Khasapopoulos] [Text] Foreign military attaches, mainly European and American, have lately been seen visiting the Defense Ministry as a delegation of higher-ranking officers of the National Defense General Staff [YEETHA] prepares to pay an official visit to Cyprus to cooperate with Cypriot National Guard officers to draw up a unified defense strategy. There has not been so much movement of foreign officials and diplomats at the Pentagon [Greek military headquarters] since March 1987, during the Greek-Turkish crisis over the search for oil by the "Piri Reis" [Turkish oil exploration ship] in the Aegean. Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's proclaimed new strategy of unified defense between Greece and Cyprus and Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis' meetings in Thessaloniki with Miltiadhis Evert, New Democracy and official opposition leader, and Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, during which the exclusive topic of discussion was the unified defense space between Greece and Cyprus, appear to have raised concern among NATO military attaches. The NATO military attaches in Athens immediately requested a meeting with the ministry's military leadership for further clarification. It is indicative that the military attaches of Germany, Britain, and the United States asked Arsenis if NATO knows about Greece's plans to expand its defense space. U.S. Ambassador Thomas Niles also asked Arsenis the same question. Arsenis' answer is that Greece, as a guarantor power in Cyprus, is obliged to look after its defense and he stated that in 1960, Greece did not inform NATO that it was sending the 900-member ELDIK [Greek Forces in Cyprus] to the island, as part of the Zurich Agreement. Turkey did the same with TURDIK [Turkish Forces in Cyprus]. Arsenis assured the foreign diplomats that the military plans being drawn up for Cyprus' defense are clearly defensive, not offensive. He also noted that Greece and Cyprus estimate that they face the same threat, which comes exclusively from Turkey, and must prepare a common defense. There has been no official Turkish response yet, despite Turkey's military delegation at NATO seeking in every way to learn Greece's plans. But there has been reaction by Britain. Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind expressed particular interest in the issue during a recent meeting with Defense Minister Arsenis in Brussels on the sidelines of the NATO summit. British Ambassador in Athens Anthony Miles has requested an official meeting with Arsenis and one of the issues that will be discussed is the defense of Cyprus, since Britain is also among Cyprus' guarantor powers. The first step toward common defense is Lieutenant General Nikolaos Vorvolakos' appointment as commander of the National Guard. Vorvolakos is being briefed at headquarters. The second and perhaps most important step will be the visit this week of a delegation of military officers to Nicosia to draw up the new defense plan to cover both countries. The third step will be National Defense Minister Arsenis' visit to Cyprus during the second half of February and the last will be the signing of an accord by Prime Minister Papandreou and Cypriot President Kliridhis, probably at the beginning of the summer.
