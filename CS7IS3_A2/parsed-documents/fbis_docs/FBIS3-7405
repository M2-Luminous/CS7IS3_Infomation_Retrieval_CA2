These two officials are also due to report to the king on the latest developments in the royal government's activities. The two officials are Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, and Sam Rangsi, minister of economy and finance. The prince deputy prime minister and the minister left Phnom Penh on 22 March. It is worth noting that the trip to Beijing by Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut and Sam Rangsi was made hot on the heels of the 22 March visit to the king by Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, and the return from Beijing of Samdech Chea Sim on 21 March. All these visits were not announced officially. It is not known what the issue is that the officials referred to as a "serious matter." However, analysts have focused on an important issue, namely the alliance between the two big parties, the Cambodian People's Party and FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]. There is happy news, that is, the king has been discharged from Beijing hospital. His spokesman told the REUTER Beijing correspondent that "the treatment was successful; the king can walk and do other things." Western diplomats in Beijing said that after his cancer treatment the king has lost his hair but put on weight. The king plans to travel to Pyongyang at the end of March and then to Cambodia on 8 April.
