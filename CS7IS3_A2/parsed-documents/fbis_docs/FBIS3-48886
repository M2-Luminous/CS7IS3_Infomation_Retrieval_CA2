During December, project teams began consultations on "Agriculture and Agricultural Community Projects" to discuss measures to be taken after the partial decontrol of rice markets, "Decentralization of Central Government Authority" and "Access to Information." Early next year, project teams will be initiated on a total of 13 projects, to include "Residential and Land Issues" and "Improvement of Bidding Procedures for Public Works Projects." However, even though each project team arrives at a conclusion, they often encounter a situation in which difficulties are faced in reaching interparty agreements or an agreement cannot be reached on how to proceed with the discussions. Project teams of the ruling coalition have been initiated and are managed with the motto that "zoku Diet members" will not be created. The reason for this approach is the strong criticism directed at the adhesion between so-called "zoku Diet members"--wielding a strong influence over policy decisions by the ruling party during the Liberal Democratic Party days--and specific elements of industry. Projects are initiated when an issue arises by summarizing the scope of the issue. In the past, project teams were established on topics such as "Cold-Weather Countermeasures" and "Relaxation of Crop Conversion Programs" to respond to poor rice harvests as well as "New Trunk Rail Lines" and "Annuities." Team positions are expressed in the form of "reports" which are submitted to the policy executive committees of supervising government agencies. However, because the team in charge of the New Rail Trunk Line issue specified the name of the new line proposed for construction, the respective coalition parties were critical, and the discussions were returned to their initial starting point. In the case of the team in charge of annuities, it was unable to engage in in-depth discussions because an interparty agreement could not be reached on how to conduct discussions on annuity reform, while treating central government treasury obligations and tax issues as separate issues. Mamoru Nakajima, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Policy executive and chairman of the policy executive committee responsible for coordinating efforts of the project teams has said, "Although we are speaking of project teams that were established under the concept of banishing zoku Diet members, failure to brake the current trend will only result in the establishment of an unlimited number of project teams. It would be more efficient if the project teams were established on the basis of broader topic areas." Already, the potential has arisen for a return to "LDP-style" project teams. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |List of Ruling Coalition Project Teams | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Team Title |Chairperson |Party | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cold-Weather Countermeas-|Takashi Tanimoto |Social Democratic Party | |ures Team | |of Japan [SDPJ] | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Relaxation of Crop Conve-|Kazuhiko Tsuji |SDPJ | |rsion Programs Team | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |New Trunk Rail Lines Team|Masao Sakon |SDPJ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Annuity Team |Nobumichi Tsukada |Democratic Socialist Par-| | | |ty | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agenda 21 Team |Tomiko Okazaki |SDPJ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Minamata Disease Team |Asahiko Mihara |Japan New Party, Sakigake| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Atomic Bomb Victims' Aid |Tadayoshi Morii |SDPJ | |Law Team | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Product Liability Law Te-|Eiki Kurata |Komeito | |am | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Access to Information La-|Jiro Kainuma |Komeito | |w Team | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Basic Law for Promoting |Tetsuo Yamaguchi |SDPJ | |the Decentralization of | | | |Central Government Autho-| | | |rity Team | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agriculture and Agricult-|Kazuhiko Tsuji |SDPJ | |ural Community Projects | | | |Team | | | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
