Police sources have identified them as Sonia Whitley-Anderson, 38, of Kendal, Hanover; Ovel Washington Porter, 28, a seaman of Flankers, St. James and an unidentified male higgler. Mrs. Whitley-Anderson died in Montego Bay on Thursday on arriving on the SAM flight from San Andres, Colombia; Mr. Porter died in Bermuda on Sunday and the unidentified higgler died Thursday morning while he was preparing to take the COPA flight back to Kingston from Panama City. According to Narcotics Police Division sources, Mrs. Whitley-Anderson went to San Andres off the Colombian coast on SAM flight 506 which left from Montego Bay on Sunday and returned on Thursday. She fell ill while the plane was returning to Montego Bay and when it landed at 3 p.m., a physician who was on board, pronounced her dead. Five small packets of cocaine were found in her brassiere and she is believed to have swallowed several more to smuggle them in. An autopsy is to be done on her body tomorrow. The unidentified male higgler was found dead in the Aruba hotel in Panama City on Thursday morning. Sources Sources say he was getting ready to leave for Kingston on the COPA flight yesterday when he died from an overdose of cocaine which he swallowed to smuggle here. Mr. Porter worked as a seaman aboard the cruise ship Song of America but lost his job recently. He left Jamaica on November 23 and after travelling to Miami, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia, arrived in Hamilton, the capital of Bermuda, on December 4.
