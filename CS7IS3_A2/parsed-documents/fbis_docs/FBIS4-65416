In the statement, Mentese explained that the terrorists suffered great losses and lost their logistics abilities as a result of the determined fight waged against the terrorist organization with the intensive support of the people and the democratic institutions. Indicating that the terrorists could not put up a fight against the fully-equipped, trained, and disciplined security forces, Mentese said that the struggle became increasingly successful when the logistics support of the organization was cut off following the cross-border operations into northern Iraq. Mentese stated that 500 terrorists -- 186 terrorists killed, four wounded -- were captured in operations conducted against the dissipating terrorist organization during 1-15 May. Mentese added that 197 long-barreled rifles, 37 revolvers, 386 bombs, and large quantities of ammunition were seized during these operations. Explaining that collective surrenders, including members in high-level positions, were taking place for the first time, Mentese stressed that during this period 48 terrorists -- 22 in Sirnak and 7 in Agri and Van [as heard] -- surrendered to the security forces, handing in their weapons. Mentese said that collective surrenders from the terrorist organization's militant cadres in the mountainous region are expected to increase. The statement further notes: Nowhere in the world did terrorism achieve its goal. The terrorists will not be able to reach their goal in our country also. Our state will fully control the terrorist organization and render it ineffective, thus eradicating it completely from the country's agenda. I am taking this opportunity to call on everybody who joined the PKK terrorist organization: Come, trust the state, and surrender yourself to its affectionate hands. Take advantage of the Law of Repentance and thus attain the right to live as one of the respected citizens of this country.
