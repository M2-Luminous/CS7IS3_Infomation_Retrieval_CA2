Ustinov, candidate of technical sciences, and A.A. Starkov, All-Russian Science Center ``State Institute of Optics imeni S.I. Vavilov''; UDC 535.317.6] [Abstract] Retouch of surfaces for compensation of aberrations in real optical systems producing a diffractional image is considered, the r.m.s. error of residual wavefront aberrations at some point of the field being serving as the criterion of compensation quality at that point. The problem is to minimize the functional &PSgr;= (1/m)_s_[RMS](i)[.sup]2[/] (i= 1,...,m) representing the integral compensation quality criterion. The problem is solved for an objective with wave aberrations W[.sub]i[/](x,y) at points i= 1,...,m and their decrement _D_W[.sub]i[/](x,y) as a result of retouch at these points in the (x,y) plane. For simplicity but without loss of generality, all mean aberrations and their mean decrements are assumed to be zero in the pupil. The retouch profile is represented by a set of analytical functions, preferably polynomial power functions with coefficients _a_[.sub]1,...,n[/]. An exact numerical solution is very laborious, especially so because the light rays must be tracked through a system with nonaxisymmetric errors of surface treatment. Applying the theory of small perturbations is shown to simplify the problem and an ``approximate optimization'' in accordance with that theory is proposed, the necessary condition for functional &PSgr; to be zero being that its all its partial derivatives with respect to coefficients _a_[.sub]j[/] (j= 1,...,n) be zero. This condition �&PSgr;/�_a_[.sub]j[/] (j= 1,...,n) yields a system of m integrodifferential equations, a zero sum of m surface integrals, which is solved by seeking _D_W[.sub]0[/] as a series in linearly-independent function _ps_[.sub]k[/] (k= 1,...n. The algorithms of compensation by retouch calculations according to this method have been programmed for an IBM -PC/AT computer, the RETOUCH program consisting of five steps: 1) calculating the profile of axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric retouch, 2) representing the results in the form of tables and on graphs, 3) evaluating and analyzing the residual aberrations, 4) prediction of the contrast at all points where interferograms have been processed and estimating the effectiveness of retouch, 5) filing the retouch profile in the form of a two-dimensional power polynomial in the INTERF program format. The procedure is demonstrated on a high-resolution objective. Figures 1; tables 1; references 3.
