Foreign Minister Mate Granic, President Zubak [of the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna], and Minister Akmadzic talked to Clinton's special envoy Redman, Warren Christopher's assistant Oxman, and Ambassadors Galbraith and Jakovich. Then the Bosnian side met the Americans. They talked about the models of organizing a new Bosnia-Herzegovina in future confederal links between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following consultations with President Tudjman, the Croatian side presented its hosts with new proposals. As we have learned from sources close to the State Department, at the meeting the Croatian representatives insisted on full protection for the rights of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This, the Croatians believe, is the most essential element of the agreement. Two models are being studied behind closed doors in the State Department. According to one, the two republics would be linked up in a federal state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the other envisages the creation of cantons some of which would be predominantly Croat while the others would be predominantly Bosnian. Every canton would have its inherent [izvorni] sovereignty and authority. This authority would then be vested in the federal state of Bosnia- Herzegovina. Observers stress that these cantons would be organized in two unions, a union of Croat cantons and a union of Bosnian cantons. There are reports that Croat cantons might include municipalities with a majority Muslim population while Muslim cantons might include municipalities with a majority Croat population. Mechanisms of mutual protection for members of the Croat and the Muslim people in these municipalities, each of which would be linked to its own union of cantons, were also discussed. According to some reports, there is a possibility of dividing powers between federal bodies -- that is, president, bicameral parliament, government, and constitutional court -- and intercantonal bodies. Minister Granic told reporters outside the State Department that the talks will continue and that further details will be known late this evening, Central European time, or even later. The two delegations and their hosts agreed that no details about the talks should be disclosed. Asked about the atmosphere at the meeting and whether any side had ruled out the possibility of reaching agreement, Granic told Croatian television: There is a working atmosphere at the meeting. No one has ruled out agreement although there still remain open issues. Observers in Washington have learned that the confederal model between Croatia and a new Bosnia-Herzegovina was discussed for the first time today. For the time being any details are regarded as secret. The United States intends to draw up its own text on the basis of the Croatian and Muslim proposal. Also mentioned were a monetary and customs union and an economic and defense agreement between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Central Bosnia was also discussed as well as protective mechanisms for the Croats there. There are also a number of options and models of involving the Serbs. As we file this report intensive consultations are still in progress. The hosts are sticking to the principle of talking separately to the Croatian and Bosnian representatives.
