FBIS4-37513 "drnes120_q_94003" FBIS-NES-94-120 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 SOUTH ASIA Bangladesh Attack on Editor Linked to Fundamentalists Attack on Editor Linked to Fundamentalists BK2106121194 Hong Kong AFP in English 1138 GMT 21 Jun 94 BK2106121194 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Dhaka, June 21 (AFP) -- A bomb attack early Tuesday [21 June] at the home of a Bangladeshi magazine editor was the latest strike in a campaign by Muslim fundamentalists, media sources said. Three powerful homemade bombs exploded at the gate of the Dhaka home of Shafik Rehman, editor of the popular Bengali language weekly JAI JAI DIN, or PASSING DAYS. No one was hurt in the blast. Rehman faces a blasphemy charge for publishing a column by fugitive feminist doctor-turned-writer Taslima Nasreen, in hiding since religious charges were laid against her, and death threats made, for criticisms of the Koran. Rehman told AFP in a telephone interview Tuesday that he felt insecure and held the fundamentalist Jagrata Towhidi Janata, or Rising Faithfuls, responsible because the group had threatened in a letter to take "appropriate steps" unless his magazine stopped publishing Nasreen's column. "These groups are making non-issues an issue because our writings are hurting their bread and butter," he said. Nasreen's regular column stopped appearing soon after she went into hiding early this month, and Rehman said he would not publish them if the opportunity arose because it would be "illegal now." Police are still searching for Nasreen, 32, who faces charges of offending Muslim religious sentiment in an interview with an Indian newspaper. Nasreen denies suggesting rewriting the Koran, the holy book of Islam. Rehman said the attack was triggered by a report in the pro-Islamic Daily INQILAB newspaper that a warrant for his arrest for blasphemy was issued Sunday was the reason for the attack. The court ordered his arrest after he failed to answer several summons and set a hearing for July 17, the Inqilab said. Government officials were not available for comment because of a national holiday. Local resident Hafiz Abdul Alim charged that Rehman insulted religious feeling by comparing two Arabic letters to human genitals in his column Day after Day in November 1993. Rehman refuted the allegation, saying that the two letters were not only used in Urdu and Persian languages, but he used them in a joke about international politics without refering to Islam, religion or the Koran. JAI JAI DIN was banned by former president Hussain Muhammad Ershad's government and Rehman returned from self-exile in London after the dictatorial regime's fall in December, 1990. In recent weeks, fundamentalists have attacked other newspapers critical of them. Editors have warned Prime Minister Khaleda Zia about rising fundamentalism in the predominantly Moslem country. Three editors of the mass circulation Bengali daily JANAKANTHA newspaper were arrested recently for alleged blasphemy. Two were released on bail. Journalist union officials said 24 newspapers have been attacked in the past three years. Rehman said he held a "a section of the government" responsible for the rise in fundamentalism because it had not taken any action against the issuers of the death threats on Nasreen.
