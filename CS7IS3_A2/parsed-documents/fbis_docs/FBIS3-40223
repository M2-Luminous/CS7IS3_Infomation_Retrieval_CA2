These robots--used for arc welding, spot welding, spray painting, assembly, transport, teaching, research, and handling of toxic substances and explosives--meet advanced international standards for variety, performance, quality, and reliability. The arc-welding and spot-welding robots, developed by the China Aerospace Corporation's (CASC) Institute 17 along with other units, have ``teaching and playback'' intelligent functions. The spray-painting robot, developed by CASC's Institute 706 along with other units, can grasp 10-kg objects and has a repeat positioning accuracy of 2mm. An electronic-component mounting robot with visual recognition functions has a repeat positioning accuracy of 0.03mm. These robots are now in batch production, and have found applications in the arc-welding and spray-painting assembly lines for the ``Audi'' bus, made at the No. 1 Automotive Works, and the ``Dongfeng'' [East Wind] truck, made at the No. 2 Automotive Works. The nation's first 7-degrees-of-freedom robot...
