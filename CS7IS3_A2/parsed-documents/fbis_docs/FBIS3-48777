Starting from April 1, the range of stores allowed to be members of such payment plans will be expanded gradually for credit cards issued by distributors and manufacturers, MITI officials said. At present, agents that can handle installment plans for card issuers in the two sectors are limited to stores in which the issuer has a 20 percent stake or more. Under the new step, the scope will be expanded to include stores having any ratio of capital relations with an issuer, those with a franchising contract with an issuer and those agreeing to use a shop name designated by an issuer and agreeing to sell goods produced by the issuer, the officials said. Convenience stores affiliated with supermarket chains and sales outlets of electrical appliance makers will be allowed to engage in installment plans under the new rule, they said. The measure is one of 94 deregulation items envisaged in the government's pump-priming package released in September last year. The rule restricting installment plans will be completely abolished in April 1995, they added.
