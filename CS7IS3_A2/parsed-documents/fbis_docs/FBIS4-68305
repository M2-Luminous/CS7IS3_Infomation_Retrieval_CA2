As for military aviation--the MiG-29, Su-27 and Su-30MK fighter aircraft--there simply weren't any competitors for them there. Everyone recognized that. But today, a month after the conclusion of FIDAE-94, we would like to talk a bit not so much about the triumph of Russian aviation as much as about the results and the lessons of the airshows. Russia had never previously participated in airshows in Latin America. And although they say that you can't expect perfection on the first try, that folk wisdom was not confirmed in this case. If you assess the results of our participation in FIDAE-94 on the whole then, as Russian Official Delegation Head Air Force Commander-in-Chief Colonel-General of Aviation Petr Deynekin noted, this was a real breakthrough in the skies of Latin America which must provide an impetus to the broad development of military-technical cooperation not only with Chile but also with other countries of this region. Previously, as is well known, we maintained contacts on the military line here only with Peru, Nicaragua and Cuba. The majority of FIDAE-94's Russian participants acted under the aegis of the recently formed "Rosvooruzheniye" [Russian Arms] State Company. But there were also those firms that independently displayed their products and latest technologies. Among them was Moscow Aviation Production Association (MAPO). Two years ago, this association obtained the right to independently, naturally under state monitoring, conduct negotiations and sign contracts on the subject of deliveries on the world market of one of the world's best light frontal aviation fighter aircraft--the MiG-29. As at previous airshows, the MAPO delegation consisted of not only association specialists but also representatives of MiG ANPK [Aircraft Scientific Production Combine] imeni A.I. Mikoyan, and also of the primary enterprises-subcontractors, suppliers of radar gunsights, avionics, onboard weapons, and other systems. According to "Vympel" GosMKB [State Machinebuilding Design Bureau] Chief Designer Gennadiy Sokolovskiy, Ryazan Instrument Plant Head Designer Yuriy Zelenyuk, the heads of other firms, and MAPO partners, this is a very proper approach. When there are developers, manufacturers and component suppliers on one team, then you can conduct substantive negotiations not only on the delivery of the fighter aircraft themselves but also on their possible modernization, providing maintenance, supplying spare parts, and other issues already during the course of the airshow. The Chilean airshow, although the largest in Latin America, still is regional in nature in contrast to Le Bourget or Farnborough. The displays consist of, first and foremost, what can actually be sold in the countries of this region. It's possible that some people will not agree with me, but we also underestimated this factor. For example, many experts think that the simultaneous participation of the MiG-29, Su-27 and Su-30MK in this airshow was hardly advisable. Yes, our fighter aircraft were a sensation in the Chilean skies. Yes, their journalists christened FIDAE-94 a "show of stars". But we did not fly 17,000 kilometers to conduct aerial performances, but to offer our combat aircraft for sale. For those people who know very well the aircraft market situation, the financial capabilities of the Latin American countries, and the specific features of their military doctrine, it was already clear in Moscow that it is practically impossible to sell MiG's or Su's here. Therefore, we needed to determine which of the aircraft had a greater chance to penetrate the Latin American market and to assign a priority to it. First of all, this would substantially reduce our expenditures for participation at the exhibition and, second, it would permit us to concentrate the attention of potential buyers on one object of sale. For many foreign experts, the models of weapons and technologies displayed by Russia at FIDAE-94 became a real revelation. They did not find out about them from the advertising brochures or catalogs that were disseminated on the eve of the exhibition, but at the airshow. Advertising costs money. And quite a bit of money. But we need to resort to these expenditures if we seriously intend to present ourselves on the international market. Moscow Aviation Production Association has learned this truth well. A small MAPO delegation, which settled all of the organizational issues, visited Chile several months prior to the airshow and met with the leadership of the ministry of defense, the Chilean Air Force, FIDAE, and conducted a series of press conferences. As a result, more than a dozen articles, which discussed the enterprise and MiG-29 fighter aircraft, were published in the local press already prior to the airshow's opening. It would be unjust to not say kind words here directed at "Menkh" Publishing Group and specifically its Moscow Bureau, which assumed responsibility for the information support mission for the airshow's Russian participants. We received xerox copies of the most interesting articles from the central and Moscow newspapers on a daily basis. A series of articles on our weapons that were displayed at this exhibition were published on the pages of the magazines published by "Menkh". Arms sales are a delicate matter with a mass of nuances, including in a political context. Even if there is a marvelous aircraft or helicopter, that still does not mean that they will mandatorily manage to sell it. Although the arms business is considered to be one of the most ancient businesses, we still have not properly mastered it. And yet, do we have a chance to conquer the Latin American aircraft markets? Or were the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent by Russia for participation in FIDAE-94 cast to the wind? At the present time, there are 123 combat aircraft in the Chilean Air Force inventory. These are primarily F-5, A-36, A-37, FGA-71 Hunter, and Mirage-50 fighter and fighter-bomber aircraft. Approximately half of them were accepted into the inventory in 1967 and 1975-76 and the remainder in 1982. Today, the question is being urgently raised on the replacement of obsolete aircraft with more modern aircraft. A special program has been developed on this score. The Chilean Government intends to purchase approximately 18-20 "second hand" aircraft to replace the old Hunter fighter aircraft. The Republic of South Africa, Israel, England, France and Belgium are competing for this contract. Unfortunately, Russia is not on this list. However, a majority of experts admit that our fighter aircraft made a very favorable impression on the Latin Americans. According to the statement of FIDAE President General Estey, who completed a more than one hour flight in a MiG-29 with Mikoyan Chief Pilot Roman Taskayev, this "aircraft permitted him to do things which he had never previously experienced". Chilean Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Vega, who flew with Sukhoy Test Pilot Igor Votintsev in a Su-30MK fighter-interceptor, also provided a flattering assessment. But, despite such favorable comments, our chances to win the already existing order are not great. At the same time, we should not forget that in the future the Chileans plan to replace a second squadron of Pantera (former Mirage) combat aircraft. And here Russian fighter aircraft can already pose serious competition to the Swedish Gripen aircraft that are competing for that order. "If preference is given to our fighter, we are prepared to equip the MiG-29's accepted into the West with navigation equipment so that expenditures for the replacement of the ground system are minimal, and to ensure in the entire range of aircraft operation guaranteed maintenance, at the level of world standards, and the supply of spare parts," said MAPO General Director Vladimir Kuzmin. During the course of the airshow, the Moscow Aviation Production Association delegation visited ENAER national aviation enterprise that is the foundation of Chile's aviation industry. This enterprise specializes in the production of the Chilean Air Force fleet and, in the event of the purchase of Russian fighter aircraft, we could develop a technical center based upon it for the maintenance of our aircraft which would be supplied not only to Chile but also to other Latin American countries. According to the assessment of MAPO Head Engineer Viktor Puzanov, there are all of the conditions for that here. As for Western countries' combat aircraft, the reports from the airshow have already noted that it was very, very modestly displayed at FIDAE-94, primarily obsolete models of aircraft that are in the inventories of the Chilean and Peruvian air forces. For example, the United States in general decided not to demonstrate its combat aircraft here. Why? There are the most varied opinions on this score. Some assert that there simply isn't a need to do that because they already know American aircraft well here. According to others, this is linked with the strict position of the U.S. Congress that still maintains Chile on a "black list" of states to which the export of American military equipment is prohibited. We also had the opportunity to hear this version: The absence of American aircraft--this is a punishment for the Chileans for the invitation of Russian aircraft to FIDAE-94. But, be that as it may, one thing is certain: The United States has had an impact on the world combat aircraft market and will have a very large impact in the foreseeable future. But then again, there are no grounds to disparage our possibilities to conquer aircraft markets. Many experts think that the Latin American countries would like to do business with us and not with the Americans. The FIDAE-94 Airshow convincingly confirmed that. I had an opportunity to see the sparkle in the eyes of the generals of the air forces of Chile, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Peru when they shared their impressions from the flights being conducted by our fighter aircraft. Without words, it was clear that they liked our aircraft. Negotiations were being conducted from morning to night in the chalet of "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, MAPO, and "Aviaeksport" V/O [Foreign Trade Association]. And although no serious contracts whatsoever were concluded directly at the exhibition, it is of course early to make hasty conclusions with regard to its commercial results. We sowed the seeds which must mandatorily produce sprouts. And we need to considerately tend it in order for a harvest to appear. It's possible that this will take years. In short, with the conclusion of the exhibition, work on the promotion of our aircraft in the Latin American market has not been completed but has just begun. FIDAE-94 provided Russian aircraft builders a chance and it would be a sin not to take advantage of it.
