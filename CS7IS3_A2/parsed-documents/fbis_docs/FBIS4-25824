They represented another important set of measures taken by China after the promulgation of the "Interim Regulations on State Functionaries" to establish and implement a public service system. A person in charge of the Ministry of Personnel said: While carrying forward the fine tradition of China's system for the selection and employment of cadres, and while drawing on the useful experience of foreign countries in personnel appraisal, the "Provisions" conscientiously summed up the practice of employment through examination in the past six years or so and provided specific stipulations on every link for the employment of state functionaries. As such, they will play an active role in guarding the "entrance" to state administrative organs, in guaranteeing the basic quality of newly employed state functionaries, and in promoting honesty and industriousness of government organs in the performance of official duties. The "Provisions" pointed out: The employment of state functionaries refers to the selection of state functionaries for nonleadership positions at and below the level of chief section member. As regards state functionaries selected from organs other than administrative organs to assume leadership positions and nonleadership positions at and above the deputy section level, they shall be transferred and do not fall under the category of employment. The criterion of hiring people with both political integrity and ability as well as the principle of openness, equality, competition, and selecting the best shall be upheld in the employment of state functionaries. Meanwhile, preferential treatment shall be given to applicants who are either of minority nationalities or ex-servicemen. The Ministry of Personnel required that all units, whether they are carrying out organizational reform or not, must gradually establish a personnel mechanism that encourages openness, equality, and competition, beginning this year. Starting from the date the "Provisions" were promulgated, all areas and departments must handle jobs in strict accordance with the "Provisions." Whenever they employ personnel for leadership [as printed] positions at and below the level of chief section member, they must hold public examinations and select the best from among applicants. Beginning from the second half of this year, the Examinations and Employment Department of the Ministry of Personnel will formulate a series of detailed rules and regulations for implementation on the basis of the "Provisions," and will organize unified examinations for the employment of functionaries for the State Council's ministries, commissions, and organs. According to his briefing, 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country and 63 departments of the State Council have adopted the method of holding examinations, to various extents, to employ over 71,000 people by selecting the excellent ones from among over 470,000 applicants for the supplement of their personnel since 1989. The practice of these examinations not only lays a foundation for the promulgation of laws and regulations on employment, but accumulates experience for the implementation of a public service system in an all-round way.
