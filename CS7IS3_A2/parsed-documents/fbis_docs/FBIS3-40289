[Papathemelis] Greece's relations with Albania certainly should develop in the framework of good-neighborliness, especially after the decision of the former PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government to remove the state of war. Good-neighborliness means, first of all, good faith, mutual confidence, and friendly cooperation. Also it means the recognition of the rights of existing minorities, which are a result of international conventions. The new Greek Government is fully predisposed to develop relations with Albania, on the foundation of good-neighborliness. However, it considers the following as basic conditions: not only the legal and formal recognition of the rights of the Greek minority in Albania but, first of all, their actual implementation in all spheres of life: religion, language, education, local government, and so forth. It is also important to avoid actions and statements that might have negative effects on and consequences for relations among states. Greece steadfastly desires normal relations with Albania but, at the same time, it will determinedly and unrelentingly defend the rights of the Greek minority in Albania. [Cakuli] You recently visited Albania with a group of deputies from the Greek parliament. What are your impressions from this visit? [Papathemelis] My impressions of Albania are of a country which is trying, with great difficulties, to rise above some very great economic and social problems inherited from the past. I am hoping for the victory of those political and social forces which are seeking a peaceful and democratic future for Albania, those forces which are predisposed to respect the political and personal rights of all the residents of Albania, regardless of their origin, Albanians, Greeks, or people of any other origin. Of course, I am disturbed when I see some forces which are trying to penetrate even into the official political opinion of a friendly country, seeking to cultivate disagreements with one of the countries with which Albania has a border -- Greece. [Cakuli] One of the greatest concerns for our two countries is the problem of the Albanian refugees in Greece. As a result of a deterioration in relations between the two countries, there was a massive return of Albanian refugees by your side. The support and employment of these refugees, who were forced to emigrate because of difficulties, constitute valuable assistance which Greece and its people gave and are giving to Albania. Our high officials, especially the president of the Republic, have expressed gratitude for this publicly, both inside and outside the country. The previous government talked about legalizing their status and the two sides have talked but the issue has not yet been resolved. What do you think about this matter and what do you think could be done to resolve it? [Papathemelis] I would say that it is not quite like that and perhaps it is just the opposite. Thus, it is not a matter of a mass return of illegal refugees as a result of tension in relations between the two sides but just the opposite: Every time that Greece is forced to send back to Albanian territory those criminal elements which penetrate into the ranks of illegal refugees, Albania causes tension in bilateral relations, with accusations and threats which, fortunately, Greece does not regard seriously. Instead of accepting the emigration to Greece of thousands of its desperate residents, Albania would be better off to cooperate with the Greek Government, which is ready to grant economic and technical assistance to Albania, assistance that would contribute to the resolution of the social problem in your country. The gratitude of the Albanian side, which you mentioned, for the real reception which Greece has given to all, should not be accompanied by measures, for example in education, in regard to the church, and so forth, which do not show the respect required by international norms of law. Nevertheless, the Greek Government is ready to resolve this issue in the best way possible, in accordance with democratic views on human rights and (it goes without saying) the protection of the mutual interests of the two countries. Note: The editorial board of RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE has its objections to this interview. It expresses its thanks to Mr. Stelio Papathemelis for his readiness and it is open to the expression of opinions regarding this interview, while wishing for the constructive development of Albanian-Greek relations.
