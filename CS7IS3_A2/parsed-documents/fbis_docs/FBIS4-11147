The minister explained that the overall perception of the Cuban community abroad has changed. He stressed that current migration laws respond to the need to protect Cuba, thus the political rights of Cubans living in Cuba cannot be the same as those who live abroad. Conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso told the press that talks between the official Cuban representatives and the 215 guests are proceeding in an atmosphere of respect and are characterized by an absence of confrontation. Cuban visitors, most of whom are U.S. residents, requested certain changes to the visa system, the creation of an official organization to handle their affairs, and the opening of several consulates in the United States. They also asked that their children be allowed to study in Cuba. The Nation and the Emigrants Conference was convened by the Cuban Government and is being held at the Havana Convention Center with the participation of Cubans who reside in 27 different countries.
