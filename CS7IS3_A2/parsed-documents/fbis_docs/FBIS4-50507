A spokesman for the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee recently spoke to a XINHUA reporter on development and construction in the Tibet Autonomous Region and the central government's policy on the Dalai Lama. Question [Q]: What major changes have taken place in Tibet over the past 43 years? Answer [A]: On May 23, 1951, the central government and local Tibetan government signed a 17-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet that effectively made it a reality. The peaceful liberation of Tibet was a major component of the emancipation cause of the Chinese people. Since then, Tibetans, like members of other nationalities in China, have fully enjoyed equal rights and embarked on the road to freedom and happiness. Over the past 43 years, Tibet has undergone tremendous changes, from backward serfdom to modernization. The 1 million serfs have become masters of their own destiny, while large numbers of Tibetan workers, intellectuals and cadres have become mature and taken up the task of building and managing Tibet. With the support of the central government and the assistance of other provinces and cities, as well as through the efforts of Tibetan people, Tibet has scored great achievements in various fields. Last year, Tibet hit an all-time high in its grain production by harvesting a yield of 620,000 tons, and the number of large domestic livestock rose to 23.2 million. Its modern industry, which started from scratch, registered a total output value of 470 million yuan, (US$54 million), and its energy, transport and telecommunications facilities improved markedly. In the meantime, traditional Tibetan culture has been promoted, and gigantic progress has been made in the fields of education, science, culture and public health. Living standards for Tibetans have risen substantially, and the Tibetan population has soared to 2 million, double the 1950 figure. Policies of the Party and the government on nationalities and religion enjoy wholehearted support from Tibetans and patriotic personages from all walks of life in the region. To date, Tibet is presenting a picture of vitality and prosperity. Tibetans have made great contributions to maintaining the unity of the motherland and among all nationalities and to the country's modernization drive. In the future efforts of reform, opening up and establishment of a socialist market economy, the central government will continue to pursue policies conducive to Tibet's economic growth and improvement of the living standards for Tibetans. It will continue to mobilize people of all nationalities in China to assist Tibet in speeding up its development. It will combine its policy to assist Tibet with the region's self-development efforts and gear its economic assistance to the overall situation of reform so as to enhance the strength, vitality and sustained power of Tibet for development, thus achieving common prosperity. Q: It is a historical fact that Tibet is an inseparable part of China. However, the Dalai Lama remains in exile and engages in activities which aim to split the country. What are the policies of the central government toward the Dalai Lama? Have there been any changes in them? A: The basic position and attitude of the central government toward the Dalai Lama and his followers have been clear and consistent, and they remain unchanged. As long as the Dalai Lama recognizes that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, completely abandons his idea of independence of Tibet and stops engaging in activities to split the motherland, the central government will welcome an earlier end to his life in exile and greet his return to China to contribute to the unification of the motherland, national unity and Tibetan economic development and perform something good for the prosperity and happiness of the Tibetan people. In 1979, Deng Xiaoping made it clear to a private representative of the Dalai Lama that "the issue of fundamental importance is that Tibet is a part of China. That is the criterion with which to judge what is right and what is wrong". When answering questions from a reporter of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY on May 19, 1991, Premier Li Peng reiterated the central government's policy, "there is only one fundamental principle, that is, Tibet is an inseparable part of China. There is no room for bargaining on that point. The central government has always been ready to hold talks with the Dalai Lama, but he must stop engaging in activities to split the motherland and change his position on so-called independence of Tibet. Negotiations can be held on any questions, but not on the independence of Tibet." These policies of the central government remain unchanged. The issue of Tibet is China's internal affair. Any attempt to internationalize the issue of Tibet will not succeed and will be firmly opposed by the Chinese people. Q: According to foreign news media, the Dalai Lama recently claimed on separate occasions that he has made maximum concessions in a series of initiatives and proposals in line with the framework for negotiations which defines that all questions except the independence of Tibet can be negotiated. Is that true? A: It would be a great advance if the Dalai Lama had genuinely abandoned his stand for the independence of Tibet. But it is regrettable that we have seen no signs of such progress so far. The Dalai Lama has never recognized that Tibet is an inseparable part of China since he went into exile, neither has he stopped his activities to split the motherland. His claims and proposals have continually centered on his stand for the independence of Tibet. Even recently, he still referred to Tibet as a captive nation, saying "I firmly believe... we will eventually lead our captive nation to freedom and peace in dignity". His so-called concessions are nothing but an adjustment in his tactics. In essence, he still sticks to his stand for the independence of Tibet. Q: It is said that the central government has made painstaking efforts to negotiate with the Dalai Lama. But the Dalai Lama has alleged on many occasions that the central government is unwilling to talk with him. What are the real facts? A: Up to now, the Dalai Lama has not abandoned his stand for the independence of Tibet. This is the largest obstacle to negotiations. The central government has made genuine efforts to help bring about negotiation and urge the Dalai Lama and his followers to abandon their position for the independence of Tibet and return to China. All these endeavors have fully demonstrated the sincerity and patience of the central government. Since 1979, related departments of the central government have on many occasions received the Dalai Lama's private representatives and listened attentively to their reports of the Dalai Lama's intentions. Some of them were met by leading members of the central government. When the Bainqen Lama died in early 1989, Zhao Puchu, president of the China Buddhist Association, personally handed a letter to the private representative of the Dalai Lama, inviting him home to attend the mourning activities. Such an invitation, coming out of pure religious motives, could have been an excellent opportunity for the Dalai Lama to meet with members of domestic Buddhist circles after spending over 30 years in exile. However, the Dalai Lama turned it down. In the latter half of 1989, in the wake of the changes in global situation, the Dalai Lama suspended contacts with the central government. In the same year, he brazenly divided China into several parts, such as Tibet, Xinjiang, Mongolia and Manchuria, in a map used in his book Freedom in Exile. Since China's domestic situation had not turned in the direction the Dalai Lama had anticipated, in 1992, he asked to resume contacts with the central government. Relevant central government departments received his private representatives on two occasions in 1992 and 1993. The reason the central government has not publicized its contacts and talks over the past 10-odd years with the private representatives of the Dalai Lama is that departments involved have made it clear to the Dalai Lama's private representatives at each of their meetings that the present contacts between the two sides are still secret associations which should not be made public. The Dalai Lama's private representatives also have agreed not to release details of the talks. But it is regrettable that the Dalai Lama's side has broken its promises time and again. It not only publicized these contacts, but also distorted what had been said at the talks, in an attempt to mislead the public. Q: Why have the bilateral contacts not produced any results? A: The reason that past contacts did not yield fruit and negotiations cannot commence lies in the fact that the Dalai Lama's side has not yet reached a common understanding with us on the fundamental issue that Tibet is an inseparable part of China. They have even referred to this cardinal principle adhered to by the central government as a precondition and obstacle to negotiations. We never think this is the case but see it as the basis and guarantee for the success of negotiations. Q: It Is evident that the responsibility for inability to hold negotiations lies with the side of the Dalai Lama. Is there any possibility for progress of the Dalai Lama's side continues to refuse to budge from its original position? A: In China, there is a saying which goes: "When the melon is ripe it falls off its stem; where water flows, a channel is formed." This means that when conditions are ripe, success will naturally follow. Everything has its own law of development, and some matters will not become obvious nor be widely perceived if they have not reached a certain stage. The central government will continue its efforts with full sincerity and patience. After all, the Dalai Lama is a Chinese citizen. We hope that in his remaining years, the Dalai Lama will abandon his stand for the independence of Tibet, end his life in exile and return to the motherland. Negotiation is the only appropriate way to resolve this problem. We hope that the Dalai Lama will size up the situation, go with the tide of historical development and make the right choice.
