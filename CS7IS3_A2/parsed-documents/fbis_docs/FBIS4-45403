The 29-year-old teacher said Robert Lock, 28, a fellow Briton, brought the drugs to her guest house on the day of the flight. "He told me it was heroin and he told me to conceal it inside myself," she said. Gregory, who told the judge she had dengue fever, admits possessing 87g of heroin at Bangkok's Don Muang international airport on Feb 5, 1993. Lock, from Cambridge, had paid her £1,000 to take the drugs to Japan for him, said Gregory, from Sowerby Bridge, West Yorks. "When we got to the airport I was approached at the check-in. The policeman pointed to Robert and asked if I came with him, I said yes. "They took us to an office and started searching us. They took X-rays and let us go. "I still had the heroin inside me when I went to the bank to change some money," she said. "But I was followed by a woman police officer with a radio. "They arrested us again and said I had a problem with my X-ray. I admitted everything and produced the drugs. "When Robert was brought into the interview room, I told him I had admitted it. He turned to me and said, `You admit it yourself. I'm not going to. You've done your job badly.'" Lock, who insists there is no evidence against him, is expected to enter the witness box on June 24. In the past his lawyer has sought to highlight alleged inconsistencies in Gregory's evidence. He was not carrying any heroin when he was arrested as he checked in for a flight to Tokyo, and denied a charge of trafficking. The court has been told that Thai customs had received a tip from the British Embassy to watch out for Lock, although the official who allegedly made the telephone call has not responded to a prosecution summons. Speaking later from her holding cell, Gregory said she had found a companion in Patricia Hussain, 29, a Briton, who was arrested last month on drugs charges. Hussain, from Manchester, is accused of possessing 7kg of heroin, and is also being held in the Women's Correctional Institution in the Thai capital. "We are like chalk and cheese, but we are getting on great," said Gregory. Lock, breaking a 15-month silence, expressed gratitude to people in Britain who had sent letters of support. He also thanked the organisation Prisoners Abroad for sending him £25 a month for food. "The food they give us is inedible," he said. "It has cockroaches in it sometimes. I have to buy everything I eat." He receives the equivalent of £15 a year for working in the prison timberyard. Gregory works at the bakery.
