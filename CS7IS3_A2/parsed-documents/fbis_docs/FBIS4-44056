Sweden's membership agreement with the European Union [EU] is going to be signed in Corfu tomorrow morning. This ceremony will take place before the EU starts its summit, where the Swedish prime minister and foreign minister are allowed to take part. Prime Minister Carl Bildt sees the Corfu meeting as important for Sweden. [Begin recording] [Bildt] We are now taking a step toward European cooperation (?with this agreement). We have been outside European cooperation for a very long time. I hope we will approve this at a national referendum in November. Now for the first time we have the possibility of a seat and a voice, even though we cannot yet vote in European cooperation. This is a historic step. [Correspondent Titti Nylander] You are going to be sitting among the other prime ministers as if you -- Sweden -- are a member, almost. Are you not going to feel slightly odd because we are not really members yet? [Bildt] It will be the case that I will not have the possibility to influence any of the decisions. I do have the possibility to say what we think about various points, but when the decisions are made, then we -- Norway, Sweden, and Finland -- we are not taking part, we are observers. However, we think it is important that we join in the cooperation as soon as possible, and therefore we are active observers. [end recording]
