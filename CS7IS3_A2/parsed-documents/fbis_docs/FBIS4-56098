FBIS4-56098 "dreeu103_m_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA Muslim Party Criticizes Head of Parliament Muslim Party Criticizes Head of Parliament LD2605223994 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service in Serbo-Croatian 0830 GMT 26 May 94 LD2605223994 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] Skopje, 26 May (TANJUG) -- The Executive Council of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA--Stranka Demokratske Akcije] in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], also referred to here as "the imported party" or "Izetbegovic's party," issued a statement expressing its indignation at Stojan Andov, the president of the Macedonian parliament. The statement says that Andov "is deliberately trying to deny the existence of a considerable group of citizens who nationally consider themselves Muslim." The SDA has not been invited to take part in the talks that members of the commission of the European Council's parliamentary assembly, who are not Council members, [as received], held with members of ethnic groups in Macedonia in Ohrid on 24 May. It has been noted several times over the past two or three years in Skopje that the SDA has been trying to turn the Islamic population originally from Serbia, Montenegro, and former Bosnia-Herzegovina--who arrived in Macedonia in the 1950's to facilitate their emigration to Turkey, but have remained in Macedonia because the Turks suspended immigration--into a new national community in Macedonia. Some Macedonian parties and associations believe that the SDA has recently been trying to turn these Muslim people in Macedonia--with Serbian as their mother tongue--into some kind of a "Bosniak" nationality. Observers in Skopje believe that attempts to affirm the alleged existence of "Bosniaks" are part of the Islamic fundamentalism strategy in the Balkans and elsewhere. Journalists in Skopje noted that during his visit to Skopje in mid-May, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin spoke, and certainly not by accident, about the Muslims in former Bosnia-Herzegovina--who speak the Serbian language--as "Bosniaks." Commenting recently on the increasingly frequent insistence that some kind of a "Bosniak culture" exists in Macedonia, Ljubisa Georgijevski, the president of the Forum for the Freedom of Media in Macedonia, said in a TV program that neither "Bosniaks" nor "the Bosniak language" exist.
