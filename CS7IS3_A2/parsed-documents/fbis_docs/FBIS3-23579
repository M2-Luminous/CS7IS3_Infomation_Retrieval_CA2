A commission headed by Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, as has already been reported, conducted a performance evaluation in military units of the 14th Air Army. The head of the committee visited several aviation garrisons, became familiarized with the state of affairs, met with servicemen there and answered a host of their questions. The officers of army command were interested first and foremost in what the structures of the Air Forces will be in the future. It was indicated in reply that the amount of aviation on the territory of Ukraine (and this conforms to international treaties) is considerably less than is needed for three air armies. There will thus certainly be no need to maintain three army staffs in the future. A new branch of the armed forces--the Air Defense Troops--is also being created. The Air Forces and the Air-Defense Troops will be part of them. This will cause changes in administrative structures as well. But all of the reforms will take place after diligent study, analysis and substantiation, and without any haste whatsoever. The problem of providing flight personnel for the units--especially helicopter units--is a quite acute one in the air army, since they are trained in Russia. How will this problem be resolved? We are not refusing any officers today, including pilots, who express the desire to move from Russia and serve in Ukraine, stated Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata in reply. And they are coming to serve. But not as many as are needed. At the same time, we are not keeping anyone here by force. All of those who wish to do so can move to Russia. The fact that they do not want very much to accept them there is another matter. We will solve the problem of training pilots using our own resources. We have already accepted into the Military Aviation Academy, this year, enough cadets to train for all branches of aviation. Difficulties are inevitable until they are trained. All pilots who intend to continue their service must thus be given the opportunity to do so. The shortage of housing is probably problem number one for all garrisons, including the air garrisons. We had to build twenty-eight thousand apartments this year, indicated the chief of the Main Staff. The corresponding funding was allocated for it. The state was counting on the fact that some military property would be sold abroad, and that most of the funds received would be directed toward housing construction. We were not able to build that quantity of apartments in just a year, however, because all of those funds were subject to inflation and were devalued considerably. We can count on only half that amount. A program to provide servicemen with housing in the future has already been worked out. It envisages the receipt of funds from other sources. It is also permissible to find and encourage investors on the following terms: Anyone can build housing on the land of the military department, including foreign structures, but only provided that thirty percent of the apartments will belong to them, and the rest to us. There is another way out of the housing problem as well--individual construction by servicemen. But there are still no funds for that. The state has not even allocated funds to grant the loans stipulated by the corresponding legislation. The solution of the housing problem is thus made more difficult by the lack of funds. Housing will appear in the future, when the financing is arranged. The "first in line" people--those who are being discharged--will be provided with apartments in the first two years, and all the rest in five years. Those calculations are based on the actual capabilities of our state. The absence of funds is also complicating the payment for municipal services by military units. How can this situation be rectified? Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata replied that if there is nothing with which to pay, then do not pay. There is good precedent for this in Poltava Oblast. There the local administration decided to cancel all of the indebtedness of the military units for heat and electric power. A billion karbovantsi were also allocated for interest-free loans to do preparatory work to erect housing next year for servicemen. They also allocated half a billion karbovantsi so as to pay the officers and warrant officers in a timely manner, since the financing was delayed at the center. All of this testifies to the fact that the officials in Poltava understand very well that without the support of the local authorities, it is too difficult for our state to maintain the armed forces today. This should also be understood in other oblasts as well, and they should meet the servicemen halfway. A question was also posed regarding to whom the helicopter units will be subordinate. Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata answered that all of us in the "infantry" have a great deal of respect for the fliers. We thus feel that army aviation should be part of the ground forces and be part of the structures of the districts, corps and divisions. The helicopter units are subordinate to the air armies today. Why was that decision made? Only because that could provide for at least a minimal level of training during these difficult times for us. The fliers also posed the question of improving the supply of military clothing, and especially special types. It was indicated in reply that the President has already approved new models for military dress. It is, to put it thus, pretty good, no worse than in Russia. Its production is based entirely on the industry of Ukraine. We will do everything to see that the necessary quantity of dress, footwear and everything else is manufactured, and we will supply it to the troops in the necessary quantities. We are issuing coveralls like those for tank crews to the aircraft ground-support specialists today, so as to get out of the current situation. We have ordered flight suits from Russia for the pilots. There will be no problems with the supply of mat√©riel in the future. Many pilots were uneasy about how they will preserve their proficiency ratings, since in the absence of fuel they are not meeting the norms for flying time. We obtain all the fuel for aviation, it was stated in reply, from Azerbaijan on a barter basis. There is fuel in Ukraine as well, but funds are needed to pay for it. The financing for the Ministry of Defense, however, is unsteady; funds are even lacking for timely pay, whence many misfortunes. We hope things will be better in the coming year. This year we have resorted to reducing the requirements for the number of hours of flying time for all categories of flight personnel, so as not to deprive them of their existing proficiency ratings. We are approaching this problem in considered fashion, and no pilot will be deprived of his rights or privileges. Colonel-General Anatoliy Lopata, in concluding the meeting, transmitted the request of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine that all officers make an example of themselves, and approach the resolution of problems connected with the building of our armed forces in considered fashion. All problems can be resolved, he indicated, for which purpose we must forget about discord; only unity can hold sway in officers' circles. We must preserve our respect for each other, and at the same time raise our mutual exactingness in the performance of official duties.
