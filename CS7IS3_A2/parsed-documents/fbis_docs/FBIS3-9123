According to data from the General Staff, every year only half of all young men who are legally obliged to perform their "citizen's duty to the motherland" actually serve in the Army. Because the number of recruits using various kinds of deferments is so huge, when it comes to the remaining candidates, the choice is severely limited. "The Army gets those who were not successful in fleeing"--that is the malicious way in which those who know a lot about yearly conscriptions describe the phenomenon. Even if such views are exaggerated, statistics regarding service waivers for potential conscripts are a very serious problem for commanders of military units. In some subdivisions, during the first weeks and months of service--that is, within the so-called short way--as many as 15 to 20 percent of soldiers drop out for, among other reasons, ailments that have just been diagnosed. It is practically impossible to make up for losses in incomplete crews of combat vehicles, while legal provisions do not provide for the possibility of conducting a follow-up conscription. The civil rights spokesman has already several times described the situation of an insufficient number of soldiers having to perform tasks designated for full subdivisions--which, by definition, means that the soldiers have a much greater burden to bear--as violating the principles of equality, which also means a violation of civil rights. According to officers responsible for the recruitment and adaptation of young soldiers, many conscripts conceal their ailments on purpose--at the point of recruitment, as well as for the first few days--to be able to avail themselves of the right to full medical treatment at the state's expense after a medical board issues a judgment saying the ailment could have been acquired during service. "A citizen aware of his rights simply uses them"--this is the way officers comment on that phenomenon and also on conscripts leaving service after the first several days not only with a medical waiver, which practically puts their future use to the Army into question, but also being financially supported. That is because every soldier, regardless of whether he has served a day or a year in the Army, is currently entitled to an allowance of approximately 4 million zlotys, on average. According to medical services, there is nothing strange in all kinds of human deficiencies and ailments coming to surface in the initial period of military service. Often, it is the first time in years that young men are subjected to such intense physical training, which helps surface all problems associated with the spine, flat feet, or concealed deficiencies of the circulation system. High stress levels and a sudden change in life-styles are also often the basis for a so-called disadaptation syndrome, which manifests itself in an inability to adapt oneself to the extreme conditions under which military service takes place. But we are not an exception in that regard: Psychologists for almost all armies have been observing the same syndrome.
