Yesterday afternoon Aguirre summoned journalists to report on the project, during a ceremony that was attended--among others--by dissidents of the Party for the Government by the People, Hector Lescano, and the Herreraists who support Alberto Volonte's candidacy. The project was submitted under the terms of a paragraph of Article 331 of the Constitution. Aguirre said: "This is the crowning point in a long constitutional reform process in which many political sectors have engaged. We want to implement this reform, which will begin a process through which the country will reach true electoral freedom." Aguirre added that the idea is that the process should not be finalized with this partial-scope referendum, but "next year, without electoral constraints, we should work in Congress to complete this process and achieve fuller electoral freedom." He emphasized "the perseverance of sectors that advocate the reform" and the "ethical attitude" toward the subject. "This ceremony marks the beginning of a period that extends up to the elections, during which we will promote this project, showing to citizens that they will be the beneficiaries of the reform because of the freedom they will enjoy," Aguirre said. The following are some of the main innovations of the project: -- Departmental Boards may modify budget bills only to increase revenues or reduce spending, and may not create jobs on their own initiative or approve any project that will generate a deficit. -- Alternate members may not automatically join Departmental Boards. -- Departmental Board members (councilmen) will earn a monthly salary that will be established by the board before they are elected. This also applies to the mayor. The salary may not be modified during the five-year tenure. Members may not receive other benefits (like gasoline vouchers, etc.). -- Departmental Boards will have a new structure, with 31 members in Montevideo, 25 in Canelones, and 21 in the other departments. -- The amendment of Article 77 of the Constitution allows citizens to make a so-called "crossed vote," that is, voting for one party ticket at the national level (president and vice president of the Republic, Senate, and Chamber of Deputies) and for another ticket at a department level (mayor and departmental board members). This means that citizens may vote--for example--for a National Party candidate for president and for a Colorado Party candidate for mayor.
