What is more, it is becoming increasingly intensive by the day. Civilian houses are increasingly being targeted by the enemy. According to reports that arrived this afternoon from the East Bosnian corps of the army of the Serbian republic, today, the 8th day of the offensive, the enemy has fired more than 200 shells at the Stolice relay station and stepped up infantry-artillery attacks on Piperi and Miroslavci, north of Lopare, from the direction of Celic. Members of NATO today wholeheartedly extended help in the latest Muslim offensive on Majevica. They have been carrying out intensive reconnaissance flights and breaking the sound barrier by flying low around this mountain. Despite the strong attacks, the Serbian positions have remained unaltered. As we have learned, there were no casualties among the Serbian fighters. As we report, which is shortly before 1500, the fighting is still going on.
