Elias] [Text] Mmabatho March 10 SAPA -- A REUTERS television crew, which has covered wars around the world, was severely beaten by Bophuthatswana police on Thursday [10 March] and said it was pulling out of the area immediately. Mark Chisholm, Paul Arubicek and Frank Kgolane were stopped by Bophuthatswana police near Mafikeng, hauled out of their car and beaten with batons, sjamboks [whips] and fists. "They pulled us out of our car, tore off our bullet-proof vests, beat us up, chucked our equipment about and told us to leave," Mr Arubicek told SAPA minutes after the incident on Thursday morning. The police had blamed them for littering the streets with stones, and their kevlar vests were no protection against the savage beating. On their return to the Mmabatho Sun Hotel television crews filmed the weals on their backs from the sjamboks and batons. Mr Arubicek's T-shirt had been ripped to shreds and Mr Kgolane's T-shirt was full of the blood which sprayed from his nose during the beating. The international television news team has covered hot spots as intense as the Gulf, Sarajevo and Beirut. "When the police start turning against the press reporting the crisis there is no point in hanging around. We are pulling out immediately," Mr Chisholm said. Another television crew, from the international agency WTN [World Television News], was also beaten by police in Mafikeng. Journalists on the streets to report on the almost total stayaway by workers in Bophuthatswana are leaving hotel grounds with kevlar protection, many with luminous flashes identifying them as press or with the name of the agency they are working for. The information service of Bophuthatswana claimed it had no knowledge of either incident. An SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] staff member working in Bophuthatswana, Phineas Diphopo, was severely beaten on Thursday and warned he would be shot if the Bophuthatswana police saw him on the roads again. He was stopped by police on the Mmabatho airport road which had been blocked by youths using stones and burning tyres. The police had their own roadblock on the Mmabatho side of the barricade. "The police pulled me out of the car, assaulted me with their fists and their feet. They also hit me with a sjambok," he said. The car was searched during and after the assault. "When I left, they threatened to shoot me if they saw me on the roads again." Mr Diphopo told SAPA that at the scene of the burning of the house of security policeman David Morobi, police were heard to say they would "start taking an eye for an eye". Mr Diphopo was was beaten on Wednesday night on the same road, but by the youths who had erected the barricade.
