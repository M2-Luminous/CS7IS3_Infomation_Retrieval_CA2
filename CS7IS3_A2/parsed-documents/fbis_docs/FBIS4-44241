Government Problems Viewed In anticipation of the elections, the 12 June Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA ran an article by Bambis Papapanayiotou listing the "thorny" postelectoral problems awaiting the PASOK government. Foremost among these is the economy, Papapanayiotou asserted, noting that a new wave of profit-taking may hit the drachma, with devaluation still possible in the future. The government must also submit its program for the convergence of the Greek economy with that of its European partners; a consensus exists that this program will include harsh austerity measures. The "unfreezing" of government public works and the awarding of the various contracts are another problem, as the obvious need for an economic "shot in the arm" will clash with the opposing interests of both domestic and foreign large economic interests. The government must also make a decision on the size and pace of the privatization of state-owned companies. The electoral results will influence the "long march" to the 1995 presidential elections, Papapanayiotou continued. Since PASOK lacks the requisite two-thirds majority in the Chamber of Deputies to elect the next president of the republic, a presidential majority in the spring of 1995 presupposes a series of moves in which Political Spring's 10 parliamentary votes might be crucial to PASOK. According to Papapanayiotou, a government reshuffle will follow the Euroelections. PASOK Reaction Following the losses sustained by the two largest parties, Viktor Netas commented in the 14 June ELEVTHEROTIPIA that "there was no cause for celebration" as some PASOK circles believed. While voters expected from the government an analysis of the results, Prime Minister Papandreou limited himself to stating that "PASOK is again the winner" and noting that "the government will continue to implement its program by intensifying the pace." However, Netas contended, matters were seen differently by a number of PASOK officials. Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos said that "while results do not put the government's stability in doubt, vote losses reveal the existence of a communications problem with the electorate." Netas further quoted Pangalos as saying that "the people did not disapprove of our policies but of our methods and style, blaming us for lacking a sense of responsibility and transparency." Minister of Industry Kostas Simitis was also cited as attributing lower PASOK vote shares to the government's slow pace and lack of decisiveness. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yiorgos Papandreou openly said that the electoral results showed popular "dissatisfaction" with the government. Netas commented that voters, "keenly aware of what they expected from PASOK, of what was done and what was not" by the government in the eight months of its existence, expressed their feelings in the voting booth. Interpretations Criticized If one were to believe the facile interpretations of "voters' messages," wrote Themos Anastasiadhis in the 15 June ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Greeks "smacked a PASOK which is (supposedly) worthy of governing us but unworthy of representing us internationally, (supposedly) expressed their attachment to [former ND leader] Konstandinos Mitsotakis as opposed to wicked leader Miltiadhis Evert, and showed Political Spring to be a `party of government' which must, however, wage a hard battle with rising parties like the KKE and the coalition, whose power was greatly increased." The electorate, Anastasiadhis continued, had no reason to favor PASOK, given the government's lackluster performance and Papandreou's obvious inability to carry out his duties "as of old." According to Anastasiadhis, the ND's 33 percent of the vote did not mean a "disapproval" of Miltiadhis Evert as his ND opponents are proclaiming, and is not solely due to the electorate's switch to smaller parties. In fact, ND losses stemmed from the "organized sabotage" by pro-Mitsotakis circles against Evert. Evert's poor political discourse and his "extraordinary vagueness" facilitated his opponents' task and precipitated his "self-destruction." However, Evert "is not finished," for he would easily win in a future confrontation with a PASOK without Papandreou. Those who believe that the "great winner" was Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras are "deluding themselves," Anastasiadhis continued. The party scored only 2 points above the Coalition and the KKE, failing to prove itself a "party of government." Finally, the KKE and the Coalition's "triumphant" claim that "bipolarity was defeated" must await the results of the next parliamentary elections, Anastasiadhis commented. While the Coalition had the advantage of leader Nikos Konstandopoulos' seriousness and status, it also benefited from the "philanthropy" of the Greek people, who "generously" accorded this "hapless" party some seats in the European Parliament, Anastasiadhis added with some irony. The KKE's slight gains came from disaffected PASOK voters who will likely "return home" in the next elections. Papandreou Presidential Plans PASOK election losses stemmed from a number of causes, wrote Stavros Liyeros in the 14 June Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. An important one was the electorate's uncertainty about the party's future. While the widespread impression that Papandreou will jump to the presidency leaving Akis Tsokhatzopoulos to succeed him as prime minister caused considerable dissatisfaction in PASOK ranks, PASOK losses made it more likely that Papandreou will run in the next presidential elections. According to an unattributed article in the 14 June I KATHIMERINI citing knowledgeable sources, PASOK's "dramatic" losses, which have weakened Papandreou's position within the party, will lead him to attempt a presidential run. In the present balance of forces in the Chamber of Deputies, the election of a president depends on an alliance between PASOK and Political Spring, an unlikely development given Samaras' reluctance to contribute to a prolongation of the present government. For its part, the KKE already announced it will reject a Papandreou presidency but left open the possibility it would vote for another candidate proposed by the majority. This leaves only the ND, whose leadership would never cooperate with PASOK in a presidential election. At this time, the article concluded, any decisions about a presidential candidacy should await the results of the October municipal elections, which will permit a better evaluation of the electorate's mood. Discussion in ND According to an unattributed article in the 14 June I KATHIMERINI, a 15 June meeting of the ND central committee will attempt to define the reasons for the party's poor showing in the Euroelections. The daily's list includes the following causes: - The ND did not campaign for Europe and Greece but for the party chairman. It supported his modernizing policies, which are seemingly not understood by a large segment of the party's grass-roots supporters. - The party was disorganized and the electoral commissions failed to perform adequately. - Mitsotakis offered no help and contributed to the creation of anti-Evert sentiment. - The ND entered the electoral fray at an inappropriate time, following an electoral defeat. - The poarty suffered from a lack of vision and an uncertain political identity. - ND candidates offered no thing new. `Bipolarity' Seen Shattered An unattributed article in the 14 June I KATHIMERINI commented that the failure of the ND to take advantage of PASOK's attrition in popularity means that the "closed cycle" of bipolarity, ensuring the two parties' alternation in power, was shattered. While this must be seen as just the beginning of a process that may be interrupted and reversed in the next elections, the gap will widen with time, the article asserted. Events will depend on ND internal developments, which may lead to a breakup and may increase similar pressures on PASOK when its succession problem will have to be tackled.
