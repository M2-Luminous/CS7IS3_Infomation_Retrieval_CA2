He added: We will examine and reevaluate the new conditions with a view to formulating a more effective program. Al-Shaqaqi noted that some of the details of this reality are still ambiguous. This will affect a decision on all these issues and will leave options and possibilities open. He criticized the recent Cairo agreement and affirmed his movement's refusal to recognize this agreement, which according to him gives the occupation legitimacy over a major part of Palestine in return for ridiculous self-rule over a small part of the homeland. Al-Shaqaqi added: We have to continue mobilizing the people against the agreement and draw attention to its dangers, which are epitomized by the loss of Palestine; the annulment of the Palestinian people's presence; and Israel's decisive victory. Israel is entering the region as a recognized central and dominating power with a recognized role. On the Islamic Jihad Movement's stance toward the Palestinian police, al-Shaqaqi stressed that one of his movement's priorities will be to avoid armed clashes with the Palestinian authority and police and that Islamic Jihad will do its utmost to avoid clashes even if it is forced to change its tactics in Gaza. He noted that one of Israel's major goals is to spark these clashes and preoccupy the Palestinians. Al-Shaqaqi said that it was important to achieve a more effective political, social, and cultural presence in the coming stage while affirming the unity of and coordination among opposition Islamic and national forces. This, in a bid to reach the best practical program possible so as to move beyond just issuing statements while the effort on the ground remains divided and isolated. In answer to a question about an issue currently preoccupying the Israelis, namely, whether he had any information about missing and captured Israelis, especially the pilot Ron Arad, al-Shaqaqi said that according to his information all missing Israelis, with the exception of Ron Arad, were dead. Those missing in 1982 were killed and there are conflicting reports about the whereabouts of their bodies. Two Israeli soldiers were captured by Hizballah fighters in 1986. One of them was killed on the spot and the other died from his wounds. As for Ron Arad, he was captured by the fighters of the "Faithful Resistance," which is a small splinter faction of the Amal Movement and holds Islamic tendencies. This faction was recently disbanded. Al-Shaqaqi added that the Faithful Resistance leaders say that they did capture Ron Arad but that after a while he disappeared or fled and that most likely an unknown party is still holding him. In any case, this party must be protecting him and has important reasons for doing so.
