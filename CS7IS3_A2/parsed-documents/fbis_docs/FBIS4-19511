This last week Norwegian authorities have received two bulletins from the nuclear power plant Polyarnye Sori about small accidents. On 3 March the cooling system of one of the old pressurized water reactors sprung a leak. Fifty cubic meters of cooling water ran out. On an international accident scale of zero to seven, this accident rated a two. Last Sunday [6 March] another bulletin appeared: A steam leak and an increase in the level of radiation was measured at reactor number three that was then stopped. This accident rated only a zero on the accident scale. "Neither of these accidents was particularly serious. Neither of them could develop into anything big. However, there is still cause for serious concern. They say something about the situation in general at the nuclear power plant," says Ole Harbitz, the director of the National Radiation Protection Service. Dangerous Neighbor When questioned about whether the situation is critical, he answers: "It is critical that Norway has a neighboring nuclear power plant that is in such a poor condition. An accident might just as easily happen tomorrow as in a week or in 10 years. I will not be surprised if there is a serious accident at the plant," Harbitz says. Two of the four reactors at the plant are of a type that Western experts think should be put out of commission as soon as possible. He follows the situation with Argus-eyed vigilance. He is very worried as to safety. Employees have been paid only sporadically this winter. Often months have passed between each payday. Work morale at the plant is consequently poor. And money for even the simplest maintenance work has been lacking since as far back as September of last year. This latest accident is a typical wear-and-tear accident in which parts should have been replaced long ago. "We are aware that there is a lack of money for wages and maintenance. This is cause for concern. Signals from Kola show that the risk of a serious accident has not decreased," Harbitz says. When questioned as to how great this risk really is, he answers: "The risk is a product of probability and consequence. Even though the probability of a large accident might still be small, the consequences for Norway will be so significant that the risk still will have to be considered large," Harbitz thinks. Norwegian nuclear authorities have not received any urgent appeals for technical help from the Kola power plant. "Moreover, we should stick to the strategy of helping with repairing only the most critical deficiencies, but not contributing to modernizing the plant so that it will continue to operate. Maybe we can hope that the present problems will lead to a more timely shutdown," Harbitz says.
