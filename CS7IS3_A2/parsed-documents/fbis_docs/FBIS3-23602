He is criticized for anything and everything. For example, for allegedly surrounding himself in two years as head of the military department with people knowing less than little about the army and its problems. And distancing himself from the army, stretching relations with real military professionals to the breaking point. The accusation is extremely serious; if of course it isn't unsubstantiated. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA received brief dossiers from sources in the Ministry of Defense on "confidential advisors" within Pavel Grachev's inner circle. VALERIY LAPSHOV. The number one man in Pavel Grachev's circle is what Lieutenant-General Valeriy Lapshov, director of his administration, is called. Prior to 1991 45-year-old Valeriy Mikhaylovich Lapshov was an unpromising senior operations officer in the Second Directorate of the General Staff's GOU (Main Operational Directorate), without any ambitions for the future. This is what he was, and most probably this is what he would have remained, had he not had the luck to study earlier in the Academy of the General Staff [AGSh] together with Pavel Grachev. Soon after the August coup, Grachev, who was then still the first deputy to Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov in the Union Defense Ministry, assumed his first command. For practical purposes Colonel Lapshov became a Major-General right away, in November of the same year, and two years later he was promoted to Lieutenant-General. (According to available information the question of promoting Lapshov to Colonel-General was also raised. However, Colonel-General Valeriy Mironov, Pavel Grachev's deputy, who handled personnel issues at that time, stated his categorical opposition. Such a high rank did not correspond to the position occupied by Lapshov.) According to friends an unusually gregarious, communicative person and a fabulous organizer of parties, Lapshov could not but be a soul mate to Pavel Grachev, no less gregarious than the former. As director of the Minister's Administration, Lapshov possesses extremely significant power. Practically all documents requiring the minister's attention go through his hands. It's his decision whether they end up on Grachev's desk or get tossed into the waste basket. Access to the Minister is also through Lapshov. DMITRIY KHARCHENKO. After graduating from the Academy of the General Staff, Major-General Kharchenko was appointed commander of a division. But the division commander's career was not a long one. He was unexpectedly appointed to the position of Chief of the General Staff's International Treaty Directorate. He had never been a lawyer or a diplomat, but like Lapshov he studied together with Grachev. To add to this, he was lucky enough to establish family ties with the General of the Army: This summer his daughter married one of the Minister's sons. Recently, the quickly advancing Lieutenant-General Kharchenko was appointed deputy chief of the General Staff. Even though he had no right to such an appointment on the basis of his position--chief of an ordinary directorate. (The directors of key main directorates, such as the Main Operational Directorate, the Main Organizational and Mobilizational Directorate, the Main Intelligence Directorate could have been deputy chiefs of the General Staff). But of course it's easy to correct this shortcoming: There are plans for raising the directorate headed by Kharchenko to the status of a main directorate, and to promote him to Colonel-General. GENADIY IVANOV. Not long ago the chief of the Directorate of Military Development and Reforms, Lieutenant-General Genadiy Ivanov was a group leader in the Center for Operational and Strategic Research--a body that has now been eliminated in view of its absolute uselessness. From there, he was sent for training to the AGSh, where he became acquainted with Pavel Grachev and Valeriy Lapshov. After graduating from the academy he remained there as an instructor. But not for long: Genadiy Ivanov rode the crest of the wave of the "August Victory" into the Russian president's administration and concurrently into the Defense Ministry's administration. After that, Ivanov transferred permanently to the Ministry of Defense, where he hammered together an army reform group in the fastest possible time. Then just as quickly he "grew" the group into the Directorate of Military Development and Reform. All matters associated with the army's reform are under his exclusive control. It is through him, and not through the "brains" from the General Staff, as was done before, that all necessary decisions of the minister pass. SERGEY ZDORIKOV. Major General Zdorikov studied together with Grachev, and he was recently appointed to the position of chief of the Directorate for Work With Personnel. He is a regular political worker who graduated from the Political Academy. While studying in the AGSh he proved himself to be an extremely undisciplined student. He rarely attended classes, as a result of which he was in perpetual friction with the group leader, Grachev. Now the relations between the "leader" and Zdorikov have normalized. VLADIMIR NIKITIN. Major General Nikitin, chief of the Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, is within the leadership of the military department, and a very mysterious figure. Ill-wishers have this to say about him: "Nikitin? Oh, before he was promoted to general he never commanded a troop grouping any larger than two typists!" A lawyer by education, Vladimir Nikolayevich Nikitin came to the Main Personnel Directorate as a civilian employee. And it was there that he became a lieutenant, upon joining military service voluntarily. After this he was transferred from the Main Personnel Directorate to, of all things, the Main Intelligence Directorate. He served there to the rank of captain, and once again returned to the Main Personnel Directorate, where he was promoted to major. Then the August coup occurred. Nikitin spent the "three black days" in the White House, from which he moved to a position in the State Legal Administration under the RF president. From there, traveling the road from major to major general in a single year (!)--Nikitin received his general's rank by an edict from USSR President Gorbachev. He returned once again to the Ministry of Defense, where he assumed his former position--chief of the Affairs Directorate; a position which, in view of its unique features, could be occupied only by a person known to be "especially trustworthy." YELENA AGAPOVA and VLADIMIR KOSAREV. Ministry press secretary Yelena Agapova and chief of the Directorate of Information and the Press Major General Vladimir Kosarev finish off the list of closest advisors. Before joining the Ministry of Defense Yelena Aleksandrovna Agapova worked around 30 years with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, where she climbed the career ladder from editorial messenger to assistant editor-in-chief. An accident decided her fate in the Ministry of Defense. It was March 1993, deputies of the RF Supreme Soviet invited Grachev to attend a hearing, where the defense minister was to give a report on the status of the Russian Armed Forces. As the appointed day came closer, Grachev became increasingly gloomier: The report, which had been drafted by military specialists and which contained a mass of "sticky issues," could create an undesirable impression. It was then that Yelena Aleksandrovna came to the rescue. Literally in one night she managed to tailor the "explosive" text in such a way that by morning the General of the Army not only survived but even earned the applause of the deputies. Having become confident in the abilities of his press secretary, Grachev elevated her to the rank of an advisor to the ministry and instructed her to form her own staff, for which 12 officers slots were foreseen. After completing this task as well, Agapova petitioned to establish a new subdivision under the Ministry--the Directorate of Information and the Press. Vladimir Kosarev, also an assistant editor-in-chief of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, became its chief. What we know about Vladimir Grigoryevich is that he had no military education at all, and that prior to August 1991 he worked with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA as deputy director of the propaganda division. After the coup he wound up in the president's administration, from which he returned to a higher position with the same newspaper. In the ministry, Vladimir Kosarev is "Agapova's man": He does not resolve a single issue of even the slightest importance without her knowledge and consent -- even selecting information coming together in his directorate and the means of its transmission to the minister. Such is the appearance of General of the Army Pavel Grachev's "first ring of defense." The editor's office feels evaluation of its reliability to be a matter for military specialists.
