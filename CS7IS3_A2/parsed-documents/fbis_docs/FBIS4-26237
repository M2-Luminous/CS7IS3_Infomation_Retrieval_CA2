Speculation concerning such a list, which according to a high-ranking, Shanghai-based official will be made public in full at the end of the year, may heighten frequently expressed concerns about the level of fund-raising by Chinese companies over the next 12 months. The current batch of 22 Chinese enterprises is in the process of listing offshore are hoping to raise about HK$8 billion, in the face of an increasingly bearish international investment community. Such an ambitious number of companies slated for international flotation will also call into question the Chinese government's ongoing efforts to develop its domestic stock markets to their full potential. Although plans have been announced to double the number of listed B shares by the end of the year, expanding market capitalisation by a further U.S.$2 billion (HK$15.6 billion) with a string of mainly infrastructure-related listings, international investors will have even less reason to shift their focus from the rapidly expanding H share market, especially while there remains no securities law in China. The continual flow of new listings (nearly 2.5 billion new shares have come on to the Shanghai bourse during the first half of this year) has also been said to be one of the main causes behind the collapse of confidence at both the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges. The fallout reached a new low point on Monday, when the Shanghai A share market fell below 500 points for the first time in more than a year and the foreign investor-driven B share market dropped to 71.13 points. In Hong Kong, on the other hand a Peregrine-led offering of 186 million shares for China Pharmaceutical was an encouraging three times oversubscribed by the time it closed this week. Investment bankers said that the varying fortunes of China-related companies trading in Hong Kong reflected increasingly sophisticated investor appraisals of individual companies. Shares in Dongfang Electric, the last of the original nine companies to be listed outside China, have traded up to a 12 per cent premium over the listing price last week. Its less well received predecessor, Tianjin Bohai, continued to languish at a discount. Bankers are also wary about the impending flotation of the first company from the new batch of 22 intended overseas listings, Luoyang Glass, which is due for launch next week. "Sentiment is not that great," banker said. "At the US roadshows, investors asked quite searching questions and didn't get very consistent answers," he said. Luoyang is being pitched at a price-to-earnings ratio of 13 but many believe that it will come to the market at a softened level of 10 or 11. With between $912.5 million and $1.2 billion being raised in total, about 25 to 30 per cent would be raised in Hong Kong. The international issue will be in the form of American Depository Receipts listed on the Nasdaq system.
