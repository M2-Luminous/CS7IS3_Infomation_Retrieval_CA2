A president of Russia has for the first time visited an independent Georgia. "In the age-old history of Georgian-Russian relations this is a significant event," Eduard Shevardnadze declared. "Russian leaders came to Georgia earlier also, but they came as to a colony...." At the airport the head of the Russian state was greeted by an orchestra. But only the initiated know that for want of suitable musicians in Tbilisi, worn out by war and political strife, the presidential orchestra had been brought into the city several days prior to this. "The Friendship, Good-Neighborliness, and Cooperation Treaty is a symbol of the new relations between Russia and Georgia"--this was how Mikhail Ukleba, deputy minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Georgia, characterized the significance of the Russian president's visit in conversation with your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent. "The Russian and Georgian delegations performed a great deal of work. There were five rounds of negotiations to prepare the documents, on the basis of which mutual relations between the two states will be built. Permanent political dialogue will enable us to develop good-neighbor relations, and in the future, possibly, allied relations at a new level. A great deal has to be done to restore the traditional economic relations. We are confronted with the task of a settlement of the conflicts in Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region." Snap Poll for OBSHCHAYA GAZETA of Leaders of Georgia's Political Parties Georgiy Chanturia, chairman of the National Democratic Party of Georgia: "We take a positive view of the visit and see it as an opportunity for a settlement of relations between Russia and Georgia. How successful this proves will depend to a large extent on Mr. Yeltsin and what Russia wants to see in the shape of Georgia: an independent neighbor or a semi-colonial country. We understand by the rapprochement of the two states civilized mutual relations and we support such a policy. But we are categorically opposed to agreements that could be followed by a loss of Georgian statehood." Vazha Adamia, chairman of the Merab Kostava Society: "We are for cooperation and a strengthening of contacts. But not such as Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the Georgian state, proposes. We are opposed to enslaving agreements and opposed to his decision concerning Georgia's membership in the CIS." Irakliy Tsereteli, chairman of the National Independence Party: "Our party's attitude toward the visit is unequivocal: The head of a state which since 1921 has perpetrated against Georgia permanent aggression is coming to independent Georgia. Russian forces of occupation are still here. Yeltsin's visit will have bad results for Georgia, primarily because it is Shevardnadze, who is his 'assistant,' who will be meeting him. Nodar Natadze, leader of the Popular Front of Georgia: "The visit is in itself a positive phenomena, but I have no great hopes that this might exert a positive influence on the situation in Abkhazia or South Ossetia." Guram Muchaidze, leader of the Social Democratic Party of the Republic of Georgia: "We advocate the maximum rapprochement with Russia. We welcome any steps aimed at the establishment of good-neighbor relations. Had we moved toward a rapprochement with Russia earlier, Georgia would not be in the deplorable condition in which it finds itself today. As far as the signing of the Friendship and Cooperation Treaty between Georgia and Russia is concerned, we may say just one thing: better late than never."
