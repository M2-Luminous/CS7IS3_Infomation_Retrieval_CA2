FBIS3-28222 "dreas024_d_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 South Korea Semiconductors Comprise 11% of Exports SK0402014094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0117 GMT 4 Feb 94 SK0402014094 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- Semiconductor exports are expected to reach 10.1 billion U.S. dollars this year, or nearly 11.1 percent of total exports, the Korea Semiconductor Industry Association (KSIA) said on Friday. Among exports, semiconductors ranked second after textiles in 1992, but last year semiconductors moved into first at 8.1 billion dollars with textiles following at 7.32 billion dollars. This year semiconductors will hit 10.1 billion dollars and textiles 8.2 billion dollars, widening the gap further. Semiconductors' share of total exports has continued to expand with the ratio reaching 8.8 percent in 1992, 9.8 percent in 1993 and 11.1 percent this year. Semiconductors have also gained in the category of electronics exports as the ratio rose to 31.6 percent in 1992, 33.1 percent in 1993 and a predicted 36.1 percent this year. "The world semiconductor market demands more large memory chips, so exports of semiconductors will rise more than 20 percent a year over the coming several years and semiconductors' ratio among total exports will jump to 15 percent," a KSIA official said. Meanwhile, automobiles ranked ninth among exports in 1992 with 3.6 percent, but rose to eighth in 1993 with 5.4 percent and will soar to seventh this year with 6.0 percent. But finished textile goods, which ranked first in 1992 with 9.8 percent, fell to second in 1993 with 8.7 percent and will drop to third this year with 7.6 percent. Among exports this year, finished textile goods will hit third at 6.94 billion dollars after semiconductors and textiles, followed by home electronic appliances at 6.8 billion dollars, steel products at 6.2 billion dollars, electronic products for industrial use at 5.6 billion dollars, automobiles at 5.4 billion dollars, chemical products at 5 billion dollars, ships at 4.9 billion dollars and general machinery at 3.8 billion dollars.
