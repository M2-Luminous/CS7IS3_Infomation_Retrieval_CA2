As a big and important step in deepening reform and perfecting the market system for the elements of production, it is attracting people's attention. The Shanghai Property Right Exchange Office will begin with exchanges of collective enterprises' property, and after achieving this will go on to gradually establish a large-scale, concentrated, public, regulated and orderly major property rights market. The "Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office" will operate at a high starting point, with high standards and high efficiency, then gradually will link up with the domestic and overseas markets, connecting with the international property rights market. In order to help readers understand the establishment background, practical significance and operational form of the "Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office, we will initially publish this special interview. The Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office is located in the Yipingxiang Building, at Alley 1277, Xietu Road, No 14. During the Lantern Festival with its deep atmosphere of spring, this reporter tracked down and interviewed the Chairman of the property right exchange office, Gong Jiemin [7895 0094 3046]. Reporter: Why organize and establish a Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office? Chairman: The office was established after more than half a year's preparation and application to the Shanghai municipal government, and was jointly organized by the Shanghai Agriculture Commission, Municipal Office of System Reform, Municipal Bureau of Commerce and Industry, and the Municipal, Suburban, and County Industrial Bureau. It is another production element market, following Shanghai's 10 other exchange offices of securities, metals, agricultural materials, chemical industry, petroleum, coal, grains and edible oils, automobiles, construction materials, and technology. Although this market is a relative latecomer, it is a very important start. It is an important and big step for Shanghai's establishment of the socialist market system. It is an inevitable high level market after conducting further reform of enterprise property rights. It is a measure which will invigorate the entire situation in the chess game that is big trading, big circulation in Shanghai. These could be the reasons why the Shanghai government approved its organization and establishment in its No 1 document this year. Reporter: Why do you say property right exchange is an important step to further reform? Chairman: The property right is the property owners' (enterprise legal person and natural person) rights to the property. It includes rights of occupation, use (operation), receipt of profits and control. Property right exchange is a special marketing activity which takes property rights as the object of exchanging, with receiving profits from property rights as the goal. The Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office is an exchange office focusing on the whole body of enterprise property right transmission (taking the enterprise as a single commodity). Prior to the implementation of reform and opening, an enterprise was an attachment to executive organs, not a commodity. Enterprise assets were non-liquid, property rights were fixed, a forbidden area for asset flow and reorganization. With the implementation of further reform, such production elements as capital, resources, technology, information, and labor gradually went into the market, and further developed enterprise asset property rights and some enterprise property right exchange, finally developing to the advanced market activity of the total enterprise property right going to the market. Reporter: In establishing the office, why did you choose to start with urban and rural collective enterprise property right exchange? Chairman: Enterprise property right exchange is a complex system. The major reasons for Shanghai selecting urban and rural collective enterprises to begin with are: First, property rights for urban and rural collective enterprises are relatively clear. Enterprises run by teams are owned by the teams collectively, those run by villages are owned by the villages collectively, those run by towns are owned by townships collectively, and in a joint stock system ownership is by the shareholders. Occupation, use, and division of enterprises is quite clear in these enterprises. Second, collective enterprise began and developed with the market economy. The enterprises' self-operation, personal responsibility for profits and losses, their self-development, and self-limiting system were all established and in operation early on; moreover, they have a stronger internal demand for exchange of property rights. Third, it is easier to handle asset and real estate transferrals for urban and rural collective enterprises, and they are especially better at placing and absorbing workers than are state-owned enterprises in cities, so it is relatively easy to transfer entire enterprises. Fourth, rural and urban collective enterprises have developed rapidly in this era of reform. Most enterprises have a comparatively short history, a light burden of retired workers, and are easy to transfer and cut debts, the amount owed to creditors. Fifth, at present, urban and rural collective enterprises have considerable assets: there are nearly 20,000 collective enterprises in suburban Shanghai, with original value of over 25 billion yuan in fixed assets. The registered capital of over 3,000 foreign-funded enterprises is more than $3.5 billion. So potentially, the market for transfer of enterprises either in whole or in part is very wide. Reporter: Why should property right transferral be concentrated in a property right exchange office? Chairman: The governing principle for all market competition should be public, legal, fair, regulated and orderly conducting property rights exchange. Carrying out enterprise property rights exchange by concentrating it in a property right exchange office helps to break down divisions among regions, industries, departments, and ownership, to form an intensive and unified large market, and helps protect enterprise assets from losses, preserving and adding to their value. Concentrating the conduct of property right exchange in an exchange office is valuable in that it provides an information center which can help enterprises straighten out their reserve assets, and perfect the allocation of key production elements through reasonable property right exchange. At the same time, it also helps to regulate the relationships among enterprises, the market and the government, and protects the legal rights and profits of publicly owned capital based on public ownership by administrative, economic, and legal means. Reporter: What is the organization and composition of the Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office? Chairman: The Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office will operate the chairman responsibility system under the direction of an administrative committee. It has three offices and five departments: the office of the chairman, management office, and general office; information department, overseas department, exchange department, legal department, and accounting department. The intermediate organization for enterprise property rights exchange is the property rights brokering corporation; these are property rights brokers. The property rights management corporation attached to the property rights exchange office is a property rights brokering corporation established in accordance with national laws, legal regulations, and temporary property rights management measures fixed by the property rights exchange office. The property rights brokering corporation is divided into three types: in order to guarantee that the exchange market for urban and rural collective enterprises is concentrated, public, and regulated, they established brokering corporations at the district or county level which are based on the management of urban and rural collective enterprises. This was done to straighten out exchange and speed up circulation in the property rights market, by establishing a group of brokering corporations directly organized or supported by financial organs, big enterprise groups and foreign trade organs. There will be planned, situational development of overseas members and members outside of Shanghai. Reporter: How will the Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Rights Exchange Office attain its goal of operating from a high starting point, with high standards and at a high level? Chairman: At the outset of its operations, the Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office will conduct "regulation, marketization, and modernization". Regulation means conducting regulated operations according to rules. The exchange office fixes and organizes internal organs strictly according to the exchange office's rules, the administrative commission's rules, the exchange office's administrative methods, temporary management methods of property right brokering corporations, provisional membership management articles and founding organizations. Exchanges will adhere strictly to several proposals concerning property right exchange submitted by the Shanghai government and the regulations and orders in the property right brokering corporation's provisional administrative measures. The whole procedure of registering sales, evaluating assets, the standard exchange contract and agreement, any changes in property right and the registration of these changes will all be standardized documents. Marketization and modernization mean that property right exchange activity must be a marketing activity, as well as using modern tools such as the computer to build up a highly efficient management system through use of internationally advanced exchange measures, concluding deals by matching pairs. This high-standard regulated exchange activity will expand the market coverage rate, and connect our property right exchange market with the international property right market.
