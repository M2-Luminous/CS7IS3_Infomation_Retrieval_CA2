FR940920-0-00012 FR940920-0-00006 LSMR 53123.B.4.a, which OSM previously approved (October 28, 1992; 57 FR 48726; administrative record No. LA&hyph;350), requires that vegetative ground cover shall not be less than 70 percent (administrative record Nos. LA&hyph;321 and LA&hyph;350). Louisiana's existing LSMR 53117.A.4, applicable to revegetation on land reclaimed for any land use, requires that a vegetative cover be established that is capable of stabilizing the soil surface from erosion. Therefore, the requirement for 70 percent ground cover on land developed for forestry is a minimum standard that must be increased if it is insufficient to control erosion. Louisiana stated at proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a that the tree stocking and ground cover standards were developed after consultation with and approval by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry. Louisiana submitted to OSM a letter, dated December 27, 1993, from the Louisiana Office of Forestry, Department of Agriculture and Forestry (administrative record No. LA&hyph;348.01). In it, the Office of Forestry concurred with the technical success standards for areas developed for forestry proposed at LSMR 53123.B.4.a. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(i) and 817.116(b)(3)(i) require that minimum stocking and planting arrangements shall be specified by the regulatory authority on the basis of local and regional conditions and after consultation with and approval by the State agencies responsible for the administration of forestry and wildlife programs. Consultation and approval may occur on either a programwide or a permit-specific basis. Because Louisiana proposed, at LSMR 53123.B.4.a, to specify the minimum stocking and planting arrangements, and submitted approval by the State agency responsible for the administration of forestry, Louisiana has proposed programwide standards for all reclaimed land with a designated postmining land use of forestry. The Director finds that proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a is no less effective than the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(i) and 817.116(b)(3)(i), and approves it. b. Utility of trees for the approved postmining land use and tree health. Louisiana proposed at LSMR 53123.B.4.a to delete the requirements that the trees that will be used in determining the success of stocking and the adequacy of the plant arrangement shall (1) have utility for the approved postmining land use and (2) be healthy. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(ii) and 817.116(b)(3)(ii) require (in part) that trees and shrubs that will be used in determining the success of stocking and the adequacy of the plant arrangement shall (1) have utility for the approved postmining land use and (2) be healthy. Because Louisiana has deleted the State counterparts to the Federal requirements, the Director finds that proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a is less effective than the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(ii) and 817.116(b)(3)(ii). The Director requires that Louisiana revise LSMR 53123.B.4.a to include these requirements. c. Length of time trees have been established. Louisiana proposed at LSMR 53123.B.4.a to delete the requirement that, at the time of final bond release, at least 80 percent of the trees and shrubs shall have been in place for 60 percent of the 5-year responsibility period. Louisiana proposed to require that (1) there shall be 450 well-distributed free-to-grow live pine trees per acre of the same age or 250 well-distributed live hardwood trees per acre of the same age and (2) countable stems shall be a minimum of 3 years old. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b0(3)(ii) and 817.116(b)(3)(ii) require in part that, at the time of bond release, at least 80 percent of the trees and shrubs used to determine such success shall have been in place for 60 percent of the applicable minimum period of responsibility (``80/60 requirement''). OSM interprets proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a to require that 100 percent (i.e., all countable stems) of the trees must be in place for a minimum of 60 percent of the responsibility period (i.e., 3 of the 5-year minimum period of responsibility). Under this interpretation, proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a is no less effective than the ``80/60 requirement'' in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(3)(ii) and 817.116(b)(3)(ii). However, before OSM can make this determination, Louisiana must clarify that this is its intent. Therefore, the Director requires that Louisiana either (1) clarify, by policy statement, that proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a requires that 100 percent (i.e., all countable stems) of the trees must be in place for a minimum of 60 percent of the responsibility period (i.e., 3 of the 5-year minimum period of responsibility), or (2) revise proposed LSMR 53123.B.4.a to add the requirement that at least 80 percent of the trees and shrubs used to determine success of revegetation shall have been in place for 60 percent of the applicable minimum period of responsibility.
