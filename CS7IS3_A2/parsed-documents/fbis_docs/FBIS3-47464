As the Constitutional Court considered, the provision of the law on leading place of Buddhism is up to the spirit of the Constitution about the unity of the Mongolian society, national security, and has just a declarative and symbolic character, concerning the provision on ban of organizational spreading of religion from outside, the judges considered that this also does not contradict both the country's main law and international rights and duties of Mongolia. But the Constitutional Court gave a commentary to this decision, stating that this provision applies only to reactionary religions and currents. As far as the provisions of the law, by which a ban is imposed on spreading, propagating of religions outside church, except Buddhism, Islam, Shamanism, and also on organization of any religious actions on the Mongolian territory by foreign citizens arrived in the country not on the church line, are concerned, the constitutional judges recognized these provisions as not corresponding to both the country's Constitution and international agreements. The chairman at the court session, after passing a verdict of the court, officially addressed the foreign citizens present at the court examination, gave explanations on some decisions, drew their attention to the fact that this is not the last word, the verdict of the Constitutional Court will be considered by the Mongolian parliament, it was said about a possibility of revision by law-makers of some provisions, on which the complaints were made. The law on relations of the state and church, which was adopted at the end of 1993, has aroused arguments not only in the Mongolian society, but, in all probability, had an international repercussions. Participation of many foreign citizens in the court examination, who represented in the main the representatives of Christian churches, and some of whom arrived in Mongolia specially on this occasion, is indicative of this fact. It has become known from the reliable sources that the ambassador of Great Britain to Mongolia at his recent meeting at the Mongolian parliament paid attention to the fact that consequences of this law would affect not only mutual relations between Mongolia and England, but also the international arena, as this restricts the human rights and liberties.
