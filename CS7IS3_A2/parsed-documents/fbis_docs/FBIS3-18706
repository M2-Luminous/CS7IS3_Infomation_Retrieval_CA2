The minister does not have the feeling that he could move around freely in that country, explained his spokesman. Pronk had intended to travel from southern Sudan to resistance groups in the Nuba Mountains, but he was denied permission to land there in a light aircraft. Last year, Pronk visited the Nuba Mountains, but on that occasion the journey was under government control. When he returned to the Netherlands, Pronk let it be known that the human rights situation in the Nuba Mountains had improved. Quite a different conclusion was reached by a Hungarian rapporteur for the UN Committee on Human Rights, Mr. Gaspar Biro [name as published]. The Sudanese Government is furious about the report, which was discussed this week in the UN Committee and is accusing Biro of blasphemy, but the European Union praised his sound, impartial report. Pronk informed the Sudanese ambassador this week that the Netherlands also supported the Biro report. Already during his last visit, Pronk had asked whether he himself might come into contact with the leaders of the various parties to the conflict in the south. This morning, Pronk informed Sudanese Ambassador Siddiq of his decision to call off the trip. During their conversation, the minister said he would not give up in his attempts to act as a mediator in the civil war.
