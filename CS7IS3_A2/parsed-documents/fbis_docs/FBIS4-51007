The country's import value in 1993 amounted to 104 billion U.S. dollars, said Zheng Silin, vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, at the '94 China Trade Investment Conference which opened in Hong Kong today. He admitted that China had a trade deficit of 12 billion U.S. dollars last year, noting this was led by a big growth of import as a result of rapid economic development in China. China's basic policy for foreign trade is to strike a balance between import and export provided it has necessary foreign reserve, the vice minister said. So far, China ranks in the world as the 11th largest trader with a total import and export value of 195.8 billion U.S. dollars last year. The country has approved 170,000 enterprises built in the forms of joint venture, cooperation or exclusive overseas investment. The actual foreign investment used in China surpassed 60 billion U.S. dollars. Starting from this year, Zheng said, China began to carry out a series of reforms in the fields of taxation, monetary, foreign exchange management and foreign trade. This demonstrates a breakthrough in the reform of China's economic mechanism and will be of a far-reaching significance in setting up a socialist market economy, Zheng said. He reiterated that China will take foreign investors into full consideration in its economic reform and strike to create an investment climate wherein enterprises operate in international norms.
