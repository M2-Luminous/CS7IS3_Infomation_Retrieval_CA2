FR941227-1-00009 FR941227-1-00002 §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Airbus Industrie: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;143&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model A320 series airplanes on which Airbus Modification 22621 (reference Airbus Service Bulletin A320&hyph;27&hyph;1041) and Airbus Modification 23556 (reference Airbus Service Bulletin A320&hyph;29&hyph;1058) have not been installed, certificated in any category. Note 1: This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (b) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent loss of the pilot's ability to control the moveable surfaces of the THS, accomplish the following: (a) Within 3,500 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, modify the trimmable horizontal stabilizer in accordance with Airbus Service Bulletin A320&hyph;29&hyph;1058, July 16, 1993, and Airbus Service Bulletin A320&hyph;27&hyph;1041, Revision 2, dated April 20, 1994. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on December 20, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
