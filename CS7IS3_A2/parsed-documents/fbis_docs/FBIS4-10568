The rumors that are spreading are truly alarming. Two days ago I spoke on another radio network, and [words indistinct] told me about this rumor that is spreading nationwide. I think that all Hondurans must support the constitutional government. The National and the Liberal Parties have had to pay a high price to bring democracy back to Honduras. Ours is a democracy that must be broadened and strengthened. In addition, rumors of this kind, especially if they are promoted by various national sectors, substantially undermine the country's economy vis-a-vis the international community. I believe and reiterate: We cannot let this government fail, but this government must also act to prevent this from happening. There are no doubts. We sensed it when we spoke with fellow party members and many Liberals. They all agree that people are very disappointed. The government lacks leadership and often improvises because it is not prepared to rule. There is a general feeling that the government makes hasty decisions, and we must find a solution to this. We must unite to find a solution to national problems. This is not about whether the government fails, it is about the system losing its credibility, which might lead people to seek other mechanisms to govern. I do not think a military coup d'etat would change the country's economic situation because such a forceful action will not bring food or money; it would do more harm. The international condemnation following a coup d'etat would be serious, widespread, and our country would be faced with even worse problems. We have also been in touch with the military on various occasions, and they have expressed their concern regarding the country's economic situation and willingness to cooperate. I think we should disregard these rumors. Regarding the presidential adviser and Liberal Party spokesman, who commented recently about feeling pressured, I know many people will go out and rush to sell their things because there is a high level of disappointment. I am positive, however, that all Hondurans reject the possibility of a coup d'etat. I reiterate that we must hold a national dialogue. All Hondurans must be aware of their positions. If ordinary people must make sacrifices, businessmen, producers, industrialists, and banks, which have fared well and have increased their wealth substantially, must make even greater sacrifices.
