Sinn Fein said it would hold a public "Peace Commission" in Belfast a week after the conference. The party -- the IRA's political wing -- has been holding the sessions all over Ireland. The announcement dashed rising speculation that the British and Irish saw the republicans' annual gathering as the platform for the announcement of their response to the Downing Street Declaration signed by John Major and Albert Reynolds on December 15. Neither London nor Dublin has put a time limit on a Sinn Fein response. But both have shown increasing signs of impatience at the long delay and had pinned hopes on Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams delivering an answer at the conference. Sinn Fein spokesman Richard McAuley said today: "The consultation process will not be complete but it does not devalue the Ard Fheis (annual conference). "It provides republicans in Ireland with their first opportunity to come together in a national forum to discuss the peace process." But Social Democratic and Labour Party deputy leader Seamus Mallon predicted that the IRA would give up terrorism and that the republican movement would enter the political process -- although not yet. Mr Mallon, MP for Newry and Armagh, said he was more convinced than ever that peace was on the way. "I think they will have a cessation of violence. I think they are on the road to peace," he said. "I think they are having difficulties in doing that and I did not expect them to have anything but difficulties. I think it will be longer than people think, more tortuous than people believe, but it will happen, I am convinced of that." Mr Mallon told the BBC Radio Ulster programme, Inside Politics, that the cessation of violence would come from within the republican movement. There was a "burning desire" for peace within the whole community and the section within the republican movement which wanted to continue the violence would find it impossible to sustain it in the face of that public desire. But people should realise that it would be a slow process.
