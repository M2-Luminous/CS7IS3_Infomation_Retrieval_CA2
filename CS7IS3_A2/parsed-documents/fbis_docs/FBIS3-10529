Lula, a 48-year-old lathe operator and union leader, told foreign correspondents in a news conference that "if we win the presidential elections, we will fight hard to promote respect for Cuba and to help it overcome the blockade that is isolating it from the rest of the world." Endorsing the Cuban people's right to resolve their difficult economic and political problems on their own, Lula said: "The Cubans have the right to decide their future free from foreign interference." Lula, who for one year has enjoyed the preference of 30 percent of the voters in opinion polls, stated that he would like to see Cuba experience a political opening. He made it clear, however, that he would refrain from making any proposal to this effect out of respect for the Cuban people's independence. Lula, who is the leader of the Workers Party [PT], said: "Although I would like to see elections and a political opening in Cuba, I am respectful of the free determination of the Cuban people." "My criticism of Fidel (Castro) is a respectful one addressed to a comrade who, because of external pressure, has been unable to prove that his system can work," Lula said. The PT is a party consisting of sectors ranging from ultraleftist to social democratic moderate factions. The PT leader acknowledges that since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, socialism is no longer seeking to put an end to capitalism.
