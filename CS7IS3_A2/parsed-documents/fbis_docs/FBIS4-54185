FBIS4-54185 "dreas102_a_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan NHK Panelists Discuss DPRK Nuclear Issue NHK Panelists Discuss DPRK Nuclear Issue OW2505082094 OW2505082094 BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese at 0000 GMT on 22 May, in its "Sunday Discussion" program, carries a live 75-minute roundtable discussion. Present at the discussion are Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister; Atsushi Kanda, Defense Agency director general; Taku Yamasaki, deputy secretary general of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]; Kosuke Uehara, a member of the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]; Hajime Funada, standing secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; Chikara Sakaguchi, chairmen of Komeito's Policy Research Council; Shoichi Ide, chairman of the Sakigake [Harbinger Party] General Council; Hiroshi Kikunami, chairman of the Japan Communist Party [JCP] Policy Committee. The discussion is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto. Yamamoto begins the discussion by raising the issue of the DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons for discussion and then asks Kakizawa to comment. Kakizawa states: "The international community has been making efforts to clear up suspicions about North Korea's development of nuclear arms. The United States and other nations, including China, have continued to urge North Korea through dialogue to work to allay international concern. I believe the effort by the United States and other nations are paying off little by little while making North Korea understand." Kakizawa goes on to say: "The international community has been concerned about North Korea's unilateral replacement of fuel rods at an experimental nuclear reactor. According to a news release issued this morning by the IAEA, however, North Korea has notified the IAEA of its intention to allow IAEA inspectors to check the replacement of the fuel rods and the experimental nuclear reactor in the future. I hope that North Korea will move that way in the future." Asked by Yamamoto to comment about the prospect of the United States and North Korea resuming the third round of their high-level talks, Kakizawa cites remarks by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci and says: "The third round of the high-level talks will be held between the two countries." Asked by Yamamoto to comment on the reports that North Korea intends to buy time instead of seeking an early settlement to the nuclear dispute, Kakizawa points to North Korea's past capriciousness in dealing with the nuclear issue and notes that "progress is being made little by little in the dialogue." Turning to the Hata Cabinet's handling of Japan's security policy and the nuclear issue, Yamamoto asks panelists to comment. Yamazaki states: "The issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear arms is a vital issue to Japan and Japan needs to vigorously deal with the issue. I believe that Japan needs to prepare itself to properly deal with economic sanctions against North Korea once they are imposed. In this connection, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai has stated the government has prepared for emergency legislation. However, my understanding is that the government has not yet prepared for the emergency legislation at all," adding that Japan should make diplomatic effort to persuade the DPRK. Uehara says: "The SDPJ takes the view that the Korean peninsula should remain free of nuclear. The SDPJ also has been concerned about North Korea's suspected development of nuclear arms. Our party has long advocated settling the nuclear issue through dialogue since it was in the Hosokawa government as a coalition partner." Noting the importance of dialogue, Funada states: "A set of policy agreements reached among the coalition partners stipulates that Japan should act within the framework of the United Nations, the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and the Japanese Constitution if the dialogue does not go well as hoped." Kikunami notes that "the JCP has harshly condemned North Korea for waging international terrorism" and states: "What is important for now is not to seek economic sanctions, but to seek a political and peaceful settlement to the nuclear issue." Discussing the government's handling of the issue of the DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons, Kakizawa states: "Japan and North Korea have so far held eight rounds of normalization talks; at these talks, Japan has urged North Korea to allay the international community's concerns over its nuclear program. Regrettably, the Japan-North Korea normalization talks have remained stalled since the talks were broken off over the Yi Un-hae issue [the DPRK's alleged abduction of a Japanese woman] in November 1992. The government has told North Korea that Japan is willing to resume the normalization talks. Japan has notified North Korea of its requests through diplomatic contacts in Beijing and the United Nations although I cannot go into details about the requests. In this way, Japan, for its part, has worked to settle the nuclear issue." Yamamoto raises the question of reinterpreting the Constitution to allow Japan to exercise the collective self-defense right and then asks panelists to comment. Kakizawa states: "The situation surrounding Japan's security has become very grim and the international situation surrounding Japan's security also has changed. Looking at the results of a recent poll, many people are concerned about this situation and speak of the need to debate how Japan should deal with it. I have proposed that national debates be held on the relationship between the Constitution and Japan's exercise of the collective self-defense right." Kanda states: "The government is going so far as to reinterpret the Constitution to allow Japan to exercise the collective self-defense right." Uehara notes the SDPJ's effort to alter its long-established security policy and says: "The SDPJ has to honor the policy agreements reached between the SDPJ and other coalition partners." Turning to economic sanctions against the DPRK, Yamamoto asks Funada to comment on what Japan should do if the economic sanctions are imposed. Funada states: "In principle, the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons should be settled through dialogue. Various actions should be taken against North Korea if the dialogue does not go as hoped. The question can be raised about how Japan should act within the framework of the United Nations. If the United Nations makes various recommendations and adopts various resolutions, Japan should of course deal with them within the framework of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the Japan-South Korea Friendship Treaty, and the Constitution. What I have advocated is that Japan should deal properly with the economic sanctions within constitutionally permitted limits." Noting that "it remains uncertain whether China will vote for the economic sanctions or not," Sakaguchi states, "Komeito hopes that the United Nations will decide to slap on the economic sanctions if the nuclear issue is not satisfactorily resolved. But the United Nations may fail to slap the economic sanctions against North Korea and Japan will have to think of what it should do if the United Nations fails to slap the economic sanctions." Discussing the possibility of a naval blockade against the DPRK under the economic sanctions, Yamamoto asks panelists to comment on how Japan should deal with the naval blockade. Kanda says: "If the naval blockade is imposed, the Defense Agency will deal with it in consultation with the Foreign Ministry," adding that he hopes such a naval blockade will not be imposed. Kakizawa states: "Mr. Yamazaki said just a while ago that the government is not prepared for the naval blockade. I think that various ministries and agencies have been asked to study how Japan should deal with the naval blockade. Now, the international community is working to settle the nuclear issue through dialogue. In view of moves taking place yesterday and today, there is a possibility that the nuclear issue could move in a good direction. Therefore, I would like to refrain from openly discussing what Japan should do if the dialogue does not go well." Ide says: "The nuclear issue should be settled through dialogue. With regard to economic sanctions, North Korea has been isolated economically from the rest of the world and I believe that economic sanctions will not yield the desired results. Economic sanctions will not produce the desired effect if China refuses to go along with them since it shares a border with North Korea." Kikunami reiterates the importance of dialogue and notes that the "set of policy agreements reached among the coalition partners aims to let Japan join the economic sanctions." Citing a congressional report in the United States, Kikunami says: "The United States plans to use nuclear weapons, impose a naval blockade against North Korea, and launch air strikes on North Korea's nuclear facilities." Kakizawa notes that the United States and European nations are deeply concerned about the DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons, adding that "according to a poll, a majority of Japanese are greatly worried about North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons." Kakizawa also stresses that "the government has been working for a peaceful settlement to the nuclear issue instead of whipping up a sense of crisis among the people." Continuing the discussion of how Japan should deal with economic sanctions against the DPRK, Sakaguchi notes the importance of defending the security and peace in Asia and the Far East including Japan and states: "It is important and a matter of course to seek a settlement to the nuclear issue through dialogue." Yamazaki states: "The diplomatic efforts have been left to the United States and North Korea, and I believe that this is not desirable. I think that Japanese politics should move to settle the nuclear issue." Kakizawa says: "Japan has continued diplomatic contacts with North Korea in Beijing and the United Nations. North Korea's basic policy is that it is not in a position to discuss the nuclear issue with Japan. As you well know, North Korea has been attaching great importance to dialogue with the United States. North Korea has been moving to link the nuclear issue to normalizing relations with the United States. Japan has maintained close contacts with the United States and South Korea. With regard to the question of whether Japan should participate in the U.S.-North Korea talks, Japan has to make a realistic judgment. As Mr. Yamazaki indicated a while ago, Japan thinks that it has to do something. However, I believe that it is proper for Japan to take a wait-and-see attitude." Discussing the question of putting economic sanctions on the DPRK, Kikunami states: "The JCP is opposed to North Korea possessing any nuclear weapons. The JCP is opposed to it from the standpoint of keeping the world free of nuclear weapons. To speak of the U.S. and Japanese Government positions, the United States presently possesses 10,000 nuclear warheads and it will retain them forever. Therefore, the United States has asserted that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] should be extended indefinitely. The United States thinks that there is no problem with its nuclear weapons, but it does not tolerate other nations possessing them. The United States has asserted that if one nation is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, then it will face economic sanctions. This is illegal." In response, Kakizawa notes that "India and other nations have indicated problems with the NPT" and says: "In reality, many other nations are greatly concerned about nuclear proliferation. Therefore, Japan believes that the NPT should be in place as written." Asked by Yamamoto to comment on the NPT, Yamazaki says: "If North Korea has nuclear weapons, I would oppose extending the NPT indefinitely. At present, however, I favor extending the NPT indefinitely. If one of Japan's neighboring nations becomes a nuclear power, causing the fear of global nuclear proliferation, Japan should not agree to extend the NPT indefinitely." Kakizawa responds: "If North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, it would bring a major change to the current security framework for Northeast Asia. I think that such a major change will not be in the interest of Japan's security. Therefore, Japan has worked hard for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. Japan has announced to the world that it will honor the NPT. The government has no intention of altering that policy." Turning to the subject to Japan's bid for a permanent membership in the UN Security Council [UNSC], Yamamoto says Prime Minister Hata is vigorously pushing for Japan's bid and then asks the panelists to comment. Kakizawa discusses the reform of the United Nations including the UNSC and says: "The mood is growing that Japan's affiliation with the UNSC as a permanent member will serve to strengthen the UN's functions. With that mood in mind, Prime Minister Hata has said Japan intends to contribute to the international community within the constitutionally permitted framework as a permanent UNSC member." Kanda states: "The Hata government intends to make Japan join the UNSC as a permanent member and I personally support this intention." Funada says: "In principle, the ruling coalition parties support Japan's affiliation with the UNSC as a permanent member." Yamazaki says: "In principle, the LDP supports Japan becoming a permanent UNSC member," adding that it is necessary to hold national and political debates on the question of Japan's affiliation with the UNSC as a permanent member. Yamazaki also stresses: "Japan should have a decisive say in the UNSC." Sakaguchi says: "Domestic debates should be held before Japan joins the UNSC as a permanent member. I think that Japan should become a permanent UNSC member since it is the second largest financial contributor to the United Nations, following the United States." Uehara says: "I do not oppose Japan joining the UNSC as a permanent member if conditions are created whereby a way opens for Japan to become a permanent UNSC member." Ide states: "Japan should not openly seek to become a permanent UNSC member because Japan has yet to decide what it can do after joining it. Although the United States and Britain support Japan becoming a permanent member, that does not mean that they are asking Japan to take that status." Kikunami states: "The JCP opposes Japan becoming a permanent UNSC member from a constitutional standpoint." Explaining reasons for the JCP's opposition, Kikunami cites the possibility of Japan getting involved in UN-sanctioned military actions. Commenting on Kikunami's statement, Kakizawa says: "Japan will participate only in PKO [UN peacekeeping operations]. Even if the United Nations creates a force in accordance with Article 42, the member nations cannot participate in the force unless they conclude an agreement with the United Nations in accordance with Article 43," adding that the United Nations does not intend to create the force immediately. Turning to the political situation, Yamamoto notes remarks by SDPJ Secretary General Kubo that if the Hata Cabinet resigns en masse after the 1994 budget bill is passed in the Diet, the SDPJ will aim to return to the ruling coalition and form a new coalition government. Yamamoto asks panelists to comment on Kubo's remarks. Yamazaki says: "Mr. Kubo has made important remarks." Uehara states: "Mr. Kubo's remarks are important. I believe that the SDPJ will debate his remarks. If the ruling coalition parties value the SDPJ, they should listen to what the SDPJ has advocated." At 0115 GMT, Yamamoto concludes the roundtable discussion after thanking the panelists.
