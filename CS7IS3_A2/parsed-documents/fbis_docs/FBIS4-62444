There were 8,380 votes in his favor. He is followed by Socialist Party leader Oleksandr Moroz, with 5,746 signatures, Education Minister Petro Talanchuk, with 4,963, President Leonid Kravchuk, with 4,011, former economy minister Volodymyr Lanovyy, with 2,690, and parliamentary speaker Ivan Plyushch, with 2,576. Independent experts point out that the only surprise is the third result, that by Ukrainian Education Minister Petro Talanchuk. However, they explain it by the somewhat command-like manner of signature collection at Nikolayev's teachers' training institute, which the minister visited in April.
