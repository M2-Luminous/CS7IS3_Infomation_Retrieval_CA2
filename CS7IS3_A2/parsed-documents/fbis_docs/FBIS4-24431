The three-day strike went ahead as official trade unionists campaigned for better protection for employees of foreign investors. They said reports were increasing of industrial accidents caused by mismanagement and maltreatment of Chinese workers by overseas enterprises. The workers, more than half of about 4,000 employed in a computer disk factory in Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, went on strike 10 days ago. Last April, they were offered a 13 per cent pay rise, well below the inflation rate in the city. They said that, in defiance of local labour regulations which set a minimum rate of 325 yuan (HK$289) a month for the average worker, and a maximum eight-hour day, the company had made them work 12 hours every day for an average take-home monthly pay of about 300 yuan. They said that despite the extra hours, they had received no over-time pay nor had they been given free accommodation, a condition most foreign-funded enterprises were obliged to provide. The dispute was resolved when the employer, with the mediation of government officials, agreed to meet the workers' demands. An official of the Zhuhai foreign investment management centre said some foreign funded enterprises imposed harsh regulations on workers, defying labour laws. A labour mediating centre was set up last year in Zhuhai to handle disputes at joint-ventures enterprises in the zone. Official unionists say joint ventures were caught up in more than 100 strikes in the past year. In 90 per cent of such cases, the workplace did not have a union or was only partly unionised. They said a long-awaited labour law giving greater protection for workers was under deliberation and was expected to be put forward this year. The vice-president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Qisheng, said Chinese law stipulates that workers enjoy collective bargaining power so that, represented by official trade unions, they could participate in the formulation of worker-related company rules. However, international labour unionists say Chinese workers often have difficulties safeguarding their rights. Although the federation claimed to represent most workers, many had quit or given up on it because it failed to offer practical assistance. The Chinese Government has outlawed unofficial labour unions.
