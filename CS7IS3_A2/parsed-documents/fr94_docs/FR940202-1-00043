Four consecutive years of drought in California (1986&hyph;1990) severely affected remaining California red-legged frogs in the Sierra foothills. According to the petitioners, several thousand hours of field surveys have revealed only one California red-legged frog since 1985 (Jennings et al. 1992). Many sites in intermittent streams that held California red-legged frogs before the drought were completely dry during field surveys. Sites still holding pools of water had water levels so low that access by predators was enhanced. Livestock grazing at many sites exacerbated effects of the drought by limiting or preventing riparian habitat regeneration (Jennings et al. 1992). Jennings et al. (1992) concluded that California red-legged frogs have been extirpated from the Sierra Nevada foothills or are extremely rare and vulnerable. Amphibian surveys of Sierran National Forests in 1992 revealed no California red-legged frogs (David Martin, University of California, Santa Barbara, pers. comm., 1993). On the central California coast, drought also may play a role in decreased California red-legged frog reproduction where frogs occur in coastal lagoons. At Pescadero Marsh Natural Preserve, Jennings and Hayes (1990) found that many dead egg masses in a portion of the marsh likely were killed by excessive (> 4.5 parts per thousand) salinity levels. High salinities in the marsh were attributed to drought conditions in the watershed. Rathbun et al. (1991) attributed the absence of California red-legged frogs in lower Santa Rosa Creek and lagoon in San Luis Obispo County to overallocation of instream flows exacerbated by the drought. Increased salinities were recorded in several other coastal lagoons during the drought years (C. Swift and K. Worcester, pers. comm. in Jennings et al. 1992). In 1993, Jennings (pers. comm., 1993) reported the loss of California red-legged frog egg masses from increased salinity in Arroyo Laguna in San Luis Obispo County. Because significant numbers of California red-legged frogs occur in coastal lagoons on the central California coast, drought has the potential to severely reduce production of California red-legged frogs over a significant portion of their remaining range. Reservoirs provide persistent habitat for bullfrogs during drought. Once rains return, bullfrogs recolonize former habitat as reservoir levels rise. Reservoirs, however, with their steep sides and lack of critical riparian vegetation, are structurally unsuitable for the California red-legged frog. Periodic wildfires may adversely affect California red-legged frogs by causing direct mortality, destroying streamside vegetation, or eliminating vegetation that protects the watershed. The 1991 Lions Fire on upper Sespe Creek in the Los Padres National Forest destroyed known California red-legged frog habitat (S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1993). Following the fire, extensive erosion in the watershed also negatively affected California red-legged frogs (S. Sweet, pers. comm., 1993). Extensive flooding has been implicated by Jennings and Hayes (in press) as a significant contributing factor in the extirpation of the California red-legged frog from desert drainages of southern California. For example, in the Mojave River drainage, no verifiable records or sightings exist of California red-legged frogs after 1968 (Jennings and Hayes in press). The disappearance of this species from the drainage coincided with a catastrophic flood event in the Mojave River in the winter of 1968&hyph;1969. The high degree of fragmentation of remaining California red-legged frog habitat makes this subspecies especially vulnerable to random extinction events and to loss of genetic variability. Small population size increases rates of inbreeding and may allow expression of deleterious recessive genes occurring in the population (known as ``inbreeding depression''). Loss of genetic variability, through random genetic drift, reduces the ability of small populations to respond successfully to environmental stresses. In the remaining vestiges of its former habitat and with its potentially reduced genetic variability, the California red-legged frog is vulnerable to random or stochastic events, such as fluctuations or variations of annual weather patterns (as discussed above), availability of food, predation and associated demographic uncertainty, or other environmental stresses. With only three areas currently supporting over 350 adults, all remaining populations of the species are considered vulnerable to stochastic threats.
