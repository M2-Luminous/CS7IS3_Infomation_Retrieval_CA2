During Choe's unofficial courtesy call to the Chinese leader, the Korean business tycoon proposed the joint-venture refining plant as part of projects to promote substantial economic cooperation between the two countries and received positive support from Jiang. Choe, who was visiting China on a five-day schedule, became the first foreign businessman to exclusively meet with the top Chinese leader, the sources said. Under the proposed plan, Sunkyong will tie up with Sinopec, China's state-run petrochemical company, and municipal government of Shenzhen to build the $1.5-billion refining plant in the free-trade city along China's southern coast, under the equity participation ratio of 40-30-30. Formal signing for the contract will likely be made during President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China between March 26-30, they said. When materialized, the 100,000 barrel-per-day plant will mark the biggest joint project between the two countries in terms of investment amount. Korea's daily refining capacity now totals 16.7 million barrels. A Sunkyong Group official said the oil plant is part of its grand overseas investment program, aimed at relocating the conglomerate's vertically-integrated petrochemical sector to China and other Southeast Asian nations. The nation's fifth-largest industrial conglomerate also plans to participate in oil exploration project in China's No. 23 oil mining zone along the East China Sea, build polyester chip and acetate factories in Shantou, and operate mobile telecommunication service network for China's three northeastern provinces, the official said. It already has been operating a solar cell battery factory in Shenzhen and a video tape plant with annual production capacity of 18 million tapes in Fujian Province, he said.
