The Belweder has opened attacks on many fronts. The most painful blow was the rejection of the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati to the post of deputy prime minister. Equally painful was the veto of the new Popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] Law. The victim of the skirmishes with the Belweder turned out to be Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, for whom the door to the Ministry of National Defense was once again closed. The president also said that he had a "Wunderwaffe" [secret weapon] up his sleeve: He may or may not sign the budget. He is not concealing the fact that the reasons for making such a decision will be purely political. Walesa's reservations concern not really the budget itself but those who have passed it. For the first time since the presidential campaign in 1990 and the first stage of his presidency, groupings coming from the Polish People's Republic have once again become Walesa's main enemy. As he delivered a blow to the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], the president unfurled the anticommunist banners, which had gathered dust and lain in the Belweder completely forgotten. Walesa's statements started to include increasingly more of the anticommunist rhetoric that had been forgotten. He returned to the ideas of file-checking and decommunization, even though quite recently he has declared that he would not allow the political struggle to mean a series of revenge acts. Most of the actors and observers of the political scene are close to expressing the opinion that the recent activities of Lech Walesa were the preliminary stage of his presidential campaign. One can suppose that, through this anti-SLD impetus, Walesa is hoping to kill two birds with one stone. First, he wants to clean the foreground in the race for the presidency: He is trying to weaken his most serious rival for this post. In line with the results of opinion polls, this rival is SLD Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski. Second, he wants to build a camp supporting him, which would lead him to the presidency for the second time. Here the calculations are simple: Walesa thinks very highly of his personal prestige; however, he would like to back it with the support of the divided--but still quite strong--Solidarity camp. It so happens that the Solidarity parties are seeking a presidential candidate, even though they are not looking in the direction of the former Solidarity leader. Therefore, Walesa has decided to take part in the bidding, and he is presenting his assets before he has been officially requested to do so. On the first issue, Walesa achieved definite, though unexpected, success. The attack on Kwasniewski, which was carried out with the tacit support of Waldemar Pawlak (because Kwasniewski is also his rival in both the coalition and the future presidential campaign) yielded results. Even though the SLD survived the onslaught, the nerves of its leader were too weak. First, Kwasniewski, who was probably in despair, stated that he is ready to publicly renounce his presidential ambitions. Next, he blurred his image of a serious and open politician through his escapade with the help of a ladder. That ladder will probably be one of the greatest arguments in any negative campaign aimed at Kwasniewski, especially a television campaign because the escape of the SLD leader was recorded on magnetic tape. Now one should perhaps expect a change in the direction of the presidential onslaught. If Walesa decides that Kwasniewski has ceased to be a serious countercandidate in the race for the presidency, he will deal with another politician from the list of his rivals. This politician is Waldemar Pawlak. If there is not a "clandestine agreement" between the president and the prime minister, the harmonious cooperation between them may turn into a ruthless fight. The beginning of this may be the president's veto of the budget. It would be a blow, first of all, to the head of government. Even though Walesa is fairly successful in "cleaning the foreground," he has not had any success in building a political camp supporting him. The president can see that the main Solidarity circles do not really trust him. He can also see, however, that their support may prove to be very beneficial for him. After he called them "screwups," he started trying to win the favors of those groups: On one day, the right-wing coalition severely criticizes the new "popiwek"; on the next, the president vetoes this law. During his term of office, the president performed a complete 360-degree turnaround, and today he is close to the position he was in back in 1990. His supporters of that time will probably not forget what came after that year. It will be difficult to say that Adam Michnik was wrong when he wrote the article entitled "Why I Will Not Vote for Lech Walesa"; he warned that this person was totally unpredictable. Walesa may become the victim of his own style of wielding presidential power. He employed the strategy of weakening every political camp whose strength grew during his presidency. In the charged world of politics, the Belweder was a considerable force--disproportionately greater than its true power. The position of Walesa and the realm of his power were safe. The first "victims" of Walesa proved to be his supporters, with whom he soon started to fight, supporting the so-called left pillar. The Suchocka government also had problems with the Belweder. However, at a certain moment, these tactics proved false: The SLD and the Polish Peasant Party became very powerful. At this time, it has turned out that the president, with few supporters, may prove too weak. He needs a political camp, which he has himself dismantled and which he will have difficulty putting together. His chances are very slim. His roads and the roads of the right wing have diverged too much. He will definitely not enchant the liberal camp by transferring political disputes to the economy. The Democratic Union will certainly not like his ideas concerning decommunization. Such arguments might only win over the most radical electorate: the supporters of Marian Krzaklewski, Antoni Macierewicz, and Jan Parys. However, they, in turn, feel the most intense hatred for the present head of state. Walesa can count on only one thing--that the "post-August Poland" will not manage to find a candidate for the president and, not wanting any postcommunist politician in that post, it will support Walesa in an act of despair. In such a case, Walesa would once again prove strong because the others are weak.
