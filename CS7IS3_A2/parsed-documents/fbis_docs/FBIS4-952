SAPU National Organiser Gerhard van der Merwe was reacting to Mr Kriel's response to a vote of no-confidence in him, passed at a SAPU meeting in Cape Town on April 15. The vote of no-confidence was accepted after Mr Kriel's office denied the SAP [South African Police] had morale problems, said Mr van der Merwe. "His response to the vote was that SAPU should stop trying to overtake Popcru (the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union) in radicalism. The obvious thing to do would be to effectively address these grievances rather than accuse SAPU of radicalism," he said. Mr Kriel's attitude aggravated the already volatile situation at grassroots level and was not in the interests of the police or South Africa.
