Thanks to this mechanism, a large number of high-ranking military cadres have been promoted after receiving systematic training at the National Defense University [NDU] and going through rigorous performance evaluation. Some 330 of them have been promoted to military district or region posts. Assigning cadres to military academies for later promotion is a basic cadre training and promotion system established by the Central Military Commission [CMC] for the Army in the new period. It is also the route a high-ranking cadre must go through to cultivate a high degree of political awareness, master modern military technology, and acquire the art of command in modern warfare in the new situation. The NDU, which shoulders the task of training high-ranking cadres for the entire Army, has fully displayed the role of a collective cadres headquarters called for by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. In the last eight years, it has run 23 different kinds of classes and trained 4,400 students. Some 4,080 students have graduated (completed the courses). Among those who graduated (completed the course) from the command training classes and high-ranking cadres training classes, 147 have been promoted to deputy army leadership posts, 119 to army leadership posts, 51 to deputy leadership posts in military regions, and 13 to leadership posts in military regions. In operating the school, the NDU upholds Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as its basic guide; earnestly implements the CMC's military strategic principles in the new period; works hard to raise the students' political, theoretical, and leadership standards; and enhances the students' organizational and command skills. To more successfully implement this school operation concept, it established, based on the instruction issued by CMC leaders, a complete performance evaluation system for students from enrollment until graduation. This has brought the work of training high-ranking military cadres to a regular, systematic path. The NDU makes persistent efforts to bring into play the overall superiority of the military academy's performance evaluation system, uphold the implementation of the various evaluation rules and regulations, integrate comprehensive performance evaluations with training and education, and objectively and fairly evaluate and recommend students. This kind of evaluation is comprehensive. For instance, evaluation of students at command training classes includes political, military, science and cultural standards, intellectual standards, progress in study, personality and moral characteristics, physical fitness standards, and potential for development. Based on the results of an evaluation, a recommendation containing views on the students will be presented. Students who are rated outstanding will be recommended for promotion on a priority basis or for promotion outside the normal routes. Students who are rated ordinary will be recommended for regular assignment. Students who are rated poor will be criticized and educated. Those who fail to improve after being criticized and educated will be eliminated. In the past two years, the NDU has sent evaluation materials and recommendation views on more than 300 high-ranking cadre-students to the CMC and the General Political Department, playing an important role in the assignment of outstanding high-ranking cadres who are have both political awareness and professional competence. The performance evaluation system also possesses notable motivation power for high-ranking cadres studying at the academy. The proportion of outstanding students in the academy has gradually increased in recent years, and the quality of instruction has also notably improved.
