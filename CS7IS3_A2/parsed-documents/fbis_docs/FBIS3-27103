And last year's sales were 42 per cent up on 1992, the State Statistics Bureau said yesterday. Encouraged by the rise in profits and sales, Chinese factories have been busy gearing up industrial production since the beginning of the year, according to bureau economists. Output in January this year jumped by more than 33 per cent over the same period last year. The bureau has not released sales and profits for this January. But January's sales of finished products were 1.3 per cent up on the corresponding month in the previous year. However, the loss-making factories which are sitting on large amounts of raw materials and stocks still pose a big headache for China's industrial development. Most loss-making factories are State-owned enterprises. And over one quarter of firms in the State-dominated heavy industry sector reported operating losses last year. The performance of these loss-makers was considered particularly poor given that more than 68 per cent of last year's profits were generated by heavy industry. Industry will have to improve efficiency as well as gear up production, according to the bureau. Industrial production should slow down a bit this year due to the government's brakes-on industrial development policy, which aims to safeguard the health of the national economy. The central government's targeted growth of industrial production should be slightly above 20 per cent this year, which is essential for ensuring a 9 per cent of GDP growth in China, official sources say. The bureau also said that the industrial production in coastal areas is better than that of the country's land-locked regions. Industrial enterprises in East China's coastal Shandong Province topped last year's output and sales league in the country. However, Shanxi Province, a major coal producer in North China, came bottom, according to the bureau.
