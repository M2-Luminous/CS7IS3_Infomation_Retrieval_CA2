This has been proven once again with the latest success of the Ljubljana criminal police who, after several months of cooperation with the Italian security organs, arrested a 49-year old Turkish citizen, Alija, in one of the rooms of the Hotel Lev in Ljubljana yesterday. During the search they discovered 5 kg of heroin in a secret place in the toilet, which is worth nearly 400,000 German Marks. [passage omitted] Simultaneous with this success of our criminal police a question poses itself as to how the aforementioned group of drug traffickers managed to smuggle 5 kg of heroin through the customs control at Brnik airport [near Ljubljana] without being spotted by an X-ray machine or customs officers. It seems that the airport is well known to the international drug traffickers, as allegedly being the place where one can dodge customs controls from time to time. However, we must recall the case from the recent past when policemen, with the help of dogs trained to search for drugs, managed to discover 11 kg of heroin at Brnik airport. Of course, this is not the last seizure of this type here, as the criminal police hold information about new smugglers. [passage omitted].
