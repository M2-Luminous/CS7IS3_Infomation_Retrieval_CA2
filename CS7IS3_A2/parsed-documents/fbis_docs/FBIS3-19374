The State Institute of Statistics (DIE) disclosed yesterday that Turkish exports rose by 3.4 percent while imports jumped by 20.2 percent in the fist month of the year. Exports went up slightly from last year's $1.2 million to $1.3 billion this year, while imports radically increased from $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion this January. The trade deficit, already on a sharp rise since early last year, climbed by 61.46 percent from $519 million last January to $838 million in the corresponding period this year, according to the DIE figures. The economy's export-import ratio declined from 71.1 percent last year to 61.1 percent this year in January. The DIE also revealed that Turkish foreign trade volume in the same period rose to $3.47 billion from $3.06 billion of last January. The Turkish Treasury plans to introduce new export incentives this month following a further deterioration in its trade balance, Treasury officials said on Friday. The new export incentive package was signed in Thursday's Cabinet meeting. The package will come into effect after receiving presidential approval. The new export incentives will include an "export return" system for agricultural products, research and development incentives for high-technology sectors, state participation in the construction of environmental facilities and measures for on-the-job training. The Treasury officials also said they had submitted proposals for new incentives, including energy subsidies to export industries, to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's coalition Cabinet. Manufacturers would pay 25 percent less for natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and water. They would also be exempted from import taxes and customs duties on fuel oil purchases. An overvalued lira and economic recession in Turkey's main trading partners have slowed exports since 1990. The 1993 trade deficit was $14.08 billion, up 72.6 percent from $8.16 billion in 1992. Exports rose 4.3 percent to $15.35 billion and imports 28.7 percent to $29.43 billion. The export-to-import ratio, a key indicator of a country's trade performance, fell to 52.1 percent in 1993, the lowest since 1980. "Acceleration of the lira depreciation and new measures will show their effects on our exports in coming months. I expect exports to hit $17 billion this year," a Treasury official told Reuters. DIE figures also disclosed that exports grew in the industrial sectors and the agricultural sectors. Industrial exports rose by 0.8 percent in January compared to last year's corresponding period, while agricultural exports rose by a higher 17.4 percent. The largest share in Turkish exports in January again belonged to the industrial sectors with $1.04 billion, which represents 79.7 percent of the total Turkish exports.
