Possibility of realization suddenly increased with the specific mention by Tokyo Prefecture of the power station site for the first time in the interim report of the Bay Plan made public recently. For Tokyo, which has depended unilaterally on power plants located in remote sites such as Fukushima and Niigata Prefecture, the significance of "Edo electric power" [Edo refers to traditional Tokyo] is great. What is the number of power plants within the prefecture? It seems a simple question, but it is a rather difficult problem. That is because in addition to widespread use of co-generation (thermoelectric combined supply) by plants, home electric generation, and large buildings, many small diesel power stations in outlying islands such as Miyakejima and Ogasawara are under Tokyo Electric Power jurisdiction. It is surprising, but there is even a small hydroelectric power station in the upper stream of the Tama River within the prefecture. If narrowed down to Tokyo Electric Power's full-size power stations, however, there are only three stations, Oi Thermoelectric (oil), Shinagawa Thermoelectric (oil), and Hoshu Thermoelectric (gas turbine). The total power generation capability of these three power plants is about 1.67 million kilowatts. It is no more than 3.5 percent of all Tokyo Electric Power's power generation facilities. Compared with the amount of electric power consumed, Tokyo has a setup that can supply only a scant 8 percent of the electric power that it uses. The reason that Tokyo Electric Power asked Tokyo Prefecture to sell the reclaimed land for power plant use was actually because of this self-sufficiency rate. Viewing large cities of the world, New York locally supplies 44 percent and London supplies 37 percent of its electric power. Even in Japan, where power plant location is said to be the most difficult in the world, Osaka supplies 40 percent and Nagoya, 33 percent. In Tokyo in the 1970's, there was a garbage war where ward opposed ward concerning garbage incineration sites. The residents strongly voiced that they did not want to build an incineration site in their own ward to burn garbage coming from other wards. It developed into a tumult where the border crossing of garbage was monitored. Changing the viewpoint, it was a dispute on the self-supply rate for each ward on garbage incineration. As a result, garbage incineration sites have been built in almost every ward. A power plant is a public works facility with an order given to a construction company and a location subsidy. It brings a huge economic effect, such as property tax payments, to the local area. No direct comparison can be made with garbage incineration sites, where garbage collection trucks only form a line, but they share a common point in that persuasion of the local residents about location is difficult. That is why Tokyo Prefecture ignored the logic shown previously in garbage incineration with regard to electric power. The building of a large power plant in Tokyo Bay is not just an issue of obligation to a self-governing body and the residents. To use electric power generated in Fukushima and Niigata in the prefecture, large-scale power transmission facilities are necessary. At 386.4 billion yen, electric transmission facilities account for 22.9 percent of all Tokyo Electric Power's facilities investment, exceeding the total investment for nuclear power and thermoelectric power stations. Simply speaking, power transmission costs more than power generation. Moreover, there is also the problem of transmission loss due to heat in long-distance power transmission. The new LNG thermoelectric power station which Tokyo Electric Power plans for the reclaimed land will be on the scale of 3 million to 4.5 million kilowatts. If it were completed with 4 million kilowatts, the electric power self-sufficiency rate for Tokyo Prefecture would be about 27 percent in 2008 when completion is scheduled. Even this cannot be called adequate, but they say "the burden for the transmission network will be decreased, and the stability of electric power supply will increase by leaps and bounds" (Tokyo Electric Power). With the combined cycle (compound power generation) used in LNG thermoelectric power, energy efficiency is rapidly improved, and facility size also becomes compact. There is also a possibility that Tokyo Electric Power will be able to create a power station of more than 5 million kilowatts at the same site if the technology is available when the reclamation is finished and construction begins. However, difficult problems remain such as the procurement and transport of the LNG fuel. In particular, the safety of bringing in more LNG than the 300 LNG tankers a year that currently enter Tokyo Bay should probably be debated. However, the "economic democracy" of self-sufficiency in electric power is a viewpoint that must not be forgotten in the future energy business (Yasuhiro Goto).
