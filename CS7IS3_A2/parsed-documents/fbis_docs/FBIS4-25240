First, standard apartments built by tax payers will be exempted from value-added tax as long as their value added does not exceed 20 percent of the amount of items for deduction. Second, real estate requisitioned or recovered for state construction projects will be exempted from value-added tax. While attending a recent seminar in Hong Kong, Li Yonggui said that the basis for calculating value-added tax is the amount deducted from real estate sales income. Items for deduction include the following: --The amount paid for the acquisition of land utility rights. --The cost and expense of land reclamation. --The cost and expense for the construction of new houses and facilities, or the appraisal prices of old houses and buildings. --The tax amount related to real estate transfers. --Other items for deduction listed by the Ministry of Finance. He pointed out that these are the principles of the regulations and that the details will be clarified in the implementation rules. In Li Yonggui's opinion, it is reasonable to say that inflation and risk-bearing factors should be included in the items for deduction and that this will be taken into account when working out the implementation rules, according to the regulations on "items for deduction listed by the Ministry of Finance."
