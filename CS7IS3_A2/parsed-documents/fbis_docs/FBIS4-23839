Reports said over a hundred people who fled into Burundi to escape Rwanda's bloodbath had been killed at Bugabira in the Kirundo Province. An aid worker said all the dead were Rwandan refugees, and that at least another 20 people were also killed in the weekend violence in the nearby town Kayanza, where Burundi's Tutsi dominated Army has launched a counter operation against Rwandans entering the country. Aid agencies said between 1,500 and 2,000 refugees had flocked into Bujumbura following several days of fighting in the hills around the city. The fighting began last weekend.
