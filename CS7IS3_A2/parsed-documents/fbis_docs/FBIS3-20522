With the deepening development of reform and opening up, the number of solely foreign-owned enterprises is rising daily, and the number of their employees is also rapidly growing. Consequently, party building work in this area is arousing increasingly strong attention from party organizations at all levels. Solely foreign-owned enterprises are characterized by a unique environment which is fundamentally different from that in state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises, and is markedly different even from that in Chinese-foreign joint ventures and cooperative enterprises. In such a unique environment, it is very difficult to operate on the basis of the traditional enterprise party-building model. It is now absolutely necessary to actively explore new approaches to the building of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises on the basis of proceeding from complex realities. I. The Current State of and Problems in the Building of Party Organizations in Solely Foreign-Owned Enterprises. The party member employees in solely foreign-owned enterprises come from all social strata and from across the country, and the individuals are very different in terms of their experiences and levels of ideological competence. After leaving their previous work posts and coming to work in solely foreign-owned enterprises, they would inevitably make adjustments with regard to their pervious party organization ties. But in reality some party members do not want to bring their party organization ties to the new work environment. Some party members do not want make their party member status public. As most foreign-owned enterprises are small and medium-sized enterprises, there are few party members among the employees, and the party members are scattered. As a result it is very difficult to arrange for them to take part in party member activities. Party members in some solely foreign-owned enterprises are even in a situation of being supervised by no one. The establishment of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises has allowed many party members to return to the embrace of the organization and to hear the voice of the organization, thereby enhancing party members' sense of organization and sense of the glorious mission of the communist. As the situation of the functioning of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises shows, it is true that party organizations in some enterprises have begun to operate in a normal manner and accumulated work experience, while winning understanding and support from the foreign businessmen involved. Nevertheless, in terms of the overall situation, it is still necessary not to overlook the fact that it is very difficult to carry out party building work in solely foreign-owned enterprises. The main difficulties in the work include: 1) There is a lack of explicit legal safeguards and policy protection for the existence of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises, and the "underground party" phenomenon cannot be completely eliminated; 2) activities of party organizations cannot be covered by the general framework of enterprise activities, and the role and status of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises are very unclear; 3) as the mobility of party members is high, it is difficult to grasp the people to be targeted in the work, and as a result grassroots organizations are unstable; 4) activities of party organizations cannot be scheduled to take place within the legal eight-hour work period, while it is often difficult to ensure that activities can be carried out in other time; 5) it is difficult for party branches to carry out joint collective activities, and it is even more difficult for a small number of party members who have become part of party branches of other units to have normal organizational life; 6) there are still some problems in the supervisor-subordinate relations and unified management of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises, and the phenomenon of "management in name but not in substance" is rather serious; 7) working in an entirely new environment, party members in solely foreign-owned enterprises are affected by bad tendencies, and thus they are strongly inclined to consider money to be all-powerful and have a weakening sense of organization, making it very difficult to conduct ideological and political work; and 8) activities of party organizations are greatly restricted in terms of time and space because some foreign businessmen fear that the enterprises' operations would acquire political colors. II. The Difficulties Facing the Building of Party Organizations in Solely Foreign-Owned Enterprises Call For Deep Thinking. According to the traditional model of party building work in enterprises, the party organization is the political core of a state-owned or collective enterprise; specialized work offices of the party organization need to be established and there need to be a certain number of party affairs cadres; the enterprise would make available activity time, activity space, and activity funds in a unified manner. The Chinese partner controls a certain proportion of the shares of a joint-venture or cooperative enterprise which thus is still publicly owned to some extent, with the employees remaining masters of the enterprise in some sense. The participation of the Chinese partner and its supervisory agency in the operations of a joint-venture or cooperative enterprise also creates some conditions for the building of party organizations in the enterprise. But things are very different in solely foreign-owned enterprises. Foreign businessmen assume independent responsibility for the operations of the enterprises and make independent decisions on operations, employment, and the distribution system, while party organizations are unable to play a role in important matters. Party organizations have no power or position in solely foreign-owned enterprises. Consequently there are many problems which should be thought about in a profound manner: What role do party organizations play in solely foreign-owned enterprises? What is the goal of party organizations' work? As the means of production of solely foreign-owned enterprises are owned by foreign businessmen as private individuals, employees are no longer masters of the enterprises, and the employee-employer relationship between labor and management is very clear. In such an environment, how should party organizations in the enterprises handle their relationships with foreign businessmen? How to carry out work among employees? According to some people, the party organization in a solely foreign-owned enterprise cannot become the political core of the enterprise. It lacks rallying power, combat effectiveness, and cohesive power, and thus will not be able to play an important role. According to some others, the Communist Party is the ruling party and the representative of the interests of workers. The party organization should become a political core of and battle bastion in a solely foreign-owned enterprise. According to some people, employees of solely foreign-owned enterprises are all wage laborers, and as owners of the enterprises foreign businessmen are in essence exploiters; therefore party organizations at the enterprises should not serve the foreign businessmen. According to some others, party organizations should proceed from the overall situation, and make active efforts to ensure that workers support the work of foreign businessmen. Various ideological and practical problem such as these have not yet been resolved in practice. III. It Is Necessary To Explore New Approaches To Building Party Organizations on the Basis of Proceeding From the Unique Environment in Solely Foreign-Owned Enterprises. First, it is necessary to face up to realities and transform the traditional ideas on and methods of party building work. Solely foreign-owned enterprises are different from state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises as well as joint ventures and cooperative enterprises. Foreign businessmen manage their own enterprises in accordance with the state's relevant laws and regulations and international practices, and would not establish offices exclusively engaged in party affairs work, maintain full-time party affairs cadres, or make time, place, and funds available for activities of party organizations in a unified manner. To do a good job of carrying out the work of party organization building in solely foreign-owned enterprises, it is necessary to discard old working models and methods and transform old ideas; it is necessary not to blindly follow the customary methods used in party building work in state-owned enterprises. Party organizations and party members in solely foreign-owned enterprises should gradually adapt to the unique environment in solely foreign-owned enterprises; should, in view of the characteristics of solely foreign-owned enterprises, carry out their work by having part-time party affairs cadres, by conducting activities after work, and by conducting small-scale and scattered collective activities; and should combine principledness with flexibility, and gradually accumulate experience on party building work in solely foreign-owned enterprises. The idea, based on disregarding the unique realities in a solely foreign-owned enterprise, of asking the party organization to become the leading organ and political core in the structural framework of the enterprise and to acquire such duties and power as entailing direct participation in enterprise decision making as a matter of course represents a dream totally divorced from realities. Second, some important problems of principle on the building of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises must be further clarified in the party's policies, the state's policies, and the relevant laws. Whether party organizations should be established in solely foreign-owned enterprises, whether party organizations should be allowed to be established in such enterprises, and what the scope, mode, and goal of the operation of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises should be are all important problems of principle. Without clear legal and policy interpretations, party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises would lack legal and policy guarantees, and their existence and development would exhibit a strong tendency to be changeable and be characterized by willfulness. For instance, the Foreign-Funded Enterprise Law of the People's Republic of China adopted by the National People's Congress in April 1986 and the Rules Implementing the Foreign-Funded Enterprise Law promulgated by the State Council in December 1990 do not explicitly stipulate that grassroots organizations of the CPC may be established in solely foreign-owned enterprises in accordance with the law; as a result there has emerged a situation where the establishment, existence, and development of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises are to a large extent dependent on the foreign businessmen's attitude toward and understanding of the issue. A small number of foreign businessmen who are opposed to establishing party organizations in enterprises would fire party members as soon as they are discovered, and clear away party organizations; meanwhile grassroots party organizations are at a loss what to do. The demand for explicit legal and policy provisions for the legality and rightfulness of the existence of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises does not entail the demand for giving party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises the status and power similar to those enjoyed by party organizations in state-owned enterprises, but entail the demand for providing necessary safeguards for the existence and development of party organizations under the preconditions of respecting the international practices regarding the management of foreign-funded enterprises and of respecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign businesses. Enterprise employees have the right to participate in legal political parties. This is a legal principle followed both at home and abroad. But there is a large difference between socialist and nonsocialist countries in the status and operating methods of grassroots enterprise organizations of political parties (especially the ruling party). Foreign businesses' biggest worry is that enterprises' party organizations would acquire the power similar to that enjoyed by party organizations in state-owned enterprises by exploiting the ruling party status of the CPC, thereby threatening foreign businessmen's independent management of private enterprises. If we make appropriate legal and policy rules which explicitly stipulate that the existence and activity mode of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises should not affect foreign businessmen's independent management of enterprises, and if we establish party organizations and carry out party work in an active and steady manner, then we are sure to secure understanding and support from foreign businessmen. Third, party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises should enhance leadership over trade union organizations in enterprises, and should be good at using the trade-union battle position in an effort to conduct their own work, consolidate their political position, establish their political prestige, and increase party organizations' cohesive power and rallying power. The lawful status of trade unions, as employee organizations in enterprises, in solely foreign-owned enterprises is protected by various enterprise laws and regulations. Trade unions' carrying out work and the participation of trade unions in enterprise management are in accord with international practices, and are thus understood and respected by foreign businessmen. To have party organizations actively promote the establishment of trade union organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises and to have party organizations participate in enterprise management through trade union organizations represent a very realistic approach. According to the Marxist theory, trade unions constitute a tie and bridge linking up the masses of workers with the party. Through having party members work in trade unions, party organizations influence the broad masses of employees, make propaganda on the party's line and general and specific policies, raise the ideological consciousness of the masses of workers, and get employees organized in activities to maintain their own legitimate rights and interests, thereby increasing the party's influence and strength. This theory provides an important guiding idea on the work of party organizations, including party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises. In solely foreign-owned enterprises, party organizations can still become political cores, but such political core status is not just given to them on the basis of legal and policy protection or guaranteed through the distribution of enterprise management power and the deployment of cadre personnel, but is embodied in the party organizations' own work. The chief way to play the political core role is to provide effective leadership over, and to organize, trade union work. Fourth, while carrying out trade union work in solely foreign-owned enterprises, party organizations should pay attention to enhancing multichannel communication and cooperation with foreign businessmen, and secure understanding and support from foreign businessmen, so as to create a good enterprise environment for the building of party organizations. The existence of solely foreign-owned enterprises is the product of our party's reform and opening up policy. It is our policy to develop the national economy, to introduce advanced technical equipments, and to learn advanced management experience of foreign countries through utilizing foreign businesses' investing in establishing enterprises. In carrying out work, party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises should be guided by the aforementioned policy, seek common grounds and keep differences in the process of communicating and cooperating with foreign businessmen, seek effective ways of cooperation under the precondition of adhering to principles, and utilize trade union organizations in adjusting labor-management relations, in organizing labor contests, and in providing technical and management training, so as to promote the development of the enterprises in the right direction. Party organizations can secure understanding and support from foreign businessmen through carrying out practical work, being sincere, organizing activities, and giving play to party member's pioneer and model role, thereby creating a vast space for the building of party organizations. Fifth, to enhance the building of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises, it is necessary to proceed with efforts at both the upper and lower levels simultaneously. On the one hand, enhance sector-based management, establish effective management institutions, and overcome the phenomena of disorderly sector-based supervisory relationships and of "management in name but not in substance"; on the other hand, in grassroots organizations, make further efforts to do a good job of building organizations and institutions and carrying out the work of party members' ideological education, enhance party members' sense of organization, and prevent the lowering of the political quality, so that the building of party organizations in solely foreign-owned enterprises can proceed in a normal and regular manner.
