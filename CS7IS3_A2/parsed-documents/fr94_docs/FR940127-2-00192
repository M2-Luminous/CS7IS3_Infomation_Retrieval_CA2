SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, Public Law 97&hyph;394 (96 Stat. 1966, 1976) extends the statute of limitations governing pre-1966 Indian damage claims (28 U.S.C. 2415) which was due to expire on December 31, 1982. A claim subject to the statute of limitations is an Indian claim for money damages which arose prior to July 18, 1966.

Claims for title to land are also not governed by this statute of limitations. This notice is required by section 5(c) of the Act. Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, lists of all potential Indian damage claims, which had at any time been identified by or submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the Department of the Interior's Statute of Limitations Program, were published in the Federal Register at 48 FR 13698, on March 31, 1983, amended at 48 FR 15008, on April 6, 1983; and at 48 FR 51204, on November 7, 1983, amended at 49 FR 518, on January 4, 1984.
