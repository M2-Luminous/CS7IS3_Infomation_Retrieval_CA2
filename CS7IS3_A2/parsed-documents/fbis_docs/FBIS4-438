So the operation to evacuate Belgians from Rwanda -- there are about 1,500 of them -- really has started, although fighting continues in the capital of Rwanda between the regular army and the troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. Francois Riquemont, our special correspondent in Rwanda, has just arrived in Kigali, and here are his first impressions: [Begin recording] [Riquemont] The first Belgian refugees left Kigali Airport early this afternoon for Nairobi. There must be about 250 of them who have already left Rwanda. In general the people arriving here are very calm, even if they have been through a lot in the last few days in the town. They are calm, and everything is going peacefully and without panic. People are saying that as soon as the French paratroops and then the Belgians arrived they felt much safer, even if many of them were threatened and had to take refuge in somewhat safer places before leaving for the airport in convoy. [Unidentified correspondent] So how are the convoys going? [Riquemont] It is known that the Belgians have in a way been caught in a trap. They were unable to leave by road, since the Belgian convoy was forced to turn back, and the Belgians in the convoys of foreigners were made to get out of the cars and they were stopped from getting through. So in the end convoys were arranged under very strong escort. There have been no incidents with these Belgian convoys, except for one, where there were serious threats, and stones were thrown, but nothing very serious. I must also tell you that the people we have spoken to here are worried about leaving, and also worried about the Rwandans they know and about the future, what they expect their future to be. [Correspondent] Do you have any idea about the scale of the fighting that has and is taking place in Kigali? [Riquemont] There is total anarchy in the town. We haven't been able to get into the town ourselves, but we have had many very reliable and consistent accounts. There is anarchy. There is still serious fighting, even if it is sporadic, between the Rwandan Army, the regular army, especially the Presidential Guard, and the rebels, or former rebels, of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] On the subject of the RPF troops, is it just rumor that they are close to the capital, Kigali, or is this well grounded information? [Riquemont] They are close to Kigali. We don't know how far. From what we have been told, they are waiting before entering the town. [end recording] That was Francois Riquemont, with whom we spoke by telephone just before this program.
