FR941116-0-00196 FR941116-0-00023 Another commenter suggested that the phrase ``harm to the contracting activity'' in §51&hyph;2.6(b) listing the factors the Committee addresses when reconsidering a Procurement List addition decision be changed to ``harm to the Government'' to allow consideration of harm to ultimate Government users of items purchased for them under the Committee's program by contracting activities. The Committee agrees with the commenter and has amended §51&hyph;2.6(b) accordingly. The same commenter suggested that language in §51&hyph;2.7 requiring the Committee to consider recommendations from contracting activities in setting initial fair market prices not based on competitive bids be broadened to permit contracting activity comments on all Committee pricing determinations. The Committee does not agree with the commenter. When initial fair market prices are established based on bids, the process is an automatic one based on the bid history of the commodity or service in question. There is no place for comments, unlike the alternate process of setting prices based on nonprofit agency costs, where a wider variety of information is allowable to determine what these costs actually are. As the commenter noted, the Committee has allowed contracting activities to make comments on pricing determinations whenever appropriate, so a requirement to accept these comments is not necessary. The Committee has modified the sentence, however, to make it clear that the no-comment rule applies only to initial fair market price determinations based on competitive bids and not to price changes. One commenter noted that §51&hyph;2.7 provides some detail on the Committee's method of making initial fair market price determinations, but very little on how price changes are determined, which is set forth on Committee procedures. The Committee has modified §51&hyph;2.7 to identify the price change methods used and to make reference to the Committee procedures where the details are set forth. The same commenter also suggested that §51&hyph;2.7 be amended to prohibit the establishment of an initial fair market price that is more than twenty percent above the existing Government price for the commodity or service. Current Committee policy already prohibits such a high price, so a change in the regulations is not necessary. One commenter asked for clarification of the term ``other persons'' in a new sentence in §51&hyph;5.2(e) concerning ordering of Procurement List commodities available only from nonprofit agencies. This term is part of a phrase extending the mandatory source requirement applicable to Government agencies to others providing the commodities to the agencies by contract which already appears in §51&hyph;5.2(c) and (d), and is only added to make it clear that the same requirement applies to orders covered by §51&hyph;5.2(e) as well. While the Committee agrees with the commenter that the term was originally intended to apply in all three cases to commercial suppliers under contract to Government agencies, the Committee believes that the broader language is justified by the JWOD Act and is appropriate to address similar situations which might not be covered by a more restrictive term. Two commenters suggested that language added to §51&hyph;5.3(a) by the proposed rule to extend the mandatory source requirement to commodities ``essentially the same'' as those on the Procurement List be deleted, along with new §51&hyph;6.13(c) which indicates that contracting activities are not permitted to purchase commercial items that are essentially the same as commodities on the Procurement List. One of these commenters indicated that this language would allow the Committee to add commodities to the Procurement List without performing individual suitability evaluations. The other commenter objected to the lack of a definition for ``essentially the same,'' and indicated that the concept would make it difficult for contracting activities to comply with the Administration policy and new statutory mandate to acquire commercial products whenever possible. As the proposed rule implied, this change was made necessary by the recent threat of proliferation in the Government supply system of commercial items which are essentially identical to commodities produced under the JWOD Program. The purpose of the JWOD Act, to create employment for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities, would be nullified if contracting activities could evade the JWOD Act's mandate simply by purchasing items which differed from JWOD Program commodities only in brand name or other insignificant features. The Committee, which includes a number of leading Government procurement officials, has carefully considered this change and has decided that it is important for the JWOD Program and within the intent of the JWOD Act. The Committee does not intend to use this concept as a substitute for individual evaluation of new commodities to determine their suitability for addition to the Procurement List. The concept will be used to identify commercial items which duplicate or differ only marginally from Procurement List commodities, to insure that contracting activities do not purchase the former instead of the latter. The Committee is already working actively with one of the JWOD Program's major Government customers to identify such commercial items. Because these determinations must be made on a case by case basis, the Committee does not believe that a specific definition of the concept is possible. The Committee does believe that the JWOD Program and the commercial items acquisition policy can coexist successfully, and that this new concept will be a useful tool for assuring that this will happen. One commenter suggested that the phrase ``simplified acquisition threshold'' be used instead of the figure ``$100,000'' as the limit for central nonprofit agency issuance of purchase exceptions without Committee approval stated in §51&hyph;5.4. The commenter noted that this change would make the provision consistent with the new procurement reform statute and would avoid the need for further changes in the Committee's regulation if the threshold changed in the future. The Committee has adopted this suggestion. As the proposed rule indicated, the Committee's intent in changing the figure from $25,000 to $100,000 was to be consistent with this legislation. One commenter noted that the policy of stocking military resale commodities, which is set forth in §51&hyph;6.4, has been changed to require exclusive stocking of commodities in the 800- as well as 900-series. The Committee has revised the section accordingly.
