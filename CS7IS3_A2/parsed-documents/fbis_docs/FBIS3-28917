I would like to address my first question to the chief cabinet secretary on the government's future course of action. Mr. Takemura, the summit could not work out even a joint communique. What is your comment on the summit results? [Takemura] It is true that the result was unusual compared with those of Japan-U.S. negotiations in the past. While the result is called a breakup or a failure, the two leaders sincerely discussed Asian affairs and the North Korean situation. Also in the framework talks, the two leaders reached accord on such global topics as population, AIDS, and environment issues. To be exact, the two nations did not reach accord in four fields -- government procurement, insurance, auto, and auto parts. When the prime minister left for Washington, we confirmed with him that Japan could not accept the numerical targets, and he told us that he would do his best on that point. As a result, the United States did not give this up too, and, as you know, the summit ended like that. In a way, this was the first time Japan maintained its consistency at the talks with the United States. But I do not think all Japan has to do is to say no to the U.S. demand. This is because both Japan and the United States are responsible for results of saying no to each other. While it is impossible for Japan to accept the numerical targets, it is still responsible for redressing its huge trade surplus through liberalizing and expanding its own markets. From the standpoint that bilateral relations with the United States are very important, Japan should exert sincere efforts on the basis of the summit results. [Yamamoto] As you noted, the numerical target issue had been a clear point of contention between the two nations. Did you expect such results in advance? [Takemura] Well, Japan has sincerely been explaining its position to the United States. Unfortunately, however, we could not agree on that point. In the past, the two nations have reached many bilateral agreements, including the semiconductor accord, and we thought we can work out a similar concession plan. Yet, Japan and the United States are nations of market economy and enjoy the free market system. So, it seems wrong for the government to set up detailed target figures for the private sector and exercise public control over the market. Since the Hosokawa administration is currently pursuing the deregulation policy to further liberalize the market, we had to refuse the U.S. proposal at any rate. [passage omitted on Yamamoto's question to Muto on how he conducted negotiations with the United States when he was the minister of international trade and industry and Muto's response] [Yamamoto] While you said Japan had to refuse the U.S. proposal, the U.S. Congress has already begun to demand economic sanctions against Japan in response to the failure in the summit. What do you think about it? [Takemura] I have heard that possibilities of economic sanctions were not discussed at talks between the prime minister and Mr. Clinton. But I think it is natural that some quarters in the Congress and public of the United States would show such reactions. But the two nations are in accord on the point that they have to maintain the important relations. I hope the United States takes prudent and reasonable attitude, and stays away from unilateral measures. [Yamamoto] Please excuse me for asking a hypothetical question. What would the government do if the United States imposes economic sanctions against Japan over the economic talks? [Takemura] We hope that will not happen. It is hard to answer questions based on supposition, but, during the Uruguay Round last year, GATT decided to provide some sort of mechanism to handle international trade disputes. I think that is a possible way Japan may take. [Fujita] Mr. Chief Cabinet Secretary, don't you think the breakup will have some negative impact on the friendly relationship between Japan and the United States? It seems to me that the United States has some sort of distrust of Japan and thinks that it is not making progress in liberalizing market even after discussions. What do you think of this point? [Takemura] I do not think Japan's demands on the numerical targets were wrong. To the United States, the huge amount of deficit, which amounts to over $130 billion, in trade with Japan is continuing to grow. Actually, it is gradually decreasing. However, the United States thinks that Japan is not making concrete efforts to reduce this deficit although more than 30 accords have been signed. Mr. Clinton is also feeling that no progress has been made at all. It seems that he has a strong distrust of Japan because the outcome of Japan's efforts in liberalizing its market and expanding its domestic demands to the expectation of the United States are still invisible. We have to understand this point. Deregulation, which will be linked to import promotion, is also an important issue to the Hosokawa administration. At the same time, we also need to narrow the price differences at home and abroad. Also, we have to voluntarily do our best to expand the market access no matter whether the United States calls for it or not. By doing that, we need to make the United States understand that Japan is seriously thinking about these matters as a whole. [Fujita] Looking back at the past, I think it was a mistake that we agreed last July to set up objective criteria. That was the beginning of the failure. Don't you think we should have clarified what the objective criteria were at least? [Takemura] Some people may think that way. However, we have had a long debate over the issue of what we meant by objective criteria. Objective criteria can be based on the figures for the past or figures for future targets. During the debate, we mixed up these figures and were unable to understand each other. [Yamamoto] As for the future, both countries agreed to resume the economic talks after cooling off their heads for a while. When do you think the economic talks will resume? [Takemura] We do not have a concrete plan as yet. The government will discuss this issue after the prime minister and the foreign minister return. Roughly speaking, however, the talks will be held for two years at the rate of twice a year. We already had an interim meeting this year. It is possible that we may have the second meeting, which will be held when the next G-7 summit opens in Naples in July, to discuss this issue. There are about five months between now and then. During this period, we will cool off our heads. There is no point in merely thinking about it without any actions. Therefore, I think we have to take due actions. [Yamamoto] Prime Minister Hosokawa called the Japan-U.S. relations a mature adult relationship. However, what do you think the Japan-U.S. relations will be like in the future? [Takemura] As the prime minister said, I think the Japan-U.S. relations will enter into a mature adult relationship, too. However, it is not an easy matter. Japan will be expected to demonstrate its independence in the diplomatic world. It will be entering a severe diplomatic stage. We have to promote true Japanese diplomacy or diplomacy in which we can maintain our independence. [Yamamoto] Indeed, some people are already pointing out that it is a bit too optimistic to think that we established a mature adult relationship. We should expect to see a very severe situation. What do you think? [Takemura] We need to see things in terms of overall politics and take the security issue into consideration. It would be nice if we have a mature adult relationship in every respect. We need to say things we want to say while having mutual understanding of each other's position. We just cannot have a reasonable argument on the basis of a race feeling [minzoku kanjo] or national awareness. [Yamamoto] Earlier, we talked about the possibility that the United States may impose sanctions against Japan. Some people are worried that the Japan-U.S. relations may become very tense and suffer setbacks. [Takemura] I do not think so. We should absolutely not allow these things to take place. To Japan, the United States is the most important country in every respect. Japan's fundamental diplomacy in the postwar era has been to maintain good relations with the United States. All political parties in Japan accept that. We should never change this fundamental diplomacy. [Fujita] Do you think the Japan-U.S. negotiations will be resumed in the same style as the current framework talks? Or, do you think completely new framework talks will start? [Takemura] This matter was left as a pending issue. Even though we are going to have a cooling-off period, I think both sides have to take some kind of actions at certain point. [Yamamoto] Mr. Chief Cabinet Secretary, we have to stop our discussion here because it is time for you to go to another place. Thank you very much for being with us. [Takemura] Thank you very much.
