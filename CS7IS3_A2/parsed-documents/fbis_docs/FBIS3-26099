In the letter Chen Yun touched on 15 points, three of which are essential-- specifically, first, corruption of the party; second, the causes of corruption; and third, a suggestion for party rectification. Chen Yun is a typical CPC member who always bears the party's fate in mind although being confined to bed all year round. He has racked his brains to find a way to save the party. He has written to the central authorities again and again, and made one suggestion after another. In order to save the party, he has defended Marxism-Leninism, criticized the Deng line, and lodged objections, going against the trend. With the same motive, he recently did two things. First, he wrote a letter to the Political Bureau; and second, he met and talked with Deng Xiaoping in Hangzhou, where he was recuperating. It is believed that he was trying to exert pressure by writing the letter and through his talks with Deng. And one cannot completely rule out the influence of these moves. In the letter to the Political Bureau he did make some sensational remarks too. After all Chen Yun still indulges in the illusion of putting the clock back to 40 years ago. Chen Yun Is Afraid That the Party Will Lose Its Leadership On 3 January 1994 the CPC Central Committee's secretariat circulated a letter Chen Yun wrote to the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau after the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. A brief note was added by the CPC Central Committee Secretariat upon the circulation of the letter: This letter Comrade Chen Yun wrote to the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau fully displays the absolute devotion of a revolutionary of the older generation to the cause of the party and the people and his utmost concern for the development of the party. We suggest that you conscientiously review your departments' conditions against this letter. Doing so will be beneficial to the party's work. The secretariat has circulated Chen Yun's letter, in the form of a special document, among the party committees of all the ministries, departments, commissions, and committees of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, as well as the party committees of all the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central authorities. As disclosed by the document, Chen Yun pointed out in his letter that the party's high priority task under the present complicated and drastically changing international circumstances is to build the party well and to pay greater attention to party building. If the party does not take care of the party ranks, they will become disunited, the party will lose its coherence and combative force, hence the people's support and its leadership. "Localism and Factionalism Are Prevalent" Chen Yun touched on 15 issues: 1. As far as party building is concerned, people lack a firm political orientation, and they think that politics is nothing but empty talk. 2. People have basically overlooked the value of Marxist theory in the new period and its importance as a guide for the party in its work. 3. Not only non-Marxist ideologies exist within the party, but also an anti-Marxist tendency and ideological trend is prevailing. 4. In the past few years, the party basically gave up its efforts regarding ideological work as well as education and propaganda on Marxism. 5. As far as propaganda on reform and opening up is concerned, the party's propaganda department has overlooked propaganda and education on socialist morality and style. 6. Now the political quality of the ranks of party and government cadres and the spirit supporting them to work for the cause of the people and the party have seriously deteriorated. 7. The party spirit and sense of organization and discipline on the part of party members, including old party members, have become unprecedentedly blunted. 8. Localism, individualism, and factionalism have been prevailing and spreading unchecked among local party organizations and departments, which has weakened the party's centralized leadership and the comprehensive implementation of the party's principles and policies. "It Is Suggested That a Comprehensive and Thorough Consolidation of Party Organizations Be Carried Out" 9. Anarchism and liberalism have become common and serious tendencies among leading party cadres. 10. Money worship of the capitalist world has corroded the party's ranks, and the will power of CPC members has been weakened amid peaceful evolution. 11. The role of party cadres and members in influencing and educating their family members and relatives has become a very prominent issue within the party. 12. Some party and government departments have become so corrupt that not only the party's leadership has been weakened, but also their corrupt practices have aroused grievances and protests among the public. 13. It is suggested that both the central and local authorities carry out a comprehensive and thorough consolidation of party organizations to get rid of corrupt and degenerate bureaucrats and to cultivate a fine atmosphere that will help to promote the party and the people's interests. 14. It is necessary to select, from the central level and localities, some upright and capable comrades of strong party spirit and great resolution, including non-CPC members and comrades of advanced age but still in good health, to replenish discipline inspection commissions and supervisory commissions at all levels. 15. It is suggested that the interim organization--"the central leading anti-corruption office" be placed under the direct leadership of the Political Bureau Standing Committee; and that a thorough investigation be carried out for a period of time, since this operation is a task of general significance and top priority. There are three keynotes in the 15 points raised by Chen Yun--namely, first, corruption within the party; second, the causes for corruption; and third, the suggestion for a party rectification. Party Rectification Is Useless to Improvement of Party Style The so-called party rectification means "to carry out a relatively comprehensive and thorough consolidation with a view to weeding out corrupt and degenerate bureaucrats." Chen Yun has an extremely deep love for the party and is extremely eager to save the party. However, cadres in Beijing who are well informed of the situation do not appreciate Chen Yun's proposal. Instead they make a mockery of Chen Yun's hidebound thinking, saying that he is but "an old, stubborn conservative." The CPC launched a few rounds of party rectification in the past. Before its rise to power, there were two major party rectifications, one took place from 1941 to 1945, and the other in 1947-48. After its rise to power, party rectifications were carried out during three periods, from 1950 to 1954, in 1957, and from 1969 to 1971. After Mao Zedong's death, another party rectification was conducted during 1983-87. During these major party rectifications, hundreds of thousands of party members were expelled from the party (238,000 party members were expelled in June 1953 alone). But has party style ever been improved and has party discipline ever been strengthened after party rectifications? To be honest, the further the party rectification goes, the more corrupt the party will be. Not to mention the previous rounds of party rectification, but let us take the 1983-87 party rectification as an example. This latest party rectification urged "fighting against all kinds of abuse of official power to seek personal interests." But after this party rectification, abuse of official power for personal interests has become more common among party members and cadres. This in turn gave rise to the mass movement against official profiteering, corruption, and privileges in 1989. Chen Yun now picks a futile remedy and expects it to work as a miraculous cure. This implies nothing but that the CPC has become so corrupt as to be incurable.
