In a statement issued at State House, Nairobi, President Moi said his attention has been drawn to the gross distortion and misinterpretation by the FORD [Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya Luo members of parliament concerning his statement in Kericho severing relations between their political party and KANU [Kenya African National Union]. However, his excellency the president noted that he wants to make it abundantly clear that he only announced the severing of the relations between the two political parties--that is, KANU and FORD-Kenya--in his capacity as the president of KANU. The president further pointed out that his reference to the Kipsigis, Maasai, and Kuria was within the context of cooperation in stamping out cattle rustling among themselves and had nothing to do with party politics. The head of state, therefore, said the claim by the Luo members of parliament that this move was meant to isolate the Luo community has no basis whatsoever unless they want to make the world believe that FORD-Kenya is a party exclusively for the Luo. President Moi pointed out that he had so far thought that FORD-Kenya was a national party with a countrywide following, but said it was now interesting to note that the Luo members of parliament consider FORD-Kenya as being synonymous with their community. The president said as far as he is concerned, this perception is entirely their own and not a corcect reflection of his statement, which was at party level and had nothing to do with ethnic communities. He also observed that he would like to believe that the highly insolent, inflammatory, and provocative utterances by a FORD-Kenya member of parliament, James Orengo, during the burial of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga were made on behalf of FORD-Kenya and not on behalf of the entire Luo community. His excellency the president noted that as a nationalist who sees tribalism as a cancer, his intention is to strengthen KANU in Nyanza in order to hasten the peace of development in the area. The KANU government, he added, has initiated ambitious development projects in that region covering all sectors, but also intends to increase them in order to serve more effectively the rising population.
