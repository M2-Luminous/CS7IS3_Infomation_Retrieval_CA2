Croatian authorities are willing to release those from the list of 980 missing persons who should be found to be in prisons or camps, said Simic on his return from Geneva, where he had met on Thursday with Croatian Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Mate Granic. Yugoslav officials will be permitted to go to Croatia and investigate the circumstances in connection with the disappearances. Simic and Granic agreed on the setting up of a joint commission for the affairs of refugees, missing persons and humanitarian assistance. The talks with Granic took stock also of other sensitive issues between the two countries, such as the restoration of PTT, road and railway communications, said Simic. He explained that the problems discussed at Geneva could not be solved without the participation of the `third party.' He was referring to Krajina Serbs, whose views he said were indispensable and whose legitimate interests had to be taken into account in dealing with the problems. Roads and railways linking Yugoslavia and Croatia pass in part through the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.), which has been proclaimed by the local Serbs in those parts within the arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia where they are the majority population, in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former Yugoslav federation and trampling on their rights. Simic said he was travelling to Zagreb on February 12 as part of regular monthly exchanges of visits by Belgrade and Zagreb ranking officials.
