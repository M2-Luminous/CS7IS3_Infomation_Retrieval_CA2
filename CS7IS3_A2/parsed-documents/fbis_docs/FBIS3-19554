Early this morning, the six deputies were taken from the Security Directorate to the Ankara State Security Court under heavy security. After their files were studied, two judges interrogated them. Chief Prosecutor Nusret Demiral later said that Hatip Dicle, DEP leader and Diyarbakir deputy, did not make a statement at the Alternate Court, which subsequently ruled to arrest Hatip Dicle, DEP Diyarbakir Deputy Leyla Zana, DEP Sirnak Deputy Orhan Dogan, DEP Mus Deputy Sirri Sakik, DEP Mardin Deputy Ahmet Turk, and independent Sirnak Deputy Mahmut Alinak. The prosecutor is demanding that the deputies be tried for violating Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code. The article in question envisages the death sentence for treason, and for crimes against the sovereignty and indivisible unity of the state, country, and nation.
