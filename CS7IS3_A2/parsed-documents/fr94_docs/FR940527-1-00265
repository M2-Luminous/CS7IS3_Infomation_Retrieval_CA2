FR940527-1-00265 FR940527-1-00014 Correcting the formula would substantially reduce hospital payments. The Commission recommends this reduction in program expenditures should be used to partially offset the increase in program expenditures for outpatient services that results from setting the beneficiary copayment at 20 percent of payments rather than at 20 percent of charges. (See Recommendation 22.). BILLING CODE 4120&hyph;01&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSEP27MY94.007 BILLING CODE 4120&hyph;01&hyph;C Recommendation 22: Beneficiary Liability for Hospital Outpatient Services Beneficiary coinsurance for hospital outpatient services should be limited to 20 percent of the Medicare-allowed payment, as it is in other settings. For services not paid on a prospective basis, beneficiary copayment would need to be estimated because it is not known at the time of service delivery. Medicare payment to hospitals for most outpatient services is based at least partly on costs or charges. Payment for these hospital outpatient services is not prospective. Therefore, it is known until the annual Medicare Cost Report is settled. Consequently, beneficiary liability is set at 20 percent of charges, rather than at 20 percent of payments as it is for the same services in other settings. Because hospital charges generally are higher than the costs of Medicare payments for outpatient services, beneficiaries are responsible for substantially more than 20 percent of costs or payments. In addition, for most providers charges have grown more rapidly than payments, resulting in disproportionate increases in beneficiary cost sharing. HCFA estimated that, in fiscal year 1993, beneficiaries were responsible for 33 percent of the facility portion of hospital outpatient spending. This is considerably more than if the services had been provided in other ambulatory settings. This difference in cost sharing unfairly penalizes beneficiaries who receive care in hospital outpatient departments. Further, it provides incentives for beneficiaries to choose a site of care on the basis of financial considerations rather than the appropriateness of the setting. ProPAC recommends reducing beneficiary liability for hospital outpatient services to 20 percent of payments. The Commission recognizes that until prospective payment is implemented for outpatient services, payment for a service will not be known at the time of delivery. Beneficiary liability based on payments, therefore, must be estimated. This could be done in several ways. Copayments could equal a lower percentage of charges, for example. Alternatively, the interim payment to charge ratio, which HCFA furnishes to all hospitals, could be used to determine the coinsurance amount for each service.
