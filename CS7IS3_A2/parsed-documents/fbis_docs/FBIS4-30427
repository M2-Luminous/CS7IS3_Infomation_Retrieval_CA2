Although Secretary Christopher says that North Korea should change its attitude before the summit can be held, his remark is all the more noteworthy because we are at a critical point in our endeavor to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Moreover, because the remark was made by someone who is responsible for U.S. foreign policy, we are even led to suspect that since the recent North Korean peace overture, some secret exchange of messages might have taken place between North Korea and the United States. If such a secret exchange of messages was not made, we can hardly understand why the United States suggests the possibility of another summit now that the inter-Korean summit talks have been agreed on. We do not object to the ending of many years of hostile relations between Washington and Pyongyang and the U.S.-North Korean diplomatic negotiations after the North Korean nuclear issue is ultimately resolved. The ROK support for sanctions on North Korea was not for the sake of sanctions themselves; it was to induce North Korea to negotiate. The ROK, more than the United States, must take the lead in inducing the closed and isolated North Korea to become a responsible member of the international community. This is so because it is a national problem directly connected to our survival. This being the case, it would not be too late to hold a North Korean-U.S. summit after the inter-Korean summit is held and after meaningful progress between Seoul and Pyongyang is made. At present, only the date has been agreed on for the third round North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, and the two sides have yet to negotiate on the key agenda items. North Korea has only expressed its willingness to freeze its nuclear program, but the United States is hastily moving to bring a package solution to the pending political and military issues. The U.S. strategic team should in the first place verify the truth behind North Korea's abrupt tactical change. They should find out why North Korea suddenly changed its stance toward dialogue with the proposal to freeze its nuclear program. They should know that with such a tactical change, North Korea intends to incapacitate the ROK, rather than resolve the nuclear issue, with the assertion on the "mutual troop reduction to 100,000 men" and to get the U.S. troops withdrawn from the ROK with the "peace agreement." The United States should not make the mistake of being implicated in a peace gesture North Korea habitually employs and of naively accepting the North Korean proposal without a safety-proof device. Peace will not settle on the Korean peninsula even if dialogue and talks are conducted while the problems connected with the security of the country are being overlooked. The United States might even find itself giving a tacit approval to North Korea's nuclear armament. North Korea's tricky peace overture and the easy-going U.S. policy toward the North as evidenced by Secretary Christopher's remark "We can hold summit talks with North Korea" can cause a rift in the ROK-U.S. cooperative alliance in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. What the ROK and the United States need at present is to reconfirm their unshakable diplomatic and security cooperative alliance. The U.S. foreign policy authorities should not forget that the abrupt reference to the North Korean-U.S. summit at this point could lead the United States to be fooled by the North Korean peace offensive.
