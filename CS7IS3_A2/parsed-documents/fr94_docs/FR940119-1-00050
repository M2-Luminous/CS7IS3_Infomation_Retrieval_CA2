FR940119-1-00050 FR940119-1-00013 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 285 [Docket No. 940101&hyph;4001; 121393A] RIN 0648&hyph;AG14 Atlantic Tuna Fisheries AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) issues this proposed rule governing the Atlantic bluefin tuna (bluefin) fisheries to: Establish fishing category quota allocations for the 1994 fishing season; amend the specified amount of other species to be landed as a condition for landing an incidental bycatch of bluefin in the southern longline fishery; adjust the line that separates the northern and southern regulatory areas for vessels using longline gear and possessing an Incidental Catch permit for bluefin; make technical corrections to clarify the regulatory text; and request comments on the use of curved length measurements to identify bluefin size classes and on additional means to provide notice of fishery closures. This action is necessary to implement the recently adopted quota recommendation of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to improve management and monitoring of the U.S. bluefin fisheries, to facilitate enforcement, and to enhance collection of data to improve assessment of the impacts of the fisheries. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before February 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on this proposed rule should be sent to, and copies of the Draft Background Document/Environmental Assessment/ Regulatory Impact Review are available from, Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management (F/CM), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. Comments regarding the burden-hour estimate or any other aspect of the collection-of-information requirement contained in this rule should be sent to NMFS and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Attention: NOAA Desk Officer, Washington, DC 20503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard B. Stone, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The bluefin fisheries are managed under the implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 285, under the authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA), 16 U.S.C. 971 et seq. The ATCA authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to promulgate regulations as may be necessary to carry out the recommendations of ICCAT. The authority to implement ICCAT recommendations is delegated from the Secretary to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA). Purpose of Current Action The proposed action for the 1994 fishing season is limited in scope. It is intended to meet existing obligations to implement ICCAT recommendations and to improve the efficiency of the domestic fishery management program. Pursuant to ATCA requirements, action is currently needed to ensure that the 1994 ICCAT-recommended quota of 1,235 metric tons (mt) is not exceeded. Also, action is needed to adjust management measures for the 1994 fishery to improve monitoring of bluefin tuna catch and facilitate enforcement. In addition, the proposed measures would enhance NMFS' ability to meet the stated management objectives for the domestic fishery: provide data to monitor the stock, minimize economic displacement, maximize the use of the resource, and spread fishing opportunity among as many users as possible. Proposed Management Measures This proposed rule would implement the ICCAT quota recommendation for 1994 and allocate the total quota among the several permitted fishing categories. In addition, NMFS received input regarding proposed changes to the Incidental Catch category from 13 scoping meetings held during September 13&hyph;17, 1993, and from written comments received during the comment period that ended November 5, 1993. Commenters suggested various proposals, some of which were adopted in the proposed measures and others that may be considered for future rulemaking. NMFS considered all comments received during the scoping process while formulating this proposed rule. NMFS believes that these proposed changes would further the management objectives for the domestic bluefin fisheries. NMFS also requests comments on the use of curved length measurements to identify bluefin size classes and on additional means to provide notice of fishery closures. Fishing Category Quota Allocations for 1994 At the November 8&hyph;12, 1993, meeting, ICCAT adopted a recommendation for new quotas for bluefin in the western Atlantic. The total catch for the western Atlantic region for 1994 would be reduced by approximately 15 percent from the 1992/1993 annual level to 1,995 mt. Despite this overall quota reduction, U.S. fishermen have been allocated nearly the same amount of bluefin in 1994 (1,235 mt) as they were allocated in 1993 (1,248 mt). This results from Japan's agreement to reduce its share of the total western Atlantic quota from its historical 26 percent to 12.5 percent during 1994 and 1995.
