FR940128-0-00015 FR940128-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 27 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ASW&hyph;5; Special Condition 27&hyph;ASW&hyph;2] Special Condition: Agusta Aerospace Corporation (Agusta) Model A109C Helicopter, Electronic Flight Instrument System AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final special condition. SUMMARY: This special condition is issued for the Agusta Model A109C helicopter. This helicopter will have a novel or unusual design feature associated with the Electronic Flight Instrument System. This special condition contains additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that provided by the applicable airworthiness standards. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Robert McCallister, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate, Policy and Procedures Group, Fort Worth, Texas 76193&hyph;0112; telephone (817) 222&hyph;5121. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 21, 1993, Agusta Aerospace Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, applied for a Supplemental Type Certificate for installation of an Electronic Flight Instrument System in the Agusta Model A109C helicopter. This model is a 7 passenger, 2 engine, 5,997 pound normal category helicopter. Type Certification Basis The certification basis established for the Agusta Model A109C helicopter includes: Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) §21.29; part 27 effective February 1, 1965, Amendments 27&hyph;1 through 27&hyph;8; FAR part 29 dated February 1, 1965, paragraph 29.903(b), for Category ``A'' engine isolation; and equivalent safety in lieu of compliance shown for: FAR 27.1189 (regarding shut-off means); FAR 27.927(c) as amended by Amendment 27&hyph;12; and Airworthiness Criteria for Helicopter Instrument Flight, eligible for day and night Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations, with one or two pilots, when Agusta Kit No. 109&hyph;0810&hyph;22, Revision E or later approved revision, is incorporated, and the helicopter is operated in accordance with the Model A109C Rotorcraft Flight Manual. If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this helicopter because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of §21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with FAR §11.49 after public notice, as required by §§11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with §21.101(b)(2) for changes to the type certificates. Novel or Unusual Design Feature The Agusta Model A109C helicopter was identified as incorporating one or possibly more electrical, electronic, or combination of electrical electronic (electrical/electronic) systems that will be performing functions critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopter. The Electronic Flight Instrument System performs the attitude display function. The display of attitude, altitude, and airspeed to the pilot is critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopter for IFR operations in Instrument Meteorological Conditions. If it is determined that these helicopters will incorporate other electrical/electronic systems performing critical functions, those systems also will be required to comply with the requirements of this special condition. Discussion of Comments Notice of Proposed Special Condition No. SC&hyph;93&hyph;5&hyph;SW was published in the Federal Register on November 17, 1993, (58 FR 60569). No comments were received. Therefore, the special condition is adopted as proposed. Conclusion This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on one model of helicopter. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the applicant who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the affected helicopter.

PART 27_[AMENDED] The authority citation for this special condition is as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 1344, 1348(c), 1352, 1354(a), 1355, 1421 through 1431, 1502, 1651(b)(2); 42 U.S.C. 1857f&hyph;10, 4321 et seq.; E.O. 11514; 49 U.S.C. 106(g). The Special Condition Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the following special condition is issued as part of the type certification basis for the Agusta Model A109C helicopter: Protection for Electrical and Electronic Systems From High Intensity Radiated Fields. Each system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure that the operation and operational capabilities of these critical functions are not adversely affected when the helicopter is exposed to high intensity radiated fields external to the helicopter. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on January 19, 1994. Sanida McRae, Acting Manager, Rotorcraft Directorate Aircraft Certification Service.
