Concerning this, Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said: "These are voluntary plans to be carried out by the private sector. It is improper for the government to comment on them." He then demanded that automakers' plans not be included in a package of government market-opening measures to be disclosed at the end of March. We support Kume's opinion. The Japanese Government should be discreet in word and deed, or automakers' voluntary plans might be considered to be an agreement between the two governments. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other U.S. Government offices in charge of trade with Japan have asserted that the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] gave auto manufacturers guidance in compiling their voluntary plans. They said that because the plans were formulated under the government's guidance, it was necessary for the Japanese Government to guarantee them. To refute such U.S. assertions, MITI should refrain from giving automakers administrative guidance whereby it pokes its nose into their business behind the scenes. It is not good if what the government has asserted in talks with Washington is inconsistent with what it has done to domestic companies. In the framework trade talks, Washington has demanded that Japanese automakers procure more auto parts from U.S. manufacturers and that Japan take measures to help the U.S. Big Three increase their sales in the Japanese market. It has also demanded that the Japanese Government guarantee that these goals be achieved. Tokyo has rejected these demands by saying that the government cannot control private sector business activities. However, because Japan's exports of autos and auto parts to the United States exceed its imports from the United States and because the framework trade talks remain stalled, the government has called on the auto industry to compile and disclose voluntary plans to expand parts procurement and to help U.S. automakers increase sales in Japan. Automakers are worried that their voluntary plans might be included in the government's market-opening measures. If they are included, it will be considered that the Japanese Government is responsible for carrying out the voluntary plans. When former U.S. President George Bush visited Japan two years ago, the government forced automakers to work out plans to increase their imports and procurement of U.S.-made autos and auto parts and included them in the action plan issued at the end of the Japan-U.S. summit talks. After that, it pressed them to carry out their plans, and automakers tried to achieve their goals at an immense cost. This has set a bad precedent. Washington has now demanded plans to expand Japan's imports and procurement of U.S.-made autos and auto parts, as well as a guarantee from the Japanese Government to carry out the plans. However, from the viewpoint of deregulation and free trade, the government should quit poking its nose into voluntary efforts by automakers. The government forced semiconductor makers to carry out the Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord and automakers to carry out their action plans compiled two years ago by justifying its demands as means to improve ties between Japan and the United States. The companies still are affected by these demands. The government should not make the same mistake.
