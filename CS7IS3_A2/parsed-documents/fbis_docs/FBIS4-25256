The move is to increase the social responsibility of prisoners and turn them into useful citizens, said Zhang Yuhua, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice yesterday. The inventions and innovations will be used to help prison work or sold to enterprises outside the jails, said Zhang. Some of the inventions have already received Chinese patent rights, she added. And in return for their creations, many inventors will have their prison sentences reduced. The move is part of the prison reforms and aims to encourage inmates to contribute more to the national economic drive and better prepare them for life after prison. A large number of talented inmates are former managers and technicians who committed economic crimes. At the moment there are 1.25 million prisoners in China's 680 jails and labour camps. In Shanghai, prisoners in the Municipal Prison have been taking part in the invention and technical innovation drive since 1992. Last year, eleven inventions and 56 of the technical innovations developed by inmates from the prison were given State and municipal prizes. And five inventions received State patents. In East China's Shandong Province, the No. 1 Provincial Prison located in Jinan also embarked on a drive to develop prisoners' inventions. Over the past few years, the jail has conferred the title of senior engineer to one prisoner, and named 56 others engineers, assistant engineers and technicians. The senior engineer was the first in the province to get such a title. He is now developing further technical innovations in the prison's workshop together with several apprentices.
