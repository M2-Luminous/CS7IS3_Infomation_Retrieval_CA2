One of the people quoted by IZVESTIYA was Aleksandr Morozov. A criminal case has been brought against him. In the four and a half years' investigation and judicial examination Morozov has repeatedly tried to draw the attention of detention center management, the Prosecutor's Office, and the courts to the numerous violations of the law governing investigations and to the inhuman conditions under which people are detained at these centers. Protesting a violation of the law in the conduct of the case, Morozov went on hunger strike -- as a result of which, he claims, his arms and legs started to wither away. Investigator Kharchenko thought that the accused was faking illness and sent him to the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences' Neurology Scientific Research Institute. There, Morozov claims, strong electric shocks were administered to him against his will. Investigator Kharchenko called on the Moscow Prosecutor's Office to bring a criminal case against Morozov. Since Morozov, the investigator believes, was to all intents and purposes accusing him of using torture, he termed the accused's testimony slanderous and "combined with accusations of the commission of a state or other serious crime" under Article 130 Section III. The statement was sent to the 108th militia precinct, which was charged with carrying out the interrogation. [passage omitted] Morozov has submitted around 600 complaints, statements, and petitions. Neither the Prosecutor's Office nor the courts have yet checked out the facts set out by the accused, even though he has continually pressed for it. But, as soon as the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] investigator who was mentioned in the accused's statement submitted his own statement, criminal proceedings were immediately instituted. That is a more than eloquent fact! I would recall that, after the IZVESTIYA article, the State Duma set up a parliamentary commission to look into the facts set out in the newspaper about the violation of human rights at Russian detention centers as a whole. The powerful departments whose interests were attacked in the article are well aware of the dangers of such checks. As we have already reported, a highly placed MVD staffer phoned the commission chairman to express resolute dissatisfaction with the creation of the commission. We must assume that this is why efforts are being made to discredit witnesses.
