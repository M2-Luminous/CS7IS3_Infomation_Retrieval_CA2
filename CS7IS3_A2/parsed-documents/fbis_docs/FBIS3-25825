Anhui has employed more than 420 foreign experts whose assistance has generated 120 million yuan in extra economic returns over the past eight years. The grain-basket province has also imported advanced cultivation technology, quality breeding stocks and other applied farming technologies to promote high-yielding agriculture with quality produce. Last year Anhui spread the use of a rice cultivation and growing technique from Japan to one third of the province, achieving a ten percent output increase per mu (one mu is 0.1647 ha [hectare]). The Fuyang region benefited from the skills of a Japanese expert in growing apples. More than 700 kg of apples are now harvested per mu, a one-third increase. The region has devoted 40,000 mu to growing the fruit. Emphasis has meanwhile been placed on updating and retooling major state-owned enterprises. A leather factory in Anqing employed 15 foreign experts to improve its technology and management skills, enabling its products to enter the world market and increase its annual output value by one million yuan. "The key to success is using the talents of foreign experts to develop the local economy," said Zhang Mingxiang, deputy director of the province's Foreign Experts Office. To date, Anhui has fostered close co-operative ties with countries like Japan, Germany, France, the United States and Canada. Zhang said his office is planning to recruit more experts, including overseas Chinese, from more countries and regions to help modernize Anhui's major enterprises and agriculture.
