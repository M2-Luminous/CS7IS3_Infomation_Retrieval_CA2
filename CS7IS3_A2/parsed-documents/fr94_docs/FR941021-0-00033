ACTION: Interim final rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its Farmer Programs servicing regulations by adding the Disaster Set-Aside (DSA) Program.

Under this program, the distressed borrower will have the opportunity to move the next scheduled FmHA annual installment to the end of the loan term. The intended effect is to service disaster victims in an efficient and timely manner while keeping them in business. DATES: Interim final rule effective October 21, 1994. Written comments must be submitted on or before November 21, 1994.
