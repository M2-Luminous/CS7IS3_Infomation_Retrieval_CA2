The five-year old popular movement had done its job. In connection with this, it would be appropriate to recall what the People's Front has accomplished. Let's recall that in 1988 Estonia was faced with a situation where it needed to make itself visible to the world, and to let the world know that we existed. We knew that the world will take seriously only those who do exist, who have to be reckoned with, and those with whom one needs to enter a dialogue. We had to create alternative structures, through which to mobilize the multitudes, reorient the awareness of the people, and select new leaders. This had to be done in such a democratic fashion that would not arouse protest against us elsewhere but, instead, earn us the support of world public opinion. We realized that supporting a popular movement that had already earned the support of world public opinion would be too difficult to avoid even by the pragmatic politicians of the West. The goal was to bring Estonia into big-time politics. This could have been accomplished in only two ways: By expressing the will of the state or of the people. We did not have a state yet. Among the people, however, 1988 saw the unleashing of processes that the whole democratic world had to reckon with. One could say that we involved the world in Estonia's cause, by signaling that what was happening in Estonia was bound to have an impact on world politics. This is how the People's Front was born, ushering in the era of movements in Estonia. It was a time of emphatic denial of what existed, and an absolute majority was in agreement on that. A situation emerged where everyone knew what they did not want for the present time. What they wanted for the future, however, and what kind of a positive program to follow, had not been sorted out between the different groupings. Only some vague and relatively general ideas existed. The emergence of large popular movements was not only characteristic of Estonia, or the Baltic states, for that matter. The popular movements became the moving force that managed to break up the Soviet empire throughout the entire territory of the former Soviet Union and its socialist satellite states in Central Europe. Sociologists have recorded as many as 70 oppositional mass movements over the former Soviet territory and Central Europe. Estonia's People's Front had close ties with popular movements in Central Europe, although our delegation was not admitted to the German Democratic Republic, for example. That's how dangerous it thought to be. One could also recall the greeting received from the 'official' Popular Front of Czechoslovakia to the First Congress of Estonia's People's Front. It was very conservative, if not stagnationist. I think there were things at that time that the Czechs could have learned from Estonia's People's Front. We sent telegrams to Czechoslovakia demanding that Vaclav Havel be freed, we protested against the dictatorial regime in Romania, etc. It should be admitted that the goals of popular movements taking place in Central Europe were, in a sense, more restricted, compared to those of Estonia. In East Germany, the goal of the popular movement was to demolish the Berlin Wall and, when that was done, disperse, without any clear formation. In Czechoslovakia, the Citizens' Forum set itself the task of getting rid of the Husak regime installed by Brezhnev. In Poland, the mission had a wider range, including the protection of economic interests, and basic spiritual values (derived from Catholicism) of the people. By far the mightiest of Central European popular movements was Poland's Solidarity. This name was chosen very carefully, as the existing regime was based on lack of solidarity between people. People were separated from each other and made dependent on the state. There was no sense of rubbing elbows or, even if there was any, it was subordinated to loyalty toward the state. The Central European popular movements juxtaposed loyalty to solidarity. All Central European movements where largely anti-Soviet (attempting not to copy the Soviet Union, demanding that Russian troops be removed etc.). They were ahead of us on economic and national issues. In the economic sector, this was due to the realization, after numerous attempts at restucturing the economy, that partial reforms were leading nowhere. The nationality issue did not have a high priority for Central European movements, and that for two reasons. First, there was no threat to national identity in these countries. There was practically no immigration, only emigration. Secondly, nationality had been made a legitimate part of the 70-year old Communist regime in Poland, Romania and some other countries, even though this was not emphasized. In contrast to the Central European countries, nationality was vital to us because, through it, we compensated for the lack of all other structures (our own state included). Besides, our old administration was clearly anti-nationalist and its goal was to suppress nationalism. This is why nationality became one of the key issues of our popular movements. By now, the popular movements of Central Europe have run their course, their goals have been met. The Communist satellite states have become independent states, with a developed civilian society. I think one of the reasons why the popular movements fell apart there was that the classical Western-European system of parties took hold rapidly. Locally initiated and in many ways amorphous popular movements were no match to the professional party machinery imported from the West, often at high cost. The intellectual elite, sustaining the popular movements, burned out fast. The popular movement was, after all, a movement for the intellectuals that was, at one point, joined by the people. It was this cerebral component that became both the strength and the weakness of the movement. Intellectuals, with their high self-esteem, have always been a poorly organized segment of a society, where everyone demands a right to one's individual conscience, and where there is no political guile, or arrogance. A popular movement is organized out of a sense of mission, a party is formulated with the idea of seizing power. A movement is headed by the intellectual elite of the nation, the parties are headed by professional politicians, often backed by a power-hungry mediocrity. The significance of People's Front, and the Baltic popular movements in general, was that they revealed the presence of massive opposition. A format was created that helped the opposition to organize and people to stick together, without running into direct conflict with the powers that be. It was essentially through the popular movement that opposition seeped into the society, itself striking a balance between legal and illegal. Secondly, with the advent of People's Front, new, public ground was broken in the society for sprouting other movements, groupings and factions. Up to that point, the regime had been based largely on fear. Thanks to the popular movements, people lost their fear of authority. It was that overcoming of fear that made it possible to break the Communist monopoly on power, to organize the first democratic elections in 1990, where the candidates of People's Front received the greatest number of votes. Thirdly, processes (IME [economic] project, disclosure of MRP [Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact] secret protocols, etc.) were initiated, without which the Baltic quest for independence would have remained incomprehensible, or seemed illegal, perhaps, even after the August coup of 1991. It was in this struggle that the general requirements for independence were met, forcing the Moscow regime to make some very clear choices after the August coup. Fourth, an example was given, along with some help, for starting other mass movements elsewhere in the Soviet Union. I am sure that people in different parts of the empire still recall the myths circulating about the emissaries of People's Front, who were feared, and had to be warned against. The activity of the Baltic popular movements made life for central authorities even more difficult, and thus increased the pressure bearing on them. Fifth, the popular movements in the Baltic countries served as a conduit of sorts between Moscow and Central Europe. Although this topic warrants a separate study, one can say with confidence that many new ideas and attitudes found their way across the Baltic countries. We had our share in helping the definitely democratic ideas of perestroyka get to Central Europe, and reform experiences from there to get back to Russia. We showed to the West that the Soviet Union was not the monolithic monster it seemed to be from far away. [24 Nov 93 p 2] [Text] The Fifth Congress of People's Front became the congress to end the movement. It generated a hankering for the unity and ideals of the past among one-time activists of People's Front, as they asked: Has the time really come? The principal goal of People's Front has undoubtedly been achieved--Estonia is a free state. At the same time, we cannot really say that Estonia has a civilized society, and a political system consisting of strong, democratic parties. To the contrary, development toward a civilized society seems to be thwarted. The parties are getting weaker, not stronger. More and more political decisions are being made outside the control of the public. We do not have a normal political life yet. In my opinion, the political development experienced so far, could be divided into three stages: The first of these was dominated by the politics of People's Front; the second by fictional party lines and simulation politics; and the third, which we are entering now, is ruled by unabashed money politics. This is the corporate period that signifies the lack of a public political life. The task of developing a civilized society is far from completed but, then again, completing this process would be outside the ken of the People's Front. This is because social stratification in Estonia (differentiation of wealth etc.) is taking place faster than the development of a civilized society. The Estonian society is no longer a swarm of bees. Five years ago, we were together, indeed, and could sense the movement of each other's wings. Now, the society has separated itself, groups have formed whose interests collide or are at odds with each other, hence what we have here and now is no longer the era of People's Front. A popular movement can be effective and successful only as long as no significant statification has occurred within the society, and as long as everybody is more or less poor, or making do on a modest scale. Once problems arise between owners and renters, employers and employees and other social groupings, the massive popular movements will no longer hold together. As more and more strength and energy is spent on settling internal conflicts, it will no longer be possible to maintain a coordinated policy. The policy of the popular movement becomes more vague and loses its attraction. The present condition of our society is also not conducive to maintaining People's Front because people lack the two necessary resources for participating in politics: They no longer have the time or the money to spare. To that are added political alienation and general fatigue. What next? It is not quite clear yet if our parties are an integral part of the universal structure of society, or merely a historical phenomenon we want to impose on our politics, in an effort to imitate the democratic countries. The parties of Western Europe were formed under circumstances that were different from what we have now. I think that in a society of mass consumption, the mentality of people is different, as are the ways in which the society is organized, and this is what makes a rapid process of forming classical parties unthinkable in Estonia. Right now, what we do is more of an imitation of political activity by means of parties, than the real thing. For our future political development, I can see three options. The first of them would preserve the political ambiguity for a long time, leaving everything up in the air, which is very similar to what happened in the 1920's. It will be like one Liviko scandal after another, with no end in sight. By the way, the current scandal of purchasing weapons from Israel is very similar to the affair of selling ships to Peru during the first Republic of Estonia. Back then, the ships were sold at an exceptionally low price. Now, the weapons were purchased at an exceptionally high price. One could presume that then, as now, someone pocketed the difference. By the year of 1934, the earlier of these events had lead to a dictatorship of corporations under the leadership of 'Isamaaliit' [Fatherland Alliance]. The second option would be to restructure the party system to match the emerging interest groups. By now, only three interest groups have organized themselves in our society: Lawful owners, farmers and, to some extent, pensioners. Yet to be organized are new owners, lease-holders, wage earners, renters and many other groups of people with common interests. The development of interest groups and their awareness is also hampered by the fact that there is no group solidarity. Those who make it, become haughty and separate themselves from others. It seems, however, that this is a passing phenomenon of property-based capitalism. I am afraid that most of today's parties lack the internal strength to renew themselves or to join with other parties. The first to wither will be those who do not have a clear long-term orientation to understand on whose behalf, and for whose benefit they function. They will be replaced by new political forces, who have a clearly established policy and a long-term socio-political orientation. Estonia's political landscape will be covered fully by three or four major parties that will eventually dominate. The third option covers factions that are not capable of developing into independent entities of political activity, and will rely on clans. The parties will be preserved in form only, while the actual decisions are made by the clan, who will command a sizeable portion of the society. To oppose that, sooner or later, a new democratic movement will emerge within Estonia's society. The way I see it, it will be neither leftist or rightist. It is more likely to be a general democratic movement, carried primarily by small property owners and less affluent groups who, because of lack of property, cannot have their say in the society otherwise. This would be a classic case of an anti-monopoly movement, demanding an effective anti-monopoly law, reorganization of banking, and funding to support private enterprise. These are only some of the possibilities for political development. At any rate, ending the activity of People's Front, does not end political activity in Estonia. I would like to thank all these thousands of people who, for the past five years, have been with People's Front and supported it who--in fact-- were the People's Front. To thank them for being the first to overcome fear in 1988. Only in retrospect does everything People's Front did back then seem so simple and so self-evident. But I am sure there were also those who preferred to hide in the bushes. But the bravest, the most enterprising and the most self-confident of them did join People's Front. To be involved in People's Front often meant putting aside one's own personal affairs. The only ones capable of doing that were those who saw the potential, who were not only thinking of themselves, but those who also thought of the fate of their fellow members and the whole society. I fully understand that many of them now feel that their job is done and that they are no longer needed. It is also a feeling of disappointment, in a way, because the subsequent course of events was always pictured a little differently than what we see now. But I think our job is far from being done. Five years ago, we had idealistic individuals joining the People's Front and these are the very same people who will now stand up to all kinds of clans and profiteers. There is no reason to think that the experience of People's Front will not be needed in the future. To the contrary. Looking at the latest EMOR surveys, one can see that People's Front enjoyed the most stable base of supporters within the Estonian society. Those who chose People's Front a year ago remember that, and would probably choose People's Front again today. People's Front had the most cohesive membership in Estonia's society and, even if someone did drop out on occasion, new strength would come from somewhere else. Completely new groupings are being formed. Recently, I got word from P�arnu that an organization has been formed there for the protection of renters. Such things are encouraging and show that specific interest groups are beginning to make their mark. And thus, the politics trying to represent them, will also be more successful. For the time being, the public does not yet know the individuals who will be heading the organizations for renters and rental agents, employers and employees, owners and lease-holders, and those dealing with consumer protection. The leaders who emerged during the 'singing revolution' are much better known. However, this situation is going to change very rapidly--new times and new problems will bring along new people to solve these problems. The People's Front has run its course, and closing it down on November 13 was the most natural thing to do. Every party will come to an end, eventually. And the period of People's Front in Estonia was a party--the party of political liberation. Liberation is always a party in the souls of people!
