Yakovlev made the remarks in a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Foreign Ministry officials said. Yakovlev also told Hata that pessimistic views abroad about Russia's situation following December 12 parliamentary elections are not true, the officials said. Hata told Yakovlev that Japan is closely watching developments around Russia's reforms, which he hopes will succeed, they said. Yakovlev was here to attend a trilateral meeting of academics, government officials and military brass from Japan, Russia and the U.S., which ended Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Hata met participants -- Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov, Gen. Andrey Nikolayev, head of the Russian Federal Border Service and Commander-in-Chief of the Border Forces and Col. Gen. Vladimir Zhuberenko, deputy chief of Joint Staff of the Armed Forces. Mamedov told Hata that the two-day gathering allowed the two nations to confirm common interests on broad international problems, the officials said. He was also quoted as saying that President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last September and the recent meeting boosted close dialogue and deepened bilateral ties. Mamedov welcomed Hata's visit to Russia, and Hata replied he wants to visit after studying results of bilateral working-level talks on a territorial dispute later this month in Moscow, they said.
