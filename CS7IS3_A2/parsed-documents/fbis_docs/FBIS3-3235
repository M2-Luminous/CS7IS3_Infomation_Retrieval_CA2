Ten CPPCC members took the floor to give their views on the country's major policies. Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, chaired today's meeting. Yang Rudai, Zhao Puchu, and An Zijie served as executive chairmen at today's meeting. Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat; State Councillor Peng Peiyun; and comrades in charge of ministries and commissions under the State Council took part in today's meeting. CPPCC member Fang Rongxin was the first to take the floor. On behalf of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, he called for stepping up efforts to carry out the population work to keep up with the development of the socialist market economy. He pointed out: To keep up with the development of the situation, we must resolve the population issue, and reform provides the fundamental solution. We must continue to uphold the target responsibility system in managing the population; strengthen grass-roots and basic construction in population management; perfect the population management network of rural townships and villages and urban neighborhood committees; and adopt different methods to improve the quality of our population to ensure long-term steady economic development. Member Zhu Guangya spoke on behalf of the China Association for Science and Technology, appealing to entire society to truly respect science. He said: According to survey, the phenomena of failure to respect science and talented personnel has become a factor obstructing the healthy development of socialist market economy and the building of spiritual civilization. This must arouse close attention of entire society and leading departments at all levels. He hoped that China's legal system would depend on and respect science; provide legal guarantee for scientists and technicians who publicize science, and popularize scientific knowledge, and bring fake and shoddy products and false advertisements into light so as to further develop the social trend of "respecting knowledge and professionally trained personnel." On behalf of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, member Li Ganliu offered a suggestion to Taiwan's Kuomintang: The best policy is to quit fantasizing, face the reality, change attitude, and sincerely accept the CPC's proposal, agree to conduct "three exchanges" with China, and hold talks with the CPC as early as possible. He said: As long as we reach a consensus on reunification of the motherland, can we resolve any problems by negotiations. He hoped that Taiwan's Kuomintang would give careful consideration to this suggestion, thus making decisions conducive to the nation, bringing about a bright future for Taiwan people, and writing a new chapter for our history. On behalf of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, member Jiang Jingbo spoke on strengthening democratic supervision, and bringing into full play the role of democratic parties in socialist democratic political construction. He said: Democratic parties in China share the glorious history of fighting side by side with the CPC. They also share the common object of struggle under the new historical period. As a result, a solid ideological and political foundation for the CPC-led multiparty cooperation system has thus been established. Cooperation implies supervision. We believed that the democratic supervision role of democratic parties would be brought into full play and China's socialist democratic political construction would continue to develop through perfecting the CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political consultative system. At today's plenary meeting, committee members, including Sun Han, Li Yongchang, Jin Xin, Qu Shijing, He Shengtao, and Li Zhensheng, spoke on strengthening cooperative economy in rural areas, on quickening agricultural development, on conducting publicity and education in Marxist view on nationality, on developing social sciences, on putting an end to the deterioration of our environment, and on popularizing agrotechnology. Chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Wang Zhaoguo, Hong Xuezhi, Qian Weichang, Hu Sheng, Qian Zhengying, Ding Guangxun, Dong Yinchu, and Sun Fuling attended the plenary meeting.
