During an interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, the old politician charged that Western governments -- without mentioning names -- are exerting pressure to accommodate in power Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the armed UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. Tsikata criticized the support some governments are still giving the Angolan armed rebel group that was defeated in the September 1992 first-ever multiparty elections considered valid and just by the United Nations. In another part of his conversation with the Cuban foreign minister -- who arrived yesterday in this city for an official two- day visit -- Tsikata regretted the tensions prevailing in Liberia, where Ghana has sent troops to contribute in the search for a political solution to the crisis in this West African state. Likewise, he encouraged the Nigerian leaders to prevent an outbreak of violence in that country.
