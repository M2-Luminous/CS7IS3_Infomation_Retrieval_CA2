FBIS4-34283 "drlat117_s_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-117 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 Uruguay Channel Dredging Notes Signed With Argentina Channel Dredging Notes Signed With Argentina PY1606232394 Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 11 Jun 94 p 1 PY1606232394 Montevideo EL PAIS Spanish BFN [Text] The two River Plate countries confirmed their geopolitical alliance on 10 June by signing notes on work to be carried out in the Martin Garcia channel, one of the two Parana River passageways to the Atlantic Ocean. The work involves the Martin Garcia channel's dredging, buoying, and subsequent maintenance. The notes commit Argentina and Uruguay to sharing equally a $107 million payment to open the channel. The governments still have two years to resolve their share percentages of future maintenance costs, which unofficially are estimated at $9 million. For almost three years, a strong "lobby" [preceding word in English] of Argentine grain growers pressed for Argentina not to fulfill its obligations with Uruguay concerning the Martin Garcia channel and finance work in the Emilio Mitre channel, the other Parana River passageway. Argentina's noncompliance would have been tantamount to disregarding the River Plate Treaty--signed by [former Argentine President] Juan Domingo Peron and [former Uruguayan President] Juan Maria Bordaberry in November 1973--on the management of the estuary and our country's river border. In a speech during the signing of the notes, President Carlos Menem evoked Juan Domingo Peron's figure as a champion of American integration and promoter of the 10 June action. For his part, President Lacalle stressed that the Martin Garcia channel work will allow linking Uruguay River ports with the rest of the world, and the river will be 32 feet deep. The work also will allow Nueva Palmira to become the waterway's entry port, linking the Atlantic Ocean with our continent's central region. Incidentally, Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who is interested in the waterway's future and was invited to the notes' signing ceremony, arrived in our country. The Uruguayan Government also invited three former [Uruguayan] presidents, Washington Beltran, Jorge Pacheco, and Julio Sanguinetti, to witness the ceremony and confirm that the signed notes are part of the state's foreign policy.
