What are the missions of the Danish Air Force today? [Fogh] The primary mission continues to be national defense within NATO, albeit with reduced forces. Even though no direct threat is visible any longer, no one knows what the future will bring. To be on the safe side, adequate defense resources must be kept in readiness in the event of a renewed threat; especially in the case of modern air forces, we cannot wait until they are needed and then try to create them overnight. The absorption of British and American reinforcement units in case of war likewise continues to be planned. Newly added is the mission of making resources available for out-of-area operations by NATO crisis reaction forces and for UN operations. Based on current plans, the Flyvevabnet will probably participate in the rapid reaction forces with one F-16 squadron. [Petersen] What practical effects have reductions had in the Danish Air Force? Are there any serious problems? [Fogh] No problems, but a lot of work to adapt the organization of the Air Force to the new realities. With the two Draken squadrons [formerly] in Karup, we lose two flying units, but all six operational bases of the Flyvevabnet will be retained. At least for the time being no base closures are planned. As compensation [for the loss of the two Draken squadrons], the Air Force flight school was moved to Karup in February 1993. To safeguard as many jobs in that region as possible, a civilian firm named Danish Aerotech is also being established there, which will take over facilities and personnel of the two deactivated squadrons. This firm will be charged with carrying out maintenance work for the Danish Air Force in the future. Additional savings are realized through the reduction in the peacetime manning of the eight Hawk squadrons by one-third, as well as by a reduction of the administration. [Petersen] Following the deactivation of the Draken, the Fighting Falcon is the only jet combat aircraft in the Danish Air Force. What steps are planned to upgrade the combat effectiveness of the Danish F-16? [Fogh] The production phase of the multinational midlife-update program begins in 1994 and includes a higher-performance radar system, a Beyond-Visual-Range capability, an improved self-defense capability, the installation of a GPS [Global Positioning System] and a new head-up display, as well as an improved cockpit layout. The Fighting Falcon will be operational until the year 2010/2015; its combat effectiveness is to be maintained in any case. In the Flyvevabnet, we must place the main emphasis on the quality of personnel and materiel, otherwise we will sink into a state of insignificance. An air force as small as ours cannot impress anybody by its number of aircraft alone.
