"The report is realistic in statements on the concerns of the Turkish side and on the continuation of negotiations," Denktas said. "However, the finger is still pointing to the Turkish side." Denktas answered questions of the press on the report of Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, which evaluates the shuttle talks held by his envoys with the Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders, on the confidence-building measures formulated by the United Nations. Denktas said that the original confidence-building measures contained arrangements which safeguarded the rights of both sides. "The changes made on the measures, gives priority and rights to Greek Cypriots and spoils the position of the Turkish Cypriot side," he said. Denktas added that the Turkish Cypriot side was ready to resume talks, to resolve the Cyprus issue. He stressed that Butrus-Ghali should not expect the Turkish Cypriot side to accept the `non-document document' of March 21, of Ghali, which modified the confidence-building measures package. "The promises which have been made to us, do not render our gains concrete," he said. "The second document is unacceptable to us in many points," he said. "If a message, which says, `I will put pressures on the Turks' is given, then why should the Greek Cypriots change its position?" He added that if an agreement is reached between the sides, the Greek Cypriots will be allowed to enter the currently uninhabited section of TRNC within four months, while Turks will be allowed in after 12 months. "What if Greek Cypriots violate the agreement meanwhile?" he asked. The UN-formulated confidence-building measures originally envisaged to place the Maras [Varosha] section of the TRNC under UN control and open the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport to international traffic. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey conducted a peace operation to the island following a Greek-backed coup attempt to annex the island to Greece. The TRNC came into existence in 1983.
