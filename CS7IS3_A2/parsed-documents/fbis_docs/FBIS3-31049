The country aggrieved by poverty and willfulness is about as close to stability as a pendulum clock. Regions that no one controls are forming regional "republics" like on an assembly line, and the new prime minister, Chernomyrdin, is proud of his nickname, "the Red Manager." In this situation, the report came that there is imminent danger of a halt in shipments of Russian crude oil. The drilling enterprises are said to be in debt up to their ears, allegedly through the fault of the "nonpayers" from among the former Soviet republics. A collapse of the Russian oilmen may result in a halt in the supply of energy raw materials also to the countries that otherwise pay properly. There is almost nothing one can educe from the traditionally contradictory comments by the central bodies, except perhaps endeavors that the "real culprits be punished." At exactly the same time, reports have been heard of intended talks between Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC]. A joint approach to the world market is to be the main topic on the agenda, and neither side makes any secret about their objective: to raise the price of oil while cutting production. It is clearer than the sun who would be hit hardest by such a play--the former communist countries that, in the framework of the economic superintegration COMECON [CEMA], have oriented themselves toward a single source of raw materials, the Soviet Union. "The inseparable friendship" of the past years condemned the Czech and Slovak Republics to the role of a beggar for Russian strategic raw materials. Other postcommunist countries of the Central European region, which are more or less dependent on shipments from Russia, find themselves in a similar situation. It is important that the post-November governments realized the danger implied by this situation. After all, nothing worse could happen to the Czech Republic than to get under the thumb of the Eastern neighbors. Therefore, it is vitally important for us to expedite the talks on the construction of the new Ingolstadt oil pipeline. The sooner it is completed, the better.
