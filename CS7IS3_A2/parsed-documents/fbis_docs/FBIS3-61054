Koshelev under rubric "Discussion Rostrum": "Organization of Combat Training (Problems of Improving Its Effectiveness)"] [Text] It is common knowledge that combat training is conducted on ships to train their crews to perform combat missions and keep ships in constant combat readiness, and it is the most important and determining thing in the life and activity of naval formations and units. But today, when the number of ships performing missions on long deployments has dropped considerably, the opinion has appeared that preventing a reduction in the personnel's level of training and in cohesiveness and combat readiness of ship crews and staffs has become the primary combat training mission.<sup> 1</sup> Such an approach to determining combat training goals appears too oversimplified to me. We know that the level of preparedness of any ship crew inevitably has inherent ups and downs, and there are many reasons for this: The commander was replaced, some of the personnel were discharged to the reserve, there was a significant interruption in operation because of repairs or a difficult ice situation, and so on. Consequently, it is more proper to consider the primary combat training mission to be to ensure a level of preparedness corresponding to the assigned combat readiness of the ship, unit or formation. Is it possible to perform this primary mission effectively today with the increasing understrength in personnel and the considerable scarcity of fuel, spare parts and other supplies? We will attempt to analyze the state of affairs in terms of certain fundamental requirements placed on the organization of combat training. First of all, high effectiveness of combat training is possible only when its organization is scientifically substantiated. The question arises: Why have there been no practical results to this day from work done by military academies and institutes on such a pressing problem? Finally, where is it possible to turn for training aids and theoretical recommendations for improving the effectiveness of combat training? New officers coming onto the Navy Combat Training staff and into local entities for directing combat training learn from their predecessors and, along with positive experience, also adopt their shortcomings. Neither military schools nor the Naval Academy train specialists along that line. This is difficult to do independently because of an absence of sufficiently developed methods aids. And the main normative document, the "Rukovodstvo po boyevoy podgotovke VMF" [Navy Combat Training Manual], developed in the early 1980's, declares only certain basic provisions and clearly is out of date. The very organization of the combat training process has stagnated and progress in improving it is very slight. Formation base exercises probably are the only innovation in recent years. Accounts and reports going to the Combat Training staff often remain ungeneralized as they return to the fleet in recommendations; moreover, they are not even reviewed. Then why are our accounts required? In 1988, who scientifically substantiated the need for setting up staffs of main specialists in combat training directorates and helped in their very difficult formation only to have this same staff planned for elimination five years later? As a result, dozens of first-rate officers, organizers of specialized training in the fleets, will be out of a job... For what reasons was the network of fleet training detachments resubordinated to the combat training directorate if other directorates will handle specialized training of navymen when the staff of main specialists is eliminated? The fact is we now do not even have such specialists as communicators, chemical warfare personnel, motor transport personnel, and so on who must organize basic military training. For example, who proved theoretically that a submarine needs 20-30 days to rehearse and pass a ship-type training task? Why not 10-40? But if this is substantiated, then how is one to explain the absence of new standards in connection with transition to a two-year term of service for draftees, the high personnel turnover caused by this, deterioration of their overall preparedness, problems in manning crews, the freeze on development of training facilities and so on? Of course, it is impossible to have rules for all instances in life, but fundamental, scientifically substantiated recommendations determining the organization of the system of personnel training measures in the fleets must be worked out regularly. Secondly, combat training effectiveness is achieved by high quality of planning, i.e., by compiling realistic, materially substantiated plans that are coordinated with plans for ship repairs and trials and with capabilities of assets for supporting combat training. To be sure, planning quality depends directly on the professional training, industriousness and initiative of staff officers of formations, large strategic formations and directorates. Nevertheless, it seems to us the reality of our plans is far from perfect often for entirely other reasons. Thus, annual plans for training command and control entities and fleet forces for each new training year are draw up and approved during October-November of the preceding year, but the actual plan of execution for ship repair goes to the fleet only during March-April, the practice missile ordnance limit during February-March, the plan for trials during January-February, and documents changing the fleet table of organization structure throughout the year. All this forces the leadership to regularly adjust already approved combat training plans, usually in the direction of their reduction, which dampens the ardor of staffs and crews and allows insufficiently responsible commanders to fulfill them incompletely or not on time. For example, 125 activities for the record (over 15 percent of the plan) were excluded from the Pacific fleet combat training plan or postponed to later dates in the winter period of the current training year. The entire training system suffers from this. If there is no thoughtfulness and constancy in it, there also will be no good results. We see a solution only in comprehensive planning of all fleet activity, but this does not appear possible at the present time above all because of unstable financing, uneven deliveries of fuel and other supplies, and problems connected with the call-up of young replacements. Thirdly, effectiveness of combat training is achieved because of constant monitoring of its course and of the quality with which missions are rehearsed and because of commanders' firm knowledge of methodologies determining the conduct of combat training measures. In my view, this thesis requires no special commentary. Everything depends only on ourselves, on personal organizational work of commanders in chief, commanders and staff officers at all levels. Behind each combat training violation stands a specific person and he must bear personal responsibility for this. But now as a rule responsibility is placed only on combat training directorate officers for omissions in combat training. And what is the level of leadership in combat training of the subordinates, for example, of the commander of a Pacific Fleet ship formation if neither he nor his deputies put to sea a single time in the winter training period? It turns out that directing the housekeeping activity of subordinates and organization of their everyday routine and so on is more in view than performance of combat training missions, which means that defining it as the principal form of fleet activity in peacetime is only a declaration. Fourthly, effectiveness of combat training measures depends on availability of modern means of supporting them and proper use of what is available. This too is a sore subject. We now lack not only modern guided surface and airborne (high-speed, small-size, low-flying) targets, but even a sufficient number of the old ones. The shortage of funds keeps us not only from producing new ones, but also from repairing damaged targets. To a certain extent it is possible to find a solution to the situation (and we are finding one) in additionally equipping written-off craft and vessels as naval targets, which is considerably cheaper than building new ones. But special financing is not provided even for these purposes, and using what are even at that miserly funds intended for ship repair hardly is advisable. Seventy percent of missile firings in the fleet were carried out against simulated targets in the winter training period, which inevitably leads to a drop in the training level of the fleet's ship crews and shore-based missile units. This problem cannot be resolved without special financing, otherwise it will be necessary to change criteria of personnel preparedness. Fifthly, combat training effectiveness cannot be raised without high quality of base training and full-fledged use of training facilities. In the last two years this matter has been given very careful attention both on the Navy Combat Training staff and in fleet directorates. Conduct of formation base exercises has become a system; they allow preparing ships and staffs for comprehensive performance of missions at sea and rehearsing interworking with ship, air and shore-based formations and units without expending materiel at authorized control stations, battle stations, and simulators. Positive examples of the effectiveness of formation base exercises are cited by Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and Chief of Navy Combat Training Directorate Vice Admiral A. V. Gorbunov in the article "And Still We Go To Sea."<sup> 2</sup> And if at times the return from exercises is not up to expectations, evidently this is above all the direct fault of the corresponding commander and staff. There are conditions for conducting formation base exercises in all formations; it is only a matter of the organizing abilities and personal preparedness of formation commanders. To improve the methodology and quality of formation base exercises, at the beginning of each winter and summer training period they are planned and conducted as demonstration exercises under the direction of commanders in chief of large strategic formations ("teachers also have to be taught"). But base training is not only and not so much formation base exercises; it is the training of each individual specialist, battle station, combat team and crew as a whole. It is impossible to organize it qualitatively without a modern training facility. Again the question rests on financing. Construction of a network of fleet training centers essentially has been frozen: Insignificant funds are allocated only for creating or renovating individual simulators. At the same time even the existing training facility is not being used effectively enough. It is difficult to change commanders' psychology with respect to full-fledged base training, which is the only thing capable of even partially compensating for the constant reduction in training of personnel at sea (although everyone understands that no base training will fully replace practice at sea). There are objective difficulties in organizing base training itself: The low personnel strength level of crews and the related need for constantly using them for fatigue duties, numerous details, searches for deserters and so on to the detriment of training; the lowered overall training level of draftees in connection with adoption of laws halting the call-up of students for military service; transition to a two-year term of service; and the unsatisfactory state of health of young replacements (every third draftee of the last levy is underweight, every fifth one is unfit for service afloat and so on). All these problems evidently can be solved by a transition to contract service, but for now this system of training has not been properly worked out, and generally this is a separate discussion. Sixthly and finally, combat training effectiveness depends on keeping weapons and technical equipment of ships in exemplary condition and on their timely, quality servicing and maintenance. This probably is the most difficult problem for the fleet. Financing of ship repairs is constantly being reduced. There is a growing number of ships whose operation is hampered and at the same time there is an increased likelihood of equipment breakdowns because of the expiration of time periods between repairs and between drydockings. There is also a growing number of ships being removed from the fleet order of battle exclusively because of the absence of funds for ship repair or modernization. The destruction of economic ties with many enterprises manufacturing arms and equipment which ended up in "nearby foreign countries" led to a restriction on or cessation of warranty servicing and repair of equipment and deliveries of spare parts, instruments and accessories. On the other hand, the drop in the personnel's level of specialized training leads to a growth in equipment breakdowns, which in turn leads to the need for additional repair expenditures. As a result, the reduction in the number of combat-ready ships and in their sorties to sea has a negative influence on morale in collectives: Discipline drops and criminal activities grow. Summing up what has been said, it is possible to dwell on two main, although possibly not indisputable, conclusions: 1. The level of preparedness of a significant number of ship crews to perform missions in accordance with their immediate purpose is steadily dropping. We can only slow this process by various organizational measures and by toughening demands and increasing responsibility at all levels, but the Navy is incapable of stopping it on its own. 2. Personnel proficiency will not correspond even to necessary combat training of fleet forces without capital investments in the creation of new naval assets and in the development of a system of basing, ship repair, training facilities and means of supporting combat training. But changing, simplifying or reducing preparedness criteria only creates an appearance of sufficiency of combat readiness, and it will be necessary to expend enormously more funds subsequently for its actual restoration as a result of this.
