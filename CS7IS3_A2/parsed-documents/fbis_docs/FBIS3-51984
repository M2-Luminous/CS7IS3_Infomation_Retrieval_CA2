I am speaking to the Cuban listeners of this station's live radio news program from the Convention Center where the Board of the Central American Commission for the Defense of Human Rights [Codehuca], a nongovernmental organization [ngo] with consultant status at the United Nations, is addressing the issue of human rights in Cuba. The chairperson of this commission read a document to reporters accredited to this Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting for Solidarity, Sovereignty, Self-Determination, and the Lives of our Peoples. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] 1. The commission strongly and categorically condemns and repudiates the U.S. blockade against Cuba as unjust, cruel, and inhumane, and because it represents an inexcusable violation of international law -- the international human rights law and the established precepts and rules for coexistence among nations. 2. It urges the U.S. Government to immediately comply with the resolutions of the UN General Assembly to end the economic, commercial, and financial blockade against Cuba. 3. It urges the United Nations to demand that the U.S. Government comply with its resolutions through established mechanisms, as it has done with resolutions affecting other nations. 4. It lauds the Cuban Government and people for their important achievements, successes, and transformations in spite of the suffering caused by the nefarious, protracted blockade. 5. It supports the worthy, exalted, patriotic struggle by the Cuban people and Government against the U.S. blockade, and its respect for international law. 6. It respectfully but strongly urges the nations and the people participating in this meeting to adopt vigorous measures and initiatives intended to strengthen solidarity their sister nation, Cuba, in its struggles and its dreams to build a more just, more humane, and more democratic society. The people of Jose Marti need and demand it. Their unfaltering struggle, their poignant sacrifice of so many years, and their unrenounceable hope deserve it. Respect for human rights means peace. [Signed] The Central American Commission for the Defense of Human Rights, Codehuca. Havana, 27 January 1994. [end recording]
