Badell's office, however, will remain alert in an effort to prevent the state security corps from committing abuses that could result from the suspension of constitutional guarantees. Badell said he is certain that the president adopted this measure because it was necessary. [Begin recording] [Badell] As well as all prosecutors, I am addressing the police and the security corps to ask them to respect the lives of the citizens and not to torture anyone. I am asking them to respect guarantees that cannot be suspended--guarantees such as the right to live and the right not to be tortured. [Reporter] Can you assure the nation that the de jure state has not ceased to exist in Venezuela, considering that six constitutional guarantees have been suspended? [Badell] Of course this is not the case. The de jure state remains in effect. Otherwise, we would not have what we have in the country. The de jure state remains in effect. Only some constitutional guarantees have been suspended. [end recording] The prosecutor general explained that although six constitutional guarantees have been suspended, this does not mean there is chaos in the country. He reiterated that his office continues to guarantee the security of the people. He noted that if any abuses are committed, appropriate punitive measures will be adopted.
