The meeting was initiated by Askar Akayev, who, judging from unofficial sources, acted as a kind of "peace refereee between the leaders of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. After Nursultan Nazarbayev came out with the idea of a Eurasian union in Moscow it was abruptly rejected by Islam Karimov, specifically during a news conference in Tashkent when Francois Mitterrand's visit was going on here. The Uzbek press severely criticized the neighboring state's leader: Having returned from Kirghizia, why did he, without consulting other participants in the trilateral treaty on a single economic area, propose that the old USSR be revived? Karimov observed, in particular, that on the shores of Lake Issyk-Kul they had agreed henceforth to act in a coordinated fashion before putting forward something within the CIS framework. In short, relations between Tashkent and Alma-Ata, which had cooled somewhat in recent weeks, were put right. The three Central Asian republics' presidents signed a communique saying that the three leaders had briefed each other on the sociopolitical situation in their countries and discussed a wide range of questions concerning the general situation in the region and CIS as well as a number of international problems. The main result of the talks which took place, the joint communique notes, was that Kirghizia acceded to the treaty on creating a single economic area which was previously concluded between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The trilateral treaty on a single economic area between Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, and Uzbekistan completely conforms to the provisions of the treaty on creating an economic union of CIS countries, and it is open to all CIS states to join it. At the same time further progress toward economic cooperation, the communique says, requires a more active and constructive mechanism for collaboration. The three Central Asian countries' presidents discussed specific measures to deal with the damage caused in Kirghizia during the current spring landslides, floods, and other natural disasters. Uzbekistan was the first to give the Kirghiz humanitarian aid by sending food, medicines, and tents. While the presidents are seeking new ways to cooperate and to deepen integration, the first days of May have found thousands of people in Alma-Ata with cold gas stoves -- Uzbekistan has yet again reminded Kazakhstan of its debt for the delivery of gas and has stopped supplies. This is in the capital, while in certain oblasts there has been no gas in homes for months. Serious problems have occurred in Kazakhstan with fuels and lubricants too -- at the moment in Alma-Ata fuel is being supplied only to vehicles ensuring the city's security and vital activities, the militia, the ambulance service, and other special services.
