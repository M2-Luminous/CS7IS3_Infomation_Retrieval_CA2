FR940620-1-00060 FR940620-1-00009 (c) Offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in computer software developed exclusively at private expense except for the software identified at 227.503&hyph;5(a) (3) through (6). (d) Offerors and contractors shall not be prohibited or discouraged from furnishing or offering to furnish computer software developed exclusively at private expense solely because the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose the software may be restricted. 227.503&hyph;2 Acquisition of noncommercial computer software and computer software documentation. (a) Contracting officers shall work closely with data managers and requirements personnel to assure that computer software and computer software documentation requirements included in solicitations are consistent with the policy expressed in 27.503&hyph;1. (b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible for identifying the Government's minimum needs. In addition to desired software performance, compatibility, or other technical considerations, needs determinations should consider such factors as multiple site or shared use requirements, whether the Government's software maintenance philosophy will require the right to modify or have third parties modify the software, and any special computer software documentation requirements. (2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for computer software or computer software documentation, data managers must balance the original assessment of the Government's needs with prices offered. (c) Contracting officers are responsible for assuring that, to the maximum extent practicable, solicitations and contracts_ (1) Identify the types of computer software and the quantity of computer programs and computer software documentation to be delivered, any requirements for multiple user at one site or multiple site licenses, and the format and media in which the software or documentation will be delivered; (2) Establish each type of computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered as a separate contract line item (this requirement may be satisfied by an Exhibit to the contract); (3) Identify the prices established for each separately priced deliverable item of computer software or computer software documentation under a fixed price type contract; (4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable item; and, (5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item. 227.503&hyph;3 Early identification of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, reproduction or disclosure. (a) Use the provision at 252.227&hyph;7017, ``Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions'' in all solicitations that include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.'' The provision requires offerors to identify any computer software or computer software documentation for which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and assertion to the offer. (b) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation'' permits a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional assertions of restrictions. The prescriptions for the use of that clause and its alternates are at 227.503&hyph;6(a)(1). 227.503&hyph;4 License rights. (a) Grant of license . The Government obtains rights in computer software or computer software documentation, including a copyright license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained by the contractor which developed the software or documentation or the licensor of the software or documentation if the development contractor is not the licensor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the software or documentation not granted to the Government. The scope of a computer software license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the software. Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions, restrict the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose computer software developed exclusively or partially at private expense (see 227.503&hyph;5 (b) and (c)). They may not, without the Government's agreement (see 227.503&hyph;5(d)) restrict the Government's rights in computer software developed exclusively with Government funds or in computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract. (b) Source of funds determination . The determination of the source of funds used to develop computer software should be made at the lowest practicable segregable portion of the software or documentation (eg., a software sub-routine that performs a specific function). Contractors may assert restricted rights in a segregable portion of computer software which otherwise qualifies for restricted rights under the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.'' 227.503&hyph;5 Government rights. The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or restricted rights. The standard license in computer software documentation conveys unlimited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014. In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.
