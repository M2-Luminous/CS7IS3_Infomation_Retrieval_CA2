FR940622-2-00102 FR940622-2-00077 Wednesday June 22, 1994 Part III Office of Personnel Management Request for Clearance of Information Collection To Replace SF 171, Application for Federal Employment; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 119 / Wednesday, June 22, 1994 / Notices OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT Request for Clearance of Information Collection To Replace SF 171, Application for Federal Employment AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), this document announces the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance of proposed job application procedures. These procedures would replace the SF 171, Application for Federal Employment, which is being discontinued as recommended by the National Performance Review. The proposed procedures described in this notice were recommended by an interagency task force. To allow time to implement the proposed procedures, OMB has approved an extension of the authorization of SF 171 and related forms through September 30, 1994. OPM has further requested that authorization for these forms be extended through December 31, 1994. The procedures proposed in this notice would take effect on January 1, 1995. OPM estimates that the public reporting burden to file a Federal job application would vary from 10 minutes to 240 minutes with an average of 40 minutes. OPM estimates that the public reporting burden to file the Declaration for Federal Employment would vary from 5 minutes to 60 minutes with an average time of 15 minutes. DATES: Written comments will be considered if received no later than July 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver written comments to Leonard R. Klein, Associate Director for Career Entry, Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415, AND Joseph Lackey, OPM Desk Officer, Officer of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Room 3002, Washington, DC 20503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Concerning the application procedures: Lee Edwards on 202&hyph;606&hyph;0830. Concerning the Declaration for Federal Employment: Kenneth Smith on 202&hyph;376&hyph;3800. Office of Personnel Management. James B. King, Director. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Summary of Process To Replace SF 171 The SF 171, Application for Federal Employment, has been the primary form used by individuals to apply for Federal jobs since 1968. However, the National Performance Review (NPR) recommended eliminating standard application forms, such as the SF 171, which is considered a barrier to attracting workers to the Federal service because it is long and complex. Therefore, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to replace the SF 171 with an approach that allows applicants to use a resume or other form of written application they choose. OPM and agencies need to collect information on education, work experience, and personal background that is necessary to determine an applicant's qualifications, eligibility, and fitness for Federal employment. OPM and agency authority to collect this information is primarily in sections 1104, 1302, 3301, 3304, 3320, 3361, 3393, and 3394 of Title 5, United States Code, covering employment in the competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service, including selection from among current and former Federal employees. To implement the NPR recommendation, OPM convened an interagency task force, representing 16 agencies, which recommended new application procedures described in this notice. OPM sought comments on implementing these recommendations from the National Partnership Council, the Interagency Advisory Group (personnel directors from more than 90 agencies), unions holding national consultation rights with OPM, and organizations representing major constituent groups. The resulting approach provides: •Alternative methods for agencies to collect information from job applicants (written, telephone, and automated techniques); •Applicant choices in how they submit written applications; •Two new optional forms and an information flyer for use beginning in 1995; and •The separation of qualifications and suitability information in applications. Temporary Extension of SF 171 and Related Forms 1. To allow sufficient time to implement the proposed application procedures, OMB has extended the authorization for the following standard forms through September 30, 1994, and is considering OPM's request for extension through December 31, 1994: SF 171, Application for Federal Employment (OMB Control No. 3206&hyph;0012) SF 171&hyph;A, Continuation Sheet for SF 171 (OMB Control No. 3206&hyph;0012) SF 172, Amendment to Application for Federal Employment (OMB Control No. 3206&hyph;0002 OMB also has extended authorization for a related form, the SF 61&hyph;B, Declaration of Appointee (OMB Control No. 3206&hyph;0182), through December 31, 1994. Proposed Procedures for Federal Job Applications 2. Overview The goal of these proposed application procedures is to make it easier for individuals to apply for Federal jobs and to present their qualifications in a manner they believe will enhance their job opportunities. At the same time, the proposal would provide methods for agencies to obtain sufficient information to evaluate job applicants. So that the public reporting burden may be reduced and agencies may better protect privacy of individuals by restricting access to more sensitive background data, qualifications information would be collected separately from suitability information. 3. Agency Options Agencies could request and collect applicant data electronically or through printed vacancy/examination announcements (and supplements to them), and paper resume/applications. Electronic media include (but are not liimited to) applications filed by telephone as well as data that applicants provide on computer scannable forms. (See paragraph 6 on agency specific forms for use with electronic systems.) Regardless of the method used, agencies would be authorized to collect necessary information of the type they currently collect from job applicants, for example: Identification, including name, address, social security number, date of birth, phone numbers. Job related qualifications, such as work experience, education, minimum college credits for professional positions, training, licenses, accomplishments, evidence of specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities.
