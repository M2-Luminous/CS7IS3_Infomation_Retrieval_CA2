FBIS4-19487 "drweu076__a94002" FBIS-WEU-94-076-A Daily Report 20 April 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs EU Calls For Immediate Cease-Fire in Gorazde EU Calls For Immediate Cease-Fire in Gorazde BR2004124794 Brussels RAPID Database in English 20 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR2004124794 Brussels RAPID Database English BFN [EC Document No. DOC/PESC/94/37: "Declaration on Bosnia"] [Text] The European Union [EU] condemns the continuing Bosnian Serb attacks on Gorazde in violation of UN Security Council resolutions and calls for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire in and around Gorazde and the pullback of Bosnian Serb forces which threaten the security of Gorazde. This will enable the deployment of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] forces to the town to take place. All detained United Nations' personnel should be released straight away and be allowed unrestricted freedom of movement in accordance with United Nations' resolutions. The humanitarian effort, the passage of which through Bosnian Serb-held territory is currently suspended, should be given unimpeded access to the people of Gorazde and more widely in Bosnia including to Sarajevo. The European Union invites the state members of the European Union which are members of the Security Council to support the adoption without delay of a binding resolution in support of these objectives. The European Union expresses its full support for the efforts of the special representative of the UN Secretary General and UNPROFOR commanders and confirms its support for Atlantic Alliance forces in their underpinning of United Nations action. It also pays tribute to the committed work of UNHCR and other volunteer agencies, which include many EU citizens, which continue their humanitarian mission despite the appalling difficulties that they face on the ground. The European Union calls upon those nations which have promised additional forces to the United Nations to ensure that they arrive in Bosnia quickly. A cease-fire in and around Gorazde is the first essential and the European Union calls upon the Bosnian Serbs to honour their word in the negotiations chaired by the United Nations. This should be followed quickly by a general cease-fire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. A general cease-fire would be a prelude to negotiations for a political settlement involving the whole of Bosnia. To this end the ministers also call for an intensified diplomatic effort by the international community, involving the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia to ensure the convergence of their initiatives and to bring about talks between the parties at an early date based on the European Union plan and taking into account the Washington accord and the talks on the Krajinas.
