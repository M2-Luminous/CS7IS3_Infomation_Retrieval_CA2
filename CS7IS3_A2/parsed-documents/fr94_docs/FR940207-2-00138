FR940207-2-00138 FR940207-2-00069 Third, the PSE has in place an adequate mechanism for providing for the exchange of the surveillance information necessary to adequately detect and deter market manipulation or trading abuses involving ADR options. Although the proposal does not require the PSE to have a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place with the foreign exchange on which the security underlying the ADR options trade, the Commission believes that this does not impair the ability of the PSE to detect or deter manipulation because the proposal requires that 50% or more of the trading activity in the underlying foreign securities occur in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission notes the proposal requires the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that constitute the U.S. ADR market to be members of the ISG, which will provide for the exchange of necessary surveillance information concerning trading activity in the ADR options, and the respective underlying ADR market. 17 17 See ADR Letter, supra note 4. As a general matter, the Commission believes that the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement that effectively permits the sharing of information between an exchange proposing to list an equity option and the exchange trading the stock underlying the equity option is necessary to detect and deter market manipulation and other trading abuses. In particular, the Commission notes that surveillance sharing agreements provide an important deterrent to manipulation because they facilitate the availability of information needed to fully investigate a potential manipulation if it were to occur. These agreements are especially important in the context of derivative products based on foreign securities because they facilitate the collection of necessary regulatory, surveillance and other information from foreign jurisdictions.
