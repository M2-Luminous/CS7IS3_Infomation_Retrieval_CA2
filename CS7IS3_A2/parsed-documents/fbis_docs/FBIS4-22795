In such a miserable little bowl--real gold extracted by our poverty-stricken super-rich. It is an eternal absurdity. And, it seems, for Russia a rather characteristic one. There is a way out of this pathetic situation. Strictly speaking, there are two ways out. The first--to demand attention from the state, or more precisely, money. The second--to sell ourselves to someone richer. And as soon as possible. The truth lies, as it should, somewhere in between. Or perhaps it lies somewhere entirely elsewhere. In the sphere of common sense. [End boxed material] Finally, almost for the first time, the interests of the Center and the territories have coincided in their intentions to "unseal" the Sakhalin shelf oil deposits. At the very end of 1993, the "negotiations marathon" finally reached the home stretch. Representatives of the Russian Government and major foreign firms interested in developing the oil and gas deposits of the Sakhalin shelf participated in it for many months. Literally in the course of one week, the preparation of key documents was completed in Moscow, and part of them were even signed. Among them were several international investment projects whose scope and proposed influence on the domestic economy are simply astounding. It is enough to note that by the summer of last year, when the negotiations on the Sakhalin off-shore deposits were in full swing, the overall volume of foreign investments in Russia comprised around $7 billion, according to the data of the Russian Government itself. And now let us compare. Three foreign consortia whose membership includes such well-known companies as "Shell," "Texaco," "Exxon," "Mobil" and others, intend to invest a sum of approximately $8-$10 billion in direct investments alone in the development of a relatively small area of the coastal zone of Sakhalin (around 17,000 square kilometers). Without a doubt, the oil business is in no way reminiscent of the Western humanitarian aid to which we have already become accustomed. The foreign partners expect to realize profits in the billions here. And, we might add, with good reason. The development of five deposits and the geological survey of three prospective areas of the Sakhalin shelf open up access to a considerable and hitherto untouched storehouse of hydrocarbon raw material in a geographically favorable region. The reserves of only a few of the deposits which have already been confirmed here are estimated at about 252 million tonnes of oil (volumes which are fully comparable with the annual export of the entire former USSR) and more than 1.5 trillion cubic meters of gas. Thus, in literally a few years, Sakhalin will be able to offer its closest foreign neighbors specifically that which they will acutely need. We know, for example, that by 1996 there will be a shortage of gas in South Korea in a volume of approximately 4 million tonnes of RNG (rarified natural gas), while the guaranteed sale on the world oil and gas market, under the current conditions, is valued at no less than the raw material itself. Naturally, by granting our partners in developing the shelf these concessions which are unprecedented in their technical-economic parameters, we too will not be the losers. For example, within the scope of the "Sakhalin-2" project, up to 70 percent of the work is to be performed through our own efforts with the use of domestic building materials and structures. Moreover, the representatives of the VPK [military-industrial complex] are already formulating a list of enterprises which expect to stay afloat in the whirlpool of conversion with the aid of the unexpected currency orders. Within the scope of the oldest project, "Sakhalin-I," the Japanese-American consortium has agreed to "forgive" the former debt of the union government which took credits for the exploration of the current deposits. And, if you add the interest which has accumulated over the elapsed decades, the sum turns out to be quite significant even by all-state standards--around $300 million. Finally, according to the results of the competition for the "Sakhalin-2" project which has just been concluded, the winners were companies which guaranteed that they would invest no less than $473 million in the search for oil and gas in the northeastern end of Sakhalin over the next six years. And, naturally, with the successful realization of all three projects, Russia will get a share of the extracted raw material, and its budget will be replentished by the appropriate taxes and bonuses granted in such cases--uncompensated payments by the foreign companies to the country owning the deposits. The packet of Sakhalin projects has already been nicknamed the "second BAM [Baykal-Amur Main Line]" by Far East residents. And this is quite understandable. With the start of development of the first off-shore deposits in the Sea of Okhotsk, one of the most remote regions of Russia which has been shortchanged in a social and economic respect will receive a strong impetus in the development of its infrastructure. It will get thousands of additional jobs, the latest Western technologies and even entire enterprises for the drilling and primary processing of the raw material. Hope has appeared also for reducing the shortage of power resources which has traditionally existed here. After all, every year it is necessary to bring up to 19 million tonnes of oil and petroleum products to the Far East from the western regions of the country, and the interruptions of heat and power supply in many local cities have already become a sad tradition. The heads of several Far Eastern administrations and mayoralities quite reasonably expect to replentish the local budgets from various concessions payments. The oil dollars may be used to build a hospital, to reconstruct an ageing airport, or to extend new automobile roads and high voltage transmission lines... The hold-up, specifically, centers around a minor matter. After many years of negotiations and discussions over the fate of the off-shore projects, in which almost everyone was involved--from the rank-and-file deputy of a taiga rayon soviet to three presidents: The presidents of South Korea, the USSR, and then Russia--it finally became clear that we do not yet even have any legislation regulating mutual relations with foreign companies in such large-scale undertakings. The law on concessions which was prepared at one time never reached the stage of a final reading in the former Supreme Soviet. Nevertheless, we cannot do without the legislative formulation of conditions and forms of concessions which are unified for the entire country. The deposits of strategic raw materials are present not only in the Far East, and the foreign companies which are prepared to develop them, as a rule, strive to gain various benefits and guarantees for themselves during the negotiations. For example, the representatives of the Russian Government have already promised the international consortium MMMShM (unifying the corporations "McDermott-Marathon-Mitsubishi-Shell-Mitsui"), which aspires to the "Sakhalin-2" project, that it would be exempted from payment of all taxes with the exception of the tax on profits and "royalties." The consortium "Sodeco-Exxon" ("Sakhalin-I project) has been offered another benefit: The right to develop an additional, third by count, deposit in Arkutun-Dagi without the competition which is traditional in such cases. Naturally, other investors are also presenting their conditions. But, you must agree, such "indulgences of the capitalists" will not evoke great happiness among part of the deputies of the new parliament. And this means that the "second BAM" itself may be considered a convenient pretext for rather heated polemics in the country's supreme legislative body, in the course of which not only the government may suffer, but the projects themselves. We might add that some of the foreign investors in the Sakhalin projects, who have become disenchanted with the omnipotence of the presidential edicts, are inclined to wait for adoption of a new law... Then again, even before the adoption of new legislation, the "second BAM" is capable of bringing both pleasant concerns and considerable profit. For example, the upcoming cooperation with the foreign firms provides for one other mandatory condition: Within a period of five years, they must transfer the sum of $100 million into a specially created Fund for the Development of Sakhalin. Whether we like it or not, we must agree with one of the participations in the negotiations on the shelf projects: Something akin to the Sakhalin United Emirates might just arise in the insular oblast.
