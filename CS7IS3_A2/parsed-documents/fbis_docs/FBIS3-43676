The ship, called [name indistinct], was registered as carrying agricultural equipment, but tanks were seen on board. The British authorities are now checking the ship's documentation to decide whether a license will be needed. The canvas covers did not manage to disguise the cargo, including tanks and artillery weapons believed to have been made in Russia and to be on their way to Angola.

Now the British authorities must make sure that those weapons are not meant for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which is facing a UN arms embargo. The Angolan Government's army is mainly equipped with war materiel made in the former Soviet Union and it is no longer under an arms embargo. In any event, it needs a (?transit) license, which appears not to be among the documentation. The authorities must establish the source, the destination, and the use that will eventually be made of the war materiel. [passage omitted]
