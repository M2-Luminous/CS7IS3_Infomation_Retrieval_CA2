[Chong Chong-uk] Apart from the five facilities, including the eight megawatt-class atomic reactor; critical reactor [imgyero]; semi-critical reactor [chunimgyero]; the plant producing nuclear fuel rods; and the storehouse for nuclear fuel rods that have received regular [chonggi] inspection; and two other facilities, including the five megawatt atomic reactor and the radio-chemistry laboratory, which have aroused doubts concerning it being a nuclear reprocessing facility by Western countries, are to be inspected. In particular, an agreement for supplementing inspection of each facility will be concluded for the two facilities that did not receive regular inspection. [Reporter] How do you assess the North's acceptance of the nuclear inspection? [Chong] It is fortunate that North Korea made such a decision. If an agreement for inspection had not been reached, North Korea's nuclear issue would have been handed over to the UN Security Council. Also, regardless of our side's position to continue dialogue, the situation would have moved toward sanctions against North Korea. It is fortunate that the possibility of handing over North Korea's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council has been eliminated. However, this does not mean that nuclear transparency will be guaranteed through the upcoming inspection. [Reporter] What are the remaining problems? [Chong] Working-level contacts for the exchange of special envoys will take place with the inspection team's visit to the North. Through the inspections, the continuity of safeguards that the facilities had not been transformed for military use should be proven and working-level contacts should successfully develop so meaningful dialogue can be exchanged. After that, the rest of the problems, including the guarantee of transparency of undeclared facilities, will be discussed at the third round of the U.S.-North Korea talks. [Reporter] Do you think the acceptance of inspection constitutes a great sea change in North Korea's external policy? [Chong] I think it is neither a great sea change nor a minor change. There are still many problems and obstacles that we have to overcome. Nevertheless, I think a meaningful breakthrough has been made for the resolution of the nuclear issue. We have avoided the stage of sanctions and the special envoy exchange between South and North Korea is now possible. The scope of dialogue is wide open. [Reporter] What do you think North Korea has gained by accepting inspection? [Chong] It has avoided being referred to the UN Security Council. I think the policy was adjusted on the occasion of Kim Chong-il's birthday. (On this point, other Chongwadae authorities feel it is because North Korea could not explain to its people that international sanctions were imposed on Kim Il-song, the hero of the chuche idea, of which North Korea was most afraid). [Reporter] What will happen to the Team Spirit exercise? [Chong] The question of its suspension will be decided in connection with the IAEA nuclear inspection and the discussion between South and North Korea regarding the exchange of special envoys. The timing of the announcement could be somehow different. [Reporter] What is the president's opinion? [Chong] The talks between the IAEA and North Korea began at 6 pm in Vienna on 15 February. More than one round of talks were held. The president received continuous reports in the evening and early morning. The president has thoroughly and concretely taken care of the nuclear issue. [Reporter] Did Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's activities during his U.S. visit help the resolution of the issue? [Chong] It was very timely. Judging that the rumor of the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula was agitating North Korea, the president had the foreign minister visit the United States on 9 February, earlier than the 13 February original schedule. Minister Han's persuasion of U.S. journalists and coordination of positions with high-ranking policymakers was very helpful. [Reporter] Kim Il-song reportedly proposed a meeting with President Clinton through Reverend Billy Graham, who recently visited the North. [Chong] We are well aware of the contents through close consultation with the United States. The reports are not exactly true. I cannot reveal further. [Reporter] What do you think of the visit to North Korea by Representative Ronald Dellums, chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee? [Chong] He received the invitation from North Korea last year. He may convey a verbal message from President Clinton, but there will be no personal letter as far as I know. He is not a government official so he will not negotiate, but will convey the existing U.S. position. [Reporter] Were there any signs that North Korea would accept nuclear inspections? [Chong] The remarks by a spokesman of North Korean Foreign Ministry last week said the nuclear issue would be resolved through dialogue. From that point we could interpret that the previous stance on inspections would be changed. In addition, there had been indirect communication between the United States and North Korea, and the IAEA and North Korea, although I cannot give further details.
