Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), was reacting to claims that one cabinet member was "having difficulties with screening certificates." The 1991 Czechoslovak screening (or "lustration") law debars former Communist Party officials, agents of the StB secret police and People's Militia members from high political and economic posts until 1996. Carnogursky said the government did not intend to change the screening law, adding that the government would deal with the question of the alleged positive screening of one of its members very soon. "The screening certificates of all members of the government will be available within the next two weeks," said Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of parliament and chairman of the National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA). He stated that new screening certificates, issued by the Slovak Information Service so as to be incontestable, were required for all cabinet members. Carnogursky said he did not know which cabinet member was said to be having problems with screening. He said the coalition council had set up a working group that would make recommendations on how the screening law would be implemented in Slovakia. Both Carnogursky and Cernak confirmed today that their candidates for the autumn parliamentary elections would have cleared the screening process.
