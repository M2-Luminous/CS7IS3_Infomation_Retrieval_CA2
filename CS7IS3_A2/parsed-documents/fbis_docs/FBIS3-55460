The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters reports that in fact the Azerbaijani National Army's renewed large-scale offensive along the Karabakh-Azerbaijan conflict line has again failed. According to preliminary reports, Karabakh Army units basically maintained their defensive positions during fighting which has been taking place all along the front line since the early hours of 7 January, and in certain sectors they even launched counterattacks and ousted the enemy from the captured positions. There are dead and injured on both sides. Casualty figures are being determined, but the losses suffered by Azerbaijani side are several times greater. The battles were still continuing as of 1200 today.
