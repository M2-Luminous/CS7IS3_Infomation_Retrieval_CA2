Black market traders in Beijing were Wednesday buying dollars for up to 8.87 yuan, compared with Tuesday's close of 8.696 yuan on the so-called "united market," comprising five swap markets linked earlier this month by computer ahead of a planned nationwide exchange beginning April 1. Banks were meanwhile offering just 8.48 yuan to the dollar. Until the end of February, the rate on the street had closely tailed the swap market -- which has hovered around 8.7 yuan to the dollar since the unification of the country's dual currency system on January 1. "There are lots of people wanting to buy now and there's not enough dollars," one black market trader said.
