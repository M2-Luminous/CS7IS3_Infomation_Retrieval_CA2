This was stated by PLO representative in Brussels Shawqi Armali during a meeting with Israeli Ambassador to Belgium Victo Har'el on Thursday monrning. The meeting was organized by the Belgium-Israel section of the Interparliamentary Union. Mr. Har'el asked the Palestinians "to overcome the grief caused by the Hebron massacre and to not allow this tragedy to interfere with the progress made in the peace negotiations." "If we stop the negotiating process now, we will play into the hands of the extremists, of all those who want to maintain a war situation in the territories," Har'el added. Before discussing the measures taken Friday by the Rabin government (disarming the extremists, setting up an investigating commission, and releasing approximately 1,000 Palestinian prisoners), the Israeli ambassador declared that "disarming the settlers is not conceivable because they must have the means to defend themselves." Mr. Armali agreed that "the grief must be overcome and the repetition of such a massacre must be avoided. The measures taken by Rabin are not sufficient, however. The settlers must be disarmed." Har'el and Armali warned that disenchantment is taking hold among the Israeli and Palestinian peoples in view of the delay in implementing the Oslo and Washington agreements in the territories. "Public opinion on both sides is awaiting tangible signs of these agreements. People should see a change," Har'el added. "Oslo was only the beginning of a long process. The negotiations may yet be long and difficult, but peace is at the end of the tunnel," the Israeli ambassador concluded.
