In the annual economic report, a growth rate of 0.5 to 1 percent is projected. But a further increase in unemployment by 400,000 is expected. At present, some 6 million people in Germany are without a private-sector job. Despite this dramatic employment situation, there is no willingness in Bonn or Frankfurt to take effective measures to promote growth. The Bundestag Budget Committee saddled the federal finance minister's austerity budget with an additional 5 billion German marks [DM] and, against this background of weak growth and poor employment prospects, the Bundesbank states that "at the moment and in the foreseeable future" it does not want a change in its policy of stability. So, must the 6 million people without a regular job resign themselves to their fate, and must many of the (still) employed continue to fear for their jobs? This is not inevitable, economically. The economic and finance policy tools still contain possibilities to strengthen the presently hesitant economic growth in such a way that, in the medium term, a noticeable reduction in unemployment is also attainable. For that, only a few financing taboos must be broken, and the wage policy must be released from its role as scapegoat. Depreciation relief, innovation and capital assistance are useful tools for improving economic development, but their application depends on the general economic and business climate. The means for promoting growth include one tool that always works: Strengthening and accelerating public investments which lead directly to an increase in orders in the construction industry, in machine and systems building, in measurement and control technology, and in building commercial vehicles. There are plenty of projects to improve the infrastructure, the environment, and employment which must be carried out urgently: - Despite increasing congestion on the German autobahns, extension of rail traffic is progressing only slowly; the rolling stock and the rail network of the Reichsbahn [east German railway] in particular must urgently be modernized and enlarged--but at Deutsche Waggonbau AG (one of the few productive east German enterprises), only 7,000 of 25,000 jobs still exist. - The installation of equipment to reduce air and water pollution progresses slowly, and the clean-up of toxic soils is done predominantly through job-creation measures (which continuallay under go cuts)-- while, at the same time, production and personnel capacities in machine and systems building are under-utilized. - In united Germany there is a need for 2.5 million additional housing units, and in the new laender there is enormous demand for the rehabilitation of cities and housing--but in December 1993, almost 110,000 construction workers were unemployed. These are measures, easily multiplied, which must be implemented in the coming years if environmental stress is to be reduced, the transportation grid is to be improved, and the creation of slums is to be averted. Faster tackling of these projects would not start an "economic flash in the pan," but rather would trigger employment-effective growth which would also strengthen smaller businesses via more effective infrastructure. The under-utilized production capacities and the reserve of unemployed workers would limit tendencies toward price increases. The question of financing remains difficult, but it is not unsolvable. Despite the frighteningly steep increase in public indebtedness in the past four years, united Germany was fifth from the bottom on the list of public debt ratios (in percentage of gross national product) among 19 OECD countries; public debt in the United States and in Japan (economically so admired here) was more than one-third higher. The German capital market would be rich enough for additional credit financing of public investments, but the interest payments present great problems. These problems could be resolved through new regulations by the Federal Government and the Bundesbank: - The Bundesbank will transfer over DM18 billion to its owner, the Federal Government. Of this amount, only DM7 billion are earmarked for the 1994 budget; the remaining DM11 billion are to be used for debt repayment. This stipulation from the 1980's is economically obsolete in 1993/94. In the deepest postwar recession, not yet overcome, the repayment of old debts is not a priority. [sentence as published] To use these funds to ease the interest burden of debt-financed investments and/or as investment subsidies to laender and communities would make more sense with regard to employment and stability. Only by reducing unemployment can one avert hindering future consolidation efforts because of diminshed revenues caused by the economic situation. One hundred thousand fewer unemployed bring a DM3.5 billion relief to public finances. - The Bundesbank should not have to balance its books according to the lowest cost principle because of regulations oriented toward protecting creditors. It has no creditors to be protected but, because of this regulation, it has accumulated "hidden reserves" in the amount of DM60 billion to DM70 billion. A gradual market evaluation would free up large amounts for investment financing, without any risks. Alternative: Introduction of a time-limited levy on private capital assets, analogous to the 1949 levy on mortgages and profits from credits, raised to finance the "immediate assistance law." In economic terms, it would make better sense to stabilize the Bundesbank profits through appropriate use.
