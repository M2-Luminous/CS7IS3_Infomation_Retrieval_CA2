He said in any circumstances Moldova will remain true to civilized compromise aimed at the formation of an open system of local, regional, global, and collective security. In Snegur's opinion the example of resolving the conflict in East Moldova (the Dniestr [Dniester] River valley) is convincing proof that in such situations only talks and compromise can guarantee success. However, the president is convinced that the effectiveness of the policy of compromise largely depends on the stage of a conflict. He said the aggravation of the situation in southern regions with a predominantly Gagauzi population as well as in the east was caused by extremely politicized declarations in which political leaders were not always sincere or consistent. According to Snegur, the Moldovan leadership did much to resolve the problems of those regions by peaceful means. A solution acceptable for both sides was found for Gagauzi regions, he said. Snegur told the conference that the region would be given a special legal status based on a high degree of self-determination and the sharing of powers with the central government. He announced that the approach was supported by the Council of Europe, the CSCE and conformed with plans of switching to a new system of territorial division of Moldova. IF Note: The draft law agreed upon with the Moldovan leadership was signed on 27 May by the president and speaker of parliament of the Gagauzi Republic and submitted to the president and speaker of parliament of Moldova. On 9 June it was approved by the Gagauzi parliament and sent to the Moldovan parliament. On Monday, the leadership of the self-proclaimed Gagauzi Republic accused the Moldovan government of distorting the draft law. The Gagauzi president and speaker of parliament Stepan Topal and Mikhail Kendigilian issued a statement saying that contrary to the agreement a Moldovan parliamentary committee altered the document. They called the move unilateral and unprecedented and claimed that it could not have been made without the knowledge and consent of President Mircea Snegur and speaker of parliament Petre Luchinski. The statement calls for stopping the parliamentary debate on the distorted document and demands a meeting with the Moldovan leadership with the mediation of the CSCE mission. Gagauzi leaders placed the entire responsibility for the possible worsening of relations on the Moldovan leadership.
