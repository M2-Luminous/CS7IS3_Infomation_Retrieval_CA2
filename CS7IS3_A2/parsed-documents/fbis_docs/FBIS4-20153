In 1992 the company had reported a loss of 3.266 billion francs. The results for 1993 included a provision of 1.8 billion francs to restructure the company. The board delayed a decision on the sale of its majority holding in the Meridien hotel group, the company said. It had decided to "accept the view of the privatisation commission to choose between the two bids which had been retained." These bids are from the British Forte group and from the French Accor company. Air France is believed to have debts of 37 billion francs, analysts here noted, and is struggling to survive its massive losses. Restructuring of the company is linked to liberalisation of the French air transport industry which was taken a step forwards on Wednesday when the commission of the European Union found in favour of a complaint by the French TAT airline against the French government. TAT, of which British Airways (BA) owns 49.9 percent, obtained an instruction from the Commission to the French Government that it must open Orly airport south of Paris to flights to Toulouse and to London. BA said that this effectively opened Orly to other airlines. The French Government wants to inject 20 billion francs into Air France and has said that half of this sum could be provided this year if the EU Commission approved it under competition law. The Commission, in approving a takeover by Air France of the French airline Air Inter in 1990, had laid down as a condition that France should open its markets gradually to more competition from within the European Union. The French Transport Ministry said late on Wednesday that it would appeal to the European Court of Justice against the decision about Orly. The decision would entail "serious consequences, by opening the whole French internal network to competition without a transitional period," it said.
