Following a talk with Yeltsin in Bonn today, Scharping said the German Government bears sole responsibility for the unncessary irritations which have arisen. The SPD has from the beginning insisted on a "worthy" farewell for the troops in Berlin. The talk at the Petersberg near Bonn was also attended by North-Rhine Westphalia Premier Johannes Rau (SPD), and SPD Bundestag group leader Hans- Ulrich Klose. Scharping accepted an invitation from Yeltsin to visit Russia. An appropriate date for the visit still has to be discussed. Scharping said that in his talk with Yeltsin he referred to the special importance of the "good" German-Russian relations. It is important for other Western states to become as strongly involved in Russia as the Federal Republic to lend support to Yeltsin's policy of political and economic reform. The SPD leader described economic relations between the two countries as "capable of being developed." He cited as examples the scientific, research, and technology spheres. Yeltsin stressed that his country wants to be a partner with equal rights in international organizations. Yeltsin will also meet this morning with Theo Waigel, CSU [Christian Social Union] chairman and federal finance minister. Afterward, Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl will set off on a tour of the Palatinate district. The two politciains are to visit Speyer Cathedral this afternoon. Yeltsin has also been invited to Kohl's home in Ludwigshafen-Oggersheim. Yeltsin will go to Baden-Wuerttemberg tomorrow, the third and final day of his visit to Germany.
