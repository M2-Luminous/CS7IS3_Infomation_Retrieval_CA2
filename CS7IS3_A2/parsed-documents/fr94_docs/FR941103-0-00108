FR941103-0-00108 FR941103-0-00016 RSPA authorized this alternative leakage test in the June 12, 1989 final rule published under HM&hyph;183 to relieve burdens of duplicate test requirements for cargo tanks intended for use in locations where, based on established standards of air quality, EPA has decided that release of gasoline vapors constitutes a hazard to the environment. TTMA stated that a cargo tank motor vehicle manufacturer may not know the local air pollution requirements to which the motor vehicle may be subject. RSPA recognizes TTMA's concerns and is permitting this alternative test when a cargo tank is equipped with vapor recovery equipment without qualification regarding the materials transported. RSPA also has revised paragraph (c) and ยง180.407(h)(2) to reference appropriate acceptance criteria in EPA's regulation contained in 40 CFR 60. Section 180.403 Commenters supported the proposal to add a definition for the term ``replacement of a barrel.'' TTMA recommended that, in the definition of ``replacement of a barrel'' the wording ``unused tank'' should be clarified to mean a ``new tank.'' RSPA agrees and the word ``new'' is added parenthetically after the word ``unused.'' Commenters also supported the proposal to revise the definition of rebarrelling. However, for the reasons contained in the preamble discussion for ยง180.413 the proposed revision is not being adopted in this final rule. A commenter recommended that the definition of ``repair'' be modified to include the replacement of components such as valves, vents and fittings. RSPA believes this suggested change would be confusing because a ``repair'' is specifically defined to mean ``any welding done to the cargo tank wall to return it to the original specification or a later equivalent specification.'' Replacement of valves, vents and fittings is considered maintenance. Therefore, the current definition is retained. Section 180.405 Minor editorial changes are made in subparagraphs (f)(1)(iii) and (f)(4) as proposed in the NPRM. In paragraph (g)(2), RSPA proposed to clarify that fittings and devices mounted on a manhole cover are part of the manhole assembly and must meet all performance standards required for the manhole cover. A commenter stated that the current requirement is adequate and recommended that RSPA not adopt the proposed change. The commenter stated that any concern or problem is due to a lack in verifying the continued proper securement of these fittings and devices to the manhole cover. The commenter said that the annual leakage test and inspection requirements in ยง180.407 should be sufficient to assure that these in-service fittings and devices remain securely mounted and properly sealed on in-service manholes. RSPA agrees with the commenter and the proposed changes are not adopted in this final rule. Another commenter recommended that paragraph (g)(2)(i) be revised to add ``month and year'' to the certification marking on manhole assemblies. Although RSPA believes that such a requirement may have merit, an opportunity should be provided for public comment; therefore, it will be considered in a future rulemaking action. Paragraph (h) specifies that replacement for any reclosing pressure relief valve must be capable of re-seating to a leak-tight condition after a pressure surge. Section 180.405(c) authorizes modifying the reclosing pressure relief valves of an MC 306 cargo tank by installing the dual function pressure relief valves which are required for DOT 406 cargo tank motor vehicles. Commenters pointed out that this replacement could result in an MC 306 cargo tank having lower emergency venting capacity than its specification requires; because it is difficult to produce a valve that achieves the comparatively high flow rates of the MC 306 units, withstands the pressure surges specified in the DOT 406 specification, and recloses with minimal loss of lading. A reduced flow capacity is less likely to be encountered in fitting an MC 307 with a DOT 407 valve replacement, and in fitting an MC 312 with a DOT 412 valve replacement, because of the larger pressure differentials which are commonly used in these cargo tanks. Regardless of the equipment installed, the venting requirements specified in the particular cargo tank specification must be met whenever a pressure relief valve is replaced. For this reason, in this final rule, RSPA is authorizing replacement of defective MC 306 pressure relief valves with new or refurbished MC 306 pressure relief valves until August 31, 1998. After this date, any valve replacements must be the surge resistant pressure relief valves required for DOT 400-series cargo tanks. This allows three years for implementation of this safety approvement.
