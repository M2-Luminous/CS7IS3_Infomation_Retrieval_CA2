Today, the Seimas endorsed the law passed in December. This document was returned by President Brazauskas to the Seimas to reconsider. It was stated in his decree that some norms of the law did not correspond with the principle of establishing market economy. The government diktat, legalized by this law, to all agricultural producers, irrespective of the form of their ownership, was the most unsuitable to the president. The law, among other things, provides for quotas of the purchase of agricultural products, fixed by the government, to all enterprises processing agricultural products. According to the constitution, the law repeatedly passed by the Seimas, must be signed by the president within three days and announced without delay.
