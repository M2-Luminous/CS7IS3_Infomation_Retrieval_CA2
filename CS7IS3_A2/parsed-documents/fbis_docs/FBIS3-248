The president said it was saddening that some opposition groups had issued threats of terrorism in the run-up to the Lugari by-election, but no embassy had protested over it. The president said the failure by the embassies to condemn the threats showed that they supported subversion and were putting democracy in the country at risk. President Moi was speaking at State Lodge, Eldoret, this afternoon when he received a goodwill delegation of elders from Uasin Gishu District, who paid him a courtesy call. He said true democracy was only possible in an atmosphere where wananchi [citizens] are free to elect their leaders without any intimidation. President Moi termed the demand by certain embassies to observe the Lugari by-election as an interference in the internal affairs of the country. Such demand said the president was tantamount to supervision and neocolonialism. [passage omitted]
