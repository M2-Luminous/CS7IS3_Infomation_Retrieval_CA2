The situation of China's iron and steel production has been very good since early this year. The output of finished steel products reached 27.6 million tonnes from January to April, registering an increase of 9.81 percent, or 2.46 million tonnes, over the output of 25.14 million tonnes posted in the same period last year. Excessive imports in the fourth quarter last year resulted in an oversupply of steel products. Coupled with the fact that the quantity of steel products imported in the first four months of this year posted growth of 5 percent over the same period last year, a new situation had appeared on the domestic steel products market -- total short-term supply of steel products exceeded demand. Prices on the domestic steel products market dropped in the past two months. The prices of steel products are predicted to basically stabilize for a certain period of time to come. In view of the fact that the current inventory of steel products kept by iron and steel producing enterprises showed an increase of approximately 27 percent over the amount kept at the beginning of this year, Wu Xichun reminded foreign trade enterprises not to blindly import steel products. Wu Xichun said: Due to the complex nature of the economy, the prices of certain steel products may rise and those of certain other steel products may drop, while the prices of most steel products will be stable. Iron and steel enterprises must pay close attention to market changes, continuously adjust the structure of their product range, and enhance their capability to adapt themselves to market changes.
