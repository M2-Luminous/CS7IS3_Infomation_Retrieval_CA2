However, the Social Democratic Party, the largest of the seven parties in Hosokawa's coalition, strongly opposed the plan and threatened to withdraw its ministers from the cabinet. Hosokawa told a news conference the government wants to introduce the new tax on goods and services April 1, 1997. Speaking at a hurriedly arranged news conference, Hosokawa said, "the government has decided to introduce a new national welfare tax at a rate of 7 percent, starting from April 1, 1997." "In tandem with the introduction of the national welfare tax, the current 3 percent consumption tax will be abolished," the premier said. "The new tax will be introduced to finance the large cost of building up the social infrastructure, improving the people's living environment and financing growing welfare expenditures," he said. The Hosokawa cabinet will decide Thursday on a 15 trillion yen pump-priming package that will include the tax cuts, officials said. Hosokawa said part of the additional revenue stemming from the new tax will be used to finance planned tax cuts of 6 trillion yen, of which income and resident tax cuts would account for "5.3 trillion yen." Asked by a reporter whether the fresh revenue from the new tax would more than offset an immediate revenue shortfall from the 6 trillion yen income tax cuts, Hosokawa nodded. "Certainly, the new tax measures would result in a net tax increase, starting from fiscal 1997," Hosokawa said, in response to the reporter's allegation that the expected 9 trillion yen annual revenue from the new tax would produce a net revenue increase of up to 2 trillion yen. Hosokawa said his administration will submit to the Diet a bill that would replace the current consumption tax with the new national welfare tax. He said his administration will not include a provision that would obligate the government to spend revenues from the new tax solely for the purpose of financing government expenditures related to welfare policy. Items of government outlays on which the revenue from the new tax would be spent "would not be specified" in the text of the new tax legislation, Hosokawa said. Hosokawa rejected the Social Democratic Party's argument that the introduction of the new 7 percent tax would be tantamount to raising the rate of the current 3 percent consumption tax. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a late night meeting of the leaders of coalition parties that his party cannot accept the new tax unless the government includes wording obliging it to use all the revenue from the new tax for welfare-related expenditures. The party urged Hosokawa to set up a "special account" inside the state budget -- independent from its general account -- to ensure that additional revenue be spent to finance welfare-related outlays, while preventing a diversion of revenues to expenditures unrelated to welfare, SDP officials said. Earlier in the day, most coalition partners agreed to back a proposal by the Finance Ministry to offset the tax cuts of 6 trillion yen with the new 7 percent tax, the officials said. The SDP, by joining the coalition, has lent vital support to the Hosokawa administration, enabling it to secure a majority in the House of Representatives. The SDP has many opponents of the consumption tax as it bolstered its parliamentary strength in the 1989 election on an anticonsumption tax platform. The non-SDP coalition partners tried in vain to persuade the SDP to accept the revenue-balancing plan, they said. Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, an SDP legislator, told reporters, "Prime Minister Hosokawa asked the SDP chairman to accept his tax legislation, but our chairman said the party cannot accept such a proposal." The coalition tussle has intensified nine days before Hosokawa flies to the United States for talks with President Bill Clinton. Hosokawa, whose administration is under U.S. pressure to revive the floundering Japanese economy by stimulating stagnant consumer spending, is expected to mention some pump-priming fiscal package featuring a tax cut at the meeting with Clinton. The non-SDP coalition partners initially tried to alleviate the SDP aversion to the tax by putting forward a proposal to change the name of the tax to "welfare-purpose tax" from "consumption tax," the officials said. Earlier in the day, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a meeting of coalition leaders, "the SDP will absolutely not tolerate a raise in the rate of the consumption tax." However, other coalition partners are calling for the raise to be implemented by the end of 1994, saying they do not want to antagonize voters before a House of Councillors election expected in the summer of 1995.
