Nine days before it was to broadcast the programme, the station replaced it in the schedules with a BBC Horizon documentary on tuberculosis. The station denies the documentary was pulled for political reasons. Last night the chairman of the influential human rights organisation Justice, Nihal Jayawickrama, said he may refer TVB to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Laogai sketches a portrait of China's nationwide network of so-called "reform through labour" camps -- detention centres where dissidents and delinquents are held, frequently without trial. The 50-minute documentary was scheduled for TVB's English-language Pearl channel on December 4, last year. At about the same time, TVB also decided not to screen the controversial one-hour BBC documentary Mao Zedong: The Last Emperor. The station has not screened the highly critical examination of the late Chinese Communist Party chairman saying the public was not interested. It broadcast its own production, Mao Fever, in December. A range of community leaders, including legislators, urban councillors and media commentators, have accused TVB of self-censorship, a charge the station denies, although it has no plans to screen the BBC programme and Beijing has been vocal in its opposition to it. A station spokeswoman Lily Chan, yesterday denied that self-censorship had motivated the cancellation of Laogai: Inside the Chinese Gulag. "It was purely a programming arrangement," she said. Cecilia Tan, the TVB controller of programming, said. "It's difficult to explain programming decisions. If you think of the number of programmes we run per day, during one year, it's more fair to comment on what has been scheduled. I would not care to comment on what has not appeared," she said. Veronica Chiu, the publicity manager for the Pearl channel, said the December 4 schedule was only tentative, and the cancellation had been "routine and normal". "There were no other political reasons," she said. Jayawickrama, the chairman of Justice, called the refusal to show the programme "tragic". Justice is the Hong Kong chapter of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists which holds an advisory seat at the UN. "The problem with self-censorship is that it's a manipulation of information," he said. "It's far more dangerous than government censorship because nobody knows about it, and here is an institution whose sole rationale for existence is the dissemination of information. This is one of the matters that the (UN's) Human Rights Commission would be quite interested in. We've referred TVB to the commission in the past and we would do it again." Another Justice member Hing-lee Wong, said TVB had done a disservice to Hong Kong. "I think it's ridiculous. We should be attacking the Government's licensing policy, and I plan to do something about this myself," Wong said. TVB is facing a mid-term review of its licence, although broadcast policymakers at the Recreation and Culture Branch have refused to become embroiled in self-censorship and scheduling disputes. A Chinese dissident, Lau Shan-ching, who spent 10 years in a Guangzhou jail and has organised a series of private Hong Kong showings of Mao Zedong: The Last Emperor, said he was appalled by the cancellation. "TVB seems to have changed its policy with the intention not to make the Chinese angry because (the station has) expanding interests in China." A Liberal Party legislator, Christine Loh, said self-censorship was a serious denigration of Hong Kong's civil liberties.
