FR940621-0-00038 FR940621-0-00017 FAA Response: The FAA intends to clarify the certification process with regard to the regulations and TSO's. Since the effective date of Amendment 21&hyph;50 to part 21 (September 9, 1980), The FAA's TSO revision program has been eliminating TSO's from the rulemaking process and eliminating references to specific TSO's from the regulations. The TSO revision makes it possible for the public to use the most up-to-date TSO or other standards that are found acceptable during the certification of a particular piece of equipment. When specific TSO standards are designated in a regulation, other TSO's or standards are automatically excluded. As stated in Notice No. 90&hyph;11, ``This rule replaces specific references to TSO&hyph;C91 in the FAR with `an approved ELT that is in operable condition','' and withdraws all TSO&hyph;C91 authorizations issued to ELT manufacturers. In effect, this would allow TSO&hyph;C91a, or any subsequent TSO's issued for ELT's, to be used as a basis for compliance with the FAR. Using the language ``approved'' is consistent with the FAA's responsibility to eliminate dated references to regulations. Whenever a material, part, process, or appliance is required to be ``approved,'' it must be approved under the Federal Aviation Regulations. The approval can be obtained in one of the following ways: (1) under a Parts Manufacturer Approval; (2) in conjunction with type certification procedures for a product, including approvals granted by a supplemental type certificate; (3) under a Technical Standard Order authorization; or (4) in any other manner approved by the Administrator. Of these approval methods, TSO's contain minimum performance and quality control standards for specified articles (material, part, process, or appliance). The standards for each TSO are those the Administrator finds necessary to ensure that the article concerned will operate satisfactorily. Compliance with a TSO is only one method of obtaining an approval and its use is not mandatory; therefore, the standards contained in the TSO are not mandatory but are a way of obtaining approval for a particular article. Miscellaneous Comments An ELT manufacturer requests that the word ``transmitter'' be added to ยง91.207(c)(2) for consistency with the rest of the section. FAA Response: The FAA agrees; this word has already been incorporated into ยง91.207(c)(2). One commenter encourages integration with the European Organization for Civil Aviation Electronics. In addition, the National Business Aircraft Association, Inc., expresses concern over the prematurity of the FAA's rulemaking and states that the ramifications of other equipment such as the international Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) system used to indicate the location of other aircraft must be fully understood. The NTSB calls for integration with ICAO efforts in establishing ELT carriage requirements. FAA Response: The FAA disagrees with the National Business Aircraft Association's comment that this rule is premature. The FAA will no longer delay this final rule because there will always be new technology on the horizon. The rule is in agreement with the ICAO requirements, including recent changes pertaining to ELT's. The FAA is a strong supporter of the search and rescue satellite system (COSPAS/SARSAT). In addition, the ELT program, as outlined in this rulemaking, takes into account national and international issues and these considerations were integrated into the justification for this rule. Three commenters request field testing of TSO&hyph;C91a ELT's to confirm their potential costs and benefits before their use is mandated. Four commenters call for additional research on ELT's. For example, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) requests further research on TSO&hyph;C91a G-switches and battery technology. FAA Response: The FAA agrees with the intent of these comments on the need for appropriate research and field testing. Transport Canada, the Canadian counterpart of the United States Department of Transportation, is currently field testing 130 ARNAV ELT's. Usable results may not be available until late 1993. The FAA is working with Transport Canada on its ELT improvement program and with other government as well as non-government organizations on maximizing ELT knowledge. However, in view of the Canadian study and numerous studies documented in the FAA/NASA report, including an FAA ELT maintenance survey on repair stations, the FAA has determined that there is no need for research on new issues before regulatory action is taken. Additional research would only delay the installation of improved ELT's without any clear expectation of improvement over the TSO&hyph;C91a specification. One commenter encourages the FAA to expand its ELT educational effort to install more reliable ELT's. NASA suggests that all pilots be required to monitor the 121.5 Mhz frequency as part of the shutdown procedure in aircraft that do not have a cockpit monitor.
