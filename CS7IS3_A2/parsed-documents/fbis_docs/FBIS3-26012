This is an important law governing the management of satellite television broadcasts in our country and it has great significance to the healthy and orderly development of our country's satellite television broadcasts, to the protection of the Chinese nation's fine cultural traditions, to the promotion of socialist spiritual civilization, and to the maintenance of social stability. I. Our Country's Satellite Television Broadcasts Develop Rapidly and Must Be Managed According to Law Since August 1985, our country has been using satellite television broadcasting technology to transmit television programs and to expand the areas covered by television broadcasts. Before that, we mainly relied on building ground microwave transmission networks for transmitting television programs, to increase the coverage rate of the population receiving television. Our country is vast and has a varied topography, over 70 percent of the land is hilly and mountainous areas and microwave transmission technology is affected and hindered by terrain and landscape. For this reason, the coverage rate of the population receiving television did not increase rapidly. By 1985, after efforts for over 20 years, the coverage rate of the population receiving television had not reached 50 percent. After using satellites to transmit television programs, because it saves on investment, involves less transmission links, has a wide coverage area, and is free from the restrictions of terrain and landscape, it has developed very rapidly. By 1992, in just seven years, the coverage rate of the population receiving television in the whole country swiftly rose to 81.3 percent and satellite television broadcasting has already become an important means of solving the problem of television covering areas in our country. At present, the Central Television Station transmits four television programs through satellites, whereas the five provincial television stations in Xinjiang, Tibet, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan also use satellites to transmit their programs; an educational television program is also transmitted through satellite. It is estimated that this year, some other provincial television stations will also use satellites to transmit their programs. We can say that satellite television broadcasting is now in the ascendancy in our country. Along with the development of satellite television broadcasts in our country, the demand for group equipment for receiving satellite television has rapidly swelled. By the end of 1992, the country had 39,000 satellite television receivers and transmitters. At the same time, the satellite television programs which are transmitted from outside our borders but can be received inside the country have continuously increased, and there is an increasing number of people who have produced, sold, installed, and used ground equipment to receive television programs from outside our borders, thus, serious chaos has emerged. Various types of enterprises have opened factories and workshops without restrictions or planning and the equipment they produce varies in quality, whereas some sales units forget about obligations when lured by benefits and sell low-quality equipment, or smuggle in products to evade tariffs, causing serious harm to the interests of consumers and the country. This not only endangers the healthy development of our new industry producing equipment to receive satellite television but is also unfavorable to socialist spiritual civilization construction. It was precisely under such conditions that the "Regulations" were formulated, promulgated, and implemented, to enable the healthy development of the satellite television undertaking to have legal protection. II. Managing Reception of Satellite Television Broadcasts According to Law, Is an Important Means of Exercising and Safeguarding State Sovereignty Since 15 November 1983 when the United States for the first time transmitted a direct-broadcast satellite television program, satellite television undertakings have sprung up like mushrooms in various parts of the world. In particular, since the 1990's, satellite television undertakings in various countries have entered a period of great development. Although the International Telecommunications Union has produced an agreement which says that the television programs of various countries should be directed to the areas of the countries concerned, for technical and political reasons, the "spill over" phenomenon whereby a country's satellite television intentionally surpasses national boundaries to cover other countries and areas has become more serious and the "electric wave battle" in the air has become more intensified. Many countries have expressed worries at the increasing number of trespassing television programs and a lot of these countries have restricted the reception of satellite television and carried out management according to their own national and public interests. For example, Malaysia views management of foreign satellite television as a political issue which has a bearing on national security, clearly stipulating that no individual or family should receive foreign satellite television. Japan's Electric Wave Law stipulates that the wireless and cable television stations in the country cannot relay television programs from outside the border; at the same time, Japanese law stipulates that residents can only receive the directly broadcast satellite television programs transmitted by NHK and Nippon Satellite Broadcasting Corporation. Britain's New Broadcasting Ordinance clearly stipulates that the Independent Commission for Television has the power to cancel any "unacceptable" foreign satellite television programs scheduled for the television channels under its jurisdiction. In fact, managing satellite television broadcasts according to law is the undisputable authority of any sovereign country. The reason is simply that no sovereign country would allow other countries to establish television stations or other news agencies on its soil without any restrictions. Whereas satellite television programs trespass the borders and cover areas in other countries and would it not be equal to allowing other countries to establish television stations on the soil of a sovereign country if nothing is done to restrict them? At the same time, when a sovereign nation, proceeding from the need to safeguard and develop the nation's own cultural patterns, values, morals, and social stability, carries out management of the trespassing satellite television according to the law of the country, it is completely a matter of sovereignty. As early as 1972, the 17th meeting of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization stipulated that a country has absolute power to select and criticize the information (news) coming from any other channels. What must be further pointed out is that, at present, our country is covered by about a dozen satellite television channels from outside our borders. According to an estimate, in the next 10 years, some 120 television broadcasting satellites will be launched by various countries and about half of these satellites will be in Asia, where most areas of our country will be able to receive programs. If we do not give management but let units and individuals receive those programs, then it is no different from establishing inside our country several dozen television stations which are run from outside the border. Setting aside what kind of subtle influence the values, morals, and cultural patterns publicized by these television programs will have on our country's audience, especially young people, speaking just in terms of safeguarding the country's sovereignty, it is absolutely necessary for us to manage according to law the reception of satellite television programs, especially the television programs beamed from outside our borders. This is also an important measure for exercising and safeguarding state sovereignty. III. The Contents of the "Regulations" Accord With the Actual Situation of Development of Television Undertakings in Our Country and Is Identical to the Policy of Opening Up to the Outside World Since the birth of television undertakings in our country some 30 years ago, we have been using the method of collectively relaying and transmitting television signals to households and individuals for them to watch. That is, television program signals are provided by the wireless television stations, television transmitting stations, and satellite ground stations set up by the broadcasting and television departments at various levels. This method is very practical and is in accordance with our country's actual situation in terms of solving the problem of the rate of population covered by television in a developing country like us, with 1.2 billion people, a relatively low per capita income, and a comparatively backward economy. With this method, some 800 million people in the country have been able to watch television programs and in many places they can even watch several programs, while in the places with cable television, they can watch nearly 10 programs. As the problem of television coverage rate was being solved, television programs became increasingly abundant. In particular, since reform and opening up, our country's television departments have worked hard to improve the quality and increase the quantity of programs made by themselves and, at the same time, also established relations on exchanging and trading of programs with the television organizations in many countries and regions in the world. They have imported a large quantity of television programs of various kinds that can be beamed outside our borders. In recent years, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television has signed 82 agreements or memoranda of agreement on cooperation with 41 countries such as France, Britain, and Italy, as well as with two international organizations. The Central Television Station signed cooperation agreements on providing news to United Independent Television News Agency which is a U.S.-British joint venture, Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), Cable News Network (CNN), Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK), East European Broadcasting Union, and Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. Since realizing round-the-clock operations for broadcasting news 11 times every day last year, the Central Television Station has been able to immediately broadcast important international news. Apart from this, the television programs -- including cultural, sports, scientific, technological, and cartoon programs -- which are made outside our borders and acquired through trading, buying, or exchanging of copyright by various television stations, have been broadcast in large numbers. In particular, the international film festival which is organized in turn by Sichuan and Shanghai every year, provides a stable opportunity for exchanges of programs between our country's television circles and the television organizations in various countries in the world. Along with the deepening of the reform and opening up, our country's television undertaking will further develop and television programs will become richer to satisfy, as much as possible, the people's demands for obtaining important international and domestic news as well as meeting their cultural and recreational needs. Carrying out the necessary restriction and management of reception of satellite television beamed from outside our borders does not contradict the open-door policy in our country. As we have mentioned before, our country's television circles have established many kinds of relations of exchanging television programs with many countries, to introduce to the people in the whole country the outstanding cultures from various places in the world through television. This is also to let the Chinese people know the world better and learn and borrow from the outstanding foreign cultures. In order to satisfy the special needs of some units and venues when implementing the "Regulations," the relevant departments will, after examination and approval, allow financial, economic, and trade units, foreigner-admitting three-star hotels and the second-class hotels judged by state standards, and the offices and apartments used by foreigners and the people from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, to install equipment to directly receive the satellite television programs beamed from outside the border. When we stress management according to law, our basic purpose is to enable satellite television to better serve our country's economic construction, reform, and opening up, and to serve socialist spiritual civilization construction as well.
