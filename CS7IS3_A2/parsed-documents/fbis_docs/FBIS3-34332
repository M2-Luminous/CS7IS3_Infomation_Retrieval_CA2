Reports indicate that the casualty toll of the besieged and war-stricken people of Sarajevo from this attack has increased to more than 250. Our colleague in Europe has sent us more information on this attack: [Begin recordeding] [Unidentified correspondent in Bonn] Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Siladzic has said that 66 were killed and 197 wounded in this attack, which is the worst attack on civilians since the onset of the war in Sarajevo. After the attack, in which a 120-mm mortar was used, Sarajevo's central market was the scene of bodies and of severed limbs. Many of the wounded died in the halls of Sarajevo hospitals due to the lack of medical facilities and medicine. This attack has sparked off an extensive wave of disgust and rage among the Sarajevo residents at the indifference that is being shown by the United Nations and the West regarding the Serbs' crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. While condemning the policy of the United Nations and the West, the officials of Bosnia-Herzegovina have called for military steps to end the attacks on civilians or the lifting of the arms embargo on the Muslims. Public mourning has been declared in Bosnia-Herzegovina to commemorate the martyrs of Black Saturday. Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Siladzic said to correspondents: Why is the United Nations supporting the aggressors and imposing sanctions on the victims? Are the 200,000 people whom we have lost so far not enough for the international community to take serious steps? Bosnian President Alia Izetbegovic also stated that any government that supports the arms embargo on the Muslims is a partner in these crimes. Meanwhile, in continuation of their past policies, Western and UN officials have limited themselves to a verbal condemnation of the attack and have called for investigations to identify those who are responsible for the attack. After the Saturday tragedy, the governments of France and Britain have once again stressed the need to continue the talks. British Defense Secretary Rifkind said: I do not think that an air raid on Serb positions will solve the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem. German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has stated: If the international community does not react seriously to this attack, we will lose all our credibility. [end recording]
