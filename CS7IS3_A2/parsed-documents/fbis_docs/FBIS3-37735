The newspaper DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA published today an excerpt from this interview. In short, the president explains his decision as follows. The election to the Supreme Council will definitely drag out and be held in two rounds. Then, no sooner a new parliament gets a chance to work than the presidential election will follow. It hardly makes sense to do this in such a short time. Second, in Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, participation in the elections would mean that he justifies the present economic and social situation. Third, the president believes that other candidates for this post do not direct all of their efforts at a constructive program, but at proving that he failed to perform his duties. To be perfectly honest, the declaration by Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk came as a surprise, if only because we learned about the decision of the president, who was elected by all the people, not from a national source but from the foreign media. Although we learned from the sources close to the president that he retains his point of view, one cannot rid oneself of doubts regarding the reasoning of Leonid Makarovych. He does not want to exacerbate the political situation by his participation in the elections. But will his lack of participation not produce exactly this kind of result? Can one perceive the participation of Leonid Makarovych in the elections as his protection of the present complex economic and social situation? Perhaps on the contrary, is it not his lack of participation that will rather testify to the incorrectness of the previous course? Finally, his third point about criticism of the president on the part of his rivals in the campaign. Can one ever imagine an election race without this in any democratic country? In one word, the decision by Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk not to participate in the next elections for the Ukrainian president contains more questions than answers.
