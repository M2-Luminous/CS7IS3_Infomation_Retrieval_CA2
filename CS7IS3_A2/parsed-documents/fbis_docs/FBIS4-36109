It is also clear that the decision came out of "the government's dark room" chaired and administered by "Imam Ayatollah Ruhollah [name as published] Hasan al-Turabi...!", the regime's spiritual leader, leader of the National Islamic Front [NIF], and member of the international organization of the "political Islam" movement. The decision made by the "dark room" is binding on the Government, whose executive seat is filled by Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir and his comrades, officers of the National Salvation Movement that toppled al-Sadiq al-Mahdi's regime. A clever cunning characterizes the way the objectives are chosen and the way in which the decisions are made and implemented. The "Imam Shaykh Hasan" possesses cleverness and cunning in ample measure. His tactics depend on choosing the right moment to focus on certain objectives that are increasingly vital. The tactics are also marked by targeting acknowledged sanctities and the rules and principles that have historically safeguarded Egyptian-Sudanese ties. These tacticians do not take into account--nor do they even care at all--whether these decisions harm the interests of the Sudanese people themselves. Al-Turabi is pressing ahead toward "forbidden" goals, always challenging the "taboo." The latest decision made inside the "shaykh's dark room," with which Lt. Gen. al-Bashir's "administration" complied, was to seize 30 posts owned by the Egyptian Irrigation Ministry in Khartoum, in the al-Shajarah area south of Omdurman, and other installations. This was a first step toward a greater and more important goal, namely the Nile observation posts on the Blue Nile, White Nile, Subat, 'Atbarah, al-Rusayris Dam, and Malakal areas. These Egyptian outposts are in Sudan on the strength of treaties, agreements, and international laws regulating the use of jointly owned rivers, observing their progress, securing the water resources, and distributing the water. This tactical progress toward the "forbidden" goal, carried out step by step by the "Imam" and his dark room is a blatant encroachment on the Nile water and Egypt's share of it. This objective cannot be concealed by the Sudanese Government's disingenuous media explanations made after the seizure of the Egyptian irrigation posts. While the Sudanese media tried to cover up the recent seizure of Egyptian posts with feeble pretexts, Sudanese Irrigation Minister Ya'qub Abu-Shura announced that "Sudan's share of the [High Aswan] Dam water according to the 1959 agreement between Egypt and Lt. Gen. 'Abbud [Sudanese leader 1958-1964] does not satisfy Sudan's needs and therefore the agreement must be revised." The facts contradict these statements, which remain a mere excuse for disputes and confrontations. The facts, which neither the Sudanese irrigation minister nor Lt. Gen. al-Bashir, nor for that matter the spiritual leader "Ayatollah al-Turabi," can deny are the following: --Since 1992, Sudan has refused to hold a meeting of the Higher Joint Technical Nile Water Committee. According to existing agreements, this committee must meet every six months, in Sudan and Egypt alternately. This intentional suspension of the committee's functions has brought consultation, discussion, and cooperation to a halt. --Sudan uses only 4 billion cubic meters of its annual 18- billion-meter share of the Nile River water. Although no one is preventing it from doing so, it is not equipped to use the rest of its share. It simply cannot use it all. --Sudan informed Egypt some time ago that it planned to raise the height of the al-Rusayris Dam and increase its holding capacity by an additional 4 billion cubic meters. Egypt did not object, but said "Go ahead with God's blessing." Sudan came back and said it needed more electric power and planned to build a reservoir called al-Hamdab Reservoir in the town of Murrah north of Khartoum. Egypt again did not object and Sudan hired a Russian company to carry out feasibility studies at a cost of $30 million. Returning to the facts, we refer to the "High Dam" agreement with Sudan of 1959. Before the dam was built, Egypt's water quota, as agreed upon with the Nile basin states, was 48 billion cubic meters. Sudan's quota was 4 billion cubic meters. The High Dam studies, before and after the project was carried out, proved that the amount of water added by the dam is 31 billion cubic meters, of which 10 cubic meters evaporates per year, between one flood and the next. The remaining added amount is thus 21 billion cubic meters, which Egypt requested be shared equally between itself and Sudan. But Sudan objected, requesting that it get two-thirds to Egypt's one-third--that is, 14 billion cubic meters for Sudan and 7 billion for Egypt. Egypt's annual share of the Nile waters would thus become 55 billion cubic meters. The same facts show that Egypt undertook full responsibility for building the dam. It even compensated Sudan for the lands that were submerged by the waters of Lake Nasir. This means that Egypt undertook full financial responsibility for the dam and compensated Sudan in order to obtain 7 billion cubic meters of the Nile waters. Sudan, which paid none of the dam's cost, gets 14 cubic meters. Egypt was not naive or helpless in doing that. Rather, it was responding to the eternal fact in which it believes and on which it acts--that there is no difference between the northern and southern parts of the valley and that the sons of the north are brothers of those of the south. These are some, but not all, of the facts that depict the relationship and its nature in one of its numerous aspects--that pertaining to the Nile and water. What does "Imam Shaykh" Dr. Hasan al-Turabi want, he and the "executive authority" which puts the decisions he makes in his "dark room" into effect, without pausing to consider the risks they involve or their different, fabricated, and even "suspect" nature? It seems that "Shaykh Dr. Imam Hasan" is spoiling for a fight; he is seeking a "fight" with Egypt. The man leaves no "well" without poisoning its water, even if the only one drinking from that well are the Sudanese people themselves. He did it with the Egyptian schools in Sudan, in which brother Sudanese were getting their educations. He did it in the name of Sudanization, as though this Sudanization is a creed, a religion, or a language. He did it the day he decided to seize the branch of Cairo University in Khartoum and sequestered its buildings and all its contents. That university was originally established to serve the brothers there. He did it when he turned to the diplomatic representation and decided to close the Egyptian consulates in al- Ubayyid and Port Sudan. Before that, he tried to change the international borders unilaterally the day he acted in Hala'ib as though it was purely Sudanese territory. He invited Canadian and Japanese companies to go there and prospect for oil. He did it the day he expelled the workers of the Egyptian Manganese Company and closed the company's doors. This line of conduct, these incidents, and the approach al-Turabi and his executive apparatus, as represented by the lieutenant general's government, appear frivolous. But a second look reveals bigger and more serious dimensions. The closure of schools, universities, the Nile observatory stations, the Egyptian Irrigation Ministry's rest houses, and the consulates, plus the earlier attempt to create a border dispute that would develop into a military or semimilitary confrontation, all fall under the same category and have one goal: To sever all Egyptian-Sudanese links, provoke hatred and malice in the hearts of the people in the northern and southern parts of the valley instead of love, amity, and understanding, and to arouse Sudanese public opinion and steer it toward a big external target involving dignity and identity in schools and universities; the national soil of the homeland in Hala'ib and Shalatayn; and life and livelihood, as represented in the Nile waters. Al-Turabi's mobilization is done in a tactical and escalatory manner. He chooses one specific target after the other and picks the time he deems fit to carry out his internal, regional, and external schemes. After that, the stage will be set for his grand scheme, which will come through a major and more serious adventure. He tried to start this adventure the day Khartoum attempted to act unilaterally in Hala'ib, concluding an exploration contract and expelling Egyptian personnel there. My guess is that in his calculations and estimates, al-Turabi thought then that Egypt would get mad and declare an all-out war, but he was disappointed. As a result, he resorted to "tactical measures" with the apparent view of "provoking" Egypt to act irrationally, such as Sudanizing schools, terminating the presence of Egyptian universities, closing down consulates, and seizing the headquarters and houses of the Irrigation Ministry. Such "tactical measures" are, I believe, outdated. Today, he is heading for his major adventure. As is known, playing with fire is a dangerous thing. Playing with fire approaches the "taboos" that concern the lives of others. In our context, it means the Nile and its water. Al-Turabi knows very well that such an "adventurous" and dangerous approach would be just a game that would lead him nowhere, for thousands of reasons. Some are legal and international and others relate to matters of capability, control and work tools [adawat tahakkum wa 'amal], finance, and the last one concerns the "defense of life and homeland." I do not want to talk about the last one, because I believe it is far-fetched. Probably "al-Turabi's major game" is to get rid of south Sudan and leave it to become independent and join the black African and Christian club south of the Sahara, while keeping northern Sudan "ethnically and religiously cleansed." It is the same as the Zionist-Jewish theory and the Serbian theory of a state racially and religiously purified in full. But there are tens of thousands of soldiers from the valiant Sudanese Army who fought for many years in defense of a unified Sudan. There are also Army officers, his own partners, who waged the "salvation revolution" and made him the "spiritual leader" with absolute power and authority. These officers, led by Lieutenant General al-Bashir, have taken part in the unification war to stop the secession and its conspiracies. People who have sacrificed their sons to defend the unity and integrity of the soil cannot go along with such "racist" notions as those pursued by al-Turabi in the name of "Islamic Internationalism," nor with ethnic and religious purity. Nobody can betray the blood of martyrs or deny the noblest sacrifices. Without that, there is nothing left for the shaykh but to provoke Egypt and approach the water taboo; and perhaps Egypt will react to his provocation, fall into his trap, and decide to put an end to these absurd, childish, and suspicious acts. Then mobilization at the border would start, Sudan's troops in the south could be pulled back to confront "Egypt the aggressor" threatening the Sudanese homeland! Then, he could hold Egypt responsible. He could distract Egypt and draw its attention away from its major development efforts for progress and welfare at home. This would hinder Egypt's role in the region and the continent in making peace and building bridges of cooperation and growth, and would disrupt its international role as a partner in drafting a new world order based on democracy, equal rights, and equal cooperation. For, chaos is the only atmosphere in which al-Turabi and his "groups" could live and expand, even if this expansion costs the bodies of people and the debris of destroyed and ruined cities. The question is: If these are the intentions and schemes of the spiritual leader, what about the views of the lieutenant general [al-Bashir] and his team, if they still have any say or any decisions to make? But that is another story.
