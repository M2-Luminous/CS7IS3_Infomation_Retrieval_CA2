The agency plans the move to prevent domestically produced rice from flowing to dealers on unauthorized markets to secure a smooth rice supply until the 1994 rice crop appears on the market full scale, the officials said. The agency has decided to supply 100,000 tons of early rice by the end of October. The amount of incentives has yet to be decided, they said. The agency plans to pay the incentives out of a 50 billion yen budget in fiscal 1993 for balanced rice supply-demand for the three coming years. On the other hand, the National Federation of Agricultural Cooperative Associations is also considering paying about 15,000 yen per 60 kilograms of rice to farmers in advance to facilitate collection of rice for unauthorized markets. On the recent rice shortage due to last year's poor domestic crop, Farm Minister Eijiro Hata said Sunday [20 March] the rice supply will be sufficient, denying a future shortage. Hata said in a lecture in Omiya, Saitama Prefecture, that 20,000 to 40,000 tons of imported rice are being unloaded daily at Japanese ports against Japan's rice consumption of 500,000 tons a month. If half of the consumption is supplied by imports, a daily import of 10,000 tons of rice is sufficient for supply, he said.
