Reporting Requirements Woodman-Iannetti Oil Company, Great Bend, KS, LEE&hyph;0104 Woodman-Iannetti Oil Company filed an Application for Exception requesting exception relief from the requirement that the firm file the Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form EIA&hyph;23, the ``Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves.'' In considering the Application for Exception, the DOE tentatively found that the firm was not adversely affected by the reporting requirement in a way that was significantly different than the burden by similar reporting firms. Accordingly, on May 3, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied. Hunt Oil Co., Pierce, ID, LEE&hyph;0086 Hunt Oil Co. filed an Application for Exception to relieve it from the requirement to prepare and file Form EIA&hyph;782B with the DOE Energy Information Administration. On May 3, 1994, the Department of Energy issued a Proposed Decision and Order which tentatively concluded that the exception request should be granted in part and Hunt be relieved of its reporting requirement until August 1, 1994.
