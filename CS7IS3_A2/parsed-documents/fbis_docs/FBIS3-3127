That is the central topic of a speech by [Defense Minister] Chi Haotian, an army deputy to the National People's Congress, when the People's Liberation Army delegation held a panel discussion this afternoon to deliberate the government work report. Chi said that in the government work report, Premier Li Peng pointed out: "Reform and opening up is the motive force behind the development." Given that the economies of many countries in the world develop slowly, stage weak recoveries, and even register negative growth, the Chinese economy, full of vigor and vitality, has maintained a strong momentum of growth. This is thanks to the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to reform and opening up. At this crucial juncture, when the state is expediting reform of the economic structure, we should bear in mind President Jiang Zemin's remark that revolutionary servicemen should hold aloft the banners of patriotism and socialism, regard the interests of the party and the people as their own, and contribute to the deepening of reform and the economic prosperity of the state. Chi pointed out: Reform, development, and stability are an organically-linked entity in which reform is the motive force, development is the fundamental, and stability is the prerequisite. Only by accurately grasping and correctly handling the relationship between them can we maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang 2170 4958, 1816 6643, 0256 1660] development of the national economy. Stability plays a special role in reform, development, and the overall interests of accomplishing the work of the whole party. It is especially necessary for leading army cadres at all levels to bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea that "stability is of paramount importance" and conscientiously regard the maintenance of stability as an important duty, so that the party and state can concentrate their energy on reform, opening up, and economic construction. Chi said: All army comrades should, in answer to the call of the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, launch activities of learning from Lei Feng and Xu Honggang and resist the corrosion of money worship, pleasure- seeking, and ultra-individualism using a correct outlook on life and correct values. Leaders at all levels should enhance their awareness of the masses, direct their eyes downward, show solicitude for soldiers, do practical things for grass-roots units and help them solve problems, increase the cohesiveness of army units, and maintain a high degree of stability and unified centralism in the army. Strong national defense is a reliable guarantee for the country's long-term political stability. On the issue of stepping up national defense modernization while putting the overall interests of economic construction first, Chi Haotian said: It is necessary to consistently take as our guide Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his idea on army building in the new period and strive to explore the special features and laws of defense building under the conditions of socialist market economy and modern warfare, so that defense building can be adapted to the new situation. It is necessary to perseveringly launch education in national defense, the focus of which is on cadres. The idea that "there is no security and stability without an army" and the ancient teaching that "despite peace in the world, it is dangerous to forget about war" should first strike root in the minds of cadres at all levels. We should rely on the party, the government, the army, and the forces of all social sectors in keeping up mass, regular education in national defense and play a positive role in exerting a subtle influence. It is necessary to step up the building of a legal system for national defense, persist in grasping the formulation and enforcement of laws while, at the same time, paying equal importance to both. With regard to national defense statutes that have been adopted, we should firmly uphold them and exercise management in accordance with them. While stepping up education in national defense and engaging in defense building according to statutes, we should adapt the building of reserve forces to the development of a socialist market economy through vigorous readjustments and reforms. At the panel discussion this afternoon, Zhang Baokang, Zhou Yibing, and Zhang Xusan said: The government work report is encouraging. The fact that China scored a series of achievements in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive last year has once again proved that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a powerful ideological weapon for guiding reform and construction. It shows that the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and the new government are firm, strong, and highly effective in their leadership. It also shows that, led by the new Central Military Commission, the whole army has carried forward the fine traditions and played the role as a "pillar," a "great wall," and a vital new force in defending state security, safeguarding social stability, and supporting state economic construction.
