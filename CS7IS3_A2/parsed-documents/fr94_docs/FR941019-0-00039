FR941019-0-00039 FR941019-0-00004 Example 1: Nonprofit organization X offers to purchase 10 eligible condominium properties for $300,000 and agrees to reserve 5 of those properties for occupancy or purchase by very low-income families. For-profit entity Y offers to purchase the same 10 eligible condominium properties for $325,000 and intends to reserve all of the properties for occupancy and purchase by lower-income families (but not very low-income families). Although for-profit entity Y has offered more for the properties, the properties should be sold to nonprofit organization X for $300,000. X's offer=$300,000. X's preference price=$300,000+ ($300,000×50×x0.0025)=$300,000+ $37,500=$337,500 Y's offer=$325,000. Y does not receive a preference because Y did not set aside any units for occupancy or purchase by very low-income families. Example 2: The RTC markets 20 eligible condominium properties in bulk, with a requirement that only 35% (7) of those properties be made available for occupancy by or sale to lower-income families. Nonprofit organization X and for-profit entity Y each offer to purchase all 20 eligible condominium properties for $600,000. Nonprofit organization X agrees to reserve 7 of those properties for occupancy or purchase by very low-income families. For-profit entity Y agrees to reserve 2 of the properties for occupancy and purchase by very low-income families and the remaining 18 properties for occupancy by lower-income families that are not very low-income families. Under the preference formula, the properties are sold to for-profit entity Y. X's offer=$600,000. X's preference price=$600,000+ ␣␣($600,000×35×0.0025)=$600,000+ ␣␣$52,500=$652,500 Y's offer=$600,000. Y's preference price=$600,000+ ␣␣($600,000×10×0.0025) (for very low- ␣␣income units)+($600,000×55×00125)= ␣␣$600,000+$15,000+$41,250=$656,250. (ix) Deed restrictions ._(A) Eligible condominium properties purchased by a public agency, nonprofit organization, or for-profit entity for rental or resale to lower-income families must be so restricted by a LURA or other recorded instrument which is binding upon successors in interest, with the provision that the property may subsequently be sold to a lower-income family without further deed restrictions (except for recapture restrictions). The deed or other recorded legal instrument shall also require the property owner to cooperate with periodic compliance reviews and to pay a reasonable fee to cover the cost of the review. The LURA or other recorded instrument shall reflect any commitment, made in accordance with a purchase offer pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(viii) of this section, to reserve a higher percentage of eligible condominium properties for occupancy by or sale to very low-income families and lower-income families and retain such affordability for the longest term. (B) Lower-income occupancy requirements shall be judicially enforceable against purchasers of eligible condominium property or their successors in interest by affected very low- and lower-income families, State housing finance agencies, and any agency, corporation, or authority of the United States Government. (x) At any time during the marketing period for a bulk package of eligible condominium properties, a qualifying single family purchaser may submit to the RTC a notice of serious interest with respect to one eligible condominium property within the bulk package, and the RTC may determine to sell one eligible condominium property to a qualifying household. (5) Offer and sale. The RTC shall establish a market value for each eligible condominium property. The RTC may sell eligible condominium property to qualifying households, nonprofit organizations, and public agencies without regard to any minimum sales price. (6) Sale to other purchasers. If the RTC does not receive a purchase offer with the respect to an eligible condominium property during the marketing period the RTC may sell the property, individually or in combination with other properties, to any other purchasers. (d) Extended marketing period. If it determines that an eligible multifamily property, eligible condominium property or eligible single family property has not been properly offered for the applicable marketing period in accordance with section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1441a(c)) and the applicable regulations, the RTC may provide a second Notice of Marketing Period and offer for sale such property. During any such extended marketing period, the provisions for marketing and selling the eligible multifamily property, eligible condominium property or the eligible single family property under this §1609.7, including the duration of applicable time periods (unless shortened by the RTC), shall apply. §1609.8 Recapture of profits from resale.
