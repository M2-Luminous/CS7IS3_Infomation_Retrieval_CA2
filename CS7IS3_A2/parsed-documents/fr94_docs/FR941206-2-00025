FR941206-2-00025 FR941206-2-00017 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Alaska Power Administration Snettisham Project; Wholesale Power Rates AGENCY: Alaska Power Administration, Department of Energy ACTION: Notice of proposed rate adjustment for the Snettisham Project, notice of public forum and opportunity for review and comment. SUMMARY: Alaska Power Administration (APA) is proposing to adjust the rates for the Snettisham Project. The present rate of 32.1 mills per kilowatthour is insufficient to meet the Snettisham Project's repayment criteria. APA proposes to raise the rate for firm energy to 34.4 mills per kilowatthour beginning May 1, 1995, for a period of up to five years. Rates for non-firm energy deliveries under both the oil displacement and wood-heat displacement programs would not change. The final proposal may differ from the present. The proposed rates will be submitted to the Deputy Secretary of Energy for interim approval and to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for review and final approval. DATES: Written comments will be considered on or before March 7, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be submitted to Mr. Lloyd A. Linke, Alaska Power Administration, 2770 Sherwood Lane, Suite 2B, Juneau, Alaska 99801. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Lloyd A. Linke, Director, Power Division, Alaska Power Administration, 2770 Sherwood Lane, Suite 2B, Juneau, Alaska 99801, (907) 586&hyph;7405. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed rates apply for power sold from the Snettisham Hydroelectric Project to the electric utility serving the Juneau area and a State-owned hatchery at the Snettisham Project. Details of the proposed rates, including supporting studies, are available for inspection at Alaska Power Administration, 2770 Sherwood Lane, Suite 2B, Juneau, Alaska. A public information and comment forum is scheduled to be held January 12, 1995, at 7:00 PM, in Room 320 of the Super 8 Motel, 2295 Trout Street, Juneau, Alaska. APA is requesting that the parties interested in attending the public information and comment forum notify APA of this intent in writing by January 5, 1995. If APA has not received any written notices of intent to attend the forum the APA Administrator will cancel the forum, as allowed in 10 CFR 903.15(c) and 10 CFR 903.16(c). Authorities for the proposed rate action are the 1962 Flood Control Act (Public Law 87&hyph;874), the Water Resource Development Act (Public Law 94&hyph;587) and the Department of Energy Organization Act (Public Law 95&hyph;91). Alaska Power Administration is developing these rates in accordance with DOE financial reporting policies, procedures and methodology (DOE Policy RA 6120.2 [September 20, 1979]), and the procedures for public participation in rate adjustments found in 10 CFR Part 903 (1987) as amended. The present rates went into effect in October 1991. Since the last rate action, sales have been significantly lower than projected and the actual cost of the Crater Lake Addition to the Snettisham Project was higher than estimated. The proposed rate results in a seven percent rate increase. This is below the rate of inflation from 1991 to 1994. Firm sales from the Snettisham Project were six percent (53 GWh) less than projected in August of 1991. Non-firm sales were down nine percent (4 GWh). The reduced sales resulted in revenues that were four percent ($1.1 million) less that forecasted in August 1991. The actual cost, to date, for the Crater Lake Addition is 7 percent ($5 million) higher than estimated in August of 1991. The sales forecast APA used in August of 1991 was based on loads during a historically normal weather year. APA has based its new sales forecast on a more conservative approach using warmer than normal weather load patterns. This results in lower sales projections due to reduced heating loads. APA believes this will result in more stabile rates for the Snettisham Project. The Administration continues to advocate divestiture of APA, and a legislative proposal to authorize the divestiture is under Congressional consideration. This proposed rate action continues present rate policies under existing law. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: The proposed rate action will have no significant environmental impact within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The proposed action meets the requirements of a categorical exclusion as defined in 40 CFR 1508.4 and is listed as a categorical exclusion for DOE in 10 CFR 1021 Appendix B4.3. An Environmental Assessment and an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. Issued at Juneau, Alaska, November 22, 1994. Michael A. Deihl, Administrator.
