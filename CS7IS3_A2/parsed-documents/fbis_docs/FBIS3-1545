The ULIMO field commander, General Mohamed Dumbuya, addressing a news conference on Monday [28 March] in Tubmanburg, said ULIMO is fully committed to the ongoing peace process and said they want the deployment of ECOMOG troops to be done simultaneously so that no one side will be put at a disadvantage. The LIBERIAN NEWS AGENCY [LINA] correspondent who traveled to Tubmanburg quoted Gen. Dumbuya as saying that ULIMO will do nothing to jeopardize the current peace process and regretted the current infighting which is causing more hardships for the residents. Gen. Dumbuya said Bomi, Lower Lofa, and Grand Cape Mount Counties are now calm and he appealed to humanitarian organizations to resume relief operations in those areas. The LINA correspondent said residents of Tubmanburg are yearning for deployment of ECOMOG troops in the city, considering the hardship being experienced in that area. The correspondent says Tubmanburg is hard hit by acute shortage of food, drugs, and other medical supplies as a result of the recent fighting.
