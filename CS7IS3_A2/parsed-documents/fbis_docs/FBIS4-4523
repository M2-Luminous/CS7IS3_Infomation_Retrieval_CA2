They decided that the two nations will continue efforts for a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue. The foreign ministers of two countries shared the view that for North Korea to resolve its nuclear issue through negotiations, North Korea should first accept the nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and should respond to North-South dialogue, and that China is playing an affirmative role for a change in the North Korean attitude. During the talks, the foreign ministers of two nations shared the understanding that in the event that North Korea refuses IAEA nuclear inspection in defiance of the statement by the UN Security Council president, hard-line countermeasures, including UN applied sanctions, will be inevitable. Thus, it is likely that the two foreign ministers discussed concrete measures for sanctions. At the same time, Foreign Ministers Han Sung-chu and Hata agreed to work out promptly the follow-up programs discussed during the ROK-Japan summit last month, including the plan to support permanent repatriation of Korean compatriots in Sakhalin. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa tomorrow and will explain to him the result of the ROK-PRC summit and joint measures on the North Korean nuclear issue, which were discussed between the ROK and the United States during his visit to the United States.
