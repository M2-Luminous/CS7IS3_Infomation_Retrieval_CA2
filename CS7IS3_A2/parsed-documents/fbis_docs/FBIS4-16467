The Duma Hoped To Begin Its Consideration on Friday"] [Text] Three days before the parliament's lower chamber was to begin discussing the budget, the State Duma's Economic Policy Committee decided to send it back to the government for amendment. The committee's conclusion on the draft federal budget for 1994 says in particular that the "authenticity" of the macroeconomic forecast underlying the draft budget "causes great doubts," proceeding from the correlation of the GNP deflation index in the first quarter compared to the same period in 1993 (7.8 percent). True, the Finance Ministry also criticized the deflation indicators included in the so-called "second" version of the "forecast." The authors of the conclusion believe that the rate of inflation, as well as of production decline, will be much higher than the forecasted level, and furthermore they assess as "unrealistic" the estimated budget revenues and expenditures as shown in the draft. Second, the Economic Policy Committee considers the draft budget proposed by the government "inadequate" to the priorities of socioeconomic development "set forth in the program materials of the Russian Federation president and government." Analyzing the structure of federal budget expenditures, the committee deems it essential to state that "only such structural policy priorities as the development of the agro-industrial complex and the fuel and energy sector have been ensured state support," while "insufficient financing of major directions of structural and science and technical policy will not allow in 1994 to break the dangerous trends toward the country's de-industrialization and irreversible destruction of its scientific and technical potential." In addition, the committee believes that "a natural form of implementing structural policy priorities should be special-purpose federal programs approved by the State Duma for the entire period of their implementation." The Economic Policy Committee, furthermore, assesses as unsatisfactory the work to raise additional budget revenues. In this connection the committee recommends abolishing all concessions in paying taxes, customs duties, and other obligatory deductions that contradict current legislation and also fail to stimulate a growth of internal demand and do not arise from structural policy priorities. "In order to assist the Russian Federation Government in finalizing the draft federal budget," the committee proposes that a parliament-government commission be set up to draw up a realistic forecast for the Russian Federation's economic development in 1994 and 1995; that the 1994 draft budget be reworked on a quarterly basis; and that coordinated targets for state economic policy in 1994 and 1995 be elaborated as well as programs for their implementation, in accordance with the provisions of the presidential message and recommendations of parliamentary hearings in the State Duma.
