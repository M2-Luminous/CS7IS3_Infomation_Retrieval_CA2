Zhou Duo who had worried about being allowed back after a year's stint in the United States is trying to set up a foundation to finance education. In Shenzhen last week, he said he would get the foundation going no matter what the government thought of it. "Although there is an official education foundation called Project Hope, it is not enough to solve all the problems," he said. His foundation, he said, would try to raise the quality of education. This was not confrontational towards the government, he said. He said he had good connections with some private enterprises and was confident he could raise the necessary funds. Mr Zhou, a prominent sociologist, was one of the prime movers of the Tiananmen Square protest in June 1989. Describing himself as a moderate, he said he supported rule by the Communist Party for now. "There is no alternative party powerful enough to take over from the Communist Party, so there is no choice but to support it for the sake of stability," he said. But he thought the party should relax its grip on the media and allow opposition parties to flourish. The party should eliminate dictatorship and become "open-minded" to save itself. Mr Zhou suggested a step-by-step reform for the party, allowing popular elections in localities, introducing rule by law and strengthening the powers of the National People's Congress, giving up some of its monopoly on benefits and sharing them with the people. He is concerned about stability in the post-Deng Xiaoping era and has urged experimentation in various styles of government. Mr Zhou said intellectuals should get more involved in the modernisation drive. He said a hands-off attitude on the part of intellectuals had allowed Mao Zedong's disastrous Cultural Revolution. Intellectuals now were too absorbed in their professions and too short-sighted, he said. Mr Zhou said intellectuals could help out in the modernisation drive through education. Intellectuals should help the government in that area, he said. "Education is very important in promoting a democracy among the people. China cannot build a really democratic system with a population which is poorly-educated and which does not understand what is rational," he said. During his stay in the U.S., mainly at Harvard as a visiting scholar, he was impressed by the sight of primary students being taken into Congress to learn about democracy. Mr Zhou said he developed a great admiration for the American system, impressed by people's politeness and the efficiency of the administration. But he missed China. "My heart beat faster every time I read the overseas edition of the PEOPLE's DAILY. I missed China so much. Now I'm so very glad to be back on the soil of my own country."
