The information ministers of Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia, and delegations representing Kuwait, the Sultanate of Oman, Palestine, Malaysia, Senegal, and the General Secretariat of the Islamic Conference Organization are taking part in these meetings. Addressing the conference, Information Minister Muhammad Salman spoke about the importance of this meeting. He said: This meeting is aimed at following up the implementation of resolutions and recommendations reached during the previous conference. It is being held during critical circumstances in light of major international developments. This requires us to increase our coordination and integrate our joint efforts to implement these resolutions and recommendations. This should guarantee more strength and effectiveness for our joint efforts in the media field in order to reinforce the prestige and role of the peoples of our Islamic states in the world community and assist them to achieve progress, growth, and freedom under a new international order that is not established at the expense of our Islamic peoples but based on the principle of equality, parity, dialogue, and positive and constructive interaction among peoples. This new international order should guarantee for our peoples the achievement of freedom and sovereignty on their territories and the realization of a just and comprehensive peace that returns the occupied Arab territories in Palestine, southern Lebanon, and the Golan to their owners. This peace should also secure the rights of the Arabs and Muslims to holy Jerusalem, the Muslims' first qiblah [the direction a Muslim faces while praying], as emphasized in the Cairo media declaration issued in the second conference held by the information ministers of Islamic states. The information minister also called for further coordination among Islamic states in all media fields in order to enhance the effectiveness of the media in Islamic states by taking advantage of new technological developments to accentuate the image of Islam and Muslims in a manner that confirms the importance of Islam and its great role in emphasizing respect for the human being and his right to justice, peace, progress, and freedom. Dr. Muhammad Salman added: Syria has participated in this march of our Islamic states toward joint media action from the time it was first launched at the conference in Jeddah, out of its firm belief in the great role that could be played within this joint Islamic framework in serving the issues of our countries and lifting injustice and deceit. Syria believes that the rapid international changes require us to focus on practical solutions and realistic visions in order to serve our joint causes. We believe that this meeting and the resulting recommendations will be an additional and blessed step which we hope will further strengthen this joint media action aimed at serving our people's interests. Dr. Muhammad Salman arrived in Cairo this afternoon to take part in the meetings of the follow-up ministerial committee of the second conference for information ministers of Islamic states which is scheduled to last two days. He was received at Cairo International Airport by Egyptian Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif, Syria's Ambassador in Cairo Dr. 'Isa Darwish, the two assistants of the Egyptian information minister, and a number of top Information Ministry officials. Dr. Muhammad Salman responded to reporters' questions at the airport. He said he was happy to meet with Safwat al-Sharif, the information minister of sisterly Egypt, which is taking part in the meetings of the follow-up committee of the conference held by the information ministers of Islamic states. He said: During the committee's meetings, we will discuss the means to formulate recommendations that will help guide our future action in the media field. Responding to a question on media cooperation between Syria and Egypt, the minister said: We are working together for the integration of the Syrian and Egyptian media in various arenas. He added: The Egyptian information minister and I are seeking to achieve a new qualitative move toward developing these relations in order to reaffirm political relations between the two countries and between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Husni Mubarak. On the results of the Geneva summit, the information minister said: The summit was clear. Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton openly responded to all questions. It remains for the Israeli side to respond to the results of the summit. Dr. Salman spoke about the role of the Syrian media after the Geneva summit and said: The media do not represent an independent policy, but embody the Syrian policy trends on various levels. He added: We are seeking to develop and promote the media up to the level of the policy drawn and led by President Hafiz al-Asad. [passage omitted]
