Additional forces of the militia will be pulled in from other cities and rayons of the kray. It is planned in the very near future to organize inspections of the gang "haunts" and secret addresses and the motor transport and papers of all suspects, which will last for several months. So concentrated an assault on the city's crime is connected with the events that occurred at the end of last week and the start of this, when several militia officers were killed and wounded. In retaliation, 145 persons were detained and eight guns and seven radios were confiscated in literally a matter of days. The militia officers arrested 45 persons at a gathering of crime groupings, at which narcotics, weapons, $55,000, and approximately R50 million were confiscated.
