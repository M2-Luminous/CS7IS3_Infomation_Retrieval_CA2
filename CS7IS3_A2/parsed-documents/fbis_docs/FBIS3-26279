Ai Pishan, chief of the provincial public security department attended and addressed the meeting. He stressed: As the Spring Festival is approaching, public security institutions at all levels should devote much attention to cracking criminal offenses and improving social order to ensure that the people will spend the Spring Festival peacefully and harmoniously. He pointed out: Last year Shaanxi made gratifying achievements in cracking down on crime. But serious crimes will still remain prominent for a period of time to come. Public security institutions at all levels in the province should continue to persist in the policy of severely cracking down and striking relentless blows at all criminal offenses. Particular attention should be paid to cities and towns where major crimes frequently occur, and to factories, mines, and economic development zones along railways and highways where the situation in social order is complicated. Great importance should be attached to severe crackdowns on crime in Xian and Baoji. [passage omitted]
