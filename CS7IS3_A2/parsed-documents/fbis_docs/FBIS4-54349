"I couldn't have easily given such a promise at the time, as it would have had to be followed through by the incoming government. Common sense rules out such an idea," Hata said. "Such expectations were voiced but how could I give such a promise," he added. In its Thursday evening issue, the Japanese business daily NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN quoted a high-ranking U.S. Government official as saying Hata promised the permanent tax cuts to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor when they met at the signing ceremony for the Uruguay Round of multilateral world trade talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, in April. Hata, then still foreign minister under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, reportedly agreed to a three-year lag between the implementation of income tax cuts and the introduction of new taxes to boost Japan's economy. The daily also reported that Washington takes the alleged Hata promise as a premise for resumption of the stalled framework talks on bilateral trade.
