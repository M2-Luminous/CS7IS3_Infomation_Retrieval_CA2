Marchuk with an open letter. Mr. Koval asserts that, despite the fact that his organization has been registered by the Ministry of Justice, officials of Ukraine's Security Service are closely "watching" DSU members: They exert political pressure upon them, try to recruit them, and conduct surveillance. Therefore, in R. Koval's opinion, Ukraine's Security Service, in fact, drives the organization headed by him to embark upon the road of illegal activity and extra-parliamentary struggle for Ukrainian independence. Mr. Koval calls upon General Marchuk to stop secret surveillance over DSU members or, otherwise, they will have to turn to judicial bodies and sue Ukraine's Security Service. However, if Ukraine's Security Service opts to work for Ukraine, the DSU chairman promises it his organization's assistance.
