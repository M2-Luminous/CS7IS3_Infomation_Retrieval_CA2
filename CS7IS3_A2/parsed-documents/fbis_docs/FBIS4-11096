Furthermore, Father Aristide, who was speaking in front of the World Affairs Council [previous three words in English] in San Francisco on 18 April, reproached the Clinton government for giving the impression of withdrawing in the face of armed bands supported by the Haitian military. In the face of some hooligans, the most powerful country in the world cannot pretend that they are stronger than they, he asserted, pointing up until now he had urged his partisans to remain in Haiti to work for democracy instead of trying to reach the coasts of Florida. Aristide pointed out that henceforth it would be cynical to maintain this recommendation in light of U.S. inaction. The Clinton administration said last week that it would continue to follow the democratic path while seeking a solution, but that it did not exclude other options. The day before, the president of the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives requested U.S. military intervention to put an end to the military regime in Haiti.
