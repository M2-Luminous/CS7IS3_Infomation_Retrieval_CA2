This charter makes provision for "presenting and supporting a joint candidate at the next presidential election" and "giving the men and women who support the UPF's values" the responsibility for choosing this candidate according to a system inspired by the American model, in which the Democrat and Republican Parties leave it to their respective supporters to appoint their candidate before he runs for the U.S. Presidency. [LE FIGARO] [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard said just yesterday that Edouard Balladur was the best candidate for the 1995 election. Are you not pleased that the presidential campaign has already been launched, given that you like political contest so much? [Pasqua] I do not think it is a good thing. The prime minister reminded the members of his government -- and he was right to do so -- that he did not want anybody to become involved in the presidential debate before the end of the year. [LE FIGARO] He was not heeded, even by his own people.... [Pasqua] He ought to reaffirm this rule. To all, including those loyal to him. It is too soon to talk of the presidential election now. But what is more serious is the fact that great inconsistency is appearing in the majority leaders' political approach. We have two elections this year: the canton elections and the European elections. In the first, in most cantons, we -- the RPR, UDF, and the government -- will support majority union candidates in the first round. In the second, from what I understand, the majority parties have decided to draw up a single list. This union list will therefore be supported by the RPR, the UDF, and the government. But in the following election -- the presidential election -- despite the pledges made by the parties forming the existing majority, the possibility of presenting several candidates is being considered! I find it difficult to understand the rationale behind this approach. [LE FIGARO] So, you will revive your plan for primaries enabling the majority voters to decide between the RPR and UDF candidates before the first round. [Pasqua] This is a pledge which we made solemnly to our voters. It was approved by the RPR and UDF, and signed by Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac. We took this course because the primaries make it possible to present a union candidate from the first round. There would be nothing worse for the current majority than to be divided. However, now, if nothing is done, we can be certain that there will be several majority candidates in 1995. [LE FIGARO] How many? [Pasqua] Two, three, four... However, this is to misunderstand the deep-seated feelings of the voters. The French people want union. Last March, they voted for a united majority and they want the government to shoulder its responsibilities for maintaining that union. [LE FIGARO] So, you will revive the primaries process... [Pasqua] We who were behind this approach, in the RPR and UDF, will meet next week and see what conclusions we must draw from the present situation. [LE FIGARO] In other words? [Pasqua] We will revive the idea of primaries. In my capacity as interior minister, I think my main political responsibility is to make every effort to maintain and develop the majority union. [LE FIGARO] When will you submit this plan? [Pasqua] This plan will have to be submitted in the spring session. Everybody will then shoulder his responsibilities. Those who prefer several candidates, in other words division and the risk of defeat, will have to say so publicly. They will not only have to say so, but will have to shoulder their responsibility in Parliament. [LE FIGARO] So, you are still in favor of a single majority candidate for the forthcoming presidential election? [Pasqua] I always have been. I am more than ever. [LE FIGARO] Several prominent members of the majority point out that submitting your plan in the spring session will mean the majority discussing the presidential election from the spring, which conflicts with the prime minister's wish for this debate not to be started until 1995. [Pasqua] No. We will discuss the election itself, but not the candidates! My problem is not one of candidates. I am not deciding in favor of one candidate rather than another. I am saying that since there is a risk of division, we must provide ourselves with the means of avoiding that trap. And the system of primaries is a means of avoiding it. [LE FIGARO] In a democracy, and especially with a two-round election, is it not natural for several candidates to stand for election? Does the first round not provide an opportunity to distinguish between them? [Pasqua] In a democracy, it is natural for several prominent people to feel that they have the abilities required to lead the country. But, if the current process is allowed to run its course, we will have two candidates in the majority appointed by the parties, in addition to those who reject this rationale. As for distinguishing between them in the first round, the last two presidential elections -- in 1981 and 1988 -- should give us pause for thought. [LE FIGARO] How do you intend to impose this system of primaries, when you know that its main objective is first to settle an internal majority problem, between Jacques Chirac, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and now Edouard Balladur? [Pasqua] But this system can also be used on the Left! At all events, those who do not wish to submit to it, will not do so. [LE FIGARO] According to its chairman, the UDF will not submit to it. [Pasqua] That is not a problem. The UDF has signed an agreement with the RPR. If these two parties think that their signatures are not binding, they will have to say so to the French people. And everybody will draw their conclusions. [LE FIGARO] But it is not betraying a secret to say that the prime minister is not in favor of your plan for primaries... [Pasqua] The prime minister is neither in favor of it nor against it. He does not intend to be involved for the time being. As far as I am concerned, I have already said, and I repeat that I will not allow a process of majority disunity to be started without reacting. [LE FIGARO] What fate do you reserve for people who do not submit to your system? [Pasqua] There are two hypotheses: Either this system is implemented or it is not. If it is not, this system will have had no negative impact on the majority because we will be back where we started. If the system is implemented, it is quite obvious that those who submit to it will accept its rules. This means that a candidate will emerge and that he will immediately be supported by millions of French people. He will therefore have a considerable advantage over those who have not submitted to the primaries and who would nonetheless like to be candidates. There will be a union candidate and the others will be candidates of division. [LE FIGARO] Do you think there is now a majority in the Assembly to adopt a system of primaries? [Pasqua] I do not see why the deputies should be less aware than the voters of the need for union, of the necessity to have a single candidate, whoever he might be. I am not saying: It must be Mr. X or Mr. Y. I am saying: There must be a union candidate. Just as I said: We must have a union list for the European elections and, once we reach agreement on a union list, the name of the person heading the list is not very important. In the parliamentary, canton, and European elections, we are united. In the municipal elections, the RPR and UDF are currently reaching agreement on union candidates in all communes with more than 30,000 inhabitants. In short, for all elections, and especially when there is an election based on a list of candidates and there are 80 places to be allocated, we have a union. And, for the presidential election, for which there is only one position, we will have a fight among several candidates? That is an inconsistent approach! Explain that to the French people.... [LE FIGARO] What do you say to those who think that a single majority candidate from the first round of the presidential election would dry up the reservoir of majority votes? [Pasqua] You will certainly have Ecologist candidates, a National Front candidate, perhaps Philippe de Villiers, and probably others... But, if there is a majority union candidate in the first round, it is not impossible that there will only be one round. At all events, to guide the country's development, and give it the necessary impetus, we need a candidate who has attracted a large number of votes in the first round. [LE FIGARO] If a single candidate is needed, should there not also be a single majority party? [Pasqua] I am one of those who think that the foundations of a big single party will be laid in the presidential election -- a party which will unite all those who have decided to support the new president. [LE FIGARO] Are you thinking of a merger between the RPR and UDF? [Pasqua] I am not thinking of a merger. But given that we will have presented joint candidates in all the elections, the single movement will exist. In practice. [LE FIGARO] What form do you think this system of primaries should take? [Pasqua] What is certain is that the studies we have carried out in the Interior Ministry show that the organization of primaries is possible, that this system cannot be compulsory, and that it cannot be imposed on the political parties by law: The Constitution states that the parties are free to organize and administer themselves. All we can do is make primaries possible and ensure that they cannot be attacked at constitutional level. It is in this framework that we are examining the question. [LE FIGARO] When do you think these primaries will take place? [Pasqua] At the end of 1994 or beginning of 1995. [LE FIGARO] Holding them in 1994 would conflict with the prime minister's wishes. [Pasqua] If we reach agreement on there being just one candidate, we can wait until 1 January 1995, or even 1 February 1995. That simply presupposes that the candidates for the presidential election should be known in the final weeks of 1994. [LE FIGARO] When will the presidential election be held? [Pasqua] On 16 and 30 April at the earliest. On 23 April and 7 May at the latest.
