A group of six foreigners was detained by the guerrillas along with Cambodian marchers for several hours Saturday, Liz Bernstien said. The group was marched into the forest where they met a guerrilla commander who later said they were free to go and told a Cambodian marcher to guide them back to the peacewalk. The Khmer Rouge stole cameras watches and other valuables but released the group unharmed, she said. Earlier Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk expressed sorrow and outrage over the Khmer Rouge attack on the march which left three Buddhists dead as well as the foreigners and others missing. "I would like to express my condolences and sorrow to Maha Ghosananda, the monks, laymen, compatriots and foreign friends...who sacrificed to serve the ideals of peace, national reconciliation, non-violence, and friendship through the peaceful ways of our Lord Buddha," the king said in a statement. A spokesperson for the march, known as the "Dhammayietra Walk for Peace" and organised by Cambodian spiritual leader Maha Ghosananda, said one Buddhist monk, a nun and a layman were killed and at least three other monks were injured in the attack. Police in Battambang however reported that four people had died in the attack. King Sihanouk advised that the peace march be cancelled to avoid "other accidents which could...happen again." The marchers were attacked by Khmer Rouge guerrillas late Saturday near Bavel district in Battambang province, the police said. They were being escorted by government soldiers when the guerrillas attacked with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, a police officer in Battambang said. An injured monk, one of three brought to Battambang hospital, told AFP that many people ran into the forest when the guerrillas attacked. The guerrillas then robbed the marchers of valuables, march spokeswoman Nou Sambo said. King Sihanouk said in the statement that the Khmer Rouge were "responsible for this sad and tragic act," and asked them to "cease their violent ways." Some 1,000 marchers set out on 400 kilometer (250 mile) walk from Battambang on April 24. Their route was to take them along National Route 10 to the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin, and then on to the heavily mined and strife-torn regions of northwestern Cambodia before ending at the temples of Angkor Wat. But Maha Ghosananda decided to change the course Saturday after heavy fighting between the government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas blocked the march's progress along Route 10 and after the radical faction refused to give a guarantee of safe passage. Another spokeswoman for the march expressed her indignation at the attack. "How can the Khmer Rouge dare attack Buddhist monks like that? When will our country ever have peace?," Kong Nary said late Saturday. "When they attack the Dhammayietra, it's just like they attack the nation," she said. Maha Ghosananda, who has been labelled the "Gandhi of Cambodia" and has been nominated for a Nobel peace prize, led two previous walks through the militarily volatile provinces to call for peace in Cambodia, one in 1991 and the other in the run-up to the May 1993 UN-organised elections. Bernstein, an American who lives here and works with Maha Ghosananda, said the guerrillas opened fire on two government soldiers who were walking in front of the peace march near Kompong Pouy about 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Battambang. A monk and a nun were shot dead and six other people, including four monks, were injured, Bernstein said. Other monks pleaded with the government soldiers not to fire back. A guerrilla leader later apologised and said his men didn't intend to kill the monk and nun. Around six other foreigners were on the march but were further behind and were not stopped by the guerrillas.
