Neither Government Nor Parliament Prevents It From Being Examined More Frequently"] [Text] After a long and stormy session on 15 April the State Duma adopted the draft budget submitted by the government as a basis and proposed that the government make changes to the basic features of the document within two weeks and submit it for first-reading examination by the Duma. The difficulty and complexity of the debate clearly showed how vulnerable the current budget is to criticism. Undoubtedly it was better-prepared than previous ones, the methods used to draw it up had changed, there were virtually no secret or hidden articles, the foreign economic activity section had been fundamentally altered, and it proposed for the first time introducing a system of transfer payments [transferty] to support needy Federation components. The budget is very realistic and describes the difficult position of the Russian economy without embellishment. It retains the best features of the financial stabilization program that was begun in 1993 and makes it possible to reduce the inflation rate to 9-10 percent a month. Adoption of the budget will make it possible to finance a whole host of highly important programs that are being put off owing to the lack of a budget. Payments on domestic debt -- on commodity bonds, checks, and targeted deposits -- will increase sharply. And it is not even a question of erroneous figures, although there are some of those. There are some fundamental grounds for concern. The most important problem is the delay in the submission [predostavleniye] of the budget for a year and the lack of a number of fundamental decisions on fiscal and customs policy. We are well aware of the consequences that this delay will have. Two options could operate in the future -- either the scrupulous work on the 1994 budget (during which it will be necessary to make substantial changes to tax and budget legislation) will continue, or work on the budget will be concluded as quickly as possible and attention turned to implementing fiscal and customs reform and to preparing the 1995 budget on time. Both of these things cannot be done at the same time. If the first option is followed, the annual budget will be adopted only late in the fall and Russia will go into 1995, once again, without a budget. In the second instance we would lose a little as regards the current budget, but we would prepare properly for 1995. The budget's clear deficiencies include clearly overstated levels of tax revenue, traditionally understated expenditure on education, health care, science, culture, and social welfare, huge amounts of administrative expenditure, and the retention of many unjustified tax and customs concessions. The budget was drawn up on the basis of a proposal on the need to repeal many articles of laws and paragraphs of edicts and decrees that are leading to increased spending. These laws, edicts, and decrees should now be altered or suspended. In order to imagine how unwieldy this work will be, we need only mention that it was initially proposed to alter almost 100 documents involving around 90 trillion [rubles] in expenditure. The two weeks spent on finalization were not wasted by the government. Numerous additional materials and calculations envisaged by the law on the foundations of the budgetary system and the budgetary process were sent to parliament. Draft amendments have been made to existing legislation. Individual features of the budget have been altered. The proposed amounts of revenue from excise duties on consumer goods have been lowered. The government has recognized that it is impossible to levy a 35-percent excise duty on machines produced. By repealing concessions and doing a better job of collecting taxes it is planned to increase revenue from import-export duties by R2.4 trillion and to increase targeted levies for the provision of financial aid to the agro-industrial complex and the coal industry by R1.1 trillion. It is additionally planned to obtain R1 trillion from privatization and R1 trillion from oil excise duties. More than R9 trillion will additionally be channeled into agriculture, of which R2.4 trillion will be used for capital investment in targeted programs such as "Baby Food," "Sugar," and so forth; and it is planned to allocate R5.6 trillion for the creation of federal and regional food funds. The principle of food being purchased at home rather than abroad will finally be laid down. Spending on television, radio broadcasting, support for the periodical press, health care, and youth policy will be increased. But even the government-amended version of the budget conceals major problems. The most obvious is the increase in the budget deficit. Income has increased by R3.8 trillion, spending by R10.2 trillion, and the deficit by R6.4 trillion to stand at R68.8 trillion (9.5 percent of GDP). This is a huge figure. The deficit is far more than R1,000 per day for everyone in the country, including the old and infants. The sources used to fund it are mainly inflationary -- Central Bank credits of R44.4 trillion and R19.3 trillion in foreign loans. Nonetheless, the proposal from the "Yabloko" faction to increase the deficit to 43-45 percent of spending is a powerful one. With the planned level of income this would come to more than R93 trillion. There is no way to fund this deficit apart from bank loans, and this means that instead of last year's R10 trillion, we would have to borrow R70 trillion from the Central Bank this year. There would be another cascade of worthless bank notes without any backing whatsoever, and prices would skyrocket. The purposes for which it is proposed to use the additional funds are very attractive -- structural changes to the economy and increased financial support for the regions. But are they feasible? Suppose the state once again, as in the days of old, were to distribute another R20 trillion in capital investment to "priority" and "key" sectors -- what then? Would we have to send out armed men to guard every ruble? Remember the archetypal example of the "GAZ" Plant, which used its tax concessions not for investment but to buy vouchers. With inflation and with salaries constantly having to be paid, who will voluntarily invest money if there is little chance of making a profit? The territories undoubtedly need help. And it is correct if we are pursuing a policy based on the principle of "take from whoever has anything left and give to those who shout loudest." The Finance Ministry wants to switch to transfer payments worked out on the basis of a single method. Except that there is one coefficient that would be out of place. In order to determine whether a region needs subsidies, it will now be necessary to compare per capita income in the given territory with Russia as a whole, and if the territory figure is higher than the Russian figure the region will get no subsidies. But prevailing price levels are not taken into account. For instance, if per capita income is R200,000 in Russia as a whole, R199,000 in Krasnodar Kray, and R201,000 in Krasnoyarsk Kray, then Krasnodar Kray will get the money -- and the fact that budget expenditure should objectively be higher in the North will not be taken into account. The State Duma committees' conclusion about the draft budget proposes retaining at last year's level the proportion of funds transferred from federal budget funds to territories' budgets, as well as the proportion of taxes and imposts retained by Federation component budgets. At first glance this looks right, but there are serious objections. First, the budget simply does not have this money. Second, if funds are sought by increasing the budget deficit, price growth will just "eat up" the entire benefit of the extra money. Third, we cannot retain last year's unfair distribution system, whereby funds were collected from a handful of industrial territories and distributed among most of the other Federation components. We need to make substantial amendments to both the revenue and expenditure sides of the budget. The main thing in our further work on revenue is to prepare for tax reform. To my mind, the approach should be extremely simple. First and foremost, we need to abolish existing individual concessions -- this mainly applies to exports of goods. We need to step up tax organs' work in collecting taxes -- above all, in the trading sphere and those sectors of the economy where "black cash" (that is, money that is unaccounted-for) traditionally looms large. Distributing taxes equally among all payers will make it possible to lower tax rates. It is time to get rid completely of the taxation of profits used for investment. We can only welcome the government's resolute steps in respect of the state monopoly on liquor and tobacco products. It is time to increase tax on individuals' excess income and, on the other hand, to restore the former tax-exempt status of certain amounts of material aid, prizes, and gifts. Nor should concessionary travel be taxable. How are we to explain to pensioners that they should pay out almost their entire pension in taxation on free travel? Serious changes are also needed on the expenditure side of the budget. First and foremost, we need a careful and planned reduction in spending on the bloated administrative apparatus -- there are some clearly unrealistic targets [obyekty] in the investment section as well. On the other hand, the problem of reforming the wages system has not been resolved and there is no funding for a whole host of highly important social and cultural projects. The Army and defense enterprises also need support.
