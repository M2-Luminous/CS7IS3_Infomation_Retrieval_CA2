After overcoming the barrier built by the radicals who, in the opinion of the candidate's staff are the only ones who can make him lose the election, the campaign has gained the tone of anticipated victory. Lula believes his adversaries have helped a lot by engaging in actions that can be easily criticized. He is now focusing his attention on Planalto Palace. He is currently working on the basis of winning in the first round. He will try to show both home and abroad that he is capable of governing without the rancid leftist taste of the radicals who have infested the PT. He assures that his government will have a broad base, not from the viewpoint of ideology but of ethics, with a commitment to the interests of the majority. To show this broadness, last Fridya, one of Lula's closest advisers reminded a group at the Petronio Portela hall in the Senate that when Itamar Franco took over, Lula defended the continuation of Adib Jatene at the Health Ministry. This shows that Lula is not prejudiced against inviting a former secretary of the Paulo Maluf government to join his team, provided, of course, he supports the party program. The idea is difficult to implement, but it reflects maturity. This is the position Lula will use when he arrives in the United States on 7 May for a five-day visit to New York and Washington. He will introduce himself as a future Brazilian president, committed to reactivating Latin America's largest country. It is a major step that should be matched by his actions. He has a busy agenda. Since Bill Clinton, Hillary, and Al Gore have already said they will not meet with candidates, no meeting has been sought. The White House couple has its own domestic CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee] problems, which we have already experienced here. Lula will contact the State Department, the House of Representatives, and will deliver a briefing at the Senate. He will meet businessmen, grant interviews to THE WASHINGTON POST and THE NEW YORK TIMES, and talk with representatives of nongovernmental organizations and with environmentalists. To the latter, he hopes to convey a good image because, as Lula's external affairs advisers have warned, they strongly influence U.S. foreign policy. Brazilian news abroad has recently been quite negative, with child prostitution, the killing of minors, a sizable robbery in congress, etc., and so Lula will say that the country needs a "social reform shock" and that to this end it must be politically and economically stable. The national project that Lula will outline abroad seeks economic stability through reforms in order to end the social marginalization of the majority of Brazilians. In the foreign policy field, Lula will try to debate Brazil's role in the world. He believes the country has no consistent foreign policy, not through any fault of Itamaraty but because of the lack of a national project. Lula says he considers the nationalist, development-oriented projects of the 1960's are exhausted, explaining that he rejects the neoliberal position under which the country should join the international economy in a subordinate position. He will explain that Brazil's problems with the United States are not ideological but economic and commercial. Lula may succeed in the country he will visit for the third time, yet he will have to face competition from Fernando Henrique Cardoso who, without doubt, is an internationally recognized figure because of his tenure at the Finance Ministry. Asked about this, PT Foreign Affairs Adviser Marco Aurelio Garcia hesitated for some seconds before replying: "Fernando Henrique is deja vu." Upon returning from the United States, Lula will return to his preferred public: the poor. An evaluation of the campaigns has revealed that the caravans were successful. The polls show that Lula's popularity grew from 18 to 36 percent thanks to his tours of Brazil, and so the formula will be repeated. This time it will be on a minor scale. He will choose places that are strongly affected by starvation and misery, and will spend two or three days listening to the have-nots. For example, he will go to the Fluminense area in Rio de Janeiro and to Ribeira Valley, in Sao Paulo State. The program for the World Soccer Cup has already been designed. Lula and his entourage will sail down the San Francisco River from Pirapora to Juazeiro, to symbolize national integration, which will be represented by the velho chico [not further identified]. This will end last week in July. The PT will then concentrate on television programs and on large rallies.
