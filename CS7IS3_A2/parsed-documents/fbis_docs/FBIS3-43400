Francisco Kuringana reports. The action took place precisely at a time when the aircraft which was carrying U.S. congressmen -- who were expected in Malanje today -- was about to land. Local circles view this as another maneuver aimed at interrupting on-the-ground observations of the main problems affecting thousands of citizens in this part of the country because of the war caused by UNITA and the problems experienced by the Angolan people in all fields.
