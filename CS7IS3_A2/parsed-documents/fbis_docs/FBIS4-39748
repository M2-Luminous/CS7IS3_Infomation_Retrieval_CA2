He Still Considers Voucher Privatization a Disaster"] [Text] It seemed that the battle of giants has come to naught: The triumphant statement by the State Property Management Committee [Goskomimushchestvo] Press Center, filled with the bombast of struggle in the course of which a revolt has been suppressed, speaks no more about Goskomimushchestvo's going to the Prosecutor's Office. The response note by the Moscow City Hall Press Center and Yuriy Luzhkov's statement yesterday also leave the mayor sticking to his anti-Chubays positions. Yesterday the Moscow City Hall Press Center circulated two statements by Yuriy Luzhkov, one of which was devoted to Chubays, and the other to security (in connection with the attempt on Berezovskiy's life). The statement devoted to privatization problems reads as follows: "I must calm Muscovites and those Russians who are still hoping to stop the catastrophe initiated by Mr. Chubays' foreign experts. I state officially that I not only have not stopped my struggle for a genuinely people's privatization but, in view of new facts coming to light, am going to intensify it." The last part of the document is an apotheosis of struggle for the rights of the down-and-outs: "For these and many other reasons I declare that a departure from our principles in this situation would be treachery with respect to the Muscovites." The Moscow mayor's sharp statement was backed up by an interview in the latest issue of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY. Observers have considered the battle in two dimensions: As a reflection of the actual economic interests of Moscow, aimed at addressing concrete tasks, and also as the first act in Yuriy Luzhkov's election campaign for the Russian presidency. Therefore, if we are to sum up the objective results of the multi-round battles, it becomes clear that the Moscow mayor has failed to stand up for the interests he had in mind when issuing the 1 April order. Moreover, according to sources in the presidential entourage, Luzhkov has even found himself in a somewhat weaker position with respect to the president. The Moscow mayor apparently officially had to abandon his claims to the presidency. But now Luzhkov will go to the very end, while the next Russian president will be either Boris Yeltsin himself or a person who receives power from his hands. (Scenarios for a tough political struggle and/or coups is a subject of separate conversation). So, what has Yuriy Luzhkov won? I venture to say that politically he has made considerable gains. In fact we have witnessed the Moscow mayor's first step from the position of a regional leader to the status of a national leader concerned not only about city problems. Any division of property in the end leads to its concentration in the hands of the minority, while the majority gets rich only in the process of steady economic development. Yuriy Luzhkov opposed voucher privatization in a loud and scandalous way, combining TV appearances with interviews circulated in 6.26 million copies. His arguments are simpler and more clear-cut than the positions of many opposition leaders who have not reached a common opinion and have weak publicity. Is there any need to say how this is important to a future contender in an election campaign, especially if the Moscow mayor's newly found charisma does not prevent him from remaining the president's trusted person? Should Yeltsin recognize that Luzhkov is right, Anatoliy Chubays, at the end of privatization, will be left one to one with the vouchers and their holders.
