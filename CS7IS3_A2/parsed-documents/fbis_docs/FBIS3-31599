[passage omitted] Ildiko Nagy reports: [Nagy] [passage omitted] The preparations for the big parliamentary battle did have one beneficial outcome: The Hungarian parliamentary parties and the Slovak opposition sat down at last at the negotiating table. We asked Bela Bugar [also known as Vojtech Bugar], chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, about the significance of this. [Begin recording] [Bugar] The opposition finally understood that it is not possible to leave out of this process the views of Slovakia's (?15) percent Hungarians, of their legitimate representatives. They were not even aware that while they needed the 14 votes [of the ethnic Hungarian coalition], they merely pushed the [voting] button; they did not even coordinate with us. We had asked for several things. In the end, we managed to agree that the government--that is, the government coalition, which would function until the elections, early elections--when it is formed, will not conduct a policy of confrontation vis-a-vis the minorities. Those methods that it will employ in its minority policy, it will coordinate with the recommendations of the Council of Europe. I know that this is not a great achievement; what is more, I would not even call this an achievement. But on the other hand we must also realize a number of things. One thing is that this government, when it is formed, will be able to function for six to eight months. Now it will not even be that long. Because it will depend on whether we manage to agree to get the Meciar government, let us say, to fall within a short time. The other thing is that it is in peoples' interest, as voting citizens, but I think of all of us, that Meciar's government should vanish very rapidly from the political scene. One only has to look: They privatize about 10 firms every day, which of course brings in large amounts of money, and one cannot say that the decisions are taken to the advantage of the voting citizen. Another thing is that this government cannot alter the political method that it has shaped here in the last two years. This [method] does not satisfy a single citizen of Slovakia. [Nagy] Will the agreement that has just come about between the Hungarian parties and the Slovak opposition parties be valid even if the new coalition government does not come into being? [Bugar] Perhaps I could put it this way: I am convinced that after yesterday's [18 February] discussions, and if our previous steps are taken into consideration, I think that not only Jan Carnogursky [chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement] and his people, but also the other political movements--perhaps with the exception of the Slovak National Party--will be ready for this agreement. So, I feel that by now a system has evolved in which we can cooperate. [end recording]
