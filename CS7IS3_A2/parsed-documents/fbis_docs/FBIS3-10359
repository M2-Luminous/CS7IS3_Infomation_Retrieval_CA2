According to the minister, if the legislative branch approves the measure, the possibility of running for president will be more remote. If the legislative branch rejects the measure, it would pave the way for his departure from the government and his involvement in the campaign. Already anticipating that the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] would strongly press him to become the party's presidential candidate, Fernando Henrique noted: "If Congress says no to my proposals, it would be the best way of making me a candidate. If Congress says yes, it would bind me. By saying no, Congress would liberate me. If Congress makes a drastic decision against my proposals, it is not necessary for me to remain in the government." The minister noted that it would not be viable to implement the new currency by 2 April when the deadline for the ministers who are also candidates to leave the government expires. Nevertheless, he cautioned that if prices run out of control, the government might advance the implementation of the new currency because the measure allows for the creation of the real at any time. Rates The provisional measure restores to the finance minister the power to establish rate increases in electricity, fuels, telecommunications, and postal services, among other services. According to Fernando Henrique, the governors may not increase the energy rates, for example, without previous approval by the ministry. The previous rules will be maintained: Once or twice a month the rates will be adjusted using the average rates of the past four months. Oligopolies The Finance Ministry has listed the prices for 470 products sold by oligopolies during the past three years. If there are any abusive increases, the minister noted, entrepreneurs will be summoned to give explanations. Fernando Henrique admitted that it will not be easy to negotiate with these sectors, which are responsible for 30 percent of the products included in the inflation rate. Nevertheless, he announced that the government might reduce import tariffs as a way of preventing excessive increases. The minister cautioned that it is not easy to negotiate with oligopolies "in Brazil or the United States." Minimum Wages Despite the fact that the government has formed a commission to study a way of increasing the minimum wage's purchasing power by 50 percent by the end of year, Fernando Henrique described this possibility as not viable. In his opinion, the commission will study if minimum wages can be increased, guaranteeing economic stability. Fernando Henrique noted that the decree forming the commission "is a sign that the government is not satisfied with minimum wages, that they are low." He used the occasion to satirize the trade unions that announced strikes against the losses caused by the conversion to the URV system. Public Deficit The minister guaranteed that the government managed to bring the public deficit to zero last year -- both the primary deficit (revenues less expenditures, not including interest) and the operational deficit (including expenditures and interest) -- at the expense of strongly curbing expenditures. He reported that the government now wants to guarantee a zero deficit without withholding the release of appropriations and without using the so-called inflationary tax that totaled about $12 billion last year. The minister hinted that the declining inflation rate will cause problems for state banks, which will have to introduce a strong adjustment to survive in a stabilized economy. He said: "There will be a shower of marches and protests by bank employees, especially Bank of Brazil employees, because the banks will have to streamline." Foreign Exchange Rate Despite the substantial entry of dollars, which causes problems in the management of the quantity of real cruzeiros circulating in the economy, the minister ruled out the possibility of implementing measures to restrict the entry of foreign capital into Brazil. According to the minister, the government has not officially put our national currency at par with the dollar, like in Argentina, in order to allow more leeway in establishing the foreign exchange rate. The goal is to prevent an overvaluation of real cruzeiros against dollars, which would discourage exports. Privatizations The minister announced that the government plans to sell its minority stock in public and private enterprises, including the National Iron and Steel Company, this week. Through privatizations, the government hopes to collect $900 million this year.
