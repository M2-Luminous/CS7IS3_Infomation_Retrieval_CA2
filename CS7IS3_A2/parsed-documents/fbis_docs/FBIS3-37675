ITAR-TASS learned that the Security Council meeting was called because of Russia's serious concern over the unclear situation with the use of the NATO air force against the Serbian heavy arms near Sarajevo, including those which could not be withdrawn on schedule because of bad weather. "The Russian Federation raised on Sunday afternoon the question about the convocation of the Security Council because the situation looked as though all the accords on Sarajevo could be disrupted because the Serbs left their arms to be taken over by the United Nations but the United Nations failed to take control because of snowfalls. We were very worried, because the weapons left uncontrolled by the U.N. forces could be seen as a bait for the beginning of air strikes, which are absolutely unnecessary in these circumstances," Russian ambassador to the United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov told ITAR-TASS. "This is why we convened the Security Council in order to draw the attention of all, including the U.N. forces, the U.N. secretary-general and his special envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, to the need to urgently take control over these weapons and preclude any possibility of unjustified air strikes, which could disrupt not only all accords on Sarajevo but also possible agreements on Bosnia and herzegovina. The moment was very tense, and this is why we convened the council," Vorontsov said. "At the meeting, we raised these questions and stressed that neither the U.N. secretary-general nor Akashi must forget that the "clues" to air strikes were in their hands, in the hands of the United Nations and its secretary-general, and that the NATO command may not launch air strikes on its own, when it is quite clear that the Serbs are abiding by the necessary conditions and complying with the obligations they assumed. "This is why we approached the U.N. secretary-general, the chairman of the Security Council and the council members to urge them to be most attentive to reminding the secretary-general that he is holding the key and that Mr. Akashi is on the spot and must see the situation as it really is, and not to open any "windows of possibility" for air strikes. "But when we were discussing this question, a report arrived from Akashi that he would not make any decisions because the Serbs were true to their word, that the weapons had been withdrawn and that he would take control over those arms that still remained in place quite soon. Our aim was achieved. The possibility of a technical error because of the snow, which could result in very complicated, bloody and possibly irreversible events, was closed," Vorontsov said. Responding to an ITAR-TASS question about the reaction of the Security Council members to Russia's intervention, Vorontsov said, "the members of the Security Council thanked the Russian side for the active part it took in solving this problem, for Russian President Boris Yeltsin's appeal to the Serb leaders and the attainment of the accord on the withdrawal of their arms from Sarajevo. They also appreciated the sending of Russian troops to Sarajevo. The troops are there and stationed close to Sarajevo, and this is seen as a good sign".
