The first, who claimed he was APLA Internal Commander Karl Zimbiri and used a pre-arranged codeword, said regional and sectional commanders as well as ground forces of the Pan Africanist Congress' [PAC] armed wing had met in Bloemfontein for five hours earlier in the day. While he respected PAC leader Clarence Makwetu, it was premature for Mr Makwetu to announce a moratorium in APLA's armed struggle. "We will strike tommorrow and today...We are always on the offensive," he said. Later on Monday night two men, calling within seconds of one another and claiming to be APLA commanders, also rejected any cessation of hostilities. Neither was aware of an identifying codeword. The man who said he was Ropa Hondo, "commander of special forces", stated: "APLA will not suspend the armed struggle and it is not true we have started to tell our forces on ground to prepare for a ceasefire or moratorium." Mr Hondo said he was calling from Grahamstown. "More blood will be spilled until the land is returned to its rightful owners, the toiling masses of Azania," he declared. Caller Hondo claimed APLA had always been suspicious of the PAC's participation in the World Trade Centre negotiations in Kempton Park and viewed the talks with contempt. Within seconds, [words indistinct] told SAPA Mr Makwetu's decision had not been welcomed "by me or by forces on ground". "Claims that the APLA leadership has begun informing cadres of the moratorium is a lie," caller Haladi said. He added that the PAC was moving away from its original policy of armed struggle, and that the decision to suspend the fight had been made by bourgeoisie politicians. "The armed struggle will continue until our people have bread and their freedom."
