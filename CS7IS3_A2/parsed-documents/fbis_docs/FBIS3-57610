The leader of the PRC said that he was glad about the meeting with the Russian minister and cited a Chinese proverb in this connection: "Meetings with old friends are a source of particular joy." Jiang Zemin recalled that during the visit to Beijing by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in December 1992, a conversation rich in content took place between the heads of the two states.

Kozyrev handed to Jiang Zemin a personal message from Boris Yeltsin containing an invitation to make an official visit to the Russian Federation.
