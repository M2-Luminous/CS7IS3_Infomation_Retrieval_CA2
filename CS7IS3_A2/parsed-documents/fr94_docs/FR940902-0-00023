ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (DOL) is amending the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) regulations to implement the Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992 and related statutes. Through these final regulations, the Department intends to direct the focus of JTPA training and employment programs on improving the targeting of JTPA services to those facing serious barriers to employment, enhancing the quality of services provided and program outcomes, strengthening fiscal and program accountability and the linkage between the services provided and local labor market needs, and fostering a comprehensive and coherent system of human resource services. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 30, 1995, except that the provisions of §627.201 shall be effective October 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James M. Aaron, Office of Employment and Training Programs. Telephone: (202) 219&hyph;6825 (this is not a toll-free number). Copies of this final rule are available in the following formats: electronic file on computer disk and audio tape. They may be obtained at the above office. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 13, 1982, the President signed into law the Job Training Partnership Act, Public Law 97&hyph;300. The stated purposes of the Act were ``to establish programs to prepare youth and unskilled adults for entry into the labor force, and to afford job training to those economically disadvantaged individuals and others facing serious barriers to employment who are in special need of such training to obtain productive employment.'' Title I of the Act sets forth general requirements for programs, as well as some requirements for State and local operation of programs. Title II provides requirements for State and local operation of adult and youth programs for the economically disadvantaged. Title III of the Act provides for operation of State and substate programs of employment and training assistance for dislocated workers. Title IV provides requirements for special programs for targeted groups, such as Native Americans, migrant and seasonal farmworkers, and veterans, as well as for the Job Corps and other specialized programs. Title V provides incentives to States to reduce welfare dependency and increase self-sufficiency for absent parents of children receiving aid to families of dependent children and blind or disabled individuals receiving supplemental security income under title XVI of the Social Security Act. The final rule, among other things, implements statutory requirements under the Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992 (JTPA Amendments), Public Law 102&hyph;367; the Nontraditional Employment for Women Act (NEW), Public Law 102&hyph;235; the Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Defense Authorization Act), Public Law 102&hyph;484; the Older Americans Act, as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;171; the Clean Air Act, Public Law 101&hyph;549; the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Worker Security Act, title V of Public Law 103&hyph;182 and the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, Public Law 103&hyph;227. While the programs are modified pursuant to statutory amendments and requirements, the delivery system for the JTPA programs under the final rule remains essentially the same as in pre-Amendment regulations. It does not have the financial or other impact to make it a major rule and, therefore, the preparation of a regulatory impact analysis is not necessary. See Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993. The Department of Labor (``DOL'' or ``the Department'') has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the final rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. No significant economic impact would be imposed on such entities by the final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, information collection requirements which would be imposed as a result of the final rule are being submitted separately to the Office of Management and Budget. Prior Actions The Department has conducted this rulemaking in an open and public manner. Since the enactment of the Amendments, Department officials have responded to numerous invitations to discuss the Amendments with organizations interested in the Amendments and proposed regulatory action. Additionally, a group of technical experts has offered suggestions to the Department on the proposed areas for regulatory action.
