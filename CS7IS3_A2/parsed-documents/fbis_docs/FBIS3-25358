More than 40 police were deployed at Nigeria Union of Journalists House before the arrival of Ransome-Kuti, preventing him and others from entering the conference hall, the witnesses said. The human rights activist later read the text of his speech, in which he called for the immediate resignation of the regime of Sani Abacha, in front of the hall to a crowd of journalists and human rights activists. The blockade was the second time in a month that the police tried to prevent a press conference in the same hall. On January 13, Chief Arthur Nzeribe, the leader of the Association for Better Nigeria, a pro-military group, was prevented by police from addressing the press at the same venue. Ransome-Kuti criticised the regime of General Abacha, who came to power in November after ousting the then civilian head of state, Ernest Shonekan. The human rights activist accused the present military leadership of "corruption," insincerity and political "gimmickry." The constitutional conference being planned for this quarter by the regime was a ruse by the administration to "consolidate its hold on political power," he said. He described some members of the National Constitutional Conference Commission, set up last month to prepare the conference as "bandits and discredited politicians." Ransome-Kuti called for the immediate resignation of Abacha's regime and the handover of power to a national government which would convene an alternative national conference. "We shall henceforth consult, organise and mobilise Nigerians against dictatorship", he stated. Meanwhile it was reported that General Shehu Musa Yar'adua, a former deputy head of state in the late 1970s, had been arrested last weekend by security agents. Yar'adua last month called on Abacha not to stay in power beyond December 31. The arrest, reported by the local press, has yet to be officially confirmed.
