Speaking to reporters during the intermission of the Beijing People's Art Theatre performance at the Victoria Theatre, he said the loss of his voice last week was due to a virus infection. He had been warded at the National University Hospital on June 8 for rest and observation after a routine medical check-up, which included an endoscopy of his stomach, colon, and rectum and was discharged last Saturday. He said that he developed a sore throat after the endoscopy procedure during which a tube-like instrument was lowered into his body. "I think I probably have some slight trauma to the throat after the procedure, but the loss of voice was due to a virus infection which occurred unfortunately at about the same time of the endoscopy," he said. He described the infection as a "coincidence, a rare coincidence." He said that since he was diagnosed as suffering fron low-grade lymphoma in l992 he has been going for regular check-ups. He has blood tests every two to three months and other tests such as computed tomography scans and X-rays once or twice a year. He added that when his lymphoma was first diagnosed, his doctors had not recommended treatment "but to wait and watch" for signs of progression of the disease. So far, they had not recommended any treatment. "I lead a normal life, I don't suffer from pain, so everything is normal," he said. [passage omitted]
