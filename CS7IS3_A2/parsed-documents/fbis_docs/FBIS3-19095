The United Nations is looking frantically for a further 10,000 blue berets to be deployed within the next few days in order to preserve the fragile cease-fire. Until now, nobody had requested Italian troops, given the rule which prohibits the United Nations from making use of military personnel from bordering countries or countries involved in previous conflicts (such as World War II), but in the face of desperate need, the British suggested a departure from that rule. The UN undersecretary for peace missions arrived yesterday in Rome. [Santevecchi] Mr. Annan, are you here to take up the offer of 1,700 soldiers which the government made in 1992? [Annan] The policy of ruling out bordering countries has not been changed yet. I have no requests to make, I am not here to negotiate, but to take part in a convention on UN reforming. True, the countries already involved in operations in the former Yugoslavia are saying that they already have done enough. Unless we find another solution fairly quickly, in the end we may have to drop that rule which so far has excluded Italy, Austria, and Turkey. This possibility is being discussed in New York. [Santevecchi] It has also been suggested that Italians could be sent to take over from other forces in hot spots that are not affected by the prohibition? [Annan] This would make no sense. Reinforcements are needed in Bosnia as soon as possible. Consider, for example, replacing forces deployed in Cyprus, Somalia, or Mozambique, with Italian troops. It would take too long and, besides, you cannot change a unit's operational area from one day to the next. At the most, we could send replacements to Croatia in order to be able to transfer units which are already incorporated in UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] from Croatia to Bosnia. [Annan ends] It sounded somewhat strange to discuss the possible deployment of Italian troops under the UN flag with a man who was one of the protagonists of last summer's "hot days," when he asked for, and obtained, the sacking of General Bruno Loi, who was guilty of having predicted, and stated, that by following a hard line and giving [Somali General] Aidid no quarter, Mogadishu would become an uncontrollable battlefield. This, of course, is exactly what happened. Moreover, today Kofi Ann will be sitting beside the "rebel" officer, since they will both be speaking at the meeting organized in Rome by the Disarmament Archive. [Santevecchi] Mr. Under Secretary, only yesterday Robert Oakley, former U.S. envoy to Mogadishu, admitted that "Italy, with its profound knowledge of Somalia, had understood the dangers involved in the operation much earlier than the Americans, who unfortunately only realized this too late." Oakley also asserted that the United Nations proved to be incapable of coordinating its efforts with the countries already involved in field operations. [Annan] (The Ghanaian diplomat nodded affirmatively, and then replied with frankness about the summer crisis between the United Nations and Italy and the brutality) No doubt some mistakes were made. Attention has focused too much on Aidid's personality, and on North Mogadishu. The fact that in the rest of Somalia the operation was largely successful, and that nobody is dying of starvation any longer down there, has not been sufficiently highlighted. But I think the main mistake, on the part of governments and public opinion alike, was expecting a rapid solution with no risks involved. In this sense, the problems we faced in Somalia have helped us clarify our ideas as regards future peacekeeping operations. As far as Loi is concerned, his fault lay in voicing his disagreement publicly. This is not allowed when you are part of an international force. (So, then, Annan and Loi are still "enemies.") [Santevecchi] Anarchy and partisan warfare will be resumed on a large scale. This is what most experts expect following Western disengagement. [Annan] Let me say that in all situations of this kind, the decisive thrust toward peace can only come from the local people and their leaders. The international community can only help. Discussions and negotiations are currently under way in Somalia among the various chiefs, including Aidid. I believe they now understand they cannot afford to miss this opportunity. I do not believe that the 20,000 blue berets that will remain there (Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese, Zimbabweans) will be subjected to systematic attacks. I do not rule out the possibility of skirmishes, banditry, but you will see, the situation will not return to what it was before the intervention. [Santevecchi] You seem to be engaged in a permanent quest for men and resources, a sort of door-to-door begging to obtain a few hundred blue berets. How can this be changed? [Annan] Currently we are engaged in negotiations with more than 50 states with a view to reaching permanent agreements. We want to know what resources these countries are ready to commit to the United Nations -- combat units, logistic support, medical units -- including the timescales and terms of this commitment. Then we will know what forces we can rely on. [Santevecchi] Mr. Annan, let us imagine that the "Folgore" [Division] arrives in the former Yugoslavia. What would you think if General Loi joined them, perhaps in command of the troops? [Annan] (Laughed, then was serious again) It is not UN policy to suggest to any country who should command their troops. That is all.
