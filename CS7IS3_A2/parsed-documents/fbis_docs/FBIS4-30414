On the same day, the ministry held the first meeting of the Export-Import Transaction Council (an advisory panel to the international trade and industry minister). It plans to work out conclusion in time for discussions on the ratification of the World Trade Organization (WTO) treaty scheduled for September. The Finance Ministry has also begun the study of import restraint measures at the Customs Tariff Council (an advisory body to the finance minister). The two ministries will work in closer cooperation through their councils to work out "Japanese-style import restraint" measures. The WTO treaty, which was signed in April following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks, authorizes a country to restrain imports as an emergency measure by such means as raising tariffs when a low-priced product is imported in large quantities. Although Japan has a system of imposing retaliatory tariffs or volume restraint, it seldom implements these measures because it takes a lot of time to do so in actuality. The WTO treaty approves of retaliatory measures when the treaty is violated. For example, if a textile product is imported in violation of the treaty, taking retaliatory measures against another product, like automobiles, is possible under the treaty. However, Japan has not yet decided on concrete retaliatory measures. Thus, the two councils will discuss what kind of retaliatory measures should be adopted. They plan to review the Customs Tariff Law and the Foreign Exchange Control Law, if necessary.
