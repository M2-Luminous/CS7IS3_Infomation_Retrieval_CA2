Nakhushev, by I. Mezova, under rubric "Politics": "Zaurbi Nakhushev: It's No Easy Life for the Speaker...: Interview With the Chairman of the Council of the Republic, of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] Parliament"] [Text] [Mezova] Well, Zaurbi Akhmedovich, like the Council of the Republic, which you head, Parliament has been working for one and a half months. That's a short period of time, but certainly something has already been done. Precisely what? [Nakhushev] We were elected as deputies on 12 December, but have been working less than a month. That is linked basically with installing Parliament. Naturally, not much has been done so far. We are basically working for ourselves: we adopted Provisional Regulations, confirmed the makeup of commissions, and elected their chairmen. There is also another important document in our assets: KBR Law entitled "The Making of Amendments and Additions to the KBR Constitution (Basic Law)." The plan for the legislative activity of the Council of the Republic for the next two months is almost ready, so the house is approaching the finishing line for creating legislation. Within the near future a commission to develop the draft of the KBR Constitution will be created. It would be a rather good idea to publish the draft in October in the mass media, and then, in November-December, to submit it for review by parliament. We are also engaged in preparing the republic's symbols -- the seal, anthem, and flag. We already have final versions of the seal and flag for submittal to the President. [Mezova] As an invited individual, you were present at the first session of the Council of the Federation. What were your impressions? [Nakhushev] Yes, for two days I was at sessions of the Council of the Federation. To tell the truth, it did not seem to me that discussions about the fact that the Council of the Federation is Boris Yeltsin's agency have sufficient foundation. The people who gathered in the house were the administrators of major enterprises in the defense industry, administration heads of krays and oblasts, Presidents, and well-known academicians -- in general, people who can make their own judgments with regard to all questions pertaining to the vital activity of the Russian state, people who are strong personalities, professionally speaking. The fact that Shumeyko headed the Council of the Federation has a positive role. The house immediately went to work. Also, he has an excellent knowledge of the government's kitchen, so to speak, from the inside. It will be easier to cooperate with him. [Mezova] Everyone says that the reforms will be rolled up. Is that correct? [Nakhushev] He (Vladimir Shumeyko) has stated frankly that we need supporters of the reforms that are being carried out by the government. In general, one thing is clear: the interaction between the Council of the Federation and the government will be good and stable. [Mezova] Since we have touched upon this topic, you apparently know that both the RF [Russian Federation] Parliament and the KBR are predicting the fate of the pocket parliament. What do you think such suppositions are based on? What is your attitude toward them? [Nakhushev] I have already said that the Council of the Federation produced a favorable impression on me. It seems to me that it will scarcely be a pocket parliament. Its makeup includes deputies who are rather independent and strong. Nevertheless I agree that they definitely are predicting. These discussions are occurring and probably contain a share of truth. But still the present Parliament is really not the Supreme Soviet, which used to engage in all state matters, and sometimes also usurped the functions of the executive power. It seems to me that these discussions are based on the fact that there has been a fundamental change in the functions and powers of the representative authority. Parliament will engage in the creation of legislation. It has retained the function of monitoring the execution of the laws and the executive power. In particular, it possesses powers concerning the expression of confidence or lack of confidence in Parliament. The budget is also in the joint jurisdiction of the houses. [Mezova] Are you saddened that Parliament's powers have been narrowed? [Nakhushev] In the broad sense Parliament actually does not possess the previous completeness of power. But that is what the division of powers is. Currently it is simply that people have not yet become accustomed to this, but in two or three years, I am convinced, this situation will not surprise anyone. Yes, we actually have been limited to a definite framework. Nevertheless, the Council of the Republic, like Parliament as a whole, will not be a pocket organization. I do not think that anyone, including the President, has an interest in this. We do not intend to cause any frictions in the interrelations with the other authorities. Each has its own functions and its own duties. [Mezova] You probably are already rather well acquainted with the deputies in your house. Are you pleased with the makeup of the house? What would you change if that depended on you? What kind of specialists (or individuals) would you prefer to have more of in the Council of the Republic? [Nakhushev] I cannot say that this acquaintance is as profound or complete as I would like, but I am satisfied with the deputy corps. People of different ages, with different knowledge and work experience, are represented in it. There are lawyers, entrepreneurs, three former school directors... I view their working ability optimistically. I hope that in a year our deputies who are working on a professional basis will actually become professionals. If, of course, we work... [Mezova] Do you mean that Parliament might be broken up or disbanded?.. [Nakhushev] No, no. If we work on ourselves. [Mezova] In the house there actually are people who evoke curiosity. But am I correct in saying that it does not contain, for example, any clearly expressed radicals? [Nakhushev] Apparently not. But I am completely happy with this makeup, although we do not have any people who are as well known in the republic as the Council of Representatives has. However, we do have people who are very interesting, and who evoke, as you have said, genuine curiosity. [Mezova] In general, how do you imagine the ideal parliamentarian? Do you see him in any concrete way -- in the present makeup of the Parliament or the former VS [Supreme Soviet], the present or former Parliament of the RF, or even the USSR? [Nakhushev] I am not confident that I am speaking about the finished image of the ideal parliamentarian, but, in my view, he is a restrained individual, who is very tactful and highly cultivated. It is not mandatory that he have several higher degrees. But he must also be consistent, competent, and be able to speak laconically and expressively. He must be a democrat in the true sense of the word, and an aristocrat at heart. Incidentally, in our house I see several persons who promise to become this kind of parliamentarian in the future. [Mezova] Could you name them? [Nakhushev] I shall not anticipate events. Nor shall I name real ones who have already distinguished themselves. Although, to tell the truth, I was not enraptured either by Sobchak or Popov, or even Sakharov, even at those times when everyone was delighted by them. At first I was irritated even by Yevdokiya Gayer. Do you remember that small woman? Then I learned to respect her, because it was obvious that she was speaking in a meaningful way and was genuinely experiencing what she was talking about and what she felt for her people. [Mezova] There have been a lot of discussions about the powers assigned to the houses. For example, certain deputies of the Council of Representatives assume that it would make sense to return to a division of them. What do you think? Which powers that are, in your opinion, the prerogative of the Council of the Republic have gone to the other house, or vice versa? [Nakhushev] When each deputy was elected, he knew about his powers according to the Statute that had been confirmed by the President of the republic. Each one know where he would be going and what he would engage in. Today people cannot engage in pulling the blankets over themselves. God willing, each one will be able to cope with his powers. I feel that our house has not been insulted by anyone. We have even shared a lot of them with the Council of Representatives with regard to confidence or lack of confidence in the Government. We also discuss the budget jointly. We have the responsibility for its initial review. There have been recommendations concerning the creation of joint commissions. They are, of course, necessary, but not too many of them. Why, then, was it necessary to divide parliament into two houses? Especially since that house is operating on an unrelieved basis, and it will not be convenient to convoke them each time. Everyone, so to speak, has his job to do, so let each person pull his own wagon honestly. [Mezova] People say that the parliament is being specially evicted from Government House allegedly to emphasize that the representative power is currently out of favor and is no match for the executive power. How would you comment of that? [Nakhushev] First, no one is evicting us. Second, I do not know that it is mandatory anywhere for the powers to be situated together. I do not think that it is worse for Parliament to have its own accommodations... [Mezova] Rather nice... [Nakhushev] If not fashionable. The building that housed the former Nalchik Gorkom of the CPSU, and that is being offered to us, is the second building in prestige after Government House. True, it will be slightly crowded for Parliament, and therefore a plan for expanding the building has been prepared. As for whether or not the representative power is a match for the executive, I have already said earlier that everyone should engage in his own job, and the better he performs it, the more everyone wins. [Mezova] The British Parliament, which is the ancestor of many parliamentary traditions, also gave birth to the job of speaker, which is already more than 600 years old. At first the speaker acted there in the role of the mouthpiece of the House of Commons. His basic purpose was to regulate order in conducting debates and in guaranteeing justice. In our conditions the speaker is assigned several other powers. What do you think they should consist of? [Nakhushev] I shall answer your question this way: the role of the speaker today is identical to the role of Parliament, and we have already touched upon that topic. Another important factor is the specifics that pertain to our republic. In general, at the present time, having worked a certain period of time, I can say that it's no easy life for the speaker, just as, incidentally, it's no easy life for the deputy. [Mezova] Do you think that the two houses of the KBR Parliament will maintain stable, even, professional interrelations? [Nakhushev] I feel that we have nothing to divide. Our tasks have been defined, and now it's simply a matter of executing them. Each house has been given its powers. The two chairmen are equal and independent of each other. I repeat that there will not be any frictions. We shall not allow them. [Mezova] What kind of house would you like to see in a year or two? A professional one? [Nakhushev] A professional one that is self-assured. This also pertains to the chairman. I think that we shall grow together. [Mezova] Just yesterday, speaking figuratively, you were not the last person in the system of the executive power. But today that power allows itself to look at you condescendingly. Doesn't this offend you? Can you say that you have won by changing your place of work? [Nakhushev] It surprises and... yes, it offends me. But, you know, I am not the kind of person who allows others to look at him condescendingly. I will growl, but if that becomes part of the system, I will simply leave... To tell the truth, I do not know whether or not I won as a result of the new job. Time will tell...
