Therefore the interest of political scientists and experts in the recently adopted decision on structural changes to the composition of the national nuclear triad is understandable. For, under the treaty signed a year ago on reducing and limiting strategic nuclear arms (START II), our primarily ``land-based'' triad could turn into a ``sea-based'' one. Since the polemic over this part of the treaty is continuing, it would be interesting to know the opinion on this score of Academician Yu. Khariton, one of the creators of the Russian ``nuclear shield.'' Although the well known scientist has left the immediate leadership of the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (city of Arzamas-16), he continues to work in this ``field.'' After asking him to familiarize himself with the rubric ``Disarm, But Sensibly'' in PRAVDA 16 February this year, we learned his opinion of the questions touched upon there. Two points stood out particularly clearly. First point. Yuliy Borisovich showed concern at the reorientation of our nuclear triad from ``land'' to ``sea'' -- as prescribed by START II. He is unable to find a proper explanation for such a decision and is not in possession of proper arguments in favor of that decision. Second point. In his opinion, under the changed conditions of trust between the nuclear partners questions of the security of nuclear weapons must evidently take priority. Precisely this must be taken into consideration when choosing the carriers of such weapons and their basing modes. Broadly speaking, security means, above all, protecting the environment and man from excessively dangerous technologies. In this connection the academician touched on the danger of an accident involving a nuclear-powered submarine stuffed with dozens of dangerously explosive solid-fuel missiles carrying hundreds of nuclear warheads. He emphasized the catastrophic nature of the consequences for nature of such an incident. The use of solid-propellant rockets with the U.S. space shuttles is also, in his opinion, a risky technical decision. The deaths of several U.S. astronauts have already confirmed this. Festivities marking the academician's 90th birthday took place recently at the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics. He is now honorary director of this institute. His opinion on the future of the national nuclear forces should be heeded, for it has already repeatedly been of tremendous benefit. But, so we understand, this time he is not, for some reason, being involved in resolving the problem of nuclear disarmament. And yet, of our scientists who developed nuclear weapons, Yuliy Borisovich is now the only ``three-star'' hero-academician.
