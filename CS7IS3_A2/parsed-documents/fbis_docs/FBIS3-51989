It is not known whether there were any casualties. The blackout affected areas near the Presidency of the Republic, the National Congress, the Archdiocese Palace, the Army Information Office, the headquarters of unions and popular organizations, the shopping center, and several foreign press agencies. Guatemalan firemen told ACAN-EFE they are investigating the cause of the blackout and the reason behind the explosion. There is little traffic on the streets. Guatemala has lived through a wave of terrorist attacks in the past few weeks, which the Army blames on the guerrillas who are trying to discourage the population from participating in the referendum next Sunday to approve or reject constitutional reforms that would move back elections for deputies and change the Supreme Court. The attacks have resulted in the death of one person.
