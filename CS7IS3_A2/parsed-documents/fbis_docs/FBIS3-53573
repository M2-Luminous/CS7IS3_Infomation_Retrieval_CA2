Despite the promise of a lull in hostilities due to a blanket of snow that descended on Kabul in the night, the artillery firefight continued for 90 minutes, followed by the deadly rattle of small-arms fire. Pro-Rabbani troops are now in their 18th consecutive day of fighting against the rival Uzbek forces of ex-communist General Abdol Rashid Dostam, and his military partner Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar. Rabbani's spokesman told AFP that the president had rejected his rival's demand for his resignation as a precondition to the cessation of the fighting. "The president has already triumphed," said spokesman Abdol Aziz Morad, as windows in his house rattled from the shock-waves of incoming artillery bursts. He said the coup attempt by the "Dostam militia" had failed, and that except for the two eastern bases of Bala Hissar and Maranjan Hill, Dostam forces had lost most of their strongholds in Kabul. Morad stressed there would be no ceasefire with the Dostam forces. "The concept of a ceasefire has no reality. A sacred war, Jihad, has been declared," he stated. Morad reiterated Radio Kabul's message that the April 1992 general amnesty issued for Dostam's ex-communist forces had been suspended. Morad said that captured Dostam forces would face trial in accordance with the Shariat, or Muslim religious law. Dostam himself, Morad said, is a "killer and a criminal, who did nothing for the past 15 years except assassinate the Afghan people". Although he blamed Dostam, former Afghan communist president Babrak Karmal, and Hekmatyar equally for the coup attempt, no Jihad has been formally declared against the prime minister's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] faction. "But if Hezb stand with the Dostam militia, they will be killed in the same way as the militia will be killed," Morad said. He said there were many honest mojahedin among the Hezb-e Eslami ranks, and that the "state" was trying to woo them over to its side. "We are trying to split the honest Hezb from their leadership," said Morad. "It would be better if all the Hezb split from Hekmatyar." Rabbani's camp does not recognise Hekmatyar as the country's legal prime minister. "Hekmatyar has forfeited his honour, his prestige, and the achievments of his political past," Morad said. In Pakistan, the Hezb-e Eslami said Rabbani had lost legitimacy. A Hezb statement urged all countries not to deal with his government, saying that it did not represent the will of the Afghan people.
