According to a broadcast report from Seoul on 4 May, Kim Yong-sam the traitor threw another party at Nokchiwon garden in Chongwadae and talked nonsense about us. Sitting with fellows from the Advisory Council for Democratic and Peaceful Unification, he said that our nuclear development is targeted at South Korea and that the North is even violating the armistice agreement. This is like a thief turning on the master with a club. He said that after announcing the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty last year, we have accelerated nuclear development during the past year while insisting on the frame of confrontation. He even repeated that nuclear development of the North should be blocked in any event. Traitor Kim Yong-sam said some useless things to threaten someone by mentioning words, such as "destruction." Such a reverse propaganda of the national traitor, war maniac, and fascist devilish homicide Kim Yong-sam is rude remarks that can only be made by South Korean puppets who are experienced in reversing black and white, and a cunning trick to divert South Korean people's attention elsewhere from their internal crisis. First of all, regarding our so-called nuclear development raved by traitor Kim Yong-sam, those remarks resulted from the fear that their nuclear development maneuvers might be discovered by the world. In fact, the ones who are developing nuclear weapons are not us but the South Korean puppets themselves. South Korea's heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose research reactor in Taedok Complex are military nuclear reactors built under the objective to develop nuclear weapons. It is not a secret that plutonium and highly enriched uranium are produced here. The whole world knows that the heavy-water reactor in Wolsong alone has produced enough spent fuel containing plutonium to produce more than 370 nuclear bombs. As exposed by the Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front, the South Korean puppets are accelerating the development of positive reactors [silchungno], which is the third phase of the development of a fast breeder reactor. Even while frantically accelerating nuclear development, they said we were developing nuclear weapons to use against them. This is none other than a scheme to accelerate their efforts to develop and arm themselves with nuclear weapons by using us as a pretext. Traitor Kim Yong-sam also said that we were violating the armistice agreement. This is also ridiculous. The Korean armistice agreement bans the introduction of operational materials into Korea. Nevertheless, the United States, a party to the armistice agreement, has continuously brought numerous operational materials and military personnel into South Korea from 1954, when the agreement was signed [as heard], up until today. Still, it had brought them secretly. However, it is now openly bringing in operational materials and military personnel in broad daylight. The Apache attack helicopters and Patriot missiles were recently deployed in this fashion. Needless to day, all of these are violations of the Korean armistice agreement. When traitor Kim Yong-sam took issue regarding the armistice agreement, he should have taken issue with these violations first. Regarding the establishment of a new peace-guaranteeing system on the Korean peninsula, which we proposed in the Foreign Ministry's statement, traitor Kim Yong-sam, poking his nose into this matter, is trying to do something about it. This is a very foolish act. How can a colonial puppet who is neither a signatory to the Korean armistice agreement, nor one who has the prerogative of supreme command over the armed forces, can sit face to face with us and discuss the issue of replacing the armistice agreement with a peace agreement? This is nonsense. Traitor Kim Yong-sam again made the meaningless remarks this time that North Korea was developing nuclear weapons and violated the armistice agreement. As I have stated, this is a scheme to divert the South Korean people's attention elsewhere because of an internal crisis. The South Korean puppets are launching a smear campaign while saying that someone is developing nuclear weapons and violating the armistice agreement. Instead of doing so, they had better mind their own business. The smear campaign which reverses facts can never produce good results. Only destruction awaits the Kim Yong-sam ring, which aggravates North-South relations, strains tension on the Korean peninsula, and leads the country to ruin. The Kim Yong-sam ring is walking down a path of self-destruction.
