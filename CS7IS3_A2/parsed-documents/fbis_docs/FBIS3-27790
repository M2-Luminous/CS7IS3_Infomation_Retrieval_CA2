After the incident, the ABB called a radio station to claim responsibility for the bombings. [Begin recording] [Reporter Noel Perfecto] First, the terrorists bombed Petron's main office in Makati at 6:15 AM this morning. The security guard on duty was slightly injured in the blast. Police said that the blast did not cause serious damage to the Petron building, but damaged some windows in the adjacent Mandarin Oriental Hotel building. Five minutes later, the ABB bombed Shell House on Paleros Street in Legaspi Village. There was not much damage from the explosion, because the bomb fell in front of the powerhouse. Makati Chief Remy Macaspar said that the bombs used were strong enough to kill people and damage property: [Macaspar, in English] Regional Director General Sarmiento ordered to intensify our intelligence efforts as well as repressive patrolling, such that last evening he was also out there in the field. He really checked the prevailing situation. We concentrated on gasoline stations, but with this development we have to consider everything now. [Perfecto] According to reports, the bombing of Caltex-Philippines in Manila came five minutes after the bombing of Shell House. Colonel Macaspar disclosed that police had brought the driver of the taxi used by the bombers in for questioning. The driver was identified as Abunjon Dabat. He said that he was forced out of the taxi after the bombings were completed: [Dabat] Before making a U-turn into the Mandarin Hotel, he told me to pull over in front of the Petron Building. Then he said that he was going to get out and drop something off. When he got out of the taxi cab, I saw him holding something round. Then he lit it and hurled it at Petron's door. Then he returned to the cab and I started driving again. He told me to turn right at Paseo Roxas and right again at Citibank. When we were at the corner near Citibank, he told me to stop because he was going to throw something again. That is what he said. [Perfecto] Shell House's security guard, identified as Rogelio Valdes, said that the bombers appeared to be youths. Is this what the object that was thrown at your building looked like? [video shows Perfecto holding several sticks of dynamite wired together] [Valdes] Yes. It looked like this, but it was wrapped in brown paper. [Perfecto] Do you think there were also as many sticks as this? [Valdes] Yes. I think there were as many sticks as that, because it was as big as that. [Perfecto] But you did not notice that they were using a taxi? [Valdes] No. I did not notice whether the taxi that passed by my post was the one that the bombers used. [Perfecto] As of air time, the Capcom [Capital Command] had alerted all of its centers and placed a tight guard on all vital government offices and buildings that are potential bombing targets. [end recording] In a related development, strict security measures are being implemented at the Energy Regulatory Board [ERB] and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. The ERB office received a bomb threat after the bombing of the three oil firms' offices. Strict security is also being enforced at the offices of the National Power Corporation and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewer System. Meanwhile, the Philippine National Police call on the public to support the security measures that will be put into place at all sensitive government offices and some private companies.
