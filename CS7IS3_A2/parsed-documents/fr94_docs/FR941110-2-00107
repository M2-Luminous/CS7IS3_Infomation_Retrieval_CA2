FR941110-2-00107 FR941110-2-00064 Upon receipt of Commission approval and authorization and satisfaction of other conditions to closing under an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 29, 1994, SFP will merge with and into BNI, which will change its name to Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. Each share of SFP common stock will be exchanged for 0.34 shares of newly issued BNI common stock. Upon the BNI-SFP merger, BNI will acquire and exercise control of Santa Fe in common with its existing control of BN. 3 The operations of BN and Santa Fe will be consolidated and fully integrated following the holding company merger. Applicants also seek Commission approval to merge the BN and Santa Fe legal entities, although the timing of the railroad merger will depend on tax, legal and other considerations. 3 Santa Fe and its majority-owned railroad subsidiaries_The Dodge City and Cimarron Valley Railway Company, The Gulf and Inter-State Railway Company of Texas, Los Angeles Junction Railway Company, Oklahoma City Junction Railway Company, Rio Grande, El Paso and Santa Fe Railway Company and Star Lake Railroad Company_are an integrated single system railroad. Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Company, a non-operating rail carrier entity, likewise is part of Santa Fe's single system. As such, the acquisition of control of Santa Fe by BNI involves the control of a single carrier within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See Robert W. Bethge & Raymond K. Wilson_Control Exemption_Canal Cartage Co., Finance Docket No. MC-F&hyph;19525 (served Nov. 29, 1989); Burlington Northern, Inc._Control and Merger_St. Louis-San Francisco Ry., 366 I.C.C. 862, 865, aff'd sub nom.

As a result of the proposed transaction, the merged company will also acquire control of WUTR, in which BN and Santa Fe each own a one-third stock interest. A petition for exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505 from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343&hyph;47 for the acquisition and exercise of control of WUTR was filed concurrently with the primary application [Finance Docket No. 32549 (Sub-No. 1)]. No new securities will be issued by any company subject to Commission regulation under 49 U.S.C. 11301 to effect the merger of BNI and SFP or the common control of BN and Santa Fe. To the extent BN's succession to then-outstanding debt obligations of Santa Fe in the merger of the railroad entities may be deemed to require Commission authorization under 49 U.S.C. 11301, applicants seek such authorization, and provide the relevant information in accordance with 49 CFR 1180.6(a)(1)(iv). In connection with the transaction, applicants propose to construct new railroad lines that are or may be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under 49 U.S.C. 10901. Petitions for exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505 from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10901 for the construction of those railroad lines were filed concurrently with the primary application [Finance Docket No. 32549 (Sub-No. 2 through Sub-No. 12)].
