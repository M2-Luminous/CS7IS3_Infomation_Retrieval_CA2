FR940922-2-00090 FR940922-2-00061 II Compliance With the APPA The APPA requires a sixty-day period for the submission of public comments on the proposed Final Judgment, 15 U.S.C. 16(b). In this case, the sixty-day comment period commenced on June 27, 1994, and terminated on August 26, 1994. During this period, the United States received comments by one competitor of MCI and BT relating to the proposed Final Judgment. 1 The United States responds herein to those comments. Upon publication in the Federal Register these comments and the following response of the United States to these comments, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 16(d) of the APPA, the procedures required by the APPA prior to entry of the proposed Final Judgment will be completed, and the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgment. The United States will move the Court for entry of the proposed Final Judgment after the public comments and this response of the United States have been published in the Federal Register . 1 These comments are attached as Exhibit A. III Response to Public Comments The only comments received by the United States were filed by ACC Global Corporation (``ACC''), one of the companies recognized by the United States and the defendants in the Stipulation as a competitor entitled to receive information concerning the defendants, under the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment. ACC is a resale provider of international telecommunications services in the United States, and one of its subsidiaries has received a license to provide international simple resale services in the United Kingdom. ACC does not oppose prompt resolution of this matter through a consent decree, and indeed it considers the transparency requirements in Section II.A of the proposed Final Judgment as ``of vital importance in ameliorating the potential anticompetitive impact of the agreements that gave rise to the complaint filed by the DOJ in this matter.'' ACC Comments at 2. These transparency requirements, ACC states, provide ``substantial protection to Competitors such as ACC'' because they ensure the availability of evidence that can be used in enforcement proceedings under the decree, or in proceedings before the Federal Communications Commission and British regulatory authorities. Id. at 3. ACC's concerns pertain solely to two limited aspects of the transparency provisions, which it recommends be clarified or modified. After consideration of ACC's comments, the United States is of the view that neither of the modifications recommended by ACC are necessary to achieve the competitive purposes of the proposed Final Judgment. A. Provision of Information Directly to Competitors First, ACC contends that the information to be disclosed by defendants under Section II.A should be provided by defendants simultaneously both to competitors and to the Department of Justice, rather than being submitted first to the Department and then being furnished by the Department to qualified competitors, as the proposed Final Judgment now specifies. Although ACC recognizes that it is qualified to receive the information from the Department, and does not suggest that it would be refused access, it believes that for the defendants to provide the information directly to the competitors would involve only a ``slight incremental burden,'' would facilitate monitoring by competitors, and would relieve the Department of the ``burden of handling the distribution function.'' ACC Comments at 3. The procedure for providing information from defendants to their competitor through the Department, as described in Section IV.E of the proposed Final Judgment and the Stipulation, was developed in response to the concerns of defendants that they not be required to disclose to the public at large, or to competitors for use in the marketing and sales of their services, information that may be competitively sensitive. The provision of this information to competitors, as ACC appreciates, is intended to aid in detecting discriminatory or other anticompetitive conduct and making appropriate complaints to government authorities. While the United States, in the circumstances of this case, accepted that some protection against general public disclosure of the defendants' information should be provided, it opposed allowing the defendants to have any role in screening their competitors and determining which ones would have accress to the information, or being able to influence the timing of such access. The United States was reasonably concerned that the defendants would have incentives to frustrate and delay access to their information by competitors, and might impose unreasonable confidentiality restrictions that would discourage competitors from availing themselves of access to the information, were they assigned the responsibility of disseminating the information to competitors directly. ACC's proposal, if adopted, could have the unintended consequence of impairing rather than facilitating monitoring of defendants by their competitors, and could impose the additional burden on the Department of refereeing disputes over access procedures between defendants and firms such as ACC. There is no reason for ACC to be concerned that the Department will postpone dissemination of the information that it receives from defendants. Rather, qualified competitors such as ACC that enter into a simple form confidentiality agreement with the Department and abide by the agreement will be sent promptly copies of any information furnished by defendants pursuant to Section II.A of the Final Judgment, following the Department's receipt of the information. B. Waiver of Transparency Requirements by the United States Second, ACC objects to the provision in Section II.A that would allow the United States to waive compliance with the transparency requirements, in whole or in part, through written notice to defendants and the Court. ACC believes that giving the United States discretion to waive the transparency requirements without prior public notice and comment and approval by the Court would ``defeat the purpose of the Tunney Act,'' ACC Comments at 4, and could lead to the United States vitiating the decree, whether intentionally or unwittingly due to lack of the knowledge of the industry possessed by defendant's competitors.
