Her visit included talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a meeting with Romania's President Ion Iliescu at Cotroceni Palace, a working lunch, and a news conference held upon departure at Otopeni Airport. [passage omitted] In a statement made to journalists after the talks at Cotroceni, President Ion Iliescu said that he views most favorably the presence in Bucharest of the American ambassador to the United Nations, the message delivered on behalf of President Bill Clinton, and the information received in connection with the Brussels decisions and the Partnership for Peace. Ion Iliescu said that even before the Brussels meeting, Romania believed that this is perhaps one of the wisest decisions aimed at eliminating any discrimination in relations with the countries in this part of Europe and at ensuring a favorable framework of equal security for all European states and preparations for an evolutionary process for integration in NATO. We, said President Ion Iliescu, have expressed our choice and hope for future integration in NATO structures, and we see the Partnership for Peace as the most favorable framework for a normal evolution of this process. We have discussed real political and military preparation for these measures, which will be examined by the Supreme Council for the country's defense to develop contacts and finalize the framework for integration in the Partnership for Peace process. In his statement Mr. Iliescu noted that other issues connected with peace and security in Europe as well as aspects of bilateral relations were also broached. On economic relations, we, the president mentioned, emphasized the need to develop a new economic partnership plan, as a new philosophy and political concept of economic relations both on the European continent, between equal partners, as well as a concept designed to govern international economic relations. This is required because the world economy faces a systemic crisis and discrepancies between the rich and poor worlds risk turning into the most dangerous and explosive source for destabilization and insecurity in the world. This is also an imperative issue at the European level, in the context of difficulties presented by the transition to a market economy in the countries neighboring Romania. Ion Iliescu expressed his view that the issue of developing a concept of economic partnership and cooperation is part of a common fate and common opportunity. He stated that during the talks with the American ambassador to the United Nations he discovered that they shared almost identical views on security and economic cooperation issues. The Romanian president added that during the talks the sides emphasized prospects for developing the Romanian-American dialogue at the highest level and he reiterated the invitation extended to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to visit Romania.
