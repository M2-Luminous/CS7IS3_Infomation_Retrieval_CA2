Adversaries and allies say that you are the pest of the pole of freedoms, the person that is making a government accord between the center-right forces impossible. Are you not afraid that these accusations will make you lose your grassroots' consensus? [Bossi] I know very well that somebody is trying to penetrate into the League, break up the movement, and put me in difficulty. They know that I am what makes the League stick together and they want to strike at me in order to strike at the heart of our federalist project. But they will not succeed and if they think they can, they do not know the League. [Vimercati] But is it true that many League members go to [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's conventions? [Bossi] I do not perform blood tests on the Forza Italia supporters. I can only say that I spoke at length with all the League candidates (and outside the headquarters in Via Bellaria for the first time there were military police with bulletproof vests in a state of alert, IL GIORNALE editor's note) and they agree with me on our political line. I have no doubts concerning the League's grassroots: It was precisely the activists and the simple supporters who rebelled against the recycled people of the Berlusconi list of candidates. I explained the sense of the operation and now I am satisfied because the opinion polls, the real ones and not the propaganda ones, say that the League is growing. Also, primarily in the north, it has already overtaken Forza Italia, which had grown a great deal thanks to the massive television propaganda. Now the pole of freedoms is stronger, but thanks to the League. [Vimercati] Regarding relations with Berlusconi in the so-called pole of freedoms: After so many election campaign controversies perhaps the time has come to reason. Do you feel up to it? [Bossi] I have been reasoning since the League was born. If not, we would have never reached this point. [Vimercati] You are presenting candidates on the same list as Berlusconi, yet not a single day goes by without your insulting him. What sense does this row have? [Bossi] First, it is not a row, and I am not insulting anybody. I am telling the truth, I am the only political leader who always tells the people the truth and nothing but the truth. [Vimercati] Even when you say that Berlusconi is a P2 [outlawed Masonic lodge] member, the head of the recycled people, a man of the old regime? [Bossi] Unfortunately for him this is the truth. His membership in the Masonic lodge has been reported, his connection with the old five-party coalition cannot be denied, not even by his press office. The facts show his role as a recycled person. [Vimercati] If this is how things stand, why did you forge an alliance with Berlusconi? [Bossi] Because I know well, and history teaches me that all the revolutions had to accept the transmigration of a part of the old system into the new. Forza Italia is the recycled quota that the League revolution must realistically accept. [Vimercati] Well then, if you accept it why continue attacking Forza Italia? [Bossi] All I have to do is clear things up, with the movement and all the citizens. I want the political significance of this electoral accord to be clear. I have not been saying these things just today and not even since yesterday. I have always said these things very clearly, even in Berlusconi's face, and even before the accord. [Vimercati] Okay, but now that the election battle has begun you should be firing against the enemy not against the ally. Do you not think so? [Bossi] War against Occhetto's statist Left was declared some time ago. I have always said that they will make the state go bankrupt. Therefore, there is no doubt that the votes must go to the pole of freedoms. This matter has been settled. However, something else must be explained to the people. [Vimercati] That is? [Bossi] That is, there are two forces within the pole of freedoms. One wants a change, in fact it was the creator of change. The other represents the quota of recycled people that are necessary in any revolution. If this second force grows too much, there is a risk that a stop will be put to change. For this reason, in the majority vote, the votes must necessarily go to the pole of freedoms, but in the proportional lower house vote, Guerriero of the north should be crossed in the gray voting card. Otherwise, there will be no change and the five-party coalition will resurrect. This is what I continue to repeat, even if the newspapers write what they want. [Vimercati] I seem to understand that you are afraid of losing your leadership. [Bossi] This is not the problem. I fear that we will lose sight of the final objective and the only one that can change this country and transform it, make it European: federalism. Without the League there are no federalist prospects for Italy. This means that the hands of the centralist parties would go back to reaching out toward the wallets of the north. This is a fatal risk that I must denounce. Woe to us if the League does not win, for the north it would be another century of centralist slavery. [Vimercati] The problem is another one, however: the government. The people would like to vote for a potential majority. Is a League-Forza Italia government possible? [Bossi] The League will propose its programs, its liberalistic and federalist ideas. Those who agree, will be in the government. It is not a matter of majorities. Let this be clear, I will not form a single group with Berlusconi. He will go his way and will have to choose whether to stay with us for federalism, or with the Christian Democrats, or perhaps the Left. The Left that is currently directing strong attacks at me and that is trying to make me lose even the battle for the Milan seat. [Vimercati] To tell the truth, today the most violent attack comes from the Right: [National Alliance leader] Fini says that a political accord with the League is even possible. As long as Bossi is no longer party secretary. [Bossi] Right and Left: They are all part of the same band. I have been repeating this for some time: Right and Left know that without Bossi, and with the League in pieces, everything would begin again as it was before. The hands of the nepotistic south would reach out toward the wallets of the north. The MSI [Italian Social Movement] people are objectively tied to paraMafia interests and are nervous because of this: They know that the north is not stupid and that it will sweep them away, it will not give them even a vote.
