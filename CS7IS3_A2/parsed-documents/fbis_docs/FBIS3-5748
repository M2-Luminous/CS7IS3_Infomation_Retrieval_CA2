The rice databank said 60 kilograms of "Koshihikari" rice produced in Niigata Prefecture were traded at between 53,200 yen and 53,600 yen in Tokyo and Osaka free markets, only 300 yen higher than a week before. Although the price of "Kirara 397" in Hokkaido is still rising, rises in other brands have been shrinking, the Tokyo-based agency said. A free rice market official in Osaka said most consumers who persist in eating domestic rice seemed to have purchased what they want prior to the distribution of government-controlled rice, which will be blended with foreign rice to counter the domestic crop shortfall in 1993.
