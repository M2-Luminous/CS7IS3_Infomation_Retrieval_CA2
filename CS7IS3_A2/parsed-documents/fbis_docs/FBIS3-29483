The U.S. wanted an agreement that was spelled out clearly, while the Thai side conducted the negotiations flexibly. The Thai side will review its position in the new round of talks scheduled for mid-October. Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said he received a report from the Revenue Department's M.R. Chatumongkon Sonakun, who negotiated on a double taxation protocol in the United States 7-11 February. According to Chatumongkon, negotiations did not achieve desired results. He attributed this to the U.S. side wanting the Thai side to base the negotiations on legal references or clear terms because it had to submit the finished protocol--a legal documen--for congressional consideration. Vagueness could result in rejection by the congress. Chatumongkon said the Thai side engaged in negotiations ready to compromise in certain areas, and it did indeed compromise on several points. However, the United States insisted that the Thai side produce a legal document spelling out every point, including permanent business establishment, business, and investment taxes. The negotiations failed as a result. Chatumongkon said the Thai side will have to review the double taxation protocol in two areas. First, Thailand will have to draft a clear protocol for a new round of talks in mid-October. Second, Thailand has to assess whether the United States really wants to conclude a protocol. This is because the failure of previous negotiations was largely caused by the United States wanting Thailand to alter numerous points or shifting its positions constantly.
