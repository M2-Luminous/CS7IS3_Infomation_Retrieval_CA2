Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said the Downing Street declaration, signed by Mr John Major, the Prime Minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, 11 weeks ago, "had run its course." His party, the main voice of the loyalists, said it would not engage in any new talks involving Dublin until an internal settlement, including a new devolved assembly for Ulster, had been reached. The Unionists offered to continue to talk to the British Government and other mainstream parties in Northern Ireland. But Downing Street reaffirmed the Government's view that all those affected, including Dublin, had to be involved in talks on the province. The Government sought to play down the rejection, emphasising that efforts to reach a settlement would continue. "We don't believe in the counsel of despair," said a spokesman. "We recognise this is a difficult situation, but we will continue to talk to all the parties to try to find common ground." The Downing Street declaration emphasised that progress would be made through the three-strand talks -- and not by a purely internal settlement. This was underlined by Mr Major and Mr Reynolds last month. The hardline Democratic Unionist Party led by Mr Ian Paisley is already boycotting talks. But the official Unionists' decision is a much more serious blow. It was the second setback for the Government in 24 hours. Over the weekend it became clear at Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin that the IRA is not yet prepared to declare a ceasefire, raising doubts over the effectiveness of the Downing Street declaration. Ministers believe that the new hardline position by the Ulster Unionists is dictated largely by the approaching European elections. The party fears it could be outflanked by Mr Paisley' s more extreme Democratic Unionists. Unveiling the Ulster Unionists' Blueprint for Stability, which includes a demand for a new Bill of Rights as well as a devolved assembly, Mr Molyneaux scorned the "summitry" by the two prime ministers. Two initiatives were now needed, he said: "a genuine effort to eradicate terrorism" and moves towards "restoring democracy." Speaking at a Westminster news conference, Mr Molyneaux said: "The failure of the declaration has also hideously damaged the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Things are never going to be the same again."
