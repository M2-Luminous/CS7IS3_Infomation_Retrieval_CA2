According to established tradition, at the start of the discussion he briefed journalists on what has happened in the Russian Armed Forces since their last meeting. We would remind you that this took place late in December 1993. First, the defense minister stressed that the process of reform is continuing in the troops in accordance with the plans and tasks set out in the president's Message to the Federal Assembly. There have been systematic moves to improve the system of command and control, create new groupings of troops and mobile forces, improve the system of Army and Navy staffing, and equip them with the requisite hardware and arms. The defense minister singled out a few of the most important areas of Armed Forces reform. Primarily, he stressed, the system of military legislation has continued to be fine-tuned. The Defense Ministry has already prepared over 20 draft laws. Drafts of new laws -- "On Martial Law" and "On the Military Militia" -- are also being formulated. Other measures to reform the Armed Forces have gone strictly according to plan. The problem of reducing the numerical strength of troops and forces remains an important one. The defense minister emphasized that it has been decided following comprehensive analysis to propose that the strength of the Armed Forces be ratified at 1.9 million men. It is thought that the lower figure proposed previously is simply inadmissible. At the beginning of the year it had also proved possible to overcome the negative tendency with regard to nonfulfillment of the draft plan. To date 88 percent of draftees (of the current plan) are already performing their constitutional duty in the Army and Navy. Toward the end of March it is intended to raise the draft level to 95 percent. A considerable improvement has also been recorded in the state of troop discipline. Compared with 1993 the total number of crimes and violations has dropped by one-fourth. There have been 22 percent fewer cases of irregular relationships and 20 percent fewer cases of draft dodging. On the whole, the defense minister stressed, the nature of offenses within the Army and Navy reflects the situation in society. The defense minister voiced the greatest concern in connection with the problem of shaping the military budget and funding the Armed Forces. According to him, if the adverse trends continue and radical, determined measures are not taken in the near future, it will be impossible to speak not just about further reform of the Army, but even about the security of Russia generally. To date the Finance Ministry is providing less than 50 percent of the required funding to meet the needs and ensure the normal functioning of the Army and Navy. Naturally, that situation cannot suit us. The defense minister underlined the fact that he would continue to try to obtain the necessary budget for the Armed Forces. He did point out that even in these conditions potential does exist for obtaining additional funding for the troops. This potential primarily arises from the Defense Ministry's right to set its own targets and sell combat hardware itself and from its ability to sell surplus military property to the national economy, cut the order to the military-industrial complex, and also further reduce the Armed Forces. Naturally the fact that this plan exists does not mean that reform of the Army and Navy will occur in precisely these areas. We will not permit a wholesale reduction in the Army, the minister stressed, especially since that does not benefit the state as a whole. The defense minister went on to emphasize that the military budget under discussion will still have an explicit social thrust. The intention is to spend over 50 percent of all budget funds, which the Defense Ministry is allocated on social protection for servicemen. During the press conference Defense Minister Pavel Grachev answered numerous questions about problems of military cooperation with countries both near and far. In particular, he pointed out good prospects for cooperation with France, the United States, and the FRG, as well as with Belarus, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia, and other Commonwealth countries. Commenting on recent events in the Black Sea Fleet, Pavel Grachev stressed that the current problems should not affect the unconditional fulfillment of the Massandra agreements and that he is hoping to cooperate closely with the Ukrainian defense minister despite certain difficulties. As at previous meetings with journalists, there was no avoiding questions with a political slant. In particular, the defense minister was asked whether his current presence in Moscow was due to the need for a "strong hand" in the capital. Pavel Grachev forthrightly rejected the political slant to the question and stressed that the Army is engaged in performing its tasks.
