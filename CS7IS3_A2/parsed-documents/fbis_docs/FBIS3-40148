According to forecasts, procured beets have amounted to less than 3 million metric tons, representing a decline of 50 percent from the best year in history. Because of the raw material insufficiency, some sugar-making enterprises have become kitchens without rice, and have difficulty in surviving. Four sugar refineries, the Zhaodong, Zhaozhou, Bayan, and Binzhou, have been forced to suspend production. Raw material insufficiencies have always been creating difficulties for the survival and development of our province's sugar industry; especially, some new refineries which have been established more recently have experienced even more prominent problems in this regard as their raw material areas are smaller. The raw material situation affects the present as well as the future; this year's raw material insufficiency not only constrains this year's production but will also affect next year's. The overall factors responsible for this year's large decline in beet production: The first is the irrational beet price in a comparative sense. Our province's main cash crops are commonly called the "two kinds of dou and one kind of nodules," that is: soybeans, potatoes, and beets. Currently the per mu value of output of soybeans is 240-320 yuan; the per mu value of output of potatoes is 160-240 yuan; and the per mu value of output of beets is 124-186 yuan. In terms of the per mu value of output, there is a marked difference in price between beets on the one hand and soybeans and potatoes on the other. The sales price of sugar has now risen to 2,800-3,200 yuan per metric ton; the ratio of the raw material price to the finished product price appears to be very irrational. It is exactly because of this price factor that the sown acreage for soybeans is extremely large across our province, thereby seriously adversely affecting not only beets but also other cash crops and grain crops. The second has been the error in the work of guiding public opinion. Early this year the General Sugar Group Corporation of the province put forward the argument for "being not afraid of three things"; one part of the argument was about being not afraid of peasants' not growing beets. The argument has produced some negative effects. Sugar-making enterprises have slackened beet production consciously or unconsciously, and peasants have also become dispirited and bitter. The third has been local governments' administrative interference. In terms of the provincewide situation, the production of raw material for county-supervised sugar-making enterprises is generally in better shape than for province-supervised enterprises. This is because the difference between the situation of making profits and the situation of making losses in sugar-making enterprises is great. Thus if the enterprises do well, they can become a major fiscal pillar for the localities; but if they are in bad shape, they can become an unbearable burden. Therefore, with regard to methods of promoting raw material production, the localities have not only issued mandatory plans but also used some constraining means, trying every means to increase raw material production. The fourth is that the problem of difficulty in selling beets has not been fundamentally resolved. In spring when beet production is being arranged and when sown acreage commitments are made, sugar refineries would call beet farmers honey brothers and sweet sisters, visiting the farmers during Spring Festival and delivering seeds and pesticides to their doors; but at the time when beets are procured, they would change their usual attitude, becoming rude and cold and using dirty methods to withhold part of the payments to beet farmers. The phenomenon of extorting money and objects has occurred form time to time. White slips have not been thoroughly eliminated. According to a source, the sugar front of the entire province still owes 160 million yuan in white slip money. This year there is still a shortage of 624 million yuan in procurement funds. This means that more white slips will continue to be issued. If selling beets does not generate cash, how would peasants acquire enthusiasm for growing beets? Over several years the sugar industry provincewide was all along in a predicament. There were many reasons for the situation. The main reason was that the sugar price was not proper. Now the price has grown gradually, and people at home and abroad are optimistic about the price, resulting in a good external environment for the development of the sugar industry. Nevertheless, beet production provincewide is now faced with a grave situation. A failure to take effective measures to rectify the situation will not only endanger the development of the sugar-making enterprises but also make it difficult for them just to survive. Resolving the raw material insufficiency is now an extremely urgent issue. First, it is hereby suggested that the provincial government immediately adopt a policy on the procurement price of beets. Raising the procurement price of beets is inevitable. It is necessary to adopt a prudent attitude toward the question as to how much the price should be raised. If the damages to peasants' interests are underestimated, the enthusiasm for growing beets would still not be raised. But overestimation in this respect would produce a result unbearable to enterprises, and harm the state's interest. Only by properly setting the procurement price of beets would it be possible to take care of the interests of all three parties, thereby raising everyone's enthusiasm. Under usual circumstances, it is proper to have the beet procurement cost account for 50 percent of the sales price of sugar. If the sales price of sugar is 2,800 yuan, 3,000 yuan, or 3,200 yuan per metric ton, then it is proper to raise the beet price to 175 yuan, 185 yuan, or 195 yuan per metric ton. A proper price ratio can play the role of directing and adjusting supply-and-demand relationships. A situation where the beet price changes with changes in the sugar price will certainly stimulate beet production, thereby meeting the needs of sugar-making enterprises. Second, enterprise autonomy should be effectively implemented. According to a source, in recent years some refineries have formulated some homegrown policies in an effort to promote raw material production, adopting, for example, such preferential policies as those of supplying beet farmers with half-price seeds and paper tubes as well as free pesticides to be mixed with seeds, the practice of paying some service fees to county, township (town), and village cadres, etc. In 1992 the Yi'an Sugar Refinery implemented the new method of "reward-getting beet growing," distributing forms in spring, checking the cases in autumn, and giving the rewards at the end of the year. With 200,000 yuan, it bought peasant willingness to grow beets. In the spring of this year, although every refinery knew that the irrational price ratio would adversely affect peasants' enthusiasm for growing beets, no one would dare to raise the price by itself. In view of the abovementioned situation, it is hereby suggested that the supervisory agencies delegate this power to enterprises, asking them to do their work boldly and proudly under the condition of having no misgivings. The belief is that they will discharge well their accounting responsibilities on the basis of consideration of their respective economic capabilities, and will not carry out loss-making operations. Third, vigorously spread the use of the new technique of paper-tube seedling growing. This new technique was introduced from Japan. Over the several years, the refineries have spread the use, and produced substantial successful experience. But a new overall situation has yet to be created. There are mainly three reasons for that: the first is the belief that the investment is too large; the second is the belief that the labor input is too large; and the third is the failure of technical guidance to catch up. As practice has proven, the new technique of paper-tube seedling growing provides a great potential for increasing yield. Under usual conditions, per mu yield can reach 3,000-4,000 kg, equal to the 2 mu yield based on direct planting; in many instances, the yield is over 5,000 kg. According to calculations based on a procurement price of 185 yuan per metric ton, the per mu value of output will be 555-740 yuan, which will be more than three times the per mu value of output of soybeans. Fourth, enhance the construction of the body of agricultural affairs officers. The ties and bridges between enterprises and the raw material areas are created through the work of agricultural affairs officers. The agricultural affairs officers of some old refineries maintain many fine traditions, which should now be advocated, restored, and developed. Currently some agricultural affairs officers are complacent, and are not diligent. When they are arranging beet production in rural areas, they often stay in towns, exercising remote command through telephones. Two qualities of agricultural affairs officers are urgently in need of improvement. It is necessary to formulate a code of conduct governing the work of agricultural affairs officers. The construction of the body of agricultural affairs officers should be managed in a routine, regularized, and standardized manner. Fifth, be determined to resolve the problem of beet-selling difficulties. The problem of beet-selling difficulties is an old and difficult problem which people have wanted to resolve for many years but which has so far not been resolved in a satisfactory manner. Peasants hate the problem extremely. This problem has not only hurt peasants' enthusiasm for growing beets but also totally broken peasants' hearts. Therefore it is necessary to be determined to resolve the problem of beet-selling difficulties.
