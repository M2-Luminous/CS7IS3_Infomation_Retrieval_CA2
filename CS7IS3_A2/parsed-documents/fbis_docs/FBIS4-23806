Speaking in a radio interview he said that this was because American legislation did not allow American companies to trade with companies which had been blacklisted. He said that the two South African companies have still not been removed from the weapons blacklist despite the lifting of sanctions. Mr. Schwarz confirmed that a number of South Africans had been arrested for drug smuggling in various American cities and were awaiting trial. It's believed that the suspects were acting as couriers in the United States and Europe for African drug smugglers.
