Katyal: ``Agreement with IAEA on Tarapur Plant''] [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 23 -- Through an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], India has volunteered to keep the Tarapur nuclear power plant under international safeguards. India was not legally bound to do so, after the expiry of the arrangement with the U.S. for the supply of enriched uranium, but has taken this step as a goodwill gesture -- in the belief that it would be helpful in the efforts to keep the plant operational with the help of the reprocessed spent fuel at a later stage. The draft agreement, submitted by India in December last to the IAEA, has been approved by its board of governors at a meeting which began in Vienna on 21 February -- according to information received by the Department of Atomic Energy and, perhaps, also by the External Affairs Ministry. The temporary bilateral arrangement between India and the IAEA, that had been in force after the expiry of the 10-year agreement with the U.S. on 24 October last, has now been put on a permanent basis. Before that date, the safeguards were applicable at a trilateral level, involving the U.S., the original supplier of enriched uranium. Chequered History The Tarapur arrangements have a chequered history. While the agreement was still valid, the U.S. found it difficult to continue the supply because of the imperatives of its domestic legislation. As a result, France came in the picture -- and enriched uranium was made available to India, though under the framework of the Indo-U.S. agreement. France, as such, had no independent standing and it stopped the supplies at the end of the time-frame envisaged in the agreement with Washington. The agreement with the IAEA has no major immediate implications, as the plant has enough fuel in stock to keep it going for two to three years. India was under no obligation to approach Vienna with the voluntary offer, but it was done as a confidence-building measure and to dispel misunderstandings about the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This, New Delhi calculates, would also facilitate its job in working for a long-term arrangement as the plant has a life of another 15 years. The U.S. -- as also France -- had expressed unwillingness to extend the arrangement after 24 October 1993. Also, the U.S. did not accept India's plea to secure enriched uranium from other sources. The other course open to India was to reprocess the spent fuel which, in any case, posed major storage problems. This point figured in the discussions in Washington in September last by then Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit. The U.S. was non-committal -- it neither said ``no,'' nor ``yes.'' Efforts in that direction are to be continued. The acceptance of continued international safeguards for the Tarapur plant does not mean a departure from India's stand against the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or its variants, suggested by the industrialised nations. The Vienna agreement means extensions of the international safeguards for Tarapur, that had been in force for the last 10 years -- now under a bilateral arrangement.
