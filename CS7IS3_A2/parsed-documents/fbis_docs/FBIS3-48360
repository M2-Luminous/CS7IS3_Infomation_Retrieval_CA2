This shows that the Japanese authorities have no elementary conscience and morality and that they are trying to evade the blame for the crime, stresses NODONG SINMUN today. The news analyst says: The issue of "comfort women for the Army" is a criminal case against humanity, in which the Japanese imperialists in the past drafted more than 200,000 Asian and European women, mostly Koreans, as sex slaves for the Japanese Army by invoking state power and vpolated and killed them. The Japanese Government, far from apologizing and compensating for the shocking crime of human rights violations without precedent in history, denies the issue itself. Unable to repress resentment at its shameless behavior, many former "comfort women" testified to the criminal case. The Japanese authorities, however, doubt if they are really former "comfort women" far from feeling remorse of conscience at the heartrending testimonies of those who made a narrow escape from death. Anyone, if he is not an insensible person, will not ourn a deaf ear to the touching appeal of the surviving "comfort women". The Japanese authorities, the offender, do not admit the crimes at which the world is resentful, because they do not honestly reflect on the seriousness of the crime and do not want to part with the crime-woven past. If Japan thinks it can gloss over the past crimes without atonement, it is a mistake. The Japanese authorities must frankly admit the pash crimes, clarify the truth and sincerely apologize and compensate for them.
