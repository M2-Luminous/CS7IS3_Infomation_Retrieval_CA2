This is clearly and blatantly apparent in the nature of the U.S. approach to the Syrian track and the measures America is taking regarding Syria. We know that it was President Clinton's serious reading of the State Department's reports that prompted him to hold the Geneva summit and led him to say objectively that he had heard a lot about President al-Asad. However, he was surprised to find that reality was far richer than what was said or written, that President al-Asad was surely a leader of peace, and that he learned a lot from him. This seems to indicate that it was that stand which subjected the United States of America, represented by its president, to a major campaign from within. Prior to the Geneva summit we warned that America and Syria would come under enormous pressure. We showed the conflicts raging among the U.S. establishments, primarily the Defense Department and the decision-making organs, to break free of the cold war mentality that predominates in the Pentagon and to counter the influence of the Zionist lobby, which uses rumors to exert pressure. Although Syria has succeeded in surviving this game and understanding its dimensions, it seems that the U.S. Administration was only able to curb the pressures on it by taking two steps backward and turning Warren Christopher's visit to the region into a mere postman's task. Serious studies by U.S. political advisers at the highest levels, like that conducted by Anthony Lake, the U.S. President's adviser for national security, underline Syria's importance. Lake emphasized the importance of reaching a comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly between Syria and Israel, in order to consolidate the Israeli-Palestinian agreement and strengthen the moderates in the Middle East. He said that Syria plays a crucial role in the regional peace process and that its past alliance with Iran and its support for (rejectionists) have given the powers of (extremism) a vital foundation in the Middle East. [parentheses as published] Washington, therefore, insists that peace should be real, safe, and comprehensive. Without going into an argument about what Lake terms "extremism," we can say that the U.S. Administration has realized Syria's importance. However, due to electoral considerations, it has little influence in the face of Israeli pressures. Hence, we address our words to U.S. Secretary Christopher and to whom it may concern in the U.S. Administration. You are favoring the direct over the indirect [not further specified]. The U.S. secretary must refer to the ABC's of politics to understand how to deal simultaneously with Israel and Syria. If the sources of the State Department and think tanks are incapable of giving the U.S. secretary true advice in politics, we will provide these lessons: 1. The American and Israeli electoral game is approaching. The keys to this game are in Damascus. Unless they hurry up and make some progress with the peace process, President Clinton in particular will be in trouble. Moreover, the [Israeli] Labor Party will not find the necessary assets to run in the coming elections. Syria alone can frustrate all that has been achieved so far in the peace process. In other words, each side has only six months to bolster its position if Syria's lawful demands in the peace process are met. 2. To understand the Syrian policy fully, it should be realized that it does not play around, that it is capable of making its own choices, and that it can considerably upset the balance of the negotiating powers with its rational silence and relentless action. Nothing proves that better than the fact that the Russian giant has found no other gateway but Syria to enter the region, force itself on the world once again, and reshape its new image at the NATO negotiations. When this giant writes off 90 percent of the debts Syria owes to the former Soviet Union and conducts several trips to Syria--three visits in one and a half months--it is enough for everyone to realize that Syria's weight is far greater than they imagined. Israel's unserious approach to its proposals, which makes the U.S. secretary of state no better than a postman, must end quickly; otherwise the wasted time will not be in the interest of the United States and Israel. 3. The U.S. secretary must carefully read his department's files and specialized books about President al-Asad, because on this depends the U.S. policy's ability to find sound measures to facilitate the negotiating process so that no one, including the United States itself, will miss the opportunity. Hence, we say that Syria is not negotiating from a weak position; it is known that President al-Asad does not negotiate from weak positions. When he negotiates from a strong position, he does not back down and he has the nerve and the political strength to play out the negotiations down to the last quarter hour. His briefing papers are not shown to anyone and he is able to create unexpected situations and stands. When he is in the right, he does not bargain; this is not a slogan for media hype. It is a fact, the bitterness of which has been tasted by many, such as the Israelis in several places, the Americans in Lebanon, [former Lebanese army general] 'Awn in his political vainglory--the list is endless. Therefore, wasting time in what some imagine is a political bazaar might undermine the entire peace process, because rights are not subject to political haggling. Had al-Asad been the type who engages in political haggling over rights, he would have taken back the whole Golan over 20 years ago. But he negotiates only what should be negotiated; this means that President al-Asad does not negotiate over themes and substantive issues, only over procedures. It also means that the frantic political bazaar won't find attentive ears in Damascus except on procedural details. Hafiz al-Asad sells but doesn't buy, listens but doesn't bargain. He doesn't buy the words of those who negotiate with him, because what al-Asad has means he does not need what the others might give. He fully realizes that time is on his side and that Rabin's latest proposals are indicative of this because it was Rabin who flinched first in this game of chicken. He initiated the campaign, so he should stay until the end. Al-Asad also realizes that stalling might--or rather will--turn the tables on the others. Al-Asad is willing to negotiate endlessly without relinquishing his rights; and he knows pretty well that nothing will happen in the region without his approval. Peace is not merely a matter of trivial accords like those some people have accepted. Peace in the region passes only through Syria. All regional cooperation is geographically dependent on Syria and every accord on water can only pass through Syria. As for an agreement on nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, its key lies in Damascus. No matter how events shape up, everyone has to refer to Syria and to President al-Asad himself. Hence, any delay or maneuvering will only benefit Syria. Perhaps it would be useful for Mr. Christopher to refer to President al-Asad's biography to realize who he is negotiating with. He alone stands out among leaders of the Arab region and the Third Word as one who constitutes a departure [mufaraqah] from U.S. policy. He is rejected because he is an opposer, he is acceptable because he is a skilled politician, he is unacceptable because he does not agree with others' policies, and he is acceptable because he is a man of politics not adventures. He stands out alone among other leaders as being both an adversary and an arbiter and also someone for whom they are compelled to announce their respect. Thus, in a clever and shrewd move, President al-Asad was able to establish a political reference for his archenemies and his fiercest foes. He is the only one who plays the game of "political options," does not put all his eggs in one basket, and does not give in to whatever the political circumstances impose on him. He believes in creating options and forcing static conditions to move by singing the same tune, but in a tempo he himself dictates. Turning your back on existing realities means presenting your back to others as a target, while accepting existing realities means submitting to whatever happens so that you end up as fertilizer for the history of others. Hafiz al-Asad was able to recognize the existing realities, but he did not surrender to them. He continued his efforts to make energize the static conditions, and he has tried to use these fluid conditions to promote his policies. Through their movement he was able to seize suitable opportunities to rearrange matters and to change these conditions. No man has witnessed such great changes in his time as President al-Asad has. He has been a man of war and a man of peace; a man of the cold war and a man of the new world order. The man soon adapted to the changing circumstances, planned his policy carefully, and made himself felt on the world stage at a time when everyone else was shaking their heads and accepting whatever came their way. He contends with bad circumstances, but is not overbearing. He influences them, but is not influenced by them. Everyone has recognized his shrewdness. Kissinger wished he could become his foreign minister. On the eve of the departure of the American forces from Lebanon in the mid-80's, a senior correspondent said that the one who resides in the White House, governs the biggest power in the world, but he cannot deter the resident of al- Muhajirin, who governs a country with a small population and few resources; he does not deserve his position, for al-Asad's position is in the White House. James Baker emerged from a diplomatic shuttle before the Madrid Conference amazed at the Steel-nerved man he had met. Last but not least, Clinton's remarks about al-Asad's capabilities, the need for him to assume a basic leading role in the Middle East peace process, and his recognition that Syria is the key to a solution was not flattery. His remarks were in the nature of things, in view of al-Asad's political importance. As the saying goes, what is correct will ultimately make itself known. President al-Asad is known to be a master in discriminating between strategy and tactics. He is skillful in the only thing that determines who is a professional and who is an amateur politician-- the art of choosing the appropriate moment. He knows how to ride the waves, and by the time the waves start to recede he has already left the beach for good. He is a man of nerves of the first degree. He takes the one with whom he is negotiating to the bottom of the pit, and at the appropriate moment he emerges with a secure position while the nerves of everyone else have broken down. Therefore, everyone must realize that they are negotiating with the eleventh- hour man, who does not hasten anything nor beg for anything, but lets time takes its course. He is persistent and is never tired of details. He discusses in depth every minor or major point. This man is now dealing with Rabin over the history of the Labor Party and Labor Party's chances remaining in control of the government. Realizing that everyone awaits his decision, he is able to take from them what he did not take from others and what they could not take from him. Therefore, Rabin will get tired, but al-Asad will not. What everyone who has an interest in peace must realize is that President al-Asad will not be trapped by their schemes, for he knows how to make hard choices and how to go to the brink of danger then withdraw quietly, leaving everybody in wonder. Accordingly, he has mastered the art of attack and retreat, and combines political and military actions. When he senses the dangers of direct military action he is the first, and perhaps the last, to resort to indirect military action--or what is known as acting by remote control--which enables him to exercise military command in a unique and effective way. He does not resort to outmoded methods of military action, for he supports institutions and organizations that have national legitimacy and rights recognized under international law. Thus, he wagers on peace, but he does not rule out the chances of war. In the welter of political negotiations, his military arsenal abounds with extra resources that make war an extension of politics and deterrence effective and a first-class negotiating card. He is a cautious negotiator who arms himself quietly without indulging in small-time showing off. He will exhaust many people, who stand no chance of obtaining from him anything that he has not already made up his mind to give. His negotiating skill features an enormous capability for endurance and an ideological encyclopedia about rights throughout history. It is also known that al-Asad links his personal dignity to the national dignity. As precious as personal and national dignity are in the East, the legacy of the relationship with the land is equally rich. For Easterners in general and Arabs in particular, land is honor. For al-Asad, negotiations means "either all one's rights or nothing." Either full rights or let the conflict continue for hundreds of years, for history does not belong to one individual. Therefore, by demanding all his rights he is defending history. He is a man whose buttress, like the Great Wall of China, cannot be penetrated. But if some people want to advance negotiations with him, they have to come up with serious initiatives from the start. At any rate, it is no secret that he is agreeable to obtaining full rights in stages, but only in installments that suit him and that may not necessarily suit others. Accordingly, President al- Asad accepts a timetable for withdrawal from the Golan, but he does not accept a phased and unspecified withdrawal. Thus, we can reiterate here that what is acceptable regarding the Golan is "all or nothing." Therefore, if the Israelis like to play for time, let them try it, and we promise them a sure loss against President Hafiz al-Asad. Likewise, if some Americans try to manipulate the two sides of the U.S. Administration--meaning the State Department led by Warren Christopher and President Clinton personally--they will lose and put the future of U.S. relations in the region in great jeopardy, for all the keys are in the hands of Damascus. It is high time the Americans realized where their interests lie and learned not to sacrifice them at the altars of old and inherited policies that time has passed by. Until the eleventh hour comes, we tell everybody: Seize the opportunity before you start to pay for not grasping it. Political reason dictates that you say a positive word in a world that is changing. Syria is the gateway to the Middle East. Syria has paid dearly for a policy that has lasted for 50 years, during which it has become the region's axis. Some people have attempted to marginalize Syria's policy but they lost, as did the region and the world. Thus, admitting Syria's pivotal and premier weight in the entire Middle East is the only key to lasting stability in the region. We believe that it is high time that the U.S. Administration realizes that Israel's weight cannot be equated with Syria's regional weight.
