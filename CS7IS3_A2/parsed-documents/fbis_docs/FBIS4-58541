It was decided that the banking system will follow the policy diligently and that the companies and establishments owned by the government or affiliated to it will avoid participation in the foreign currency market. Taking into consideration the readiness of the banking system to supply the foreign currency requirements of this group of importers, the presence of state companies and those companies affiliated to the government in the foreign currency market will be deemed treason and offenders will be prosecuted. According to a decision by the Cabinet, any negligence by executive banks in carrying out the new decisions by the foreign currency regulating committee will be deemed as collaboration with saboteurs of the state currency and economic system.
