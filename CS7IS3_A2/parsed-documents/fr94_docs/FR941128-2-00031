FR941128-2-00031 FR941128-2-00021 Department of the Air Force Notice of Availability Record of Decision (ROD); KC&hyph;135 Combat Crew Training School (CCTS) Relocation The Air Force has prepared a classified environmental impact statement (EIS) assessing the potential cumulative environmental effects of a Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (Commission) 1993 recommendation to relocate specified KC&hyph;135 CCTS units to Altus AFB, OK. The EIS also analyzed classified C&hyph;17 actions that will take place at Altus. Consideration of cumulative impacts, when associated with the Commission recommendations, required portions of the EIS to be classified. A ROD was prepared in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and summarizes the decision of the Air Force on the proposals. Commission actions in 1991 recommended the closure of Castle AFB and the relocation to Fairchild AFB, Washington, of the 398 OG, which is the Air Force's KC&hyph;135 CCTS. In 1993, Commission recommendations redirected the relocation of the 398 OG from Fairchild AFB to Altus AFB. The President accepted, and the Congress did not reject, the recommendations of the Commission; therefore Public Law 101&hyph;510 requires the Secretary of Defense, as a matter of law, to implement the realignment. The movement of the specified units to Altus AFB is by law, a final decision, therefore, no other beddown alternative locations were assessed. The CCTS conducts formal flying training in the KC&hyph;135 aircraft for pilots, navigators, and boom operators. The CCTS also provides instructor training in each of these aircrew positions. Locating the CCTS at Altus AFB will increase the number of KC&hyph;135s at the base by two for a total of 24 primary assigned aircraft (PAA). The Air Mobility Command's 457 OG, an Altus Tenant that currently operates KC&hyph;135 aircraft, will inactivate before the CCTS starts training. Tulsa, Clinton-Sherman, and Will Rogers World (Oklahoma City) Airports, all in Oklahoma, as well as the Midland International Airport, Texas, may be used as auxiliary training airfields for some CCTS flying training missions.
