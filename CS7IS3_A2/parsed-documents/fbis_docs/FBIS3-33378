During a meeting of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] regional leadership in Sao Paulo, Quercia said he will not play nice during the campaign, and on 21 February he already started attacking his possible adversaries in the presidential succession. The main targets of Quercia's attacks were Deputy Antonio Britto, Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes, and Mayor Paulo Maluf. Quercia's candidacy enjoys the support of most of the members of the regional PMDB leadership; however, he does not have the support of the federal bloc nor of the deputies who back Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho.
