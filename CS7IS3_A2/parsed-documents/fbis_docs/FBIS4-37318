Addressing a news conference attended by Arab and foreign press and television correspondents, as well as an INA correspondent, al-Kibsi said the Yemeni people and the legitimate and constitutional government today face a manifestation of the secessionists' opposition to the will of the Yemeni people, with their various segments and political and social forces. It is a manifestation of their rejection of the democratic option Yemen has chosen since the realization of immortal unity. [passage omitted] He stressed that in the recent battles, the legitimate and constitutional forces achieved successive victories against the remnants of the separatists, who have been forced to retreat into Aden. He said those victories have provided new pieces of evidence that prove conspiratorial and treasonous coordination between the secessionists and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. He said the legitimate and constitutional forces have seized sophisticated weapons and military hardware, comprising a squadron of Sukhoi-22 planes, a battalion of T-72 tanks, in addition to 18 heavy guns, each worth over $5 million. He said the secessionists do not have money to purchase such weapons, adding that these weapons, which have been seized by the legitimate and constitutional forces, are categorical proof of the subordination of that secessionist gang to the powers that do not want Yemeni unity to last. [passage omitted] Asked by INA about Yemen's concept regarding the Arab stand on Yemeni events, the stand of the legitimate and constitutional Yemeni leadership regarding formulas to end the war completely, and the military developments on the battlefield, al-Kibsi said: When fraternal Iraq was exposed to American aggression and to the blockade that is still imposed on its people, the Arabs took positions ranging from those who understood the Iraqi position and were opposed to the aggression and the blockade, to those who adopted the opportunistic and reactionary position of a lackey who did not want the Arab nation to rise via the rise of the Iraqis. The latter stood by the aggression on Iraq and mobilized all their political, material, and military resources against Iraq. They are repeating this stand now against the constitutional Yemeni government and people because they do not want the nation to unite. Moreover, they took this stand because Yemen stood by its Arab brothers in Iraq during the unjust aggression, despite the fact that the Yemeni events are an internal issue and not a dispute or war between Yemen and another external power. Al-Kibsi said Iraq's position on the current Yemeni events is an honorable national and pan-Arab position and has had a great effect on the morale of the united Yemeni people. Al-Kibsi said Yemen rejects any kind of interference in its internal affairs, including interference in the recent events, because what is happening in Yemen today is that secessionist forces are standing against the nationalist and constitutional forces of legitimacy, something that should be rejected by all patriotic, noble, and zealous Arabs. Al-Kibsi said: While we are tightening the grip militarily on the besieged secessionists in Aden, we also support peace from a position of military and political capability. We are ready for a peaceful solution to save our people in southern Yemen from the perils of bloodshed. This is because the renegade secessionist al-Bid compels innocent citizens to withdraw along with him whenever there is military pressure by the forces of constitutional legitimacy. These forces are now no more than 25 km from Aden, the secessionists' major stronghold. He said a constitutional and legitimate Yemeni dialogue should be held with the unionist and nationalist elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and not with its renegade secessionist elements. He pointed out that many nationalist and unionist socialists are now fighting alongside the forces of constitutional legitimacy against the secessionist gang on various combat fronts. Others in Aden are facing pressures by the intelligence elements and henchmen of the renegade secessionist al-Bid. Al-Kibsi explained that the secessionists declared a government that no one recognized and that is rejected by the nationalists and unionists in the YSP itself. Some elements in this party were sentenced to death by the YSP itself. He pointed out that the secessionist group, which claims that it is the government in southern Yemen, is actually an agent of Saudi Arabia and it only consists of those who were in Saudi Arabia. No one has recognized or will recognize this group because the whole world, including the United Nations and the Arab League, recognize only the Republic of Yemen. The head of the Yemeni House of Representatives delegation said each Yemeni citizen throughout the Yemeni homeland has much love and appreciation for Iraq and its leader and people for their sincere and honorable nationalist positions. He explained that his visit to Baghdad, along with the accompanying delegation, is part of parliamentary efforts designed to clarify facts about what is taking place in Yemen.
