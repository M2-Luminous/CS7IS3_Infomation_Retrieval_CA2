Endara said he will ask the Cabinet Council on Wednesday for an 11-day leave to travel abroad starting on 10 June. During his absence Vice President Guillermo Ford will be in charge. The president also said he is preparing a pardon that would complement the amnesty law being discussed at the Legislative Assembly. [Begin recording] [Endara] Since the elections, since before the elections I had planned to grant a pardon immediately after the elections. Great progress has been made on the pardon. The Legislative Assembly, however, has had the same idea, but the fact that I will grant a pardon does not mean the Legislative Assembly cannot grant its amnesty. They are separate measures. I will proceed with my studies of the pardon, and, perhaps before I take my leave, I will have the pardon ready. [Unidentified reporter] Will the pardon benefit those who have committed different types of crimes? [Endara] Only political-type crimes. I am fundamentally concentrating on the 510 corregimiento representatives, who made a political decision, a very dumb one by the way. It was a political-type decision, and they do not have to be politically persecuted for that political decision. I am talking about the case of the 510 corregimiento representatives who made that decision. I am also concentrating on the case of the Council of State, which elected Francisco Rodriguez president even though it did not have the authority to do so. It was strictly a political decision. I am fundamentally concentrating on those two cases. [end recording] President Endara noted that the pardon will not benefit Colonel Eduardo Herrera, who is under arrest and is accused of plotting against the government. [Begin Endara recording] As for the case of Mr. Eduardo Herrera, he committed serious mistakes against a budding democracy in its most critical moments. He was one of the persons who was called upon to protect democracy, but the first thing he did was to try to overthrow it. I am not going to include Mr. Herrera in my pardon. [end recording]
