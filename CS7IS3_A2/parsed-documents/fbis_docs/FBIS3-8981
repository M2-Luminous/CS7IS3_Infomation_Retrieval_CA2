He also replied to some of the questions concerning relations with Croatia. Nadja Pengov has more details about the news conference: [Begin recording] [Pengov] The visit to Chile was of political and economic nature and was successful in both aspects, as Foreign Minister Peterle says. The partners displayed interest in the new markets in Europe and Slovenia can play an important role as a sort of service in this function. Great interest in the economic cooperation with Slovenia was also expressed by the Chilean economics minister. The talks that the economic part of the Slovene delegation held with the representatives of the association of industrialists were also successful. The foreign minister will again visit Latin America in May. On that occasion he will go to Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay where he will sign several economic agreements. The purpose of the visit and the talks at the UN Headquarters in New York was, according to the minister, to accelerate the lifting of the arms embargo for our country. The partner in talks was French Ambassador Merimee who is presiding over the UN Security Council this month. [Peterle] Mr. Merimee was pleased with this meeting and said that new circumstances and new reasons have emerged for Slovenia to be exempt from the embargo. However, he saw no possibility of this happening immediately, that is to say, very soon. He believes that the action should be pursued further on this basis. Judging by these talks I believe that we are actually considerably closer to this solution than we used to be. [Pengov] The opinion of the Brazilian ambassador to the UN, who is the head of the UN Sanctions Committee, was similar. He promised that his commission will act in a way so as not to hurt Slovenia. Now to other issues: Bearing in mind that the second meeting of the Slovene-Croatian border commission was scheduled to take place today and that the meeting did not materialize, the foreign minister, when asked about the reasons, replied that the postponement had been proposed by the Slovene side. The reason? [Peterle] There is no new basis for the work of the commission because the Croatian part of the expert group, that is to say, the geodesists, do not show any willingness to continue searching for a common solution for those sections of the state border for which consensus has not been reached yet. Let me say that the fact that the Croatian Post and Telecommunications public enterprise without any prior warning, let alone consent, redirected the telephone lines of some subscribers on the territory which is within the land registry district of Secovlje does not have a positive effect, also in connection with the work of this commission. [Pengov] What about the refugees moving out of the Slovene holiday homes in Istria? The owners of the holiday homes rejected the request to extend the deadline for their stay and the deadline will thus have to be observed as it was agreed. [end recording]
