Speaking at a meeting of lawmakers on the outlook for South-North economic cooperation, Pae Yong-sik, the deputy director general of the EPB's International Economic Policy Bureau, also said the North would likely open very limited parts of its territory such as the Rajin and Sonbong special economic district along the Tuman River in order to cut off the North Korean community from South Koreans. Stressing the need to proceed slowly on Seoul-Pyongyang economic cooperation, Pae said, "a lot of things have to be considered for the Tuman River area development program, which needs more than 30 billion dollars in funding and coordination of the interests of concerned countries." The EPB official noted that the Tuman River program should be treated as a multilateral project, not as one between Seoul and Pyongyang. "It is desirable for the government to act as the sole agent for economic cooperation with the North in the initial stage to establish order," the official said, adding that private companies could later do business with the North on their own.
