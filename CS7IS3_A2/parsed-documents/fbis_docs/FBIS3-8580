The governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) will "almost certainly" be addressed when the new government is formed, said Kovac, who was recently expelled from the HZDS following his criticism of former Premier Vladimir Meciar. The composition of the government will be decided within a week, he added. Leader of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky called September the most likely election date. "I hope parliament will pass the constitutional law setting the date for early elections in the autumn," he added. Carnogursky ruled out the possibility that he would join the new government, adding that the idea that the cabinet be formed without political leaders was correct. "A new cabinet can be formed within a few hours," former chairman of the Slovak National Party Ludovit Cernak said. "All the parties are ready to put an end to feuds and to agree on a broad coalition government which will lead Slovakia to early elections," he said. "I believe ethnic Hungarian parties will not make extravagant claims because all the parties have pledged to set their own needs aside," Cernak said. He confirmed he respected the preliminary agreement providing for the absence of political leaders in the provisional government.
