The Commission views the applicant countries as support for the new foreign and security policy, rather than an encumbrance, despite their tradition of neutrality. A strong argument voiced against expanding the union, expressed by many countries, France for one, was the fact that three of the applicants, Finland, Sweden, and Austria, were neutral. But the concept of neutrality has been modified since the fall of the Berlin wall, and the juxtaposition East-West has ceased to be current. "Finland is apt rather to promote a stronger security policy than prevent such a development." Sweden's Prime Minister Carl Bildt has no objections to joining the WEU. Nor will Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democrats' leader, try to stop such a development. During a background briefing on Tuesday [15 March], a high official at the Directorate General explained to a group of journalists that he did not expect that the applicants would create any kind of problem in the area of foreign and security policy. "When Finland joins the EU, it will share a 1,200-km-long border with Russia. It is up to us to find a formula for exporting stability, instead of succumbing to the insecurity bacteria from the other side," noted the spokesperson. [passage omitted] "If the political willingness is there, then the Council of Ministers can react to these proposals," said the official. "However, in order for the Commission to make suggestions in this field, we must define the common interest," he added. "Currently, it is most important for the WEU to concentrate on the standardization of weapons and to direct and monitor the implementation of sanctions on the Danube," added the official. At the Directorate General, the view is that the next expansion phase will include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. This should take place around the turn of the century, with negotiations taking place during the period 1996-98. "The current scenario is that these three countries will be part of the expansion. Other countries are currently lagging too far behind," the official concluded.
