By deepening reform of the enterprise personnel system and breaking down the barriers in regard to the status of cadres and workers, some 120,000 exemplary workers in Beijing have assumed leadership and management positions in enterprises. For years, Chinese enterprises practiced a "life tenure" system in regard to the status of cadres and workers. Once you became a cadre, it meant you were sitting on an "iron armchair" -- your rank was guaranteed for life regardless of your ability and performance. Restricted by his status, a worker, no matter of how talented he is, will find it almost impossible to assume leadership or management responsibility in an enterprises. Such a personnel system is not conducive to optimizing managerial talent and promoting talent. In 1984, Beijing started introducing competition mechanisms in a bid to reform the enterprise personnel system. On one hand, the city introduced an appointments system for the existing cadres. Those who were not appointed were reassigned as workers and paid as such. Their status as a cadre was retained only in their personal files. At the same time, outstanding workers were appointed administrators and managers and started to draw the benefits due cadres. A new mechanism of mobility whereby both cadres and workers can be assigned as a worker or manager and receive the benefits due their posts began to take shape. Figures of the Beijing City Personnel Bureau show that workers hired as cadres account for nearly one-third of the cadres in the city's state-owned enterprises. In some enterprises, such cadres account for nearly half of the ranks of cadres. Promoting cadres from among workers has put an end to the situation in which demobilized Army cadres and graduates of colleges and secondary vocational schools made up the primary source of cadres, thereby expanding the source of potential cadres available for the entire work force of enterprises and creating opportunities for outstanding workers to show their talents. In hiring cadres, enterprises in Beijing earnestly solicit the views of workers and set strict standards. Most of the workers selected are under 35 and have finished senior high school. They have rich work experience, are content with their work, and can identify with the workers. Most of them have become backbone management personnel. [passage omitted] Cadres who are promoted from among cadres do not have an "iron armchair" on which to sit. Enterprises appraise the performance of every appointed cadre. Competent ones will be reappointed and the incompetent ones will be demoted or reassigned as a worker. This has injected competition, energy, and mobility into the ranks of cadres. Every year, about 20,000 outstanding workers in the city's state-owned enterprises are promoted to the ranks of management. At the same time, a number of incompetent cadres are reassigned as workers. This has not only enhanced the sense of competition and self-restraint among appointed cadres but has also aroused the initiative of the demoted cadres. [passage omitted] Party committees at all levels in Beijing have stepped up efforts to elevate workers to cadre level by, among other things, having them take courses at party schools or spare-time universities to improve their knowledge of policies and to sharpen their vocational skills. To institutionalize and standardize this practice of enterprises appointing cadres from among the workers, the city personnel bureau has formulated a series of regulations governing the promotion, evaluation, approval, management, and material benefits of workers-turned-cadres.
