Lack of such information is especially acute when priority objectives are concerned. Since progress in these areas is largely determined by the production of chemical reagents and ultra-pure substances, this requires a stream of the most diversified information. Information systems in chemistry occupy a special place within automated information systems due to the need for handling huge volumes of highly complex information. One of the major problems of chemists working on chemical reagents and ultra-pure substances is optimization in selecting a method for purification and the equipment design needed to provide a given degree of purity. Resolution of these problems within the framework of a developing expert system (scheme) was facilitated by the following: a) classification and systematization of existing information; b) development of an interface with the user, and development of program shell for the expert system; c) development of a system for comprehending the subject matter and the multiplicity of rules describing it; d) filling out a data base. In the present work some results are presented on the development of an expert system for analyzing methods of preparation and equipment design for ultra-purification that takes into account the physical chemical properties of the product and a required level of impurities. A multi-level systematization of the literature and an expert evaluation of purification methods was developed and a universal shell based on the FoxPro data base system was worked out. This enables development of expert systems in the technology of chemical reagents and ultra-pure substances that also provides the user with the opportunity to supplement and modify the data base if needed.
