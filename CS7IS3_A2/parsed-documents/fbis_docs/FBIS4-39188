These security measures were approved on Monday by the coordination council of Tajik law enforcement bodies, which met here under the chairmanship of First Vice-Speaker of the Tajik Supreme Soviet Abdulmadjid Dostiyev. The vice-speaker said that they were prompted by the current dangerous criminogenic situation in the city, which had, in fact, gone out of control in recent days. As earlier reported, a wave of terroristic acts swept the Tajik capital this May. Their victims included prominent Tajik businessmen and journalists, as well as officers of the Russian military contingent and the national armed forces. The patrol squads are vested with extensive rights, including the right to inspect all types of transport vehicles, check the documents of citizens, and confiscate unlawfully possessed weapons. The areas, where Russian servicemen and their families are housed, are being guarded with particular care. The patrols are allowed to open fire in case of resistance or refusal to obey their orders.
