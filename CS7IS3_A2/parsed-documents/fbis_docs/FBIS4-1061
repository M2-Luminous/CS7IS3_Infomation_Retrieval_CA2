Addressing a short media conference in Ulundi after his first election rally in the kwaZulu capital, Mr Buthelezi said: "One must accept that whatever the international monitors say will be it -- whatever one's feelings may be." On the IFP's election candidate lists, Mr Buthelezi said these were still being drafted. He however "assumed" he would head the party list for the National Assembly. "As national leader of the party I have to be on the national list. One can't appear on both," he said in response to a question on whether he was eyeing the kwaZulu Natal premiership position. The IFP president was at pains to point out that his party had decided to contest the poll just 24 hours earlier and was still in the process of preparing its nomination lists.
