Chirac Delays Announcement of Candidacy According to Gilles Bresson writing in the 9 May Paris daily LE MONDE, Chirac is profiting from the drop in Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's popularity, which is affording him a margin of maneuver he had been unable to achieve since last summer. A "pragmatic" Chirac who is "ill at ease in the domain of ideas" is at tempting to give the impression he can "offer a dream" by affirming that he is working on a program out lining the France of the year 2000, Bresson wrote. This initiative is supposed to lend him the "aura of a visionary" and elevate him above the other candidates and Edouard Balladur who, according to Chirac, "still has his hands in the grease." The RPR leader has decided to reveal his vision of the future piecemeal during his trips to the provinces, a move allowing him to dominate headlines in local papers and television news for months. When Balladur was high in the polls Chirac had planned to go on the offensive by unveiling his entire program at the end of June. He has now decided against this strategy for fear of moving too soon. Bresson quoted a close Chirac aide as saying that "Chirac is afraid of declaring himself a candidate at the wrong time and trusts no one." Chirac is currently courting centrists by accepting Dominique Baudis as head of the majority list for the European Parliament elections and making overtures to his partners, such as his promise to consider centrist Pierre Mehaignerie for prime minister if he were elected president. Chirac aides are also recruiting French Democratic Union (UDF) deputies, who would give official support to a Chirac candidacy. Chirac Choices Assessed Chirac is facing a number of decisive choices, Frederic Gerschel writes in the 12 May Paris weekly PARIS MATCH. The first is finding a "propitious" time to declare his candidacy, which could be at the beginning of September. However, a number of his aides argue that a premature disclosure could favor Balladur, who has long maintained he will not discuss the issue before January 1995. Gerschel cited a Chirac aide as saying that "Balladur will entertain ambiguity as long as possible because he knows that a declared candidate immediately becomes suspect." A second choice centers on the attitude Chirac must adopt. Chirac wants to be seen as above "pedestrian" matters, to put the finishing touches on his image as a politician concerned with major problems. A third focuses on the program he will present to the French people. Chirac has set up a group of about 60 experts and parliamentarians to formulate proposals. Unemployment will be a major issue, Gerschel noted, citing Chirac's entourage as declaring that the difference between their man and Balladur may well reside in "the primacy of the social field over the economic." While Balladur has maintained that one should not get caught up in such a debate because "there is no social progress without a strong economy," Chirac has been advocating a "new social contract that would break with the status quo." Noting that Chirac has twice "rendered homage" to Philippe Seguin, the declared adversary of the prime minister's economic policies, Gerschel concluds that a possible Chirac-Seguin ticket is increasingly being considered.
