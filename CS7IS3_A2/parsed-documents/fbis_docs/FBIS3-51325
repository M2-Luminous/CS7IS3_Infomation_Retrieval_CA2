After the Mexican Army's offensive during the first days of the armed uprising that began on 1 January, members of the Zapatist National Liberation Front (EZLN) retreated to the jungle areas near San Cristobal de las Casas, from where they direct their attacks. On Wednesday [12 January] Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ordered the Armed Forces to observe a cease-fire against the "transgressors of the law" (as the government describes the rebels) and since then official reports maintain there is absolute peace in that area. The Mexican press, however, reported on today's front page that some isolated groups of soldiers have clashed with rebels on Wednesday and Thursday without specifying which side fired first. The daily LA JORNADA reported that a group of soldiers clashed with presumed guerrillas in the Lacandona jungle area, a few kilometers from the Indian village of San Miguel. "There is no truce, no cease-fire in the Chiapas jungles," the report said. "We were stopped by recurrent detonations that sounded like a pistol discharging all of its ammunition. Those detonations were followed by synchronized machinegun fire. We heard heavy shooting from tanks. For 10 minutes, the shooting made the jungle birds fly away, while we waited in Chuvi," LA JORNADA journalists reported. The report added that a dozen tanks entered the towns of San Miguel, Patate Viejo, and Chivi on Thursday "attacking EZLN rebels," and that helicopters and reconnaissance planes participated in the attack. Apparently the announcement of the unilateral cease-fire has not reached the soldiers, who are still searching for rebels in the jungles of Lacandona -- considered the "lungs of Mexico" -- and probably it has not reached the Zapatists dispersed in the mountains either. Regarding this, it is being said this is why the EZLN General Command has not responded to the government's invitation to hold peace talks, which is creating a tense and long wait for authorities. Civilian sources from the town of Altamirano, which was taken by the rebels on 1 January, said the soldiers, who were deployed there to prevent more rebels attacks, maintain it in a "virtual state of siege. They do not allow us to go out to work in the fields or visit relatives in other villages; they supervise the distribution of food and supplies and oversee the activities of all residents of Altamirano as if we were suspects," one of the residents said. The National Defense Secretariat reported the situation in the mountainous and jungle region in Los Altos de Chiapas "remains completely calm." It added that during the patrols ordered by the Army to guarantee peace in the region and the security of the local residents "no armed group was discovered" in the last 24 hours. Most radio, television, and newspaper media, relying on official reports, maintain that peace reigns in the area and that the dialogue between the government and the rebels will be held soon.
