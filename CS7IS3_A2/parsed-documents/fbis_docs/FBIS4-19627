Their Land Rover was rocked by a blast as it drove along Spencer Road, in the Waterside area of Londonderry, shortly before midnight. The RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] confirmed that one male officer was killed, and two others "very seriously injured" in the attack. Early today a spokesperson at the town's Altnagelvin Hospital said the two injured officers were in "a very serious condition." The blast was heard over a wide area of Londonderry. Security forces sealed off the largely commercial road before beginning a search operation. An RUC spokesman said the attack was being treated as ther work of the IRA. Earlier in the evening, a man was shot and injured at a police checkpoint in South Armagh. Police said the man was taken to hospital suffering from a leg wound after a number of shots were fired by police at a civilian vehicle. Another man was arrested. An investigation was mounted after the incident at Ballsmill Road near Silverbridge. The scene is a few miles from Crossmaglen, where a major security operation has been mounted in recent days at the start of major re-building work at the village security base which has been regularly attacked by the IRA.
