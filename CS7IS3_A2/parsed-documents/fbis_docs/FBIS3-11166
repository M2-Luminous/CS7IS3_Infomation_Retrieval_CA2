After attempting in vain to be received by the congressmen who were present in the building, the demonstrators invaded the provincial Congress and destroyed the glass windows on the ground floor, as well as several offices. After the incidents, the workers went to Independence Square, in front of Government House, where they are still waiting for a meeting with Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega to take stock of the situation. The workers' protest demonstration was staged within the framework of those that began 15 days ago after news was published that the sugar mill had gone bankrupt. Governor Ortega said he would not meet with "anyone who has chosen to adopt violent methods." Ortega is holding a meeting with the representatives of the Alcofin company, which will be in charge of exploiting the sugar mill from now on. The congressmen were surprised at the police delay in containing the demonstrators. The police did not arrive at the Congress building until the demonstrators were already leaving, and did not arrest anyone. The workers' version of the incident has it that "the attacks began from inside the Congress building," from where the first stones and firecrackers were hurled. Some Congress employees were injured trying to leave the area. Acting Congress President Christian Saracho held Miguel Brito, secretary general of the local General Confederation of Labor office, as one of those responsible for the incidents.
