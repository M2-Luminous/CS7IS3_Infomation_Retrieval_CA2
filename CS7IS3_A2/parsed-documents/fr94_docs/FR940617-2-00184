(70&hyph;7022) American Electric Power Company, Inc. (``AEP''), a registered holding company, and AEP Generating Company (``Generating''), an electric public utility subsidiary of AEP, both of 1 Riverside Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, have filed a post-effective amendment to their application-declaration filed under Sections 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 12(d) of the Act and Rules 44 and 45 thereunder. By order dated August 17, 1984 (HCAR No. 23399), Generating acquired a 1/2 undivided interest in the Rockport Generating Station (``Plant'') with Indiana & Michigan Electric Company, now Indiana Michigan Power Company (``I&M''), also a subsidiary of AEP, including responsibility for 50% of the costs associated with acquiring certain air and water pollution control devices (``Project''). By order dated October 4, 1984 (HCAR No. 23445) (``October 1984 Order''), Generating was authorized to enter into an Agreement of Sale (``Agreement'') with the City of Rockport, Indiana (``City'') providing for the construction and installation of the Project by the City, and the issuance by the City of pollution control revenue bonds (``Series 1984 A bonds'') to finance Generating's share of the Project. The October 1984 Order authorized the issuance of the Series 1984 A Bonds in a principal amount of $150 million. In addition, the October 1984 Order reserved jurisdiction ``with respect to the fees and commissions to be incurred by [Generating] and AEP in connection with this transaction, and the terms of sale under the Agreement.'' By order dated September 6, 1985 (HCAR No. 23821) (``1985 Order''), Generating was authorized to enter into a First Amendment to Agreement of Sale (``1985 Agreement'') with the City providing for the issuance and sale of three additional series of pollution control bonds (collectively, ``Series 1985 Bonds''), each in the principal amount of $55 million with a maturity of September 1, 2014. One series of the Series 1985 Bonds was issued with a variable interest rate (``Variable Rate Bonds'') the rate of which was based upon an index and not to exceed 12% per annum, determined weekly and payable monthly. A second series of the Series 1985 Bonds was issued with the interest payable semi-annually at a rate which will be adjusted every five years based upon an index (``Adjustable Bonds''). A third series of the Series 1985 Bonds was issued with the interest rate fixed at 93/8% per annum, payable semi-annually (``Fixed Rate Bonds''), and these Fixed Rate Bonds were issued subject to optional redemption following an initial period not to exceed ten years. The proceeds of the Series 1985 Bonds were used to cover a portion of the cost of construction of the Project and to refund the outstanding short-term Series 1984 A Bonds in the principal amount of $150 million. The 1985 Order included no reservation of jurisdiction. AEP and Generating now propose that Generating entire into an agreement with the City whereby the City will issue and sell up to $55 million of a series of refunding bonds (``Refunding Bonds'') the net proceeds from the sale of which will be used to provide for the payment of principal required for the refunding prior to their stated maturity of $55 million principal amount of the Fixed Rate Bonds. The Refunding Bonds will be issued under and secured by the existing indenture (``Indenture'') between the City and the Lincoln National Bank and Trust Company, as trustee (``Trustee'') and a fifth supplemental indenture (``Fifth Supplemental Indenture'') to be execute pursuant to Commission authorization under this post-effective amendment. Pursuant to the Indenture and the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the proceeds of the sale of the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds will be deposited with the Trustee and applied by the Trustee, together with other funds supplied by Generating, to the redemption of the Series 1985 A Bonds at a price of 102% of the principal amount thereof. It is stated that the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds will bear interest semi-annually and mature at a date or dates not more than 40 years from the date of their issuance. The Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds may be subject to mandatory or optional redemption under circumstances and terms specified at the time of pricing, and, if it is deemed advisable, may also include a sinking fund provision. In addition, the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds may not, if it is deemed advisable, be redeemable at the option of the City in whole or in part at any time for a period to be determined at the time of pricing the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds.
