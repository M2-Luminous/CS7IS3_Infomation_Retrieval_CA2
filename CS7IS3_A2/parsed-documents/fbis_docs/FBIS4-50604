As exports continue to slide, Taiwan's trade surplus this year is expected to drop to a 13-year low of U.S.$2 billion, compared to U.S.$18.7 billion in 1987, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) reported Friday [13 May]. Taiwan's trade surplus continued to fall in the first four months of this year, even after the island recorded its lowest trade surplus in nine years in 1993, BOFT Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu said. If the trend persists, he said, Taiwan is doomed to become an import-oriented country rather than an export-oriented one. Lin said the development may serve as an important early warning signal for Taiwan, an economy heavily dependent on manufacturing industries and exports. As exports are becoming less vital, domestic demand will become the prime mover behind the country's economic growth in the future, Lin maintained. Lin hoped that Taiwan would follow in the footsteps of Singapore in keeping a surplus in its international balance of payments despite running a deficit in foreign trade. Singapore has witnessed deficits in foreign trade during the last five years. It, however, maintained a comfortable international balance of payments surplus of U.S.$3 billion in 1992, with its two-way trade deficit exceeding U.S.$8.7 billion, Lin said. Meanwhile, Lin hoped that Taiwan would not turn out to be the second South Korea, which was ousted from the informal "Asian's four little dragons" grouping last year because of its relatively poor economic performance. South Korea has suffered a continued decline in exports during the last few years due to sluggish industrial development. Its economy failed to pick up because other domestic industries, including the service industry, didn't rise to fill the vacancies left by departing manufacturing industries, Lin said. According to customs tallies, Taiwan exported U.S.$27.58 billion worth of goods and services in the January-April period of this year, up 2.3 percent over the similar period last year, with metal, electrical machinery, and textile products dominating the export list. Imports during the four-month period totaled U.S.$26.98 billion, up 7.2 percent over a year-earlier, with capital equipment, industrial and farm raw materials, metals, and chemicals leading the trade. During the four months, exports to the United States, Japan and Europe all declined while Taiwan's deficit with Japan increased, Lin said.
