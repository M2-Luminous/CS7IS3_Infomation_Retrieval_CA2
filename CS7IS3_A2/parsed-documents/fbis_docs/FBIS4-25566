He emphasized during the meeting: The most fundamental task of ideological and political work during the new period is to educate the vast number of party members, cadres, and people in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. To perform the task well conscientiously is the most important and effective way to strengthen and improve ideological and political work and to raise it to a higher level. The meeting was held in the Huairen Hall at Zhongnanhai. Nearly 100 people attended. They included Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat, and department heads and full-time party secretaries of Central Committee organs. During the meeting, Tian Congming, Yang Xingfu, Cui Yuanxi, and Sun Guozhi, persons in charge of relevant organizations, gave reports on their organizations' ideological and political work. After hearing their reports, Hu Jintao pointed out: To build socialism with Chinese characteristics is the common aspiration of the people across the country and it is a task in the people's fundamental interest. To accomplish it, we must rely on the people across the country to display a pioneering spirit and work hard in unity. We should now effectively seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, maintain statability, and continue to advance toward the splendid goal. Fundamentally speaking, to do so, we must rely on the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, on the strong party leadership, and on effective ideological and political work to arouse to the maximum extent the enthusiasm of millions upon millions of people and to fully bring into play their wisdom and talents. Ideological and political work is our party's fine tradition and political superiority. During the historical period of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and during the present course of establishing a socialist market economic structure, we must take a further step to carry forward the tradition and give play to the superiority. We must not weaken the tradition and superiority even a little bit. Hu Jintao said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always attached great importance to ideological and political work. He has made a series of expositions on the new period's ideological and political work, which are the important contents of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and are a correct guidance for us to do ideological and political work well in the new period. He has set a brilliant example for the whole party in attaching great importance to ideological and political work and in earnestly doing the work himself. We should seriously study and understand Comrade Xiaoping's expositions on ideological and political work and conscientiously strengthen and improve ideological and political work under the new situation. Hu Jintao emphasized: To arm the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a longterm strategic task. We should proceed from the characteristics of the organs under the Central Committee to guide the masses into considering the new situation and new tasks and adhering to the principle of integrating theory with practice. Efforts should be made to study theories and major practical problems thoroughly and to apply what has been studied. As a result of the study, we should enhance our understanding of ideological theories and policies, improve our political quality, and make the organs under the Central Committee play an even better role in serving the central authorities, the grass-roots units and the people, and in serving reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. Hu Jintao pointed out: An important principle during the new period is to do ideological and political work; implement the party's basic line, principles, and policies; and accomplish the party's central task simultaneously. The task of strengthening and improving ideological and political work must be done in conjunction with the general task of the whole party and the whole country -- to "seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain statability." This is a new demand set by the new situation and new tasks, a test for party and government organs in ideological and political work, and also an opportunity for them to further strengthen and improve their ideological and political work. We should seize the good opportunity to step up ideological education and ideological guidance in light of new realities and to remarkably improve ideological and political work. Hu Jintao said: A party or government organ's ideological and political work is linked to its party building work. When the party organizations at all levels in the organ become stronger, have a greater fighting power, and fully display the party's superiority, they will promote the organ's ideological and political work, as well as its other undertakings. We should continue to properly improve leading bodies' ideology and work style. While holding democratic meetings regularly, we should uphold and improve democratic centralism. It is also necessary to persistently manage the party strictly and to continually improve the contingent of party members' quality. Communist party members in Central Committee organs should continually undergo tests to strengthen their party spirit. At their respective posts and while conducting various organ activities, they should be models who resolutely implement the party's basic line and its various general and specific policies, and who safeguard and enhance the party's overall work across China. They should be models who wholeheartedly serve the people, who foster close ties with the masses, and who conscientiously safeguard the masses' interests. Furthermore, they should be models who do arduous and pioneering work; who honestly and diligently administer; and who conscientiously resist money worship, hedonism, and extreme individualism. In addition, they should be models who study hard and who are practical and creative. Hu Jintao pointed out at the end: Leadership is the key to intensifying and improving ideological and political work. Major leading comrades in various departments in Central Committee organs should take the lead in paying close attention in this regard, should earnestly practice what they advocate, and should realistically strengthen their leadership over ideological and political work in their units. Various units should include ideological and political work in their work schemes and agenda, and should thoroughly study, examine, and supervise the work. Party organizations in the organs should be responsible for properly and regularly conducting ideological and political work, and should actively and effective promote ideological and political work through various activities. Leading comrades in various organs and party organizations should pay full attention to cultivating the growth of the cadres contingent who handle political work. Comrades who handle ideological and political work should further strengthen their sense of responsibility; should continually promote the spirit of making selfless sacrifices and actively forging ahead; and should cautiously, conscientiously, and properly perform their work so as to further propel departments' tasks to progress to a higher level. Also attending the meeting were comrades in charge of various units in Central Committee organs including Gu Yunfei, Li Shuzheng, Wang Jialiu, Pang Xianzhi, Shao Huaze, Guo Chaoren, Sun Jiazheng, and Li Keqiang.
