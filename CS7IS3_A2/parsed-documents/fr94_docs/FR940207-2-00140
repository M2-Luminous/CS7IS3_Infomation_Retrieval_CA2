FR940207-2-00140 FR940207-2-00069 The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . The PSE proposal to list and trade ADR options where 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume of the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market is identical to proposals by the Amex, CBOE, and Phlx to provide for the listing of ADR options that meet this uniform standard. 22 The Amex, CBOE, and Phlx proposals were subject to a full notice and comment period and no comments were received. 23 22 Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33102 (October 25, 1993), 58 FR 58356 (November 1, 1993) (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;38), 33103 (October 25, 1993), 58 FR 58357 (November 1, 1993) (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;28), and 33252 (November 26, 1993), 58 FR 63604 (December 2, 1993) (SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;54). 23 Although Amendment No. 1 to the proposal was not part of the Amex, CBOE, and Phlx proposals when they were noticed for comment, the Commission notes that Amendment No. 1 merely clarifies how the PSE will determine whether not less than 50% (or less than 30%, in the case of the maintenance standard) of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security (as represented by ADRS, common stock and any other related securities) occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission believes that this amendment does not make a substantive change to the proposal and, thus, raises no new issues. Further, the Commission believes that the Amendment strengthens the proposal by ensuring that the standard will be applied consistently by all the markets seeking to list ADR options. The Commission further notes that approving the current proposal, including Amendment No. 1, on an accelerated basis will permit the PSE to compete on an equal basis with the other options exchanges for orders in ADR options. Accordingly, since the Commission finds that the current proposal involves the exact same issues as the above-noted proposals, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act 24 to approve the PSE's proposal on an accelerated basis. 24‚ê£15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) and 78F(b)(5)(1988).
