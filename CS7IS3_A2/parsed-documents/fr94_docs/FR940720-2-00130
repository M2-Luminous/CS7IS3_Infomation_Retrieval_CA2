FR940720-2-00130 FR940720-2-00073 III. Discussion The Participants have submitted to the Commission proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Plan, and have requested continued exemptive relief under certain provisions under the Act. 12 The Commission's approval of Amendment No. 1 and the requests for continued exemptive relief are discussed below. In the 1990 Plan Approval Order, the Commission stated that it would review several issues related to the Plan after it had been in operation for one year. These issues are also discussed below. Furthermore, in 1985, 1992, and 1993, the Commission discussed the possible need for an intermarket linkage and a trade-through rule for transactions effected pursuant to extensions of OTC/UTP. 13 As discussed below, the Commission continues to believe that such a linkage and/or rule in this context may be appropriate. 12 See 1994 Extension Request, supra note 2. 13 See 1985 OTC/UTP Order, supra note 6; 1992 Phlx Pilot Order, supra note 10; and 1993 Phlx Pilot Extension Order, supra note 11. A. Proposed Amendment No. 1 of the Plan Section XIV of the Plan provides that the NASD shall recover from exchange Participants a sum of money to be negotiated. Specifically, Section XIV of the Plan states: [I]t is expressly agreed and understood among the Participants that specific provisions governing the issues of cost allocation and revenue-sharing among the Participants will not be included in the Plan at the time of execution thereof, but will be resolved within one year from the commencement of the Plan's operation. The provisions agreed upon by the Participants will be applied on a retroactive basis by means of an amendment to the Plan. There shall be no retroactive application if the Participants are unable to agree upon a cost allocation and revenue-sharing provision or the amount of recapture. *␣*␣* Even through the Plan has been in operation for one year, the Participants have not yet come to an agreement concerning revenue sharing. Proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Plan, which the Commission is approving today, extends the negotiation period for an additional six months. Thus, the Plan will now require the Participants to come to an agreement on these financial matters before January 12, 1995. To assist the Participants in ensuring compliance with this Plan amendment, the Commission is requesting each Participant (including the BSE) to submit a written report to the Commission on or before September 30, 1994, that describes the status of the negotiations, and the Participant's position with respect to those negotiations. 14 14 The Commission notes that, throughout the Plan negotiations prior to the 1990 Plan Approval Order, the Participants agreed that distributions would be made from net operating revenues, rather than net income, as the basis for determining revenues pursuant to the Plan. In 1990, the Commission expressly approved the language ``net operating revenues'' in this regard. See 1990 Plan Approval Order, supra note 3. The Commission reiterates this determination in approving the extension of the Plan. B. BBO Calculation and Extension of Rule 11Ac2&hyph;1 Exemptive Relief On a temporary basis also scheduled to expire July 12, 1994, the Commission provided an exemption from Rule 11Ac2&hyph;1 under the Act regarding the calculated BBO for securities quoted pursuant to the Plan. At the Participants' request, the Commission is extending this exemptive relief through July 12, 1995, provided that the Plan continues in effect through that date pursuant to a Commission order. The Plan provides that, in calculating the BBO disseminated to vendors, if quotations of more than one Participant are identical in price, then the earliest in time is the best. While the Commission chose not to modify this Plan provision in 1990, the Commission stated in approving both the Chx Interim Plan, and the Plan, that it would continue to reevaluate this BBO calculation. Indeed, the Commission stated that its temporary approval of this BBO calculation would not foreclose a future Commission decision to require size priority pursuant to the Vendor Display Rule, 15 should such a decision be appropriate. The Commission also notes that, in the 1990 Plan Approval Order, the Commission stated that the NASD had represented to the Commission that the Plan Processor would include a ``switch'' for easy conversion if the Commission determines that the BBO should be calculated using price/size/time priority. 16 15 17 CFR 240.11Ac1&hyph;2. 16 See 1990 Plan Approval Order, supra note 3. In order to evaluate the effects of this term of the Plan, the Commission is requesting that the Participants each submit to the Commission a written evaluation of any relevant effects of the BBO calculation based on time on or before September 30, 1994.
