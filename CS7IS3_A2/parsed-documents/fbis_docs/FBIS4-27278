Takahiro Yokomichi, officials said. The meeting, which had been expected to be held Wednesday, was to bring together members of a Social Democratic Party (SDP) policy study group called "Democrats" and of a parliamentary group consisting of new party Sakigage [Harbinger], the Group Seiun and Minshu no Kaze (Democratic Wind). The idea of forming the new political group, aimed at seeking a new direction by uniting democratic forces, was revealed by Minshu no Kaze members on May 20. However, plans were apparently derailed by a report in a leading Japanese daily that Yokomichi was to be involved. The MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported in its Monday evening edition that the new political group to be formed by some 60 lower house members in June had already asked Yokomichi to become a member. The 53-year-old Yokomichi, who was elected four times to the House of Representatives with SDP backing beginning in 1969, is widely regarded as a likely leader of a new political group in the event of further political realignment. Yokomichi told a press conference in Sapporo, Hokkaido, about a week ago that he would not seek reelection as governor of the northernmost main island next spring, promoting speculation that he might return to national politics. One of four Minshu no Kaze members, Yuichi Takami, denied he had contacted Yokomichi on the issue, saying "we will wait until the public excitement over the affair dies down" before forming the group. Political sources said the prospects that the group would offer a stage for Yokomichi might be based on the close relationship between the governor and another Minshu no Kaze member Satoshi Arai who once served as head of the governor's office in Hokkaido. The four-member group Minshu no Kaze on Tuesday joined an existing 18-member parliamentary group comprising new party Sakigage and the Group Seiun. Minshu no Kaze defected from the Japan New Party (JNP) headed by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa due to differences with the party leadership. Sakigage, a 15-member party, is headed by Masayoshi Takemura, former chief cabinet secretary in the preceding coalition government. The three-member Seiun, also a breakaway from the JNP, left after Hosokawa failed to carry out a planned merger with Sakigake.
