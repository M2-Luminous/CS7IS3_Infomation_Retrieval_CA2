This is what the Foreign Affairs Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri said in an exclusive statement to EL MASSA newspaper following the sixth summit of the AMU states. Mr. Dembri said that political will has been mostly premature, noting that realism meant that world transformations should be taken into account and that these transformations will not allow for any individual adventure from now on. He added that it was imperative that we organize ourselves as an integral entity and hold dialogue with the others in order to become a partner either in the North- South direction, or within the framework of the Mediterranean states, or within Arab unity, or in the South-South direction. The minister for foreign affairs spoke about the Algerian-Syrian call for the holding of a meeting of Arab Mediterranean states. He said that the call aimed at stressing the need for starting consultations between these countries so that we could agree at least on what to be said in the Mediterranean forum.
