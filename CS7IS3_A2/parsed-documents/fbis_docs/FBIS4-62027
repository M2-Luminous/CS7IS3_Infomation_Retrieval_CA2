Russia Thinks That the United States Is Indifferent To It"] [Text] The fifth forum of the Russian-U.S. Aspen Dialogue, organized on our side by the International Association of Enterprise Directors [IAED] and on the U.S. side by the Colorado State Civil Administration Center (Aspen), ended in Sochi last weekend with the adoption of a final declaration. This time its text was rather tough. The sides have started talking about a "post-romantic" period in the relations between Russia and the United States. The Americans expressed misgivings about the nature of Russian democracy which is in a state of lengthy transition, not excluding the possibility of an "enlightened authoritarianism" period being established (the term by Presidential Council member Andranik Migranyan). And they expressed doubts as to whether democratic goals can be achieved by undemocratic means. Greg Guroff, director of a U.S. State Department division, said that the U.S. press and the people no longer love Yeltsin as before. And support by U.S. politicians of actions analogous to the storming of the White House in Moscow will not be repeated. The Russian side however, in the person of IAED President Mark Masarksiy, believes that the return of authoritarianism is impossible because federal power can no longer concentrate all financing in its hands following the introduction of a two-way taxation system. The declaration also talks about the Americans' anxiety over Russia's policy in the CIS states which the Russian side regards as a sphere of its vital interests, while the opposite side sees it as a zone of possible expansion by Moscow within the former Soviet sphere of influence. "For the United States and the world community, 25 million Russian-speakers in the CIS is no less painful an issue than the Armenians living in Azerbaijan or representatives of other nations in third countries," Mr. Guroff believes. The final document also states that "U.S. policy... has lost an element of sensitivity to Russia's real needs in the post- confrontation situation." This statement was preceded by a speech by Aleksandr Yakovlev, director of the Russian Federal TV and Radio Broadcasting Service. He noted that "the United States' policy toward Russia is temporizing and indifferent." The Marshall Plan was adopted because it testified to victory and billions were spent on it. On the other hand, the revolution of the 80's and 90's in Russia was "alien" to it, and it gave nothing. "And this is just as well," Mr. Yakovlev thinks. In his opinion, in the United States there is no understanding that reformation of Russia has worldwide importance. The Americans for their part have recognized that their country has no coherent policy with respect to Russia. The tonality of the Aspen dialogue has also changed. Whereas earlier the forum was of an enlightening character -- U.S. experts/democrats were teaching the young Russia -- now they want to understand what is really going on over here.
