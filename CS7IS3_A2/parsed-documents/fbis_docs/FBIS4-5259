The Gold Mine on the Mekong River's Bank"] [Summary] "Somphong Mongkhonvilai, vice chairman of the Laos Commission for Cooperation and Planning, confirmed that the LPDR [Lao People's Democratic Republic] is quite rich in natural resources compared to other countries in this region. At present, forests cover 47 percent of the total area of the country. Geographically speaking, Laos can build as many as 18 hydroelectric dams with a combined production of electricity of 14,000 megawatts. Forty percent of the water in the Mekong River comes from Lao territory." French geologists have confirmed that huge deposits of over 10 precious minerals were found in different parts of the country. Dr. Wiraphong Ramangkun, former economic advisor to the Lao Government and secretary of the Thai-Lao Friendship Association, disclosed that the lignite deposit discovered in the area of Hong Sa Special Zone "is three times larger than that of Thailand's Mae Mo mine and sufficient for electricity production for up to 60 years" Moreover, zinc, tungsten, and gypsum can also be found in large quantities in Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, and Xieng Khwang Provinces while blue sapphire is also plentiful in Bokeo Province. Phadaeng Industry Company of Thailand reported the discovery of additional huge deposits of zinc and other minerals in southern Laos, while a French oil exploration company is considering the commercial viability of tapping the country's petroleum resources. "Speaking about the advantage of Laos' geographic location, Somnouk Khaiy-gnavong, deputy secretary general of the Lao National Trade and Industries Council and former director general of Laos' National Economic and Social Development Planning Department, said Laos shares common borders with five countries namely Thailand, China, Burma, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Therefore, it can serve well as a trade center for this region." Laos' first four-year economic development, covering the period from 1981 to 1985 was designed to heal the wounds of war. The second economic development plan, 1986 to 1990, concentrated on promoting the free trade system and establishing a strong currency. The year 1989 saw bright economic prospects as a result of the influx of foreign investment. The current third development plan, according to Somphong Mongkhonvilai, emphasizes the endeavors to tap and fully exploit the country's natural resources and bring about self-sufficiency to Laos. Under this development plan, 1991-1995, Laos will find ways to attract more foreign investors and promote production of goods for domestic consumption to alleviate the country's dependence on imports. "The drafting of the fourth economic development plan (1996-2000) is complete. The blueprint is currently under scrutiny by the National Assembly. The major contents are likely to be left untouched. The plan must pass through the National Assembly before its promulgation." Somnouk Khai-gnavong, also a member of the committee in charge of drafting the development plan, revealed that "the fourth plan opens the door wider because the Lao Government's objective is to turn the country into the energy and free trade center of the region. The LPDR will use Singapore as a good example in doing trade." "Under this development plan, Laos will divide the country into five development zones. The northern region with Xieng Khwang Province as its center will emphasize animal husbandry. The central region including Vientiane Municipality will concentrate on tourism and industrial development. Khammouane Province will stress electricity production and processing industries while the two southern provinces -- Savannakhet and Champassak -- will pursue agricultural development and trade." Moreover, the economic development programs for the northern region comprising Bokeo, Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, Oudomsai, and Phong Saly are also designed to be compatible with the Northern Quadrangle Economic Development Scheme. Bokeo, Phong Saly, and Luang Namtha are classifed as trade zones, whereas Luang Prabang and Oudomsai will become a special zone for tourism and mining industry. Following the opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, Vientiane Municipality will be turned into a trade and investment center. A cultural and arts center inside the municipality will help promote tourism. A business area will be located in Tha Naleng near the bridge. The industrial zone will be in Saithani District along Road No. 13 from kilometer markers 18 to 27. The industrial area in the southern region will be located at Nakai in Khamouan Province because of its proximity to the seaport in Vietnam. Savannakhet Province will become the free port town, a transit point for the transportation of goods from Danang port to Thailand and vice versa. Savannakhet's trade system will be similar to those of other free port towns elsewhere. There will be tax-free shops, wholesalers, and retailers. Champassak Province, after the construction of Pakse Bridge, will be able to trade with both Thailand and Cambodia. In its attempts to review economic management, the LPDR has passed an economic law for the promotion and protection of foreign investment in the LPDR. However, common shortcomings observed by business people who went to explore investment opportunities in Laos are: 1. Laos has no laws for protecting the operation of financial institutes, insurance, and real estate businesses. The revenue of financial institutes in Laos comes from fees collected from loan transfers and related services. 2. Investors are left to face inconveniences caused by bureaucratic red tape, bribery, and a sluggish attitude among officials concerned. 3. The country lacks a quality work force and has no business administration schools to produce qualified graduates. 4. Public facilities such as roads, electricity, and running tap water are insufficient. 5. The government is unable to control the unrealistically high cost of living. The cost of living is incompatible with the people's income and may later become a major problem in the country. "The present LPDR might resemble Thailand 30 years ago. But in 2000, Laos might be able to compete with Brunei in terms of per capita income. But this depends on how well the Lao Government can build the country's economy. If everything proceeds as planned in the fourth economic plan, the realization of such a dream is not beyond the reach of the Lao Government.
