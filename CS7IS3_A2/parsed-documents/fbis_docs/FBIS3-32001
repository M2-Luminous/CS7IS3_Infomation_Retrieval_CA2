The demonstrators, who included some from the provinces, especially the Plaine Central, used as their authority the recent people's congress held at the initiative of notables in the north. They chanted slogans hostile to the parliamentarians and the international community, demanding the lifting of the embargo. Uniformed and armed police were inside the parliament [words indistinct]. Since the congress, Haitian deputies have rejected a petition demanding the installation of a ruling triumvirat and the dissolution of the parliament. Jean Luckenson reports: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Luckenson] On Thursday, 25 January at about noon, dozens of young men and women demonstrated in the streets leading from Rue des Miracles and Rue des Casernes to the Haitian parliament. They were protesting the embargo and the return of the president elected on 16 December, and demanding the dissolution of the parliament while calling on [national founder] Father Dessalines to return to help them. The demonstrators said they would block the country if their demands were not satisfied. [passage omitted] The demonstrators, parading before the front and rear gates of the parliament, carried a big Haitian flag and placards that expressed the demands of their home areas. We saw several pickups, filled with policemen, parked a few meters from the demonstrators to ensure their safety. Deputy Pierre Francois Vital, in reaction, supports the objectives of the demonstration and emphasizes the parliamentary dissolution demanded by the demonstrators. According to the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion], nothing has been accomplished in the chamber for three years. [Vital] As long as this chamber is there, nothing can be done in Haiti because whoever is at the palace as president or in the government of Haiti will always have problems with this chamber. In my opinion, unavoidably, regardless of whether one has worked well, whether or not one has some money saved up, I see that the parliamentarians must leave in order to give the country a break because they are like a band of children who are always joking. [passage omitted] [Luckenson] Deputy Denis Saint-Fort believes it is normal for the demonstrators to express their opinions. It is democracy, and there must be pressures for anything serious to be accomplished. As for dissolution of the chamber, the deputy has reservations; but regarding the [lifting of] the embargo, he agrees 100 percent because it is one of the biggest cancers gnawing our society. [passage omitted] I must tell you that a few minutes after the demonstration began, the members of the National Front for Change and Democracy Parliamentary Bloc hastened to run off, one after another. But there was an important safety device inside the parliament grounds. Several other deputies and senators, who arrived two hours later while the demonstrators were in front of the gate, got out of their cars with gun in hand to enter the parliament. [end recording]
