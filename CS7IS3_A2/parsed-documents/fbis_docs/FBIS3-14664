He stressed that France, which was still dealing with Chad and African countries with a colonialist mentality, has not given up its desires in the African continent. France's dealings with Chad have always been within this framework. It was France that conspired against the Frolinat revolution. It toppled the former president Felix Malloum, conspired against Goukouni Oueddei and overthrew him, and is now conspiring against President Idriss Deby because it does not want this brotherly country to ever enjoy stability so that France can continue serving its interests in dominating and colonializing Chad. The JANA African affairs editor said: We are confident that the Chadian people, who suffered from French colonialism's calamities and persistent conspiracies to hinder the establishment of stability and security in Chad, are well aware of what France is contriving against them and will not give colonialism the opportunity to come back to the region again.
