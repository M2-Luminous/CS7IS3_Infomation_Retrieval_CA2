Signed by his own hand, the prosecutor's letter tells the U.S. attorney general that unless the United States presents evidence, the war against drug trafficking will be lost; evidence is needed to condemn people in both countries; drug legalization is good provided it destroys the source of funds for drug traffickers; and consumer countries have no policies to halt consumption. These are four obvious truths, which nevertheless offend the U.S. attorney general. The prosecutor is condemned for the virtue of speaking the truth without beating around the bush, which gained him admiration in Colombia. Something similar has happened to the government. The prosecutor has implemented surrender-to-justice policies, but the government changed the rules to avoid a repetition of the La Catedral Jail mistakes, when Escobar confessed what he wanted to. Now the confession must be accurate, sincere, and truthful. At that time, Escobar purchased, built, and outfitted the prison to his needs; now imprisonment must be in high security jails and subject to special disciplinary regulations. The government wants to show the United States that it will not repeat past mistakes. The prosecutor only ensures law enforcement, as he has always done, to the admiration of the country.
