This is the decision made in a session of the executive committee of the association Free Trade Unions of Ukraine. The main demand of the All-Ukraine strike is the resignation of the Cabinet of Ministers and formation of a new government headed by Volodymyr Lanovyy, who is supposed to obtain all possible authority over the period prior to the elections and set about the conduct of economic reform. Resignation of the president is not yet a demand--in the opinion of the trade unions, "his task is not to interfere." Until such time as these demands are met, Ukraine will constitute an appendage and will remain not only without coal, but without means of transportation and communications with the outside world as well. The scope of losses from such a strike of indefinite duration would be difficult to predict. But we know for certain that the epicenter of the impending events will not be Donbass, but rather Kiev, where several large-scale enterprises will be the first to go on strike. Others will immediately follow--in all regions. In the opinion of Free Trade Unions, the "higher authorities" will better feel the impact of a strike begun in the capital than ordinary miners. Lenin Forge and other industrial "monsters" in the capital have already repeatedly declared their desire to take part. "Ukraine is reaching its boiling point"--noted Aleksandr Mril, leader of the Independent Trade Union of Miners. "Just one more small upheaval and the country will not survive to election time. If the trade unions do not today mount a strike, extremist forces will take advantage of the disarray of the masses--a situation fraught with the prospect of civil war." But right now, independent trade union forces are looking at a specific common enemy: "the existing authority, under which people cannot live normally." Meanwhile, even the obsolete Cabinet of Ministers has been granted a stay of execution of the trade union sentence and been given the opportunity to remain in their long-occupied seats, if they bring salaries into conformance with price increases in the course of a month and introduce a mechanism of anticipatory compensation. This is mentioned in the decree of the executive committee of Free Trade Unions which was distributed to the Supreme Council, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the president. However, the workers do not believe that that which has remained undone over two years can be realized over the course of one month. Therefore, they are using the time remaining prior to 18 January to coordinate strike activities. Talks have been held with Volodymyr Lanovyy as well, whose candidacy for the position of prime minister elicits no objection from the population majority, it has become clear, or from most parties and movements, which have long discussed the need for professional economic leadership of the country. As the current leader of the Center for Market Reforms stated, he "will agree to accept the responsibility entrusted, taking into account the adversity of the economic situation in the country," and will take the first steps on a state level towards extricating the country out of crisis and stabilizing the socioeconomic situation. In the opinion of the trade unions, this will prevent a "witch hunt" from taking place in Ukraine and will give the country a period of respite and the opportunity to survive until the elections. But here we recall information not as yet refuted by anyone: In the event of social conflicts in Ukraine, a state of emergency will be introduced and the elections will be postponed; a ban will be placed on political parties and movements, and other measures of a military nature will be enacted. A Ukraine-wide strike of indefinite duration more than constitutes suitable cause for a "state of emergency." "Social conflicts in January-February may be used by the 'higher authorities' as a pretext for introducing an illegitimate regime and government and prolonging the authority of the president. This will lead the country into a final impasse," V. Lanovyy believes. "The impending crisis has to yield positive results, for example--a revision of economic policy and the reactionary law on elections." But then, in the opinion of trade union leaders, the "higher authorities" will be able only to proclaim a state of emergency--they will not have the power to implement it. And if this does take place, people will just become further convinced of the lengths to which their present leaders will go. And in that case, the year 1994 in our country will be covered with the banner of strike.
