Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's recent visit to Pyongyang was successful in this respect. During meetings with him, DPRK President Kim Il-song made a series of important assurances. This is represented by Pyongyang's intention to let the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors continue their work in this country's nuclear facilities. The DPRK also proposed that its nuclear program be frozen during the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and that North-South top-level talks be held. The response by Washington and Seoul to this overture was affirmative. However, some politicians of Washington and Tokyo expressed a variety of other views. Time will prove which view is correct. However, what is clear today is a need not to hasten the implementation of sanctions. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who has well-informed sources, viewed that Pyongyang had no nuclear weapon. He also said that it would take three to seven years for it to do so. Moscow worries that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] may be broken down. It worries so because in case one signatory withdraws from this treaty, there may be a chain reaction. The Russian foreign minister said that many other countries had been waiting for their turns. Russia expressed its dissatisfaction at the United States, which had unilaterally and hastily distributed a draft resolution on sanctions in the UN Security Council. Such a resolution must include convening an international conference during which how to ensure a nuclear-free status on the Korean peninsula and ways to effectively ensure security in the North and South of Korea must be discussed. The writer says: Today, when new signs for easing tensions on the peninsula have appeared, is convening such a meeting more practical than imposing sanctions?
