Maria Cristina Arguello, Nicaraguan government ministry spokeswoman, told ACAN-EFE "everything is set, and the necessary conditions are given" for the disarmament. The government and the 3-80 Northern Front, led by Jose Angel Talavera, alias "El Chacal," signed a four-point agreement last week which establishes the mechanism that will be used to begin disarming the rebels and possibly end the conflict in northern Nicaragua. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta and delegates from the Army and verification and follow-up commissions met with rebel leaders on Tuesday in Quilali, on the Honduran border, to establish whether the agreements had been fulfilled. "It was a preparatory meeting to finalize the details of the first phase of the demobilization and disarmament process," which will take place in the village of Caulatu, Arguello explained. The second contingent of "recontras" (approximately 250 men) is scheduled to surrender its weapons on 16 March, and the remaining members of that unconventional force, including its general staff, will surrender on 8 April. According to military sources the 380 Northern Front, the foremost armed group, is formed by approximately 500 people, mostly former members of the "contra" who fought against the Sandinist government. Argentine Sergio Caramagna, general coordinator of the OAS International Commission of Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS), has said the 3-80 Northern Front's demobilization "will mark the beginning of the dismantling of armed violence" in Nicaragua. Nevertheless, in statements to ACAN-EFE the diplomat warned if broad social and economic programs are not implemented in the northern regions, there may be a resurgence of armed violence. "Broadly speaking, peace is coming of age" in Nicaragua, "but I believe the time has come to attack the root of the conflict," Caramagna stressed. He also expressed concern over two "recontra" leaders known as "Northiel" and "Charro" who did not sign the recent peace agreements signed by "Chacal" and the government. The Army has reiterated it will fight the groups that have not agreed to surrender their weapons, adding the groups led by "Northiel" and "Charro" are formed by approximately 100 men only. President Violeta Chamorro urged the people last week to forget the chapter of armed violence in Nicaragua, and she called for a reconciliation among the Nicaraguan people. The "recontra" problem emerged in Nicaragua after Chamorro took office almost four years ago. Thousands of the 22,000 former "contras" rearmed themselves because they were unhappy with the government, which, in their opinion, had failed to fulfill the agreements for their return to civilian life. Sandinist Legislator Carlos Gallo, president of the National Assembly Human Rights Commission, will attend the disarmament ceremonies of the first 100 "recontras" from the 3-80 Northern Front. Gallo said the Chamorro government "must now fulfill its pledge to present a new social and economic emergency program" for the rebels' definitive return to civilian life.
