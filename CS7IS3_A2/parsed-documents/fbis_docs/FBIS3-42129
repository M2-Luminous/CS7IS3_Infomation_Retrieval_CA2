It is an unpardonable grave military challenge to scheme to introduce Patriot missiles in South Korea at a time when DPRK-U.S. contacts have taken place and the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks are expected for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is self-evident that the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea will key up the tensions on the Korean peninsula and increase the danger of war. This scheme vividly shows the reckless attempt of the United States and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique to contain the DPRK militarily has gone beyond the danger line. The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is to "counter the threat of missile attack from North Korea." But this is no more than a crafty plea to justify their dangerous introduction of lethal weapons. The real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot missiles into South Korea under the pretext of "threat of missile attack" is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for "nuclear inspection" on the DPRK through pressure and threat. The projected deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea is motivated by the persistent anti-socialist, anti- DPRK campaign of the United States. Not content with the deployment of more than 1,000 nuclear weapons in South Korea, the traitor Kim Yong-sam allowed the introduction of Patriot missiles to kill fellow countrymen. By doing so, he revealed once again his true color as a heinous traitor, flunkeyist and "civilian" fascist outdistancing the preceding military fascist dictators. If the United States and its followers think they can subdue the DPRK with pressure and threat, it is a big mistake. That method may lead the situation to a hopeless phase, far from resolving the problem. The United States must look straight at the reality and act with discretion and drop at once the reckless plan of Patriot missile deployment in South Korea.
