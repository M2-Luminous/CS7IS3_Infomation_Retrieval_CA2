It will also put forward a proposal to the Bosnian Muslim side on conditions for the urgent cessation of all hostilities and elements for drawing up internal boundaries. As Minister Granic said, Croatia remains open to negotiations on the alliance between the two states, and hopes that progress will be reached in one of these fields. He also added that it is not realistic to expect a final agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina to be reached at meetings which are to be continued tomorrow. Speaking about the results of negotiations conducted today, the Croatian foreign minister stressed that what could be considered headway in talks with the Bosnian Muslim side was that they have finally put forward draft maps and that they have agreed to hold talks on the alliance between the Bosniak Muslim republic and the Croat Republic as well as talks on territorial settlement within the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We deem that this was important progress. However, we are not happy with the proposals, but it is finally clear what they consider contentious and what their proposals to the Croatian side are, Mate Granic said in his phone call.
