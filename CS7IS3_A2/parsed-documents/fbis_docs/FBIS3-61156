Kh. Zaveryukha, deputy chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation, by EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN correspondent N. Dudorov; place and date not given: "The Agrarian Reform in Russia"] [Text] Our agriculture has never been in such a dismal state. Why is the acreage sown and the livestock herd being reduced, and the productivity of fields and farms going down? How did it happen that plant-growing and especially animal husbandry have become unprofitable for our countryside? What is the explanation as to why not only collective, but also peasant (private) farms have found themselves in such a difficult economic situation, and some of them have gone bankrupt? Our correspondent posed these and other questions to A.Kh. Zaveryukha, deputy chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation. Aleksandr Kharlampievich Zaveryukha was born in 1940 in Novosergiyevskiy Rayon in Orenburg Oblast. His first job was that of a tractor driver. He graduated from the Orenburg Institute of Agriculture and is a candidate of economic science. He knows agricultural production inside out. Worked as a chief economist and a kolkhoz chairman. For many years held management positions in the Orenburg Oblast Party Committee and the agro-industrial committee. Was the head of the scientific-production association of the All-Russia Scientific Research Institute for Meat Cattle-Breeding. Was elected a people's deputy of the Russian Federation. He was appointed a deputy chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation in February of this year. [Dudorov] Aleksandr Kharlampiyevich, in your opinion, what should be the main principles of the state economic policy with respect to the APK [agro-industrial complex]? How are they being implemented in practice? [Zaveryukha] It is my firm conviction that the reform in the agro-industrial complex and its transition to the market must be based on fundamentally changing the totality of socioeconomic relations in this sector of production. Why is a market preferable to an administrative-distributive system? First and foremost because it gives the peasant an incentive constantly to strive to work more productively. He will show this concern about "his own" not only on an independent farm but also when participating on a voluntary basis in cooperative production. That rural residents will be joining in various entities is also beyond any doubt, because one person or even a large family cannot compete with a cooperative, where responsibilities are clearly assigned among its members. That is, it uses all the advantages of division of labor among producers joined together. Hard-working people will not tolerate among them a sluggard or a drunkard and will simply "squeeze" him out, like a foreign body. A question comes up: Why do we produce four or five times less output per rural worker as compared with a similar peasant or farmer in Europe--what is the problem? One of the main reasons for this situation, in my opinion, is the deviation from a normal correlation of prices for agricultural and industrial products for the countryside. This and other reasons have led to an impoverishment of the countryside; producing agricultural output has become unprofitable. The state has begun to support rural workers with money from time to time, but these were considerably lesser amounts than what was being withdrawn. That is why the sector has been deteriorating. As a result, the only sovkhozes and kolkhozes that have survived have been those managed by the most capable and energetic administrators, who were able to create highly profitable production through comprehensive mechanization, introduction of modern crop-growing and cattle-breeding techniques, and rational organization of production processes. However, it has come to the point that even they are in need of state support lately. Because even the 200-300-percent profit on grain production will be eaten up by inflation if it runs at 400 percent a year or more. Because agriculture is a seasonal sector; expenditures here run year round, while the output is produced once a year or at even greater intervals. Over this time much changes in the economy, and farms are left in the red. The proof of that is the current financial situation of grain producers, to whom Roskhlebproduct owes almost 1 trillion rubles [R] for the grain it has procured from them. One of the most important conditions of forming a market in grain and products of its processing is for the state to give up its monopoly on sales of bread and bakery products, granting the right to sell them at market prices and compensating in a variety of ways the low-income part of the population, thus providing protection from rising prices. The government has appraised the situation correctly and has issued to agriculture before the end of 1993 R1 trillion to pay its own debts; this step should contain somewhat the process of the impoverishment of the countryside. In order to stop this negative process, however, many times more infusion will be needed. [Dudorov] What is the role of the public sector and other economic forms in solving the food problem? [Zaveryukha] If we keep in mind the rather sad experience of the hasty decisions in the economic sphere, it will become clear that the current fundamental change of production relations in the countryside is something that will require not one and not five years. The recent fashionable slogan on paying the debt to the countryside simply did not work out because the government did not have the necessary means. And the result of a complete disintegration of the system of payments was that agriculture began literally to visibly collapse. The first victims were weak kolkhozes and sovkhozes, which after their reorganization either merged with enterprises that were better off financially or separated into private farms. Betting on them, however--as many demand that we do--may pay off no earlier than in five to 10 years, since most kolkhoz members are not capable of engaging in independent production and are not knowledgeable about things that a farmer should know. Neither can we dismiss the fact that new farms now--the same as collective farms--are experiencing extreme economic hardship. To set things up, a farmer now needs to spend many millions, while the government is unable to allocate these means. Therefore, the public sector practically retains a dominant role in agriculture. And collective farms, too--including kolkhozes and sovkhozes reorganized into different forms--need reliable protection from dishonest partners, both domestic (in terms of payment for products) and foreign. [Dudorov] The land reform is currently being implemented on a broad scale in Russia. What do you personally think of the introduction of private ownership in land? [Zaveryukha] The president of the Russian Federation's edict "On Regulating Land Relations and Development of Economic Reform in Russia" has caused a range of reactions in the countryside. It is revolutionary in substance, and many people have not yet appraised its subsequent effect on the entire process of transition to a market. Its opponents are concerned over point 4 regarding private ownership in land; they maintain that people with money obtained in a dishonest manner will begin buying it up for speculative purposes or in order to create large land holdings. Their concerns are not groundless; at the same time, however, the edict has only set the general direction, while the mechanism is being detailed in a package of legislative acts on the land reform, which is to be prepared by the government, after which these documents are to be adopted by the future Federal Assembly. The same kind of acts are being prepared with respect to economic activities on the purchased land. In the event that it is used not in accordance with the intended purpose, first the owner will be fined, and then the land may be confiscated. Documents are currently being developed on procedures of land plot buyouts, mortgages, taxation, and other operations involving land, as well as using agricultural land as a collateral. [Dudorov] To what extent does the current infrastructure meet the needs of the APK market? [Zaveryukha] The infrastructure needed to begin market relations in this economic sector is already in place. Its weakest link is the lack of a sufficient number of specialists who have knowledge of the methods of managing an enterprise in the new environment and the basics of marketing. Another difficulty is that many APK sectors are overly monopolized. Take for instance the aforementioned Roskhlebproduct corporation. We need to demonopolize such entities. Private sector organizations also intensively build a market infrastructure. For instance, exchanges began to specialize in individual commodities, moving away from universality, and join into associations and unions. For instance, in the APK sphere there is an association of exchanges that already has been functioning for two years; it has prepared a program for the development of a market of grain futures in Russia. I think that the state should support such a constructive approach and influence grain price regulation in a certain way through commodity and financial interventions. Creating a market infrastructure on the existing basis is more promising, since reconstruction and modernization of it will cost less than starting from scratch. I recommend that all businessmen who wish to work with the APK in this direction contact the Agro-Industrial Chamber for Reconstruction and Development of the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, whose task is to coordinate the actions of all forces, regardless of form of ownership, in the direction of program implementation. [Dudorov] What should be the economic relations in the future, and what should be the infrastructure of the APK market? [Zaveryukha] Having studied the experience of market operations in the agrarian sector of the economy of many countries in the world, we found out that the system that is most suitable for Russia is the one used in the European Union, which regulates the agrarian market through state institutions. Their influence on the domestic agrarian market is exerted in the form of direct commodity or financial intervention. We, too, should find optimal transitional market mechanisms, which would allow the market to take off without leveling to the ground already functioning structures, to offer them better economic conditions. They should be as follows: --selling agricultural products at market prices; --price regulation should not interfere with the market nature of relations; --state procurement prices (fixed) must be set after taking exchange mechanisms into account; --the state builds up a reserve supply of agricultural products and foodstuffs in order to conduct a commodity intervention in the event of sharp increases in product prices. It is also proposed to conduct state regulation in the market environment through a system of collaterals, which includes accepting the product as a collateral for a certain period of time with payment at guaranteed prices, and also works through preferential credits for commodity producers in certain sectors by compensating part of the expenditures on the production of grain products, and so on. We also need to think about creating such financial institutions as mortgage and land banks, payment and clearing institutions, trust companies, and leasing firms. Their development is held back only by the lack of a legislative and normative base. We need to create organizational-economic forms for certain APK sectors. This approach is built into state programs "Soybean," "Grain," "Oil," and others. One of the possibilities in this direction is organizing industrial-financial holding companies with the participation of state institutions and ministries. But this is a separate large topic. [Dudorov] How do you see the role of the mass media in the successful conduct of the agrarian reform, raising the level of the population's knowledge and literacy in matters of a market economy? [Zaveryukha] The role of the press and other mass media in covering the APK problems is enormous. Unfortunately, quite often the press, radio, and television are not objective in their appraisal of a score of processes taking place in the countryside. Some authors maintain that we need to speed up the liquidation of large collective farms and create instead 5 million peasant (private) farms, which will immediately feed the country. Others, on the contrary, proclaim a lack of future for the latter, since they allegedly are less efficient than large enterprises. Such a diametrically opposite approach is groundless and only harms the reform in the APK. Sometimes we also see an incorrect appraisal of the current situation in the countryside. The mass media must reflect the real picture in the agrarian sector, cover the experience accumulated in the regions and on farms, reveal shortcomings, and publish the professional advice of specialists and scientists on different aspects of the economics of the national agro-industrial complex. I believe that the EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN newspaper, which, in my opinion, comprehensibly and quite objectively covers the course of economic reform in our country, could be of substantial help to the Russian agro-industrial complex in overcoming the difficulties that it is currently experiencing. And I think that top managers of the APK, farms, enterprises, and organizations, as well as new commercial structures, will gladly share on the pages of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN their experiences, providing tips on the best approaches to the solution of some or other problems. Both sides will benefit. [Box, p 24] In the Mirror of Statistics Reregistration of kolkhozes and sovkhozes is practically complete. It has been implemented at 24,000 farms (93 percent). The collectives of 8,100 farms made a decision to retain the existing status of their enterprise. Joint-stock companies and partnerships of various kinds have become the prevalent form of economic activity in the countryside. As of 1 October 1993, there were 11,300 such entities. According to the data of the State Committee on Statistics, as of 1 November of this year there were 268,000 private farms operating in Russia, covering a total area of 11.2 million hectares (42 hectares per farm, on average). Over the past few months, the process of their creation has slowed down perceptibly. Over January-October, more than 9,000 farms ceased operations because of increased difficulties with material and technical supply, the worsened financial situation, and other reasons. It should be noted particularly that the people's interest in having their own personal auxiliary plots has increased. The 18 million personal auxiliary plots, as well as those belonging to enterprises, organizations, and institutions, which are currently in operation in Russia, now produce 30 percent of the gross agricultural product. Over the period under review, the herd of livestock and poultry on these farms has increased by 5-12 percent. As compared to 1991, in 1992 agricultural output fell by 9 percent, while the national gross domestic product declined by 20 percent. It is expected that the gross agricultural product will decline by 5 percent in 1993. The total yield of grain after processing is expected to be 100-102 million tonnes (over the past two years the average yield was 92 million tonnes). There has been more sugar beet produced (by 23.4 million tonnes) than in 1992. Production of sunflower seed, potatoes, and vegetables--counting the production of these crops on personal auxiliary plots, is expected to remain at the 1992 level (2.3 million, 38 million, and 10 million tonnes, respectively). A certain trend toward stabilization may be seen in animal husbandry. Beginning with the second quarter of this year, the rate of decline in the production of most varieties of farm products has gone down. However, because of a continuous drop in the number of livestock and poultry over 10 months as a whole, selling livestock for slaughter has declined on farms by 14 percent; the gross yield of milk has declined by 4 percent, and production of eggs by 7 percent. The herd of livestock kept on the population's personal plots continues to increase. This only partially compensates, however, for the perceptible decline in the size of the herd at agricultural enterprises. The share of horned cattle in the hands of the population has increased from 23 percent to 26 percent; of cows--from 30 percent to 34 percent; pigs--from 29 percent to 33 percent; and of goats and sheep--from 32 percent to 38 percent.
