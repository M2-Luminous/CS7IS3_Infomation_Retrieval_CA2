The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat and the robbery and murder of 32 victims. Of the dead, 24 were tourists from Taiwan. Wang, chairman of the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that the incident should not be used by a few people with ulterior motives as an excuse to oppose the mainland, halt exchanges across the Taiwan Straits and advocate Taiwan "independence". "Both sides of the Taiwan Straits should view, with a good sense and in a calm and objective manner, the incident and various questions arising in the course of handling the incident, as well as draw a lesson from it," he said. He promised that the mainland will continue to tighten security administration in an effort to ensure the security of Taiwan compatriots in their visits to the mainland. Wang, who is inspecting Zhejiang Province, said that the incident was an unexpected, unfortunate tragedy in the course of expanding across-straits exchanges and economic cooperation. He expressed the hope that ARATS and its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation, will try to increase contacts and dialogue at high level, eliminate misunderstandings, resolve differences and promote cooperation.
