The minister informed the Angolan ambassador that the Zairian Government strongly protests the subversive statements; statements in contempt of the nation's unity and integrity made on Angolan soil by some Zairians in their quest for fame. The Zairian Government regrets that the Angolan authorities have to date not disapproved of these statements which are liable to disturb the fraternal and neighborly relations between the two countries. The Zairian Government, therefore, calls on the Angolan Government to take all the necessary measures to discourage all those who may try to use its territory as a springboard for acts of destabilization against Zaire. The Zairian Government wishes to reassure the public that it has taken all the necessary steps to protect its territory and, if need be, it will exercise its right to prosecute.
