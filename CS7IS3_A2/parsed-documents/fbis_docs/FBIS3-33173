The article is based on the research that Nicanor Leon Cotayo has been carrying out for 15 years on the isolationist policy Washington conducts against Cuba. Leon Cotayo discusses several issues in collaboration with the Public Health Ministry, particularly the finance office. The article is especially significant now that the UN Human Rights Commission is meeting in Geneva. Because of the blockade, in one year of this five-year period, Cuba paid an additional $45 million in health costs. Cuba could have bought 180 million liters of milk with that money. Nicanor Leon Cotayo points out that this effect of the blockade is reflected simultaneously in the increase in the foreign debt and a greater outlay of hard currency for excessive transportation costs -- in most cases air transportation -- in order to ensure the swift delivery of highly critical products. Despite these difficulties, the article adds, Cuba has preserved its accomplishments in this sphere regardless of Washington's systematic efforts to damage our health care system.
