FR940516-2-00114 FR940516-2-00077 Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Sunstates Corporation, Common Stock, $0.331/3 Par Value; $3.75 Cumulative Preferred Stock, $25 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;5300 May 10, 1994. Sunstates Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the following: According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved a resolution on January 20, 1994, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock and Preferred Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock and Preferred Stock on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market Systems (``NASDAQ/NMS''). The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system of competing market makers will result in increased visibility and sponsorship for its Common Stock and $3.75 Cumulative Preferred Stock than is presently the case with the single specialist on the Amex. The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the Company's shareholders a broader market, greater liquidity and less volatility in quoted prices per share than is presently available on the Amex. The Company believes that the firms making a market in the Company's Common Stock and $3.75 Cumulative Preferred Stock on the NASDAQ/NMS system will also be inclined to issue research reports concerning the Company, thereby increasing the number of firms providing research and advisory reports. Any interested person may, on or before June 1, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue and order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
