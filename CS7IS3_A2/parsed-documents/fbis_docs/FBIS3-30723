[Begin Izetbegovic recording] I believe that this is a request to prepare for such an action, to authorize the command of NATO's Sector South to carry out the attacks, but -- and this is important -- at the UN request. This means that Butrus-Ghali will have to order it once again. This is typical of Butrus-Ghali's manner. But, I hear that this is obviously being seriously discussed. It is becoming a serious issue. As you know, we held talks with [UN envoy] Akashi yesterday. He then held talks with the Serb side. We demanded -- to avoid the air attacks but achieve the goal at the same time -- that the Serbs, of their own free will, withdraw their artillery and place it under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control. This was our latest demand. They issued some counterproposal or other -- for the artillery to be just monitored -- that we obviously rejected. We increased the pressure today by sending another letter to the [European] Twelve, who have just begun a session, and to the NATO secretary general -- they are holding a session tomorrow. Something seems to be moving in the European Union. I heard that the European Union has made a decision to break the siege of the city, if necessary with the use of force. So, obviously, things are moving in some direction. There is at least a 50-50 chance that NATO attacks against those positions will materialize. I believe that the Serbs will take the risk. They will try to test Europe, to see if it will do it or not, for their experience with Europe so far has shown that Europe is indecisive. I think they will play that card. I would not say that they will withdraw of their own [free] will. Something has changed, but we have paid for it. The price was those 70 lives and 200 wounded, for people to realize that such absurdity and evil cannot be tolerated any more. Or they understood that this is not only the question of Bosnia- Herzegovina, that this is -- as our esteemed visitor from Pakistan [Benazir Bhutto] said -- that this is a moral issue, which concerns every man. Can crime be tolerated and is it not encouragement for crime and fascism, opening the doors wide for them in the world? You see, there are some new, sad phenomena in Russia, which really pose a threat to the world, to the survival of the world. If we look back perhaps we could trace it to the lax attitude and tolerance in Europe toward an evil that appeared in the Balkans some four or five years ago. [end recording]
