The law, which has already been passed by the Bundestag, sets out the arrangements for the move of the Bundestag and government to Berlin. Under the arrangements, the German Government is to move to Berlin "in temporal coordination with the Bundestag." At the same time, a "fair division of labor" between Berlin and Bonn will be laid down by means of the allocation of federal ministries to the two cities. Several federal bodies are to move their headquarters to Bonn. The region will also receive financial compensation. The costs of the move are put at around 20 billion German marks.
