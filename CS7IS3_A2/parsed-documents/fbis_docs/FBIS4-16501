It is expected that the president, who will be elected on 23 June or a bit later by a popular vote, will become head of the state and the executive power. Paradoxically, however, the new Constitution left the soviets that -- at least in the hinterland -- will continue to hold sway, as they did in the past. As no presidential structures are envisioned so far for the country's regions, it would take a lot of optimism to expect that the introduction of the presidency will bring only good things to our people. The example of Russia, showing what confrontation between Executive and Legislative Branches can lead to, is only too vivid, but you do not even have to go as far as Russia! In other former Soviet republics that introduced presidential rule, changing the government system is conducted with great difficulties. What is it that Belarus expects? With the most probable presidential candidates already known, this can be predicted even today. Knowing those candidates and the forces standing behind them, one can predict with a great dose of probability to what the victory of any of them will lead. In an article "About `Bison,' `Mice,' and Gorbachev's Shadow," published in NARODNAYA GAZETA of 22 February, 1994, I spoke out on why the majority in the Supreme Soviet chose this particular time to introduce the presidency in the Republic, and why the Belarusian Popular Front opposition, the free trade unions, and the striking committees attempted to stage a nationwide political strike in February of this year. As we know, the attempt fizzled out, but the Republic's leadership, supported by the legislative majority, did reach its goals. The scenario that I predicted before has already started to unfold -- in what might prove a very risky undertaking, the party of power is now attempting to strengthen its power. It needs its own president. Its main candidate is Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. In the words of certain parliamentary deputies, a collection of deputies' signatures in his favor has already gotten under way. In addition, we received phone calls from several places and learned that the callers were intensively instructed to set up initiating groups to support Vyacheslav Kebich as the candidate for president. As a matter of fact, there will be nothing reprehensible about this if such groups emerge voluntarily, but it would be a different thing if they are forged by directives, forcing officials, whose fate is now in the hands of the Cabinet of Ministers and rayon and oblast executive councils, to enter them. That would be the case of blatant pressuring and an attempt to influence the citizens' free choice. However, there is no need to repeat all this right now, because our state has always exerted pressure on its citizens; and it would be naive to think that this will change during the first presidential election in independent Belarus. Of course, all opponents of Kebich are perfectly aware of this fact, and are bracing up for heavy fighting. It was not by accident that the legislative majority, pressing for the soonest possible election of the president, wished to break its promise to hold early elections to the Supreme Soviet in March 1994. The explanation is simple -- under control of the Cabinet of Ministers, they will elect their new president in June, and then, under control of the president, hold legislative elections. This would not violate the democratic procedures and will leave power in the hands of previous wielders. This will happen if Vyacheslav Kebich emerges as a victor in the presidential elections. His present moves show where he is going to lead the Republic. I am not sure about all the Belarusian people, but this outcome is most desirable for the Cabinet of Ministers and the legislative majority. What if Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb joins the race for the presidential seat? Although this prospect cannot be ruled out, the question is how realistic is his victory? However, this would set a remarkable precedent when local executive bodies would have to make decisions on their own, instead of waiting for instructions from on high. In this case, the elections would be more democratic. Even if Hryb lost, he would forever go down in Belarusian history as a man who tried to remove pressure from the electorate. The future will show whether Mr. Hryb will decide to make this move. And what will happen if deputy Alyaksandr Lukashenka wins the elections? Although Mr. Lukashenka is a very complex figure, he is resolutely proceeding toward his goal. He is quite respected by Belarusian citizens, and... spurned both by leftist and rightist forces. Remember an amendment proposed by Vasiliy Chepik, member of the Popular Movement, saying that the president should be at least 45 years old, not 35? Alyaksandr Lukashenka is 39, and is open about his intention to fight for the presidential post. It is clear that the amendment was targeted at him in the first place. It was voted down, though. It was supported both by far left candidates and by deputies working in the Cabinet of Ministers. A paradox? Not at all. It is just that everyone fears Lukashenka's unpredictability; and state officials understand very well that once Lukashenka is elected, many of them will have a difficult life. However, Belarus will experience an even more uncertain situation if Stanislav Shushkevich, Gennadiy Karpenko, or Zyanon Paznyak will be elected president. All of them will find themselves in a bind if they win the election. First, the Constitution does not give the Belarusian president too many rights and powers. Second, a democratic Belarusian president will have an alienated parliament, not to mention the Cabinet of Ministers. You cannot fire everyone -- go and try to figure out which of the Cabinet of Ministers' employees is capable of working in new conditions! So, we might have a real but absolutely powerless president; or, there will be a confrontation between him and the parliament and local executive council leadership. Most important, in spite of the activation of the Belarusian Constitutional Court, these conflicts would be practically irresolvable, perpetuating anarchy and a lack of responsibility. This outcome was forecasted by the opposition deputies. This is why they had called for the reformation of local authorities -- the Soviet power is incompatible with the presidential one, but the [legislative] majority did not hear them. Obviously, it was confident that a puppet of the Cabinet of Ministers will become president, leaving no room for conflicts. Alas, life teaches us that even the most promising and easy plans sometimes fall through at the last moment, and then, disappointed, we curse ourselves for our own improvidence. But still, a reader might ask, if all of the possible outcomes of the presidential election are so bleak, for whom should I vote? I am not going to campaign for anyone here. I know that all Belarusian citizens want to live better, but what does it mean to live better? To live the kind of life we had a decade ago, having a guaranteed piece of bread and sausage, and thinking this was the best that could have happened to us? Or, to live as people do in civilized countries, experiencing true freedom and really enjoying life? We had been thinking about our socialist Motherland, cutting back on our salaries to buy furniture or a car, and hoping that our children will be happier. Those on top of the power had been thinking about themselves, working for big money, and vacationing all over the world. So, a better life can mean different things. We hope that most Belarusian citizens look ahead, into the future. If so, we need a president who would lead the Republic in this very direction. If he reflects opinions of most of the people, we should fear no confrontation with conservative forces. We will overcome everything if we want to. So, determine your positions, dear citizens!
