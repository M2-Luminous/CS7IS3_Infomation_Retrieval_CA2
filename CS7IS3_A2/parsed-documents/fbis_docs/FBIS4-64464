Originally, the privatization was to have been carried out on 1 May (as reported in the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE of 30 April). On Monday [2 May], however, representatives of Riva and functionaries from the IG Metall union held negotiations on the conditions in line with which the privatization would be carried out. There is still disagreement over the appointment of an eleventh, neutral member to the new supervisory board as well as over the way in which personnel would be reduced. So far, no information has been made available on the results of talks in Potsdam. The Eko Stahl AG cannot be turned into a limited liability company until a new supervisory board is named. This conversion is a condition for the sale to Riva. In January and March, the IG Metall union and Riva reached agreement on "personnel" and "participation in decisionmaking," and those points must now be given concrete form. Of the 3,300 Eko employees, 1,700 are to remain after 1996. According to the agreement with IG Metall, Riva is to provide financial support for a reduction in personnel. However, the two parties have not reached agreement on job guarantees, as Riva reportedly wants to include Eko subsidiaries. Concern boss Emilio Riva and Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party) met during the weekend. During their conversation, Riva is said to have complained about the "hostile atmosphere" at Eisenhuettenstadt, which has meant that problems connected with privatization there are much greater than in the case of the Hennigsdorf steel works. Rexrodt and the Trust Agency have repeatedly appealed to the parties involved not to endanger privatization, because that would place the future existence of Eisenhuettenstadt as a steelmaking center at risk. The Trust Agency has not called into question the sale to Riva, although the Italians have still not submitted the consolidated balance sheet for the concern that the Trust Agency has requested. That should in fact have been done by the end of April. Rexrodt said that a heavy responsibility lay with those on company boards -- the Eko board of directors and administrative board -- who are continuing to pursue their private or ideological hobbyhorses. Eko will neither find another investor nor will it receive further assistance from the EU. It is being said that the Trust Agency has in the meantime checked whether the Eko board of directors and supervisory board can be sacked. However, not only the industry's right to participate in decisionmaking, but personal contacts, too, are making it difficult for the Trust Agency to act. The chairman of the Eko supervisory board is Hamburg accountant Otto Gellert, who has never made a secret of his aversion to Riva and is also deputy chairman of the Trust Agency administrative board.
