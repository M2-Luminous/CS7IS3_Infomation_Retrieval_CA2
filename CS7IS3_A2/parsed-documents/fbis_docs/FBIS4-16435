The incident was eventually settled and the presidents of the two countries, Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, reached an agreement on Black Sea Fleet. The agreement evoked "interpretations which differed in principle", the Itogi host said. According to Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, the agreement reached is evidence that "Russia acknowledged that the Russian Federation and Ukraine are equal partners." Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin said in an interview that "up to date Ukraine owes the Black Sea Fleet more than 17 billion roubles", which is a clear sign that Ukraine is "trying to live on somebody else's account." Speaking about last week's events, the admiral said they reflect the intention "to cover up the present economic situation with political ambitions". The unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, the agreement on which was signed last week, has evoked mixed reaction in both countries, the Itogi host said. According to Yegor Gaydar, the leader of Russia's Choice, "this is a purely political decision, and the economy was sacrificed to politics". State Duma Deputy Sergey Glazyev said "the unification of the monetary systems must be followed by a transition to a customs union and further integration". Yabloko coalition Leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy said there can be no "clear-cut response to the agreement signed because its specifics are not known". Public opinion poll conducted on order from Itogi revealed that 36 per cent of those polled favoured the unification of the monetary systems of the two republics, while 41 per cent said it should not be done. "If the reached accord eventually strengthens inflation in Russia, the government will be in for much trouble," Itogi concluded. As concerns Belarus [Byelorussia], its former leader Stanislav Shushkevich, who has already joined the race for presidency in the republic, criticised the agreement, stressing that it makes no mention "of the Chernobyl catastrophe, which claims 15 per cent of all budget allocations in the republic every year". Itogi announced that the Commonwealth summit, which ended in Moscow, adopted a number of documents, mainly recommendations, which have no direct effect. According to Boris Yeltsin, who spoke at the closing press conference, "the CIS is not a rigid factory management". As concerns decisions in the military field, Itogi noted that "judging by all appearances, Russia will have to shoulder the main burden". "The bulk of the tasks has fallen to the share of Russia," Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said. Both Itogi and Voskresenye reported on the centenary of Nikita Khrushchev and stressed the contradictory and extraordinary character of his activity. A public opinion survey ordered by Itogi, revealed that 37 per cent of those polled recall Khrushchev's role in exposing the cult of the personality (37 per cent), the large-scale cultivation of maize (24 per cent), country-wide housing construction (24 per cent), as well as with the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite, the first manned flight into space, the development of the virgin lands and the Caribbean crisis. The second part of the programme was devoted to international affairs, and opened with a report on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's "strange" visit to Spain, which Itogi described as "a test of the Russian president's ability to run the state." "Everybody noted that the president was in good shape," the Itogi host stressed. Itogi highlighted the aggravation of the situation near Gorazde, where the NATO aviation shelled Serb targets. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in an exclusive interview with Itogi that the new initiative proposed by him in Yugoslavia calls for the unblocking of Gorazde and work towards an agreement on an end to military activities along the entire frontline. The minister, who was just back in Moscow from a trip to Serbia on President Yeltsin's instructions, said "the realisation of these measures will create a favourable situation for the resumption of the negotiations on the political settlement". Andrey Kozyrev also said that every step taken by the Serb side will be accompanied, for our part, "by a resolute raising of the question about the lifting of the sanctions". He stressed that "such a consistent progress is a must". "I think Russia has remained the only strong player on this arena, who has not marred its reputation with irresponsible actions," the minister said. He reported that Russia has been informed by the West about the latest developments around Gorazde. As a result of consultations, we succeeded in convincing them that one should not make haste this time around," Kozyrev said. "It is necessary to consult Russia, we must act in concert", Kozyrev stressed.
