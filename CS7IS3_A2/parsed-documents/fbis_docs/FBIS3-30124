The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications said a ministry advisory panel, the Postal Services Council, approved on Friday the first premium increase in 46 years for new postal insurance policies. The raise is necessitated by a fall in interest rates, which has cut the estimated yield on investments of insurance funds, ministry officials said. They said the premiums will be increased by 9.7 percent for ordinary postal insurance and by 17.3 percent for annuity insurance. Under the plan, the monthly premium payment for a 10-year savings-type endowment insurance, which pays 1 million yen for death or at maturity, will be hiked to 7,940 yen for a 40-year-old male, up 8.3 percent. The monthly payment for life annuity contracts, which start pension payments at age 60, will be raised to 34,722 yen for a 50- year-old female, up 37.6 percent. The estimated yield on investments of postal insurance funds in fiscal 1993, ending next March 31, has fallen to about 5 percent from 5.8 percent the previous year and is likely to drop to a range of 4 to 5 percent in fiscal 1994, the officials said.
