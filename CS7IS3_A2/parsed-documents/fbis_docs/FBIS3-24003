Kravchuk by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Valeriy Zholdak, in the office of the president of Ukraine on 9 December 1993; published under the rubric "UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Projects: Realistic Contenders for the Office of President of Ukraine, Elections to Which Have Been Scheduled for 26 June 1994": "`Ukraine Will Be Great and Strong.' UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Has a Conversation With President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk About the Most Burning Problems in Domestic and Foreign Policy of Ukraine, the Leading Cadres of the State, the Family, Rumors, and the Woes of the People"--for first two installments see Ukrainian National Affairs Section of Central Eurasia Daily Report of 28 Dec 93 p 30, 11 Jan 94 p 52, for parts III and IV see Ukraine Political Affairs Section of the FBIS Report: Central Eurasia of 3 Mar 94 pp 7-15] [Text] Will There Be Communism in a Separate Oblast? [Zholdak] ...So, who is tearing our state apart? [Kravchuk] Let us determine first what separatism is. Transcarpathia, the Crimea, and Odessa cannot be accused all together; I am against this. This is ignorance! Believe me, it is ignorance! [Zholdak] Why? [Kravchuk] When, let us say, a region wants to have the right to invest, wants to have more economic rights in order to use its internal reserves which are specific to this region, undertakes to pay taxes, and does not raise issues concerning a change in its status, this is not separatism. If the point at issue is taking advantage of economic opportunities, it is not separatism; this is normal. There are two paths to choose: Either the state assumes responsibility for everything and says: I will provide for you, I will help you, and you will work in peace; if the state is not able to do so, it says: You take advantage of your own opportunities yourselves, work, and provide everything necessary for yourselves; pay your taxes yourselves. Tell me please what kind of separatism is this anyway? [Zholdak] Is it not separatism if they refuse to execute the laws of Ukraine and your edicts? [Kravchuk] Who is refusing? [Zholdak] There are such people. We will be publishing items about this, in particular, an article by an adviser to the representative of the president, your representative in Odessa Oblast, one might say, your eyes and ears. [Kravchuk] However, you will find cases in which edicts of the president and laws of the Supreme Council are not complied with not only in Odessa Oblast but in all oblasts of Ukraine. This is a complicated time. [Zholdak] Correct. [Kravchuk] For your part, you wish to apply a certain formula of separatism to individual regions. [Zholdak] However, we cannot remain silent. The Crimea also started out with this until it came to the presidency, to being a state. [Kravchuk] This is not terrible, either. We interpret the presidency in the Crimea as a form of local executive power. [Zholdak] It is terrible. [Kravchuk] I am explaining to you that it is not. [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, pardon me, but is it a normal phenomenon to see that your representative and the head of an oblast council cannot find a common language--one pulls one way, and the other the other way. I mentioned this abnormality to Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch. He said that such dual power is a bad phenomenon. [Kravchuk] It is bad. [Zholdak] One person should lead and be personally responsible for everything. [Kravchuk] This is precisely what we set forth in the draft of the new Constitution. We know, and it is our mentality, that if, say, two angels are ensconced and each has his power, they will begin to fight after a while. [Zholdak] Correct. [Kravchuk] This is why for our mentality, for our society, the determining factor is for power to be held in the same hands. [Zholdak] So, what did you write in the draft Constitution? [Kravchuk] The head of power is elected by the people locally. That is it! One individual resolves all issues.... Well, not one individual personally.... Incidentally, the Supreme Council passed a law on this issue. [Zholdak] Correct, correct! Everything should come under this person; there will be order then, and there will be someone to be held accountable. [Kravchuk] Yes, and there will not be the tug-of-war that you mentioned. [Zholdak] Will this head of, say, the oblast be subordinated to the president or, once again, to the Supreme Council? The Supreme Council is a legislative organ; it should not be the leading and guiding force of society. [Kravchuk] This will now be a mechanism set forth in the law. The law will set forth everything: how the chairman is elected, what powers he has, and what obligations he has to the president, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Supreme Council. It cannot be that I say so and you do it. This is a dangerous thing: I have said so! If this word comes to your mind, and you begin saying once again: "I have said--ban it!", "I have said--do not go!", it will be no good. The entire state power should be built on the law. [Zholdak] This is clear. Leonid Makarovych, you "omitted" my previous question.... So, what do you think: Mr. Bodelan and other oblast leaders, former Communist figures, for example in Donetsk--are they acting properly in demanding that free economic zones be legalized? [Kravchuk] This is a normal phenomenon. Free economic zones should be "within the law." [Zholdak] Is this not urging by some kind of forces to secede within, and subsequently without? Such as, for example, the Hungarians urging Transcarpathia.... [Kravchuk] What is a free economic zone and its status? It is a so-called "point" zone, an administrative zone. All this already exists in the world, and nobody is scared of it. We have not suddenly chosen or discovered this.... [Zholdak] However, they also want their own borders and to establish their own customs. Do you understand? [Kravchuk] Listen, if it is a free economic zone, it has its own laws of life. [Zholdak] All these laws of "their own" should not counteract those of the state. [Kravchuk] Specifics are at work here. If, say, you cut through a free economic zone, you plug yourself into a different system of economic relations. You cannot go there with your own "statute." You should meet the conditions of the zone. For example, I have been to these zones in China, where the situation is similar. [Zholdak] Is each zone over there a "monastery" with its own statute? [Kravchuk] Yes. [Zholdak] So, is there one set of requirements when you enter one zone, and another one when you enter another? [Kravchuk] Of course. Other laws are in effect. [Zholdak] But is the state one? [Kravchuk] It is economic laws that are in effect, not political! The state does not mean the economy. The state means the system. Within the state there may be special situations in various regions. I am saying that this should not be feared. This Is Something Alien in Our State [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, do you know what people are now afraid of? Of the "democrats" who have run Ukraine into the ground. Who are such democrats at present? I mean democrats who are in power. You, Mr. President, one of the former leaders of the Communists of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Mr. Chairman of the Supreme Council--likewise a former member of the party nomenklatura. A majority of local leaders are from the glorious host of Lenin.... [Kravchuk] You know, we live in a world of cliches. Are there many people who are capable of governing in a new way? They tried, they thought it was easy, that devotion alone would suffice.... [Zholdak] I am telling you about real facts. [Kravchuk] I am also telling you about real facts. For example, they elected the Supreme Council. It immediately split into two groups--the democrats and the partocrats. Instead of proceeding to cooperate, they began to battle each other. Some condemned others, others abused the party, the leaders, and so on. What did it bring about? What did the People's Council begin with in the Supreme Council? They did not vote. Correct? How have they ended now? They will not vote again. Then Ihor Rafayilovych spoke and stated: "We refuse to vote." Four years have gone by. Now, Mr. Zayets speaks, and also states: "We refuse to vote." All of us have built our lives on struggle, on confrontation. I have proclaimed constantly: Do not look for enemies within the country. If you look for them, you will find them and embroil everybody, embroil Ukraine, and divide Ukraine into east and west, and there will be an eternal struggle. I say: Good people, find grounds for living here. The people are what they are, you will not change them. Yuriy Khotlubey, the chairman of the Mariupol City Council, a people's deputy from among the partocrats whom you have mentioned, introduced a proposal in the Supreme Council: Set us free, set the enterprises free, open the way to a market economy. People cannot be judged on the slogans they proclaim, but should be judged on what they do. [Zholdak] Correct. [Kravchuk] If you set us free, he said, we will make money and sell things ourselves. This is already a market economy. Look, life has brought this "partocrat" (in the parlance of the democrats) to a market economy. Every thinking man would understand that continuous political struggle will not take the country out of an economic crisis. Everybody proclaimed: We have severed relations with Russia. Now they are already stating at a congress of entrepreneurs: The process is underway, Russia abandoned Ukraine, pushed Kazakhstan out of the ruble zone, and is pushing others out because such is the situation. Russia cannot do otherwise. It is protecting its own interests. We should not take offense at it. We should unite in work rather than quarrel. Meanwhile, the democrats began by drawing cards and not voting, and have arrived at the same.... We do not have an opposition because normal opposition is always constructive. Our so-called opposition is geared toward destruction, rejection, and the denunciation of "anybody and anything." This opposition was born for struggle rather than for creation. [Zholdak] However, Leonid Makarovych, I did not bring to your attention the democrats who vote or fail to vote in the chamber of the Supreme Council. Who specifically rules the state, regions, oblasts, and rayons at present? Who rules locally? The former party leaders rule. They have become democrats. [Kravchuk] Who has ruled in certain oblasts, say, western oblasts? [Zholdak] Those were mere individuals. [Kravchuk] No. We had 3.5 million Communists here, in Ukraine. All positions--from team leader to the chairman of the Council of Ministers--were held by members of the CPSU. Do you really think that things would have moved had people filled leadership positions who did not have any skills in management work? And that had we promoted someone, say, from the People's Council in Donetsk, all these Communists, directors, and others with a certain psychological party charge would have reacted to him properly right away? This is an illusion. Experienced cadres and proper conditions are needed. People change, they gradually begin to understand the new conditions and their irreversibility. They should not be viewed as enemies. So, I take a newspaper and read it, and all kinds of labels are pinned in it.... [Zholdak] UKRAYINSKA HAZETA does not attach labels.... [Kravchuk] No, you do not have that. Although yours is a trenchant newspaper, it displays a culture of respectable relations with the readers and those who, as you wrote, lead us at present. Believe me, there are publications that one hates to pick up. [Zholdak] Do not pick them up. [Kravchuk] I do not. [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, to complete the "party" topic I would ask you, as a citizen of the new Ukrainian state and at the same time a former prominent party leader, to sincerely voice your personal thoughts about the Communist Party, its past and present, its credits and defeats, its crimes against the people (I feel, I am convinced that we are holding this conversion sincerely). I am not concerned with rank-and-file Communists. You would know better than anyone the strength and might of the Brezhnev and Shcherbytskyy-style party clutches in Ukraine. As you see it, what will be the future of what once was your party and mine? Many post-Communist countries have already condemned it, including Russia. What is your view of it? [Kravchuk] Indeed, I have lived not only in the party but also in the leading organs. I became firmly convinced that communist ideology and communist ideals do not have any prospects. This is my profound conviction, and I will not ever abandon it. However, as president I cannot ban the party on the basis of this conviction because this would not be democratic. A party can exist in any country, including the Communist Party. It is the right of the people to choose a party for themselves. The situation in our country is different. At present, the Communist Party wants to say that it is already completely new, since it proclaims some, shall we say, slightly different slogans or updates old slogans. If 18- or 20-year-olds came to this party and tried to create a party for Ukrainian statehood, so that they could come out in favor of an independent state, of Ukrainian culture and language, of their preservation, I would support this party, regardless of my position, although I would not join in. When people come along and say that this is a different party, and at the same time accuse us of having made a mistake in coming out for independence, and demand that the Union be restored again, this is not a Communist Party of Ukraine. It is something alien in our state. This party comes out against the statehood of its country. [Zholdak] Correct. [Kravchuk] This is why I am against this party and this ideology, but not generally against the party. [Zholdak] You see, Mr. President, the Ministry of Justice and its leader, Mr. Onopenko personally, have registered this party which had been retreaded in order to pull the wool over our eyes. [Kravchuk] The people there should be the guardians of the law. Incidentally, Hrushevskyy and Vynnychenko also had certain socialist views of society, but they talked about a Communist Party of Ukraine, of their state, a party that defends the interests of its people, and not at all a party that operates in Ukraine but whose center is located somewhere in another foreign country, and which does everything against its people and its state. You will understand that this is impermissible. [Zholdak] At present, two similar parties, the Communist and Socialist Parties, are uniting on this "revolutionary-Leninist platform." [Kravchuk] They probably have a lot in common here. This is why I am telling them: If you are different, be so kind as to show by deeds and not just words that you are for an independent state, that you are making an effort to build, that you are coming out against those who would destroy statehood, who come out against us. Prove this, and I will support you. [Zholdak] You know, Leonid Makarovych, I had a conversation with Stanislav Hurenko about what you are saying. I even wanted to interview him. We made arrangements, and I notified the readers about this through the newspaper. Later, he suddenly called me and said: "You know, I have reread the latest issues of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA and noticed that we have somewhat different positions." I said to this: So what if we have different positions, let us reflect on this, and the readers will draw conclusions for themselves as to which one is right. He refused, and it is a pity. Why did I want to talk to him? I liked one position of his. He had said before that he had prepared the organizational congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine in Donetsk after it was banned. However, he then refused to be elected as a member of the Central Committee, of the leading organs. Why? It turned out that he was against the desire of other leaders of the Central Committee for revanche. [Kravchuk] Oh! [Zholdak] The second point he made to me: A new party should be headed by new people, young people--what you have also said. [Kravchuk] Yes, the party will be new if new and younger people with other views and convictions come in. [Zholdak] Who is the "helmsman" of the party now? Petro Symonenko has grown from a Komsomol [All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League] boy to a secretary of the Central Committee of the Lenin Communist Youth League of Ukraine and secretary of the Donetsk Oblast Party Committee.... [Kravchuk] I do not want to.... [Zholdak] Let us not.... However, another newly elected secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, Oleksandr Kotsyuba.... [Kravchuk] I do not want to discuss or characterize any one of them. Time and the people will do this. [Zholdak] Do not say anything, Leonid Makarovych, I will say this. Third, for the party to again conquer the "mind" of all the masses it should be headed by authoritative individuals respected by the people. [Kravchuk] Not just authoritative individuals.... An authoritative person may have the old mentality and the old ideology. [Zholdak] Yes. [Kravchuk] Do you know how much life and...struggle I needed in order to tell you these words right now: I will never go back to the Communist Party? Meanwhile, anybody can say that without fearing for his life. [Zholdak] Indeed, it was very interesting and pleasant for me to hear these words from your lips, and we will publish this. [Kravchuk] These are my convictions. [Zholdak] I believe you. [Kravchuk] However, I will never take even a step in order to ban a Communist Party that will, I repeat, operate in the interests of an independent Ukraine, or to forbid any person to join that Communist Party. At the same time, I will fight to the end the communist ideology or the nationalist ideology that threatens our state. The Famine of 1933--Genocide of the Ukrainian Nation [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you often talk so persuasively that one believes you. Will you be able to convince me that you, the former leader of the ideological front of the Communist Party, did not know about the year 1933? On one occasion, you stated that you have only now learned from documents the true facts about the famine in Ukraine. I had not previously read the documents, either, but I conjectured and believed that this was the annihilation of our Ukraine by Stalin's communist clique. Did you really think otherwise? [Kravchuk] I made my assessment on the basis of the facts I knew. [Zholdak] But you did know! Say that you did. After all, you have stated that you did not. [Kravchuk] I have stated that I did not know the real scope. I said this because I had not seen the documents. [Zholdak] However, you knew about the fact itself, about this having been the annihilation of Ukraine, of the Ukrainian nation. They also exiled people from Latvia.... [Kravchuk] They exiled people from my village. Why go far? However, knowing individual facts and seeing the entire panorama are different things, different values for generalization. I studied them, and later these documents were published when the Communist Party was still in power.
