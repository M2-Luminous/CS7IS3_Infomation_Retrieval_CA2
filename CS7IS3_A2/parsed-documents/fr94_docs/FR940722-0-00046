FR940722-0-00046 FR940722-0-00013 j. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5), Prohibition of SOAP Assistance to Operations Not Subject to Payment of Reclamation Fees North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5) to read as follows: Proposed surface coal mining operation that will not be subject to payment of reclamation fees required by [SMCRA] are not eligible for the assistance to small operators provided by [NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37 (2) and (3)]. There are certain mining operations in the State of North Dakota that are considered coal mining operations under the State program and thus are regulated in the State pursuant to the North Dakota program, but which are not subject to the payment of reclamation fees pursuant to section 402 of SMCRA. For example, the North Dakota program encompasses operations extracting coal incidental to the extraction of other minerals where coal does not exceed 162/3 percent of the tonnage of minerals removed for purposes of commercial use or sale (incidental coal mining operation). See 57 FR 37702, 37703&hyph;37704, (August 20, 1992). In contrast, the Federal definition of the term ``surface coal mining operations'' at 701(28)(A) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 700.5 specifically excludes incidental coal mining operations. Similarly, North Dakota regulates leonardite operations under its coal regulatory program. In contrast, OSM has taken the position that leonardite is not ``coal'' as defined in 30 CFR 700.5, and thus leonardite operations are not subject to regulation or oversight by OSM under SMCRA. See December 14, 1982, letter from OSM to the North Dakota Public Service Commission (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;17). Section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA provides for SOAP assistance to a qualified ``coal surface mining operator.'' Accordingly, since incidental coal and leonardite operations are not considered ``surface coal mining operations'' under the Federal program, such operations would not be regulated by OSM pursuant to SMCRA and thus would not qualify for SOAP assistance under SMCRA. The operators who will be deemed ineligible for SOAP assistance under the North Dakota proposal would not qualify for such assistance under the Federal program. Accordingly, the Director finds that North Dakota's proposed statute at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5) is not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Director is approving it. 4. Coal Exploration For purposes of clarification, the Director notes that in North Dakota, jurisdiction over surface coal mining and reclamation operations, including the Small Operator Assistance Program, is with the North Dakota Public Service Commission. However, jurisdiction over coal exploration, of which the following proposed revisions and findings pertain to, is with the North Dakota Industrial Commission, through the office of the Geological Survey. Thus, the surface coal mining and reclamation operation and coal exploration components of the North Dakota permanent program are administered by separate agencies. a. NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6) and NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), Roads North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), which defines the term ``road,'' as used in the coal exploration portions of the North Dakota program, to read as follows: ``Road'' means a surface or right of way for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in coal exploration. A road consists of the entire area of the right of way, including the roadbed, shoulders, parking and side areas, approaches, structure, ditches, and surface. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 701.5 defines ``road,'' in part, as ``[a] surface right-of-way for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in surface coal mining and reclamation operations or coal exploration.'' In a letter dated November 12, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;14), OSM identified two concerns with North Dakota's proposed definition. First, OSM stated that North Dakota's use of the word ``or'' in the first sentence of its proposed definition of ``road'' appeared to serve no useful purpose. Read literally, the proposed definition states that ``[r]oad means a surface [for purposes of travel] *␣*␣* or a right-of-way for purposes of travel *␣*␣*'' (emphasis added). OSM requested in its November 12, 1993, letter that North Dakota either: (1) Correct what appeared to be an editorial error in a subsequent rulemaking; or (2) clarify how the definition of ``road'' would be interpreted and applied.
