The Ministry rejected a request from the United States for judicial cooperation, but it did block three Swiss bank accounts held by Ames. This decision raised certain hopes in Washington which, as it turned out, were largely unfounded. A report from SRI's [Swiss Radio International] Michel Walter, voiced by Peter Capella: [Passage omitted] Washington approached Switzerland in the course of its investigations because a part of the suspected $2.5 million in pay-offs to Ames was deposited by Moscow in Swiss bank accounts. The United States is applauding the freezing of the accounts in question, as well as the release of transaction details and confiscation of the deposited sums. However, Switzerland reiterated that its judicial cooperation treaty with the United States excludes all political matters, and notably espionage. Nonetheless, Switzerland did freeze the relevant accounts and at the time it appeared that Switzerland would help the Americans out after all. Some newspapers wondered whether the authorities were even prepared to give this judicial help because Ames used Switzerland for illicit money-laundering. But the Swiss Justice Ministry maintains this was simply wild speculation. It said the move to block Ames' bank account was initiated purely within the context of a Swiss inquiry, which wanted to establish whether or not Ames's activities had violated Switzerland's penal code on espionage. The Ministry says that issue is, however, quite separate from the American request for judicial cooperation, which was turned down less than two weeks ago.
