Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary for Defence Suwit Chantharapradit yesterday emphatically ruled out the likelihood of another coup, which he described as an idea "as extinct as dinosaurs". The article, entitled "Fear No Coup" and written under the pseudonym "Lt Col Tatthiam Yiamnakhon", argues that contrary to popular belief, the armed forces' hunger for power is not the main cause of most government takeovers. "The notion that coups were caused by over-ambitious soldiers is an unscientific explanation because military officers never covet the power to rule. All of them only want to defend the country against outside threat," the anonymous writer claims. "Rather the main cause of most coups were shortcomings on the part of the country's democratic system," he says. The writer says military men never initiated a coup but were asked by the government's opponents and disempowered groups, and members of the public. "Other warning signs were harsh criticism by the mass media and a show of frustration by academics," he says.
