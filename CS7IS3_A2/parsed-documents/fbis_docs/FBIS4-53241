Yi Chu-hyon, chairman of the Pyongyang municipal committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, said in his speech: "The South Korean workers are overdriven for 13-16 hours a day to earn far less than the minimum living cost. It is only too natural that they rose up in a struggle against the authorities' anti-popular predatory and wage curbing policies. "The South Korean rulers, however, let loose numerous riot police to disperse rallies and demonstrations by force and arrest workers, far from meeting their demand. Nothing has changed in the conditions of the South Korean workers after the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique came to power." Noting that the South Korean workers are the immediate victims of the puppet clique's "strategy for economic recovery" and war preparations, the speaker voiced full support and solidarity for their struggle against "the civilian" regime's anti-popular labour policy and for wage hike and the improvement of living conditions. "If the South Korean workers and people are to win political freedom and vital rights, they must oust the traitor Kim Yong-sam from power and intensify the struggle to check the new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys and get the U.S. Forces and nuclear weapons out of South Korea," he declared. Workers from different industrial establishments in the city also took floor at the meeting. They called on the South Korean workers to expand the struggle for their vital rights into an anti-kim Yong-sam struggle and continue it until their demand was met. Their speeches were frequently interrupted by slogans "Down with Kim Yong-sam the traitor to the nation!" "Full support to the South Korean workers' struggle for wage hike!" etc.
