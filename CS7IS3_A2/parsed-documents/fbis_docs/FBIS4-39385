The participants in the meeting discussed the implementation of the Supreme Soviet Presidium resolution on allocating 400 billion rubles in credit to the government by commercial banks. There are reasons to believe that the above-mentioned resolution was met by commercial banks without enthusiasm. Some bankers fear that the allocated money can be used for holding an election campaign by one of the candidates. Representatives of several banks expressed their willingness to allocate credits, but the total sum is very small -- less than 10 billion. It is expected that the rest of the banks will present their proposals regarding this issue on 8 June.
