FR940804-2-00041 FR940804-2-00018 CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION Petition Requesting Exemption From Child-Resistant Packaging Requirements for Iron-Containing Dietary Supplements AGENCY: Consumer Product Safety Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Douglas Ingoldsby of Nutritech, Inc., has petitioned the Commission for an exemption from the child-resistant packaging requirements for dietary supplements containing iron, 16 CFR 1700.14(a)(13). The exemption would be for unflavored, unsweetened powders. The petition contends that child-resistant packaging is not needed for this product because a child would gag before ingesting a toxic amount. The Commission solicits written comments concerning the petition from all interested parties. DATES: Comments on the petition should be received in the Office of the Secretary by October 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the petition should be mailed to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, telephone (301) 504&hyph;0800, or delivered to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, room 501, 4330 East-West Highway, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. Comments should be captioned ``Petition PP 94&hyph;1 for Exemption of Iron-Containing Supplement.'' Copies of the petition are available by writing or calling the Office of the Secretary. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sadye E. Dunn, Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207; telephone: (301) 504&hyph;0800 ext. 1502. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission has docketed correspondence from Douglas Ingoldsby of Nutritech, Inc., as a petition for an exemption from the child-resistant packaging requirement for certain dietary supplements containing iron that is codified at 16 CFR 1700(a)(13). That requirement applies to supplements containing ``an equivalent of 250 mg or more of elemental iron, from any source, in a single package in concentrations of 0.025 percent or more on a weight to volume basis for liquids and 0.05 percent or more on a weight-to-weight basis for nonliquids *␣*␣*.'' Mr. Ingoldsby requests that the Commission exempt ``an unsweetened, unflavored, bland multi-vitamin, mineral, amino acid powder that contains no colorings, flavoring agents, [or] sweeteners of any kind and is virtually unpalatable until mixed with juice.'' Petitioner contends that child-resistant requirements for this product are unnecessary because, until it is mixed with juice, it is so unpalatable that a child will gag before ingesting a toxic amount. The Commission solicits comment on the issues presented by the petition. Comments on the petition should be received in the Office of the Secretary by October 3, 1994. Interested parties may obtain a copy of the petition by writing or calling the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207; telephone (301) 504&hyph;0800. A copy of the petition is available for inspection from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, in the Commission's Public Reading Room, room 501, 4330 East-West Highway, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. Dated: July 29, 1994. Sadye E. Dunn, Secretary of the Commission. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18937 Filed 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6355&hyph;01&hyph;P
