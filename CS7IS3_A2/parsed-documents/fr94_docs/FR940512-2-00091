FR940512-2-00091 FR940512-2-00054 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Mine Safety and Health Administration Petitions for Modification The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 1. Little Rock Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;43&hyph;C] Little Rock Coal Company, RD # 2, Box 40, Hegins, Pennsylvania 17938 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1), (4) and (5) (weekly examination) to its Lykens Valley # 1 Vein Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08320) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous conditions, daily or weekly traveling of the intake air course significantly increases the fall potential. The petitioner proposes to examine the intake haulage slope and primary escapeway from the gunboat/slope car with an alternative air quality evaluation at the section's intake level, and to travel and thoroughly examine these areas for hazardous conditions once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 2. K & L Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;44&hyph;C] K & L Coal Company, RD # 1, Box 266, Shamokin, Pennsylvania 17872 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1200(i) (mine map) to its No. 1 Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;06649) located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to limit the mapping of mine workings above and below to those present within 100 feet of the vein being mined except when veins are interconnected to other veins beyond the 100 feet limit through rock tunnels. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 3. K & L Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;45&hyph;C] K & L Coal Company, RD # 1, Box 266, Shamokin, Pennsylvania 17872 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1100&hyph;2(a) (quantity and location of firefighting equipment) to its No. 1 Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;06649) located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use only portable fire extinguishers to replace existing requirements where rock dust, water cars, and other water storage are not practical. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 4.

No. 36&hyph;06649) located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to revise and supplement mine maps on an annual basis instead of the required 6 month interval and to update maps daily by hand notations. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 5. K & L Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;47&hyph;C] K & L Coal Company, RD # 1, Box 266, Shamokin, Pennsylvania 17872 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.360 (preshift examination) to its No. 1 Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;06649) located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to examine each seal for physical damage from the slope gunboat during the pre-shift examination after an air quantity reading is taken inby the intake portal and to test for the quantity and quality of air at the intake air split locations off the slope in the gangway portion of the working section. The petitioner proposes to physically examine the entire length of the slope once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 6. K & L Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;48&hyph;C] K & L Coal Company, RD # 1, Box 266, Shamokin, Pennsylvania 17872 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1), (4) and (5) (weekly examination) to its No. 1 Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;06649) located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous conditions, daily or weekly traveling of the intake air course significantly increases the fall potential. The petitioner proposes to examine the intake haulage slope and primary escapeway from the gunboat/slope car with an alternative air quality evaluation at the section's intake level, and to travel and thoroughly examine these areas for hazardous conditions once a month.

No. 1211&hyph;VA5&hyph;0005.05 by subsurface investigation and thermal monitoring instead of extinguishing the refuse pile fire. The petitioner states that application of the standard would result in a diminution of safety for the miners.

Consolidation Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;50&hyph;C] Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1)(weekly examination) to its Robinson Run No. 95 Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01318) located in Harrison County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions, the Shaft Circle air course located near the intersection of 94 block, Main North to Oakdale Shaft, cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish check points CP # 1, CP # 2, and CP # 3 to monitor the quantity of air ventilating the affected area; and to have a certified person test for methane and the quantity of air on a weekly basis and record the results in a record book kept on the surface and made available to all interested persons. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 9. Consolidation Coal Company
