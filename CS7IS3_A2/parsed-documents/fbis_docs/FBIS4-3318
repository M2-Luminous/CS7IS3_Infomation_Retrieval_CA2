Qian, holding talks with Cote d'Ivoire Foreign Minister Amara Essy here this morning, described the bilateral ties in the political, economic and trade, cultural and other fields as "developing smoothly". "This is embodied in the high-level exchanges between the two countries in the past two years and we are satisfied with it," Qian said. Cote d'Ivoire is a major country in West Africa and "we cherish our friendship with it," Qian said, adding that China speaks highly of Cote d'Ivoire's wishes to develop ties with China. The Chinese Government appreciates the peace, neutrality and non-alignment policy pursued by the Cote d'Ivoire Government, as well as its tenacious efforts to maintain unity and peace in Africa and its efforts for the setting up of a new world order. Qian noted that China and Cote d'Ivoire share common views on many important international issues, and support and cooperate with each other in world affairs. This is beneficial to both countries under the current complicated and volatile international situation. He reiterated that it constitutes a major part of China's foreign policy to develop its unity and cooperation with african countries. Qian said after the de-colonialization, Africa faces a major task of developing its economy. And only after raising people's living standards and satisfying their rights to survival and development could it have the means to pursue other things. Without sustained economic growth, it will be very difficult for the continent to develop democracy, Qian said. Qian voiced China's support for the efforts to strengthen unity and economic integration in africa. He also voiced its concern over the recent conflicts in some parts of the continent. Peace is the first important thing to these areas, Qian said. Essy said his country attaches importance to its ties with China and follows China's development with interest. He congratulated his host on the constant lifting of China's status on the international stage, and expressed appreciation of China upholding justice in world affairs and safeguarding the rights and interests of developing countries. The Cote d'Ivoire Government is grateful to China for its sincere aid and help, Essy said. He also reiterated the "one China" stance of his country. Essy and his party arrived here on Sunday [17 April] to begin a week-long goodwill visit to China as Qian's guests.
