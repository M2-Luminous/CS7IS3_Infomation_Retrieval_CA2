The first resolution expressed their support for the peace talks between the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF); the second recommended the establishment of a consultative mechanism between the peace panels and the Mindanao community. Present in the meeting held Friday afternoon were Defense Secretary Renato de Villa; Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan III; Presidential Assistant for Mindanao Paul Dominguez; Lieutenant. General Thelmo Cunanan, Southern Command commander; Governor Liningding Pangandaman of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao; Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte; and Representatives Maria Clara Lobregat (Laban [Party], Zamboanga) and Nur Jaafar (Lakas [Party], Tawi-tawi). The meeting assessed the peace and order situation in Mindanao in the wake of the bombings perpetrated by radical groups, the current peace talks between the government and the MNLF, and the progress of the East-Asian Growth Area. President Ramos told the meeting he was determined to reach a pact with MNLF rebels "in a just and honorable way without bloodshed." The president, however, stood pat on the government's position disallowing MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari from being escorted by 500 armed bodyguards when he entered Cotabato City for the signing of the cease fire agreement. The signing of the cease fire agreement scheduled 11 January was postponed due to the MNLF's demand to provide Misuari with armed escorts.
