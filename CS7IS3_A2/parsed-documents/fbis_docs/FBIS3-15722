It is important to build up on the positive impulse and try to reaffirm, rather that lose it, noted Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on summing up his almost two-hours long discussion today with the Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina Haris Silajdzic, who has arrived in Moscow. Russia's top diplomat described the talks as fruitful. This positive assessment was also shared by his Bosnian counterpart. Saying that there are now prerequisites for resolving the conflict, he added: This momentum should not be lost. We expect that the Russian Government will play a constructive role in continuing the talks on Bosnia, stated Silajdzic. Simultaneously, the prime minister spoke in favor of a more balanced Russian policy in some aspects of the Yugoslav crisis. We hope that the Russian battalion stationed around Sarajevo will play a positive role and make it possible to preserve the multi-ethnic nature of that city, he went on to say. On the agreement to establish a Croat-Muslim federation, which has been achieved, he said that this agreement excludes no one. Obviously, its implementation is impossible without the Serbs, he pointed out. We made it clear that our agreement will also be offered to the Serb side. It is quite possible at the same time that now it is not ready to accept it. In this scenario, we will develop a new version, but it will still be based on the main premise -- the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
