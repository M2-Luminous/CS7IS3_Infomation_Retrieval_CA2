The move, as the first of a series of planned expansions in China, is an integral part of UPS's strategy to boost its presence in China and the Asia-Pacific region. It follows the opening of UPS service to Vietnam on April 1 and the addition of a direct UPS flight between the U.S. and China's Taiwan Island in March. UPS, based in Atlanta, Georgia, first entered the China market in 1988 through a service partner agreement with Sinotrans, a China-based carrier also known as China National Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation. Since then, UPS has made significant inroads and is currently one of the leading international express carriers in the market, serving 57 cities in China. "With the rapid rise in economic activities in China, we see tremendous growth in demand for integrated express service, especially in the major export cities and manufacturing centers within the mainland," said Ed Schroeder, UPS senior vice president in charge of international operations. Schroeder said UPS has been closely monitoring the business and economic developments in China and sees great potential in the Chinese express distribution industry. "With our new offices strategically located in the key export cities of China, we can stay close to our customers and gauge local customer requirements and the market situation. This can also allow us to better tailor our services to meet the transportation needs in China," he said. UPS is a worldwide company serving more than 185 countries and territories. With revenues of 17.8 billion U.S. dollars and a volume of 2.9 billion packages and documents in 1993, UPS is the largest distribution company in the world.
