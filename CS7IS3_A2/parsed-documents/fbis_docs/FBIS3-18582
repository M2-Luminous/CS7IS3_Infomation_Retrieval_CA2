Diplomats said Norway was sticking firmly to its longstanding refusal to give EU fishing fleets, mainly Spanish, increased access to fish-rich Norwegian waters as part of its price for membership. Spain has been pushing for the right to take 14,000 tonnes of fish a year from Norwegian waters when Oslo enters the grouping -- less than one percent of the annual Norwegian catch. Norway's ministers of fisheries, Jan Henry T. Olsen, and of trade, Grete Knudsen, pursued talks on the issue here Sunday with several EU ministers including Theodoros Pangalos, chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers. Knudsen would say only that the two sides had been engaged in "positive dialogue." The talks are expected to continue through most of the week. Agreement must be reached by Thursday if Norway is to meet a target of January 1 to enter the European Union with the other three newcomers, which agreed on membership terms last Tuesday after a year of tough negotiations. The issue is crucially important for Norway, where preservation of fishing communities is an emotional political issue, and in Spain, which is trying to wring maximum benefit from bringing newcomers into the EU. "We want a satisfactory conclusion in fish and institutions," Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said in an interview with Spanish television on Sunday. His reference to "institutions" applies to a row over voting rights in the EU Council of Ministers -- its main decision-making body -- which is threatening to torpedo the enlargement negotiations for all four applicants. Britain and Spain are trying to freeze voting procedures so that entry of the newcomers does not tilt the balance of power from bigger to smaller EU countries and so that it is easier to block controversial decisions. Both countries have said they will not budge on the issue, which will be discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers here on Monday and Tuesday. Diplomats say the meeting might drag on through the week because, without a solution, the Union will be unable to complete the enlargement negotiations in time to submit the result to the European Parliament by Thursday. This would mean, in turn, that it would become almost impossible to complete ratification of the negotiations in time to admit the newcomers on January 1. A British official said: "There are two good card players at the table. The Spanish are very good and everyone knows the Norwegians are unbeatable.... I don't think the Norwegians know yet what they can get away with." The Norwegian negotiators say they must return home with a good result on fish, otherwise the Norwegian electorate might say "no" to membership of the EU in the mandatory pre-entry referendum. This happened before. Norway was set to join the European Economic Community, as it was then called, in 1972 along with Denmark, Britain and Ireland. But Norway voted "no" because it would not submit to fisheries policies from Brussels. Compromise might be easier this time because, with Finland and Sweden ready to join the Union, Norway would be isolated in Scandinavia if it said "no" again. But nobody is ready to predict the result of this week's talks.
