Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov: Russia Does Not Produce Chemical Weapons" -- first two paragraphs are introduction] [Text] Articles and speeches by private individuals are continuing to appear in the press and on television in which attempts are made to bring to the notice of Russia's population and the world public distorted information about Russia's compliance with the demands of international agreements in the sphere of banning chemical weapons and about the Defense Ministry's activity relating to questions of preparations to destroy these weapons. At the editorial office's request the chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff dots the "i's" in this matter. Kolesnikov: Production of chemical weapons in the former USSR was stopped in 1987 and has never been resumed, and their stocks have not been replenished or renewed. The stocks of chemical weapons in the Russian Federation Armed Forces do not exceed 40,000 tonnes by weight of toxins and are located on the Russian Federation's territory in seven specially equipped arsenals which make it possible to ensure their safe and reliable storage. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: Is it proposed to destroy the existing stocks? Kolesnikov: In accordance with a decision of the Russian Government, the Ministry of Defense is currently preparing the necessary grounds for a Russian chemical weapons destruction program. The Defense Ministry is also the state customer for work on creating ecologically safe technologies for destroying (recycling) chemical weapons. At the same time it uses in its work the principles of glasnost in choosing the necessary technologies and discusses together with the regions' representatives the sections of the draft program, the project documentation, and other substantiating documents which concern them. It actively promotes coverage in the mass media and in scientific publications of various aspects of the problem of the destruction of chemical weapons. The time for adopting "quiet" decisions is long gone. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: How is it proposed to implement this program which, without exaggeration, is unprecedented? Will the destruction of stocks of chemical weapons not affect people's health and the ecology? Kolesnikov: The destruction of chemical weapons will be carried out in the Russian Federation only at installations specially created for these purposes, and their location will be decided by a government commission. It has been formed in accordance with the Russian president's directive of 9 August 1993. The basic condition in preparing for destruction is to ensure the safety of the population and the environment. To these ends the Defense Ministry cooperates closely with oblast and republic inspection organs in monitoring the population's health and taking samples of objects in the environment. Such work has already been carried out in the region of Kambarka city in the Udmurt Republic and in Saratov Oblast's Krasnopartizanskiy Rayon (Gornyy settlement) and Volskiy Rayon (Shikany settlement). Top-class medical specialists, professionals in their own line, are involved in carrying it out. The results of the assessment of the state of health are reported to the regions where this work is carried out. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: Everything is clear, you might think. The Defense Ministry makes no secret of the large-scale measure that is being prepared and is ready to pass information to the interested persons. Nevertheless, fabricated articles which inflame the atmosphere in society are continuing to appear. How do you rate them? Kolesnikov: In this connection the Defense Ministry deems it necessary to declare that the use of information relating to military-chemical potential and to the Russian Federation's fulfillment of its pledges under international treaties in the sphere of banning chemical weapons must be based exclusively on official sources. The opinions of private individuals may not serve as a basis for assessing Russia's activity in the said sphere. The incompetence and unreliability of the sources of information are inflaming the situation in places where stocks of chemical weapons are stored and where the military units dealing with the problem of destroying chemical weapons are stationed, and they are helping to shape a distorted and false public understanding of the real state of affairs in respect of Russia's desire to eliminate chemical weapons stocks. All this can be regarded as blackmail for the purpose of vilifying Russia's methods of preparing to destroy chemical weapons and damaging our country's political authority. For everyone who makes such statements and for those who disseminate them among the public it is time to ponder the question: Whom does this benefit?
