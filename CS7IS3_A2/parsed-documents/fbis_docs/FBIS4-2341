Silva, who signed the historic China-Portugal Joint Declaration on the question of Macao during his first visit to China seven years ago, arrived here by air this morning on a week-long official visit to China at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Peng. The sources described Silva's visit as "a major event in the history of Sino-Portuguese relations." China and Portugal are far apart geographically, but friendship brings them closer. Since the two countries established diplomatic ties 15 years ago, contacts between the countries' high-ranking officials have been increasing noticeably. Foreign ministers of the two countries exchanged visits while Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Vice President Rong Yiren paid visits to Portugal on separate occasions. This has not only promoted mutual understanding, but also pushed forward bilateral ties in every field. With concerted efforts and friendly consultations, the question of Macao left behind by history is being properly settled. The two governments formally signed a joint declaration on the question of Macao on April 13, 1987 after four rounds of talks over nine months. The two sides confirmed that China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao from December 20, 1999. Since the Joint Declaration was signed, the two governments have conducted good cooperation with fruitful results. The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group has convened nineteen meetings at which the three major questions in the transitional period of Macao, namely the localization of public servants, law and official institution of the Chinese language, have been discussed in depth. The two foreign ministers reached a consensus in February 1991 that the Chinese and Portuguese languages share the same status in Macao and that Portuguese will also be an official language after 1999. In December of 1991, the Portuguese side finished legislative procedure on the above-mentioned issue. Progress has also been made in localization of public servants and laws. Both China and Portugal have taken a sincere and friendly cooperative attitude toward the question of Macao, which has given rise to a good environment for Macao's social stability, economic development and residents living and working in peace and contentment. Last year, the two countries successfully settled the issue of financing the Macao International Airport and the model for aviation agreement. Now the Macao International Airport, with a total investment of 7.3 billion patacas, is under construction. The principal part of the airport lounge and runway have been built. It is expected that the project will be completed in July next year. In addition, the second largest bridge in Macao has been erected and three advanced refuse burners with a total investment of 600 million patacas newly built in the region. The prime minister will take part in a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the bridge in Macao after his visit to China. Over the past few years, trade between the two countries has risen by a big margin. Statistics show that the volume of trade between the two countries last year amounted to 110 million U.S. dollars, a 64.4 percent increase over 1992, hitting an all-time high. In March this year, the two sides signed a contract on the joint investment of a winery with an annual output of 4,500 tons in north China's Hebei Province. Seventy percent of the wine will be exported. In addition, the two countries also signed agreements on economic, industrial and technical cooperation and on the protection of investment. In March last year, the Portuguese Minister of Trade and Tourism Fernando Faria de Oliveira headed a delegation composed of industrialists and businessmen to visit China. In September of that year, the mixed Committee for Economic Cooperation and Trade between the two countries held a meeting in Lisbon. Today the Portuguese prime minister has brought nearly 60 industrialists and businessmen, including leaders of nearly 40 major Portuguese enterprises, to China. During the visit, they will hold business talks with about 200 Chinese entrepreneurs, exploring new ways for further expansion of bilateral cooperation. All these demonstrate that Sino-Portuguese cooperation is advancing healthily. The Chinese people hope that Silva will make fresh contributions to the growth of bilateral ties established on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. They also feel that with the approaching of 1999, it is imperative to accelerate the pace for the early settlement of the three major issues concerning the transitional period of Macao so as to create good conditions for the stable transition and smooth transfer of power.
