[passage omitted] Light patrols were due to leave Cyangugu, the first camp set up by the French who arrived in Rwanda Thursday, bound northwards along Lake Kivu towards the town of Kibuye. The area is held by Rwandan government forces. No details were given as to the numbers of men involved in this operation nor whether it had begun. French troops based in the Zairean town of Goma, Operation Turquoise headquarters, are also due to cross the border Friday towards the town of Gisenyi, the sources said [passage omitted]. French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said later Friday that a centre would be set up next week in Goma to coordinate with non-government organisations which are assisting stricken Hutus and Tutsis. The centre would "inform the mission command about the whereabouts of the people under threat and on the kind of humanitarian requirements," said spokesman Richard Duque. France also planned to move relief supplies to the two staging areas set up by the French forces in Goma and Bukavu, he added. But representatives of French humanitarian organisations hesitated on Friday to join the French initiative, saying they were torn between their desire to help the local population and by the fear of being compromised by a military operation.
