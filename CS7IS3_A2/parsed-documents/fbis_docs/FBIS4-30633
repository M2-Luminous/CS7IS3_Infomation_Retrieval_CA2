Keating -- whose comments came as 21 people went on trial for protesting the ban -- said the press closures "appear to conflict or at least contrast with the openness which generally occurs in the Indonesian (?economy)." Keating said at a press conference after meeting Indonesian President Suharto that he had been asked to understand Jakarta's point of view. Suharto said it was "very important" to maintain "stability and national unity at this time of great economic growth and transformation, that these things were to be taken as given in the society," Keating said. "Journalists in question had put some of these things -- that's national unity and stability -- at risk," Keating quoted Suharto as saying. [passage omitted]
