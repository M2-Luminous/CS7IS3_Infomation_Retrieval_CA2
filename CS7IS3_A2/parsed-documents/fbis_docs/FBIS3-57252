Correspondence can be monitored and secretly copied, conversations can be bugged, and people can be followed. Operational activity relies on "cooperation with the population." Those who used to be called "informers" are now known as "secret assistants." Here too there was no getting away from the division between the rights of Latvian "citizens" and "noncitizens" (who comprise one-third of the population). Only "citizens" can collect information on other persons, facts, and cases -- in other words, become "secret assistants."
