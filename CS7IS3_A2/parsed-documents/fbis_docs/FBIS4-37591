Shells slammed into the Dar al-Amir suburb, which lies north of the city and just 10 kilometres (six miles) from the front, killing nine people and wounding 29, officials said. Three dead soldiers and seven wounded were taken to hospitals here from Abyan, where southern forces have been resisting a northern offensive for the past two days. Eight Katyusha rockets also hit the airport without causing damage on Wednesday as southern jets were taking off for raids on northern supply lines. Two surface-to-surface missiles were fired at Aden on Tuesday evening, but one was intercepted by anti-aircraft fire while another landed in the sea. President 'Ali Abdallah Salih's northern troops, and southern forces loyal to his rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid, have been locked in a civil war for almost two months.
