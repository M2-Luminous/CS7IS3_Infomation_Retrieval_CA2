The move was put to the vote and turned down by the overwhelming majority of the deputies. The attempt to topple the Chernomyrdin cabinet had been made hot on the heels of the debate in the lower chamber about the inadequate deliveries of food and petroleum products to Russia's northern regions this year. Baburin proceeded from the critical remarks made by the speakers who said the government was unjustifiably slow in organising the deliveries.
