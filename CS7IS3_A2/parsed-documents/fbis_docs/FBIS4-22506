Zhukovskaya; place and date not given: "Strike: What the Miners Want"] [Text] Aleksandr Sergeyev is the chairman of the Independent Trade Union of Miners of Russia, which was founded at the second congress of miners in 1991. He was born on 5 August 1960 in the city of Mezhdurechensk in Kemerovo Oblast. He graduated from the institute, worked in mines as a mine foreman and a mechanic. He has been in the workers movement and a member of the strike committee of the city since 1989. He was an organizer and member of practically all strikes. He is married and has two children. He rents an apartment in Moscow. [Zhukovskaya] Aleksandr Andreyevich, why are you striking? Do you want to hang the losses of your mines on us, the taxpayers? [Sergeyev] First, we are coming out against closing mines without job placement for the workers that are released. Further, we are trying to fight for a structural restructuring of industry and its entry into the market. The third item of our demands: To achieve the establishment of safe work conditions. It is not known to this day how the state subsidy is being used and, in general, the resources of enterprises, and what contracts and how many were concluded. Without verification and control, any subsidies will vanish, as in 1992--36 billion rubles [R] and last year--R1.5 trillion. When we tried to come to the administration of the enterprises with an inspection--we were not given access to documents, and we were assured that this was a commercial secret. On our insistence a comprehensive check was made at the Polysayevskaya mine in the city of Novokuznetsk, and we found outrageous facts of poor economic management and criminal proceedings were instituted against the directors. [Zhukovskaya] Thus, perhaps, instead of strikes, clarify relations with the administration in the localities, and then some of the problems will be resolved. [Sergeyev] Everything is not that simple. We have been trying to remove the directors of the Severnaya mine for one and a half years. And at the Central mine in Chelyabinsk, where an explosion occurred and people died, the director prospers, while saying: There is no money to pay wages. [Zhukovskaya] But how do they explain to the miners that there is no money? After all, everyone knows about the subsidies. [Sergeyev] They say that they have not arrived from the government yet. Only now, once again at our insistence, have the presidential structures started to get involved in verification of the transmission of state support. Along the chain of the Ministry of Finance, the Rosugol association... [Zhukovskaya] But the court? After all, you can dislodge the money through the court. [Sergeyev] What kind of court? In Norilsk, our organization brought a suit against the general director of the mine and metallurgical combine three times. But Judge Sokolovskaya denied our case, arguing that "the economic condition of the country does not permit observation of the law." [Zhukovskaya] Of course, strikes are an extreme step. What have they brought you? [Sergeyev] At our insistence, the government established an interdepartmental commission for resolution of socioeconomic problems of the coal-mining regions. We have pinned a lot of hope on this. It was headed at that time by Gaydar, but with his departure, it is now two months and the commission has not met even once--it seems no problems exist. What is more, attempts are being made now to change the situation concerning this commission. But, after all, it could conduct an analysis, and it could decide where and how much money is needed in the first instance, and in the second...
