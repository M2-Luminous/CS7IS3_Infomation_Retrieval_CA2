He stated emphatically: We should make every possible endeavor to steadily develop agriculture, successfully build vegetable-basket projects, and show more concern for people's livelihood. From 20 April to 25 April, Secretary Yan Haiwang and his entourage went deep into seven counties in southern Gansu to inspect town and township enterprises and vegetable production bases. They also visited some peasant households; inquired about the situation in the implementation of central policies, the building of vegetable-basket projects, and arrangements for people's livelihood; and helped local areas tackle economic problems. After being briefed on the situation in building vegetable-basket projects in these counties, Secretary Yan Haiwang noted that the supply and prices of vegetables now have become a pressing issue for urban residents. This is why vegetable-basket projects have a crucial bearing on the overall situation.

Secretary Yan Haiwang also called for making sound arrangements for people's livelihood and for solving the problem of sufficient food for poor peasant households in the province's mountainous and disaster areas, in batches and stages. He urged leaders at all levels across the province, and especially principal leaders, to attach great importance to and assume personal responsibility for work in this regard.
