Vice-Admiral Igor Khmelnov is now acting commander of the fleet. Observers say Admiral Gurinov's sacking is due to a sharp drop in the fleet's combat capability. At a recent press conference in Moscow, Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said the Pacific fleet ranks last in the Russian armed forces as regards its degree of battle capability and the command of the fleet needs reshuffling. Observers also point out that Admiral Gurinov was not personally involved in the clean-up operation after the May 14 blast at the fleet's ammunition dump in Nezhino. He was also notably absent from the welcoming ceremony for the Chinese warships which arrived for a visit to Vladivostok on Tuesday. According to official information, the admiral is feeling unwell.
