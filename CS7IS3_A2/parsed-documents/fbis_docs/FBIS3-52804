The Palestinian side will be headed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat. The Israeli delegation will be headed by Deputy Chief of Staff General Amnon Shahaq. The security committee and the drafting committee are scheduled to meet tomorrow. The civil committee concerned with the transfer of the self-rule powers will meet in Taba on Tuesday [11 January]. This round of talks is scheduled to continue until Friday and will resume next week on Sunday or Monday. Dr. Sha'th held a meeting this evening with the Palestinian delegation members, who arrived in Taba this afternoon, to prepare the working papers that will be submitted to the Israeli side. Dr. Sha'th stated that the negotiations will continue for three weeks until all the steps relevant to the transfer of power to the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho are prepared. He defined these steps as the issue of the crossings, the size of the Jericho area, and security along the sea and in the Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. He noted that the Israeli withdrawal is scheduled to be completed before 13 April. He pointed out that postponing Israeli withdrawal after this date will be considered a violation of the Declaration of Principles. Dr. Sha'th stressed that no agreement will be signed until after a timetable has been worked out to release the remaining Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails, noting that their number now ranges between 9,600 and 9,700. He noted that Israel's release of 101 Palestinian detainees recently is merely a gesture of good will. He said that the Taba talks will resume because the Israeli side gave up its claims of the existence of "a Cairo document" for the negotiations, noting that during the Cairo talks six working papers were submitted, but nothing in them has been settled.
