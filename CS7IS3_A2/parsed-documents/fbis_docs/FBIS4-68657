Russia Has Separated Itself from Integration Processes in the Central Asian Region"] [Text] Russian political scientists, diplomats, strategists, and publicists speak about Central Asia as "a zone of Russia's vital interests," about "Russia's foreign political priorities" in the region, etc. To look at the region's economic problems in depth, from at least two sides--both the Russian and the Central Asian--is the intention of this article. Viewpoint Economic interdependence and, correspondingly, the need for close economic cooperation are such obvious things that it is awkward even to recall them. Russia and Central Asia are parts of a unified national economic complex of the former USSR. This complex was formed as a system with elements that supplement one another. The region is largely the source of a number of raw material resources that are either completely lacking in Russia or exist in insufficient quantities. The extremely large copper-porphyry, pyrite and stratiform deposits of Central Asia and the Transcaucasus lay beyond the borders of Russia. The situation was no better with respect to a number of other mineral-raw material resources. Russia has insignificant reserves of copper, manganese, chromites, strontium ores, germanium, potassium salts, etc. It is also necessary to mention cotton here. Russia's main supplier of it was Central Asia (with Russia's demand for 1,175,700 tonnes, Uzbekistan alone provided 544,000 tonnes). This list could easily be continued. Not only Russia depends on deliveries from the post-Soviet "South"; Central Asian countries are interested in them as well. Coal from the Kazakhstan Ekibastuz is intended for heating and electric power plants operating on the territory of Russia. The Karaganda Metallurgical Combine delivers to Russia about 2 million tonnes of rolled metal a year. The problem of selling these and other products will inevitably arise if exports to Russia are excluded. The existing organizational forms of economic cooperation between Russia and states of the post-Soviet Central Asia are developing (true, without very good results) within the framework of the CIS: An Economic Union of CIS States has been created, a number of interstate organs have been instituted--Interstate Bank, Interstate Council on Questions of Industrial Policy, etc. Cooperation is developing at the level of enterprises and branches. There is also a future for such forms as economic interaction at the level of border oblasts (for example, Omsk Oblast of Russia and Pavlodar Oblast of Kazakhstan). But one gets the impression that the Central Asian states, while not destroying economic ties with Russia willfully, are trying to find an alternative to them, working within other organizational frameworks with states of the world South. Russia is jealous of this, but itself is exerting no active or positive resistance to it. In my view Russia should take a considerably more active part in the regional and interregional organizations in whose work the states of the post-Soviet Central Asia have already become involved. One of these organizations is the Organization of Caspian States (OPG, created in February 1992). Representatives of Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia participated in its creation. The degree of interest of the aforementioned states in this organization is shown also by the level of representation at the constituent assembly: The first three states were represented by the president, the fourth--by a deputy prime minister, and the fifth (Russia)--by the ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran. There is no need to enumerate the problems that could be resolved simply through joint efforts: raising the level of the Caspian, ecology, extraction of oil in the open sea, on the shelf, and along the coast, fishing, etc. Russia's passiveness could quite well be regarded as one of the reasons why nothing has come of the OPG so far and the aforementioned states are cooperating (if they are cooperating) in the aforementioned areas either on a bilateral or multilateral basis or within the framework of associations that do not include Russia. Another example is the Organization for Economic Cooperation (OES, sometimes designated as EKO), which initially (since 1984-1985) included Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, all the Central Asian states and also Azerbaijan joined the OES. Russia became a kind of initiator of maximum self-isolation from the OES. Moreover, the Central Asian states were given an ultimatum: either economic cooperation with Russia or participation in the OES. Not to mention the fact that the condition for Russian-Central Asian cooperation given above is insulting and unacceptable to the independent states of Central Asia, the question could have been posed differently. Why should Russia not join the OES? As far as I can judge, the OES regulations do not preclude that. In order to give a full picture it is necessary to mention the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone (ChZES) created in 1992, in which both Russia and a number of states interested in cooperation in the neighboring Central Asia region (Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia) participate. The coordination of this regional organization, to which Russia pays considerably more attention than to the one mentioned above, can be facilitated by untying several knots right in Central Asia. Integration processes in Central Asia itself is a topic unto itself. They began "reactively," they were forced--as a completely natural reaction to the creation of the CIS as a quasi-Slavic association. Subsequently this separation and intraregional consolidation were reinforced by plans for a Russian-Ukrainian-Belarusian economic alliance and zigzags in Russian policy regarding post-Soviet Central Asia. True, the integration processes are extremely weak. It is difficult to imagine Russia's participation in these processes. The plans to create new transportation communications (railroads and highways, pipelines, etc.) are a visible sign of future trends in economic cooperation. The building of communications routes tells us considerably more than serious agreements and widely announced declarations. One Central Asian leader noted: "Previously all roads to the East (from Europe--A.I.) passed through Moscow." Now the new states of the region are looking for different roads, which very frequently bypass Russia. The program of the Commission of European Communities (CEC), which is oriented toward the creation of a combined (rail, ferry, and sea) transportation corridor "Europe--Caucasus--Asia" is very attractive to the Central Asian states. The main route would bypass Russia--along the line of Almaty-Ashgabat-Turkmenbashi (formerly Krasnovodsk)-Baku-Poti/Batumi. Each Central Asian country is exerting a fair amount of effort to create its own transportation access to communications centers of world significance. Thus Kazakhstan, having established rail communications long the route of Almaty-Beijing, is intending to extend this route to the territories of Turkmenistan, Iran, and Turkey, in order to reach Western Europe. Turkmenistan is speeding up the construction of the railroad route of Tedzhen-Serakhs-Mashkhad, which will make it possible to link this Central Asian country to Tehran, Ankara, and West European capitals. Iranian territory with renewed communications in the interests of Turkmenistan will become for the latter a kind of bridge to the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. Through Kazakhstan, which is joined by railroad to China (Beijing), it is also possible to gain access to the Far East--the Asia-Pacific region (APR). Turkmenistan is also exerting efforts to create a gas line through Turkmenistan-Iran-Turkey-West Europe. Turkmenistan leaders also dream of laying a gas line to Southeast Asia, China, and Japan. Pakistan is prepared to open routes to the Indian Ocean for Central Asian states. Regional communications could be affected by the implementation of an agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan for the creation of a petroleum line, which will make it possible to transport Azerbaijani petroleum to a terminal on the Turkish coast of the Mediterranean Sea: Azerbaijan--Northern Iran--Nakhichevan--Turkey (Erzurum--the region of the Syrian-Turkish border--Yumurtalik). The plan for transporting oil through a pipeline from the oil region of Tengiz (western Kazakhstan) to Novorossiysk is promising and mutually advantageous for both Kazakhstan and Russia. But there are serious obstacles to the implementation of this plan, the main one being Turkish interests: In the first place, since 1990 (because of UN sanctions against Iraq, which was prohibited from trading in oil in the full volume) the petroleum terminal of Yumurtalik on the Mediterranean Sea and the petroleum pipeline leading up to it have been inactive and Turkey is trying to put them to work; second, Turkey (largely because of the preceding factor but also because of a real concern for the ecological situation in the densely populated regions) is trying to prohibit large tankers containing oil from passing through the Bosphorus. If these Turkish interests (or one of them) are honored, the significance of the petroleum terminal in Novorossiysk will drop sharply. And oil from Tengiz could go not to Novorossiysk but to Turkey, changing the aforementioned route somewhat: Tengiz-Azerbaijan-Northern Iran-Azerbaijan (Nakhichevan)-Turkey (Mediterranean Sea coast). As far as one can judge, in this case too it is necessary to observe Russian interests: On the one hand, the petroleum pipeline should not extend through the recreation zone or the productive agricultural land in the south of Russia; on the other hand, Russia itself could hook up to this petroleum pipeline for its own advantage. This kind of untangling of communications problems which is convenient both for Russia and for the Central Asian states in the newly formed geopolitical and economic space is possible, apparently, in other cases as well, say, with the utilization of mechanisms for regional and interregional economic cooperation. Thus Russia will undoubtedly be able to derive an advantage for itself from the existence of the transportation corridor "Europe-Caucasus-Asia." It could hook up to railroad lines through Chelyabinsk, and then the possibilities of the Transsiberian main line would also be taken advantage of. For many reasons the new Astrakhan-Kizlyar-Baku railroad line would not be superfluous either. Through the Caspian, Russia could join transportation flows along the Astrakhan-Baku route. One gets a sense of satisfaction that Russia is participating in the actions for coordinating the program (as an equal with the Transcaucasian and Central Asian states and also Iran, Turkey, China, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the states included in the CEC). There is a mutual interest in having Russia supply the armed forces of the Central Asian states with various kinds of weapons, military equipment, and ammunition. All these products of the military-industrial complex can come only from Russia: It supervised the formation of the infrastructure, combat regulations, tactics--everything the armies of the newly independent states of Central Asia have inherited; further, the products are cheaper than in the West and of better quality than the Chinese, which coincide with ours in terms of many tactical-technical characteristics; regular deliveries are guaranteed; some of the states of Central Asia in cooperation with Russia could produce their own arms (from cartridges in Kyrgyzstan to aircraft of the AWACS type in Uzbekistan). As for Russia's interests, they include above all the availability of a large and promising market for selling products of the military-industrial complex, cooperation with a number of enterprises of the Central Asian military-industrial complex, the use of testing grounds (especially Baykonur), and the acquisition of important military-strategic raw material. Military cadres are a promising area of cooperation. At the present time there is a critical shortage of officers representing the "titular" population in the formation of armies of the Central Asian states. Russians and other Slavs make up from 70 to 90 percent of the officer corps. It will take at least several years to create a highly professional officer corps from local residents (again, not without help from Russian instructors and military training institutions). The service of Russian officers in armies of the states of Central Asia will help Russia to relieve a fairly critical problem of returning military servicemen to Russian territory. In addition to the already tested forms of cooperation it would be possible to consider the following as well: The search for new forms of regional collective security (naturally, with the mandatory participation of Russia and, possibly, enlisting certain adjacent states); expansion of bilateral cooperation (for example, in the form of legal documentation with interstate agreements of Russia's military presence with Russian military bases); the transformation of collective (and essentially mainly Russia) forces into real coalition armed forces intended for protecting all the former border of the USSR in the Central Asian region; development of contract service for Russian citizens in armies of Central Asian states. It is not ruled out but rather suggested that there be military cooperation within the framework of the CSCE and the United Nations.
