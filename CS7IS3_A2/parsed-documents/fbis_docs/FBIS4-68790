The Duma Covered It Up"] [Text] The Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation sent the State Duma a document, according to which almost one out of every four deputies should be deprived of his mandate. In accordance with the Statute on Elections of Deputies of the State Duma, the Central Election Commission has no later than three months following the official publication of the election results to present the State Duma with an account of the expenditure of monetary resources by the election associations. No later than a month following its receipt by the Duma this account should be published in "publications in which federal laws are to be published and communicated to other news media." All the deadlines have passed. Nothing has been published anywhere. There is not even the Central Election Commission account to the Duma. This is not entirely the case, though. It is all far more involved. Some document from the Central Election Commission was received in the Duma, apparently. Was received and sank without trace, causing none of the ripples on the surface which are expected in such cases. Your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer managed to obtain the mysterious paper. Even at first glance it evokes a multitude of questions and misgivings. Printed with grammatical errors and any old how, the stitched document has neither signature nor stamps nor source and entry data attesting its receipt in the chamber. Nor is there the decision in the margins: "Copy and distribute to the factions"--signed and dated--customary in such cases. Hot on the trail, colleagues from the newspaper ZAVTRA have already randomly extracted and published what is, seemingly, the tastiest information--data on violations by the Russia's Choice and Yabloko election associations of the article of the Statute on Elections... prohibiting the acceptance of monetary donations from companies formed with foreign participation. The biggest contributions from donors of this type were paid into the Russia's Choice election fund: R154.8 million from the Stolichnyy Joint-Stock Commercial Bank; R130 million from the Olbi-Diplomat Stock Company; R30 million from the Skyline Russo-British joint venture. For Yabloko sponsors with foreign participation were the Viamond LTD Stock Company--R30 million--and the Torgovlya i kredit Stock Company and the Optsion Bank--R10 million each. The participation of foreign capital in the Russia's Choice and Yabloko campaigns is reason in principle to raise the question of deprivation of the deputies of this faction of their Duma mandates. But this is not all the document contains. Its basic text is composed of an affirmation of the numerous "deficiencies in the election associations' observance of financial discipline." The absence of documents confirming the actual performance of jobs and services, for example, are classed as "deficiencies." For the Democratic Party of Russia for a total of almost R70 million and for the Party of Russian Unity and Accord for R20.7 million, for the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia for an absence of stamps on accounts for R62.9 million, and so forth. The authors of the document, evidently, on the one hand recognized the seriousness of the facts and could not fail to adduce them, on the other, deliberately lowered the categorization of these abuses to "deficiencies in the observance of discipline." The account gives the impression of some rough copy or memorandum conveyed confidentially for the familiarization of the requisite persons or of a trial balloon released to test the retaliatory response. But what is most surprising and incomprehensible is the subsequent fate of this document. The Duma factions know of, remember, and have opinions about the document. The Russia's Choicers, whose guilt it establishes, maintain that Russia's Choice and Yabloko are the sole election associations to have honestly and openly published their sources of financing. This, allegedly, is why they were hit. Others also would, most likely, be found to have similar sins: The Germans' funding of the LDPR is known, after all. The deputy who handed your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer the document expressed the hope that the newspaper would "dig up" violations among Russia's Choice's opponents also: "Go looking--there are no honest communists." Russia's Choice had even prepared a complaint to the Central Election Commission demanding publication of all the data, but it was not sent. Nonetheless, the sight of the document in the hands of a journalist had literally a shock effect on the Duma authorities that it concerned primarily, it would seem. People in the Credentials Commission had a stunned look: "Where did you get this? We don't have this." They asked to make a copy, but immediately had second thoughts. Oleg Shenkarev, deputy chairman of the commission, repeated several times that this was an "extremely delicate" matter and that "a serious picture emerges." And hereupon categorically declared that until the commission had a document with signatures and a stamp, it would be examining nothing. The curtain on the mysterious origin of the strange paper was lifted slightly when your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer turned for clarification to Valentin Kovalev, deputy chairman of the State Duma. Valentin Alekseyevich also acknowledged that he had not seen the Central Election Commission account and also asked to make a copy, kindly agreeing to comment on the document "from the legal standpoint." But at the time scheduled for the interview he also suddenly began to have misgivings: Was this an authentic account of the Central Election Commission? "Why do I not have it? Such documents should be on my desk! We have just now learned that this document was not received by the Duma." In the presence of your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer he, however, telephoned State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, who confirmed the authenticity of the document and announced that it was being distributed in the Duma with his consent. Replacing the receiver, Kovalev suddenly remembered that "the Duma Council considered this document on its merits and adopted the decision to take note of it." Valentin Alekseyevich himself described this decision as "highly neutral." While cautioning that this "does not mean that the matter is closed--it could be considered at a sitting of the State Duma also," the deputy chairman emphasized that for this "someone has to raise the issue. It is not being contemplated thus far, according to my information." "As a lawyer," Kovalev concluded that legislation made no provision for legal liability for the violations perpetrated by Russia's Choice and Yabloko. To the candid question as to why the opponents of Russia's Choice and Yabloko had not availed themselves of so splendid an opportunity to get in a political blow, the deputy chairman, a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation faction, replied with references to the Duma's preoccupation with problems of the budget and the achievement of national accord. The same reason was cited also by Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia faction: "What business is this of the Duma's? If the Central Election Commission has discovered violations, let it apply to the law enforcement authorities. Our faction has no interest in constantly looking to the past. There is too much to do today to be rummaging around in yesterday's shit." Some not so "titled" deputies explain the State Duma's more than indifferent attitude toward the sins of the election campaign by reasons of a totally different quality, alas. Not by the lower house's total immersion in far-reaching business designed to secure for the country a bright future but by a fear of touching what--merely a touch--would start to flake off uncontrollably or cave in completely even. Mikhail Molostvov believes: "Rummage around, and you will discover the dubious nature of all the elections. This is why nothing is being said about this." In the opinion of Ayvars Lezdinsh, "corporate interest in this case outweighed everything else. Almost everyone understands that if investigations start, they could ultimately reach him also. Not only were the factions guilty of violations, the head-to-head constituency deputies are no exception either." The "presidential host" might, perhaps, have made a fuss and have attempted to deliver the Duma a mortal blow, the opposition having been caught in financial peccadilloes. But, as ill luck would have it, its "own people" were caught also. The opposition also was faced with a dilemma: Should it insist on an annulment of the election results? The members of the opposition realize full well that the complete "removal" of their political adversaries from the Duma would make the lower house an inoperative body and would break up its whole structure, which had been put together with such difficulty and in which the opposition had succeeded in occupying pretty good places. There is a certain common thread linking the president and parliament and the Central Election Commission and, most likely, many others also. This is the actual historical action of 12 December of last year. The hastily organized presidential-model elections were conducted in a "bundle" with a referendum on a constitution dear to the president's heart. Violations in one part of this action would compel reflection on the legality of the other. This is why both sides are trying not to make a fuss. Some under the pressure of the sorry necessity of sending others a semi-official paper deliberately reducing the scale of the lawlessness, others swiftly and quietly "taking note of it." All this is reminiscent of the syndrome, well known in psychiatry, of the forcing into the subconscious of facts of which one is ashamed and which are dangerous for one's reputation.
