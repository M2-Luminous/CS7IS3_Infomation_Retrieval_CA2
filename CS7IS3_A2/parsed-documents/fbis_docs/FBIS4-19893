It is true that Europe and the United States have remained spectators to the "crimes against humanity" perpetrated for the past two years against the Bosnian Muslims in the former Yugoslavia. The Western world, which attempted to absolve the sins of the "genocide" undertaken by the Nazis during World War II through films it has been producing since then, is unfortunately displaying the same indifference now with regard to Bosnia as well. Expressing other intentions under the guise of showing "reaction" on the basis of "humanitarian" reasons, however, is a deception that goes beyond defending Bosnia. [passage omitted] The anti-imperialist winds created using the excuse of Bosnia and raids against embassies inevitably bring the Iranian example to mind. The excuse for the occupation of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 was the "commemoration of the students who fell during the Shah's rule." The meeting held in front of the university turned in one moment into an anti-American demonstration, leading to the occupation of the U.S. Embassy, which in turn played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Khomeyni regime. Intellectuals who witnessed the 4 November demonstrations grasped the significance of the demonstrations only later, saying that "the appearance of mullahs and their supporters in the streets for martyred students, who were mostly leftists, was very surprising." Probably, a large majority of the people in Turkey, who associated the calls -- issued by certain television stations to the effect that "all parties are participating; our people are rushing into Taksim Square in their masses" -- with the massacre in Bosnia, only realized that they were deceived by the radicals when they watched the television news in the evening. If this trend continues, it is clear that the Prosperity Party will no longer be able to control such events. The people of Algeria are now suffering the bitter consequences of the politicization process brought about by the Islamic movements by using force whenever necessary. Algeria has been dragged into a civil war in the hands of fanatics. [passage omitted] To be able to uphold the social peace and the democratic system in the face of the "green siege" around it, in addition to "stability," Turkey should also display an interest in new overtures and political formations. State of emergency rules and military formulas cannot constitute a solution. Above all, the country's need for a powerful social democratic platform should be discussed. It is a fact that radical movements that develop within democracies eliminate the atmosphere of tolerance when they come to office and put an end to the freedom of expression. The fanaticism manifested in the big cities using the excuse of Bosnia -- which thankfully did not cost the lives of innocent people as in the case of the Sivas massacre -- should never be forgotten.
