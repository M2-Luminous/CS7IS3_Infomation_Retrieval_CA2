Healthy People 2000: The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This Request for Applications (RFA), HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program, is related to the priority of HIV/AIDS infection. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 ( Full Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;0474&hyph;0; or Summary Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00473&hyph;1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325 (Telephone: 202&hyph;783&hyph;3238). Promoting Nonuse of Tobacco: Studies have clearly established that the use of tobacco products increases mortality and morbidity, not only for the primary users of these products but for those in close proximity to the user. Statistics published by the National Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible for as many as 1,500 deaths per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that prolonged exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing heart and lung disease. Therefore, the CMHS strongly encourages all awardees to provide smoke-free project and work environments. A number of the goals of this program are consistent with the President's Health Care Reform initiative (e.g., providing quality mental health services, reducing the number of unnecessary inpatient and outpatient medical visits, and increasing productive work capacity as a result of receiving these services) and support the DHHS Secretary's themes of fostering independence through empowering the people, preventing future problems, and improving services to our customers. Part II_Programmatic Purpose, Goals and Scope, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date Services Demonstration Projects: CMHS will award competitive cooperative agreements under Section 520B of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to develop or expand programs to provide mental health services for individuals, their families and others who experience serious psychological reactions as a result of HIV/AIDS antibody testing, and to provide mental health services for people with HIV/AIDS. The services demonstration projects will be responsible for an evaluation that includes collection of both process and outcome data and that will document the extent to which the objectives set forth in the application have been met. The services demonstration projects will also participate in the development of an overall evaluation of the HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program by the coordinating center, as described below. Coordinating Center: CMHS will award one competitive cooperative agreement to a recipient which, in conjunction with the services demonstration projects, will design and implement the overall evaluation of the HIV/AIDS Mental Health Services Demonstration Program. This will include evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the different approaches or models used for organizing and providing the mental health services. The coordinating center will also provide the overall coordination and management of the program data.
