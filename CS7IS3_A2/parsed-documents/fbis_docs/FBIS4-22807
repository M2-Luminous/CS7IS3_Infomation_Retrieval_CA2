A Talk With the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Republic of Georgia"; place and date not given] [Text] A state delegation headed by Foreign Affairs Minister Batoni [a term of respect in reference to or addressing a male] Aleksandre Chikvaidze returned to Tbilisi from Tehran on 19 February. In addition to the official visit to Iran, the Georgian delegation paid a working visit to the capital of Azerbaijan. These days, when almost every basic priority of Georgia's foreign policy is developing dynamically, the official visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran was especially meaningful and important in many respects. [Correspondent] Batono Aleksandre, your trip to Tehran and Baku is the first as Foreign Minister since Boris Yeltsin's official visit to Georgia. Why Baku and Tehran? Does it carry some specific import? [Chikvaidze] Indeed it does. Boris Yeltsin's recent visit closed the regional circle of Georgia's foreign policy, in a sense--that is, it gives final balance to our relations with neighboring countries. Defining relationships has put many hitherto unsolved problems and puzzles with the Russian Federation in their logical place and made it much easier to establish contacts with other states in our region on a calmer and more reasoned basis. Hence, our official visit to Iran and our working visit to Azerbaijan are in keeping with this specific context. It begins an important stage of improved relations and deeper cooperation. A vigorous regional policy is a top priority of Georgia's foreign policy, because we remain a regional-scale country which can get organically involved in "big politics" only by implementing an intensive regional policy. [Correspondent] Batono Minister, before Tehran you went to Baku. What prompted the visit, and what was there of interest in it? [Chikvaidze] Our delegation had the chance to pay a one-day working visit to the capital of Azerbaijan. The fact is that Georgia and Azerbaijan face almost identical problems at this point in history. So we have a lot to talk about and share. One might say that the Georgian delegation's stay in Baku went beyond the bounds of an ordinary working visit. We had a lengthy, meaningful, and fruitful talk with Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov (incidentally, he grew up in Tbilisi and speaks excellent Georgian). His wife is Georgian too. We discussed a broad range of international and regional problems. We talked about the extreme escalation of armed conflicts in Transcaucasia. We agreed to step up joint efforts with respect to collective security in the framework of the CIS. Most important, I met with Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev. We talked about the quadrilateral meeting initiated by Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze to settle the conflicts in Transcaucasia, with Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia taking part. As was to be expected, Heydar Aliyev met the Georgian Head of State's initiative with enthusiasm. We agreed that implementing the idea would be a big step toward normalizing the situation in the region. At the end of our talk, I conveyed to Batoni Aliyev Eduard Shevardnadze's official invitation to visit Georgia, and he accepted it with pleasure. [Correspondent] Batono Aleksandre, was our delegation's official visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran prompted by any specific factors, and if so what can you tell us about them? [Chikvaidze] I told you when we started talking, and I will repeat it now, that a qualitatively new stage has begun in Georgia's foreign policy, or, rather, the implementation of its priorities. The present system of international relations is a reality for the whole world; it began to take shape after World War II and has been undergoing very important transformations before our very eyes. Time has also brought it about that Georgia also has a place in this world order. Clearly and specifically determining this place and purpose constitutes the chief task of Georgia's recent foreign policy, the basic direction of our efforts and analysis. Our single point of departure is this: Georgia's geopolitical position remains unchanging; it cannot be affected in any way by any change in the system of international relations. Georgia has always been and still remains on the border between West and East, which is a very important factor despite the fact that the traditional anxiety of that confrontation has been somewhat alleviated these days. The logical conclusion, then, is that the influence of our big neighbors' short-term and long-term interests on little Georgia's domestic and foreign policy is a clearly marked and permanent political process. This is an indisputable fact, and so I think that our foreign policy's prime characteristic has to be balance and, as far as possible, take account of the set of interacting factors which define our actual geopolitical position. I took this brief theoretical excursion in order to emphasize the elementary truth that Georgia's permanent, unflagging interest toward Iran is what you have called the factors that prompted our official visit. These factors will always exist, just as the objective necessity of bilateral relations between Iran and Georgia will always exist. Add to that the realities that have taken shape through the centuries and you get a picture of the extreme necessity of an impeccable regional policy. It is in our future interest to have close relations with Iran--political, economic, cultural, and general. This is why relations between the Republic of Georgia and the Islamic Republic of Iran have been characterized by special intensity since November 1991. [Correspondent] Batono Minister, what can you tell us specifically about your visit? [Chikvaidze] Iran's Foreign Minister, Batoni Ali Akbar Velayeti [transliterated], visited Tbilisi last spring. So now I paid a return official visit to Tehran, and the visit had an objective of specific import. The Iranians welcomed us with a very intensive, packed program. We visited Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Akbar Velayeti the first day. We spent almost two hours talking about a broad range of current political problems. We talked about many urgent issues of Iranian-Georgian bilateral relations and explored many pleasant prospects. Naturally, our focus was on major problems of regional security and normalization of the situation in Transcaucasia. It is a pleasure to report that Iran's top political leaders have complete and objective information about our problems, and, what's more, Iran's Islamic Mejlis [Parliament] has a functioning Friends of Georgia group. On 16 February I met with Iran's President, His Excellency Hashemi Rafsanjani. I presented him with a personal letter from Georgia's Head of State. We had a very interesting talk, and the President gratefully accepted Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze's official invitation to Georgia. I mentioned above that our program was a packed one. We met with all the ministers in the field of economics and the Vice Speaker of the Islamic Mejlis. Very soon, many prospects will become a reality. We agreed to create a joint economic commission in the first half of 1994. We can say, then, that the visit was a success. [Correspondent] Batono Aleksandre, at the beginning of our interview you said that the visit to Tehran is in keeping with the specific context of regional policy, and you linked that to Boris Yeltsin's visit. Could you give us more details? [Chikvaidze] During our talk with Iran's President it became very clear that creating the legal base for relations with Russia was truly an urgent necessity for us. Rafsanjani stated directly that he welcomed the improvement of Georgian-Russian bilateral relations. What's more, Iran will encourage further development of relations with Russia. The President believes that tension between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia has a direct and negative influence on the situation in the region, and Iran can't help being concerned. [Correspondent] Batono Minister, there has been a lot of talk about Iran's possible support in supplying natural gas. Was there any discussion of that during your visit? [Chikvaidze] I spoke about that to the Foreign Minister and the President in the name of our Head of State. We reached an agreement by which we will be supplied with one billion cubic meters of gas from Iran; this is to be done on the basis of a long-term and very favorable agreement. The Iranians' support is due to Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze's prestige. "We will give maximum support to Shevardnadze's Georgia," President Rafsanjani stated at the end of our talk.
