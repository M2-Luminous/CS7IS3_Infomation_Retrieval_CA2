ACTION: Additions to the procurement list. SUMMARY: This action adds to the Procurement List services to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 27, 1994. ADDRESS: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 1 and 15, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 FR 15385 and 18104) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Administrative Services, Interagency Cooperative Administrative Support Unit (CASU), 230 South Dearborn Street and other locations, Chicago, Illinois. Janitorial/Custodial, U.S. Army Reserve Center, 4500 South Lancaster Road, Dallas, Texas. This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts. E.R. Alley, Jr., Deputy Executive Director.
