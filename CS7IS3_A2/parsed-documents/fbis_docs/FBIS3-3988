At a press conference held here, Cheng said that the development of international port and trade centers in the region will benefit 240 million people in a 23-million-square-kilometer area in southwestern China. He said that the province will provide a shortcut for import and export goods from land-locked Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Now the goods mainly goes through coastal cities of Guangzhou in the south and Shanghai in the east. He said that the central government has adopted preferential policies to encourage the locality to expand economic and trade links with Southeast Asian countries. The central government supports include special loans and funds allocations for infrastructure and better-off of the eight million poverty-stricken people in the autonomous region. In response to a question about the region's economic relations with Southeast Asian countries, he said that many countries have shown great interest in investing in the areas along the 1,600- kilometer coastal line of the region. Guangxi has a 1,020-kilometer border line with Vietnam, and is located near the Laos, Thailand and Myanmar [Burma]. He said that former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew visited the coastal city of Beihai in the region last year. Now a group of Singapore entrepreneurs are in the city to assess a 666.7-hectare area to be designated to them by the local government. "There is a bright prospect for the project," Cheng said, "The two sides are consulting on the industrial structure and scale of investment in the area." He said that a number of cooperative projects between the autonomous region and Thailand and Malaysia are also in the pipeline. Since Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai went to Guangxi during his China visit last August, some 18 investment projects by the Thai bank have been under discussion. The bank from Thailand is also applying to set up a branch in the regional capital of Nanning. Cooperative projects under way with Malaysia include a seafood processing plant and some 400 luxury villas in Beihai city. The city has joined hands with Malaysia to open marine tourist routes to Southeast Asian countries. It has placed orders for luxury pleasure boats and will soon put them in use. Last year, the region introduced a total of one billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds with 2,544 investment contracts signed, seeing the fastest growth rate of foreign investment among coastal areas of China. Most of the funds come from Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States and Southeast Asian countries. Besides introduction of overseas funds, the region also expanded its investment overseas. To seize the opportunity emerging in a surge of market-oriented economic reform in Vietnam, the region has been seeking to take part in technological renovations of a large number of Vietnamese enterprises that were built with Chinese aid in the 1950s and 1960s. "We are planning to send a technological group to these Vietnamese enterprises to see what we can do to help," he said. He said that the region has set up a joint-venture fertilizer plant and a department store in Vietnam since the two countries resumed normal diplomatic relations in November 1991. "The two countries have a long history of friendly exchanges and cooperation. We can cooperate in many areas, such as trade, joint ventures, and tourism," he said.
