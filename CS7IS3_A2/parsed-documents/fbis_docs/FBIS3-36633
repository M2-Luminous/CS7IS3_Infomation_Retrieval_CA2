This was said by spokesman for Moscow's secret services, Aleksey Kandaurov, who granted PANORAMA the following interview. [Bigazzi] How will the services be reorganized following the decision to abolish the Security Ministry, formerly the KGB? [Kandaurov] Yeltsin's decree sets out the broad outlines of the functions and structures of the renewed special services -- the struggle against the espionage and subversive activities of foreign services; the struggle against terrorism, against illegal armed groups, against movements with extremist leanings, against drugs and arms trafficking, and against corruption and smuggling. [Bigazzi] Is there a real threat of political terrorism such as that of the Red Brigades in Italy? [Kandaurov] There are already some armed groups that have taken up weapons. Right-wing subversive movements such as Aleksandr Barkachev's for instance. Armed extremists are proliferating throughout Russia, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to combat them. [Bigazzi] Following the demise of the blocs, is there still pressure from "foreign agents"? Which secret services are more dangerous? [Kandaurov] The CIA remains the most active, like the British, French, and -- albeit to a lesser extent -- the Italian services. On top of this, agents of the former Soviet republics are now operating in Russia, too. Five Georgian agents and one Estonian agent who committed a homicide have been arrested. In 1993, 20 foreign agents were arrested. [Bigazzi] Zhirinovskiy is worrying the West. Did you forecast the rise of the ultra-nationalists? [Kandaurov] Two weeks before the elections we forecast that Zhirinovskiy's party could have win 24 percent of the votes. We were only wrong by one percent. [Bigazzi] Many people, including Gorbachev, say that Zhirinovskiy used to be a KGB agent. Is it true? [Kandaurov] Not to my knowledge. In any case, what does it mean, to have been a KGB agent? A number of the present democratic leaders were KGB agents, too.
