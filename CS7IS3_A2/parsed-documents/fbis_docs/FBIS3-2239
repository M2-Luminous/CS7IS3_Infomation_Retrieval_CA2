In a campaign codenamed "The Two Opens", the Maoists plan to launch a blistering attack on how Mr Deng and his faction had "opened the door to capitalism and opened fire on the residents of Beijing" in the early hours of June 4, 1989. Chinese sources said yesterday that while the full blitz would not be launched until Mr Deng's death, the first salvoes had been fired in view of the rapidly declining health of the 89-year-old senior leader. The sources said while the leftists had denigrated the student demonstrations of early 1989 as a sign of "bourgeois liberalisation" they had always disputed the need to use live ammunition against the students and citizens of the capital. They said the ideologues had collected "impressive black material" that would point to Mr Deng, then chairman of the policy-setting Central Military Commission, as the leader who gave the order for soldiers to shoot to kill. "Seeing how they have been marginalised by the development of reforms, the conservatives hope they can win widespread support by spearheading the drive to overturn the verdict on June 4," a source said. "While the ideologues will never support the prodemocracy movement, they figure they can deal a body blow to Deng's reputation by laying bare his June 4-related `guilt'." China analysts said Mr Deng had never admitted responsibility for ordering the troops to open fire. Sources close to the People's Liberation Army said after the massacre that detailed information and documents on the chain of events that led to the shoot-to-kill order had been obliterated or covered up. However, a party elder claimed in late 1992 that he had recordings and other material proving it was Mr Deng who made the fateful decision. The sources said it was likely the conservatives would publicise some of this evidence immediately upon Mr Deng's death. At the same time, leftist commissars have in official journals under their control started an open campaign against Mr Deng's "re-introduction of capitalism". The attack has focused on attempts by the Deng faction to diminish the "leading position of the state sector" in the economy through quasi-privatisation. In a recent issue of In Search of Truth [QIUSHI], a commentator on the leftist journal accused certain cadres of "failing to make a distinction between the socialist market economy and the capitalistic market economy". Other articles in the same journal attacked the conversion of state-owned enterprises into shareholding companies as evidence of "sidelining state planning" and "curtailing state ownership". Referring to Mr Deng's famous doctrine that "productivity is the only criterion" for assessing a policy, the ideologues criticised unnamed cadres who said the question of "ownership" should be dropped so long as economic development could be expedited.
