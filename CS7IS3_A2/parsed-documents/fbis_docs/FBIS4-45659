Wichert: "Old Liabilities -- New Tasks: Criteria for Reclamation"] [Text] The problems surrounding polluted sites in the new federal laender may be seen as the major obstacle to the sale of the old factories with a view to creating new jobs. However, it is important to differentiate between the various types and degrees of pollution and the future uses to which it is intended to put the sites concerned. For the purposes of polluted site reclamation -- and this does not apply solely to the new federal laender -- a distinction will have to be drawn between the general principle of prevention and that of salvaging in order to conserve the soil as a natural entity and the foundation for human, animal, and plant life. Unless this distinction is clearly drawn, there will be a danger that prevention standards will be applied to operations designed to remedy existing soil pollution. This would result in an enormous outlay and gigantic reclamation costs. Typical Polluted Site Problems It is not only the special cases of former industrial areas, such as those containing coking works, gasworks, refineries, etc., that present problems. Polluted sites are often to be found at factories producing products above suspicion of contamination, but which merely used (apparently small quantities of) substances represent a water hazard. In most of these cases, only part (often under 20 percent) of the site is contaminated and needs to be cleaned up. Plant sections such as former dyeing units, sedimentation tanks, residue deposits (factory dumps), drum stores, heating boilers, etc. are the main parts affected. In all these cases it is to be expected that the soil will have been polluted by slag containing heavy metals, petroleum products, phenols, chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHC's), and creosotes (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons). All these pollutants are to be found in the soil in varying concentrations, and can spread down to great depths, for instance in troughs, hollows, and gutters and over wide areas. It often emerges in practice that the reclamation strategies drawn up at the beginning have to be changed into use-oriented versions without reference to the former factory. Multifunction use of the type frequently called for in the early eighties cannot be achieved. It is unrealistic to assume that the entire mass of soil can be cleansed to a degree of purity reflecting its natural state. In addition to the nature of the substance concerned, the path by which it spreads plays a decisive role in determining the hazard that it constitutes for human beings, animals, plants, and the environment. Chemical degradation combined with volubility in water can endanger the groundwater, whereas volatile substances also take an aerial path. It is only via knowledge as to how the substances are spread that it can be established whether they place the various resources at risk. If a substance in the soil may be regarded as persistent, it has zero effect on the groundwater and/or human beings provided it remains below the ground surface but at a sufficient distance from the groundwater. The situation is quite different if a substance in the soil is rapidly degradable. This has major implications for reclamation technology, as it may be assumed that processes take place in nature in accordance with the law of minimum, i.e., with the minimum economic outlay. Developing the Right Criteria A major issue, especially in the new federal laender, will be the elaboration of criteria that distinguish between the differing conservation targets for avoiding contamination either on a preventive basis or as a salvage measure. Without doubt, reclamation targets frequently call for the lower preventive level, not least in view of the legal uncertainty facing the licensing authorities. Taking a realistic view of the overall situation -- particularly with an eye to stretching limited resources -- every attempt should be made to explore alternative strategies that make it possible to release parts of the factory sites so that they can be put to new uses.
