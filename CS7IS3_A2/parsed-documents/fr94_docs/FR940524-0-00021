Part 24 is amended by adding a new subpart F consisting of §§23.301 through 24.309 to read as follows: Subpart F_Competitive Bidding Procedures for Narrowband PCS Sec. 24.301␣Narrowband PCS subject to competitive bidding. 24.302␣Competitive bidding design for narrowband PCS licensing. 24.303␣Competitive bidding mechanisms. 24.304␣Withdrawal, default and disqualification penalties. 24.305␣Bidding applications (FCC Form 175 and 175&hyph;S Short-Form). 24.306␣Submission of upfront payments and downpayments. 24.307␣Long-Form applications. 24.308␣License grant, denial, default, and disqualification. 24.309␣Designated entities. Subpart F_Competitive Bidding Procedures for Narrowband PCS §24.301 Narrowband PCS subject to competitive bidding. Mutually exclusive initial applications to provide narrowband PCS service are subject to competitive bidding procedures. The general competitive bidding procedures found in 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q, will apply unless otherwise provided in this part. §24.302 Competitive bidding design for narrowband PSC licensing. (a) The Commission will employ the following competitive bidding designs when choosing from among mutually exclusive initial applications to provide narrowband PCS service: (1) Single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or simultaneous); (2) Sequential oral auctions; (3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions. (b) The Commission may design and test alternative procedures. The Commission will announce by Public Notice before each auction the competitive bidding design to be employed in a particular auction. (c) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid, a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be used with any type of auction design. (d) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction. §24.303 Competitive bidding mechanisms. (a) Sequencing . The Commission will establish and may vary the sequence in which narrowband PCS licenses will be auctioned. (b) Grouping . In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial bidding, the Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned simultaneously or in combination. (c) Reservation Price . The Commission may establish a reservation price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject to auction will not be awarded. (d) Minimum Bid Increments . The Commission may, by announcement before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage terms. (e) Stopping Rules . The Commission may establish stopping rules before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate an auction within a reasonable time. (f) Activity Rules . The Commission may establish activity rules which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that the Commission establishes an activity rule in connection with a simultaneous multiple round auction, each bidder will be entitled to request and will be automatically granted five (5) waivers of such rule during the course of a single auction.
