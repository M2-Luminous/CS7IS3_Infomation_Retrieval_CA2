Karayev; UDC 519.25] [Abstract] The proliferation of ship-borne and coastal radar (RLS) used at very low grazing angles resulting is surface shadowing in addition to space and airborne radar operating at medium and small angles of incidence and the shortcomings of existing approaches of solving the problem of echo signal spectrum at small grazing angles prompted the development of a new approach which is suitable for finding any statistical characteristic of a random moving surface allowing for blockage. The approach is first tested on a simple model and then applied to the case of sea waves. The approach thus makes it possible to treat the undulating sea surface as a superposition of traveling plane waves with random amplitudes and determine its effective statistical characteristics. Since available computer facilities are too slow and inadequate for parallel calculations, the new approach is based on taking blockage into account for each term, than adding up the results. The proposed algorithm is a combination of precise and approximate approaches and makes it possible to consider moving surfaces and find any statistical characteristic allowing for blockage as well as plot the distribution function, resulting in a precise solution. It is expected that the algorithm will be used to find the spectrum of the echo from the sea surface at small grazing angles. The author is grateful to M.B. Kanevskiy for constructive discussions.
