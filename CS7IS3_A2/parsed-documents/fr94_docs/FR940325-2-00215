FR940325-2-00215 FR940325-2-00095 6. Various fees and expenses are deducted under the Contracts. A $30 annual Policy Fee will be deducted in arrears from the Account Value on the last Valuation Date of the Policy Year and upon a complete surrender. If applicable, a pro-rate portion of the charge is also deducted on the first Policy Anniversary after a Participant's Effective Date. A daily Administrative Expense Charge equal to an effective annual rate of .15% of the net assets of the subaccount is deducted from the assets of each subaccount. There currently is no charge for transfers, but United of Omaha reserves the right to impose a $10 fee for the thirteenth and each subsequent request to transfer Account Value from a Subaccount made during a single Participant Year. A withdrawal Processing fee equal to the lesser of $15 or 2% of the amount withdrawn will be imposed for the second and each subsequent partial withdrawal request during a single Participant Year. United of Omaha does not anticipate any profit from these administrative charges, none of which will be increased. United of Omaha will deduct the above charges in reliance upon and in compliance with Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act. 7. A one-time set-up fee of $30 and a quarterly asset charge equal to an annual rate of 1.50% will be deducted from Account Value with respect to Certificates for which an optional asset allocation program has been elected. 8. United of Omaha will deduct a charge of up to 3.5% for the aggregate premium taxes paid on behalf of a particular Contract or from the Account Value upon a complete surrender, death of the Participant, or at annuitization, depending upon when it is required to be paid. No charges currently are made for federal, state or local taxes, other than premium taxes. United of Omaha may, however, deduct charges for such taxes, or the economic burden thereof, from Account B in the future. 9. No sales charges are deducted from premium payments under the Contracts. A contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') in the amount of up to 6% is imposed on certain full or partial surrenders during the first nine years after a Certificate's Effective Date to cover expenses relating to the sales of the Contracts. No CDSC is assessed upon: (a) Participant's death, (b)a corrective distribution, (c) a hardship distribution, if the Participant suffers a permanent disability or is diagnosed as having a terminal illness, (d) the Participant's separation from service of his or her employer, or (e) the application of a Contract's proceeds to any Payout Option, with certain exceptions, for a period of at least 36 months. United of Omaha will not increase the CDSC. United of Omaha does not anticipate that the CDSC will generate sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing the Contracts. If this charge is insufficient to cover the expenses, the deficiency will be met from the general account assets of United of Omaha, which may include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expenses risks. 10. A daily charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in Account B will be imposed to compensate United of Omaha for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. The 1.25% charge will not increase. Of this amount, approximately three-fourths is attributable to mortality risks, and approximately one-fourth is attributable to expense risks. The charge may be a source of profit for United of Omaha which will be added to its surplus and may be used for, among other things, the payment of distribution, sales and other expenses. United of Omaha currently anticipates a profit from this charge. 11. The mortality risk arises from United of Omaha's contractual obligation to make Annuity Payments (determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contracts) regardless of how long all Annuitants or any individual Annuitant may live. This undertaking assures that neither an Annuitant's own longevity, nor an improvement in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the periodic Annuity Payments that the Annuitant will receive under a Contract. A mortality risk also is assumed in connection with the Death Benefit guarantee because it could exceed the Account Value. There is no extra charge for the enhanced Death Benefit.
