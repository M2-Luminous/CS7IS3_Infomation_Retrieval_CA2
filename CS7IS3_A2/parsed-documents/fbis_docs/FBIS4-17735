In particular, he considers it inexpedient to hold a referendum or a plebiscite on the treaty, as well as its adoption as a federal law. In his opinion, responsibility for non-observance of the agreement should be more of a moral character. In this connection, Satarov pointed out the role of media as one of the most effective controllers of the treaty's implementation by the sides. Satarov suggested that relations between those who will sign the document on April 28 and "non-signatories" will be built "normally." To prove his viewpoint he cited an episode during the recent meeting between Boris Yeltsin and leaders of the factions; when reacting to sharp criticism of the draft by a Yabloko representative Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy, the president said: "Whatever you say about the agreement, we will still be friends." "The non-signing of the treaty does not mean discrimination against nonaligned public organizations," Satarov pointed out. Otherwise, he said, "the idea of civil accord itself would be discredited." Satarov noted that the process of civil reconciliation should not be exhausted with the conclusion of the treaty. He considers the mechanism for the solution of concrete problems as the most important issue in the document. Satarov has in view one of the functions of the conciliatory commission, to be created under the treaty, which will organize roundtable meetings and working groups on various issues. The presidential aide said that "according to latest reports" about 220 people had been invited to the ceremony of signing the civil accord treaty on Thursday.
