A ministry official yesterday said the chemical industry will pursue 8 per cent growth this year. That will bring its annual production value to 190 billion yuan ($21.84 billion). Last year, total production in the chemical sector was worth 178.79 billion yuan ($20.55 billion), an increase of 7.2 per cent over the previous year. Chemical product exports should experience a 16 per cent rise over 1993, the official said. However, the export growth rate set for this year is lower than that in 1993. In the January-November period last year, China's chemical sector saw its imports hit $11.02 billion, up 1.6 per cent while its exports reached $9.97 billion, representing a record growth of 27.3 per cent. Among exports, the ratio of finished products to unfinished products increased last year, indicating China's chemical industry has made progress in variety and quality of goods, as well as advances of its technologies. In the past, raw chemical materials amounted to a large share of exports due to China's low technical level, the official said. Meanwhile the chemical industry this year will continue its opening drive in a bid to attract more foreign investment and establish more foreign-funded ventures in coastal areas, the official said. But the spokesman warned that last year's problems of funds shortages and price hikes for raw materials energy resources and transportation may continue to restrain this years production. Due to price hikes, the chemical industry suffered a production cost rise of more than 7.3 billion yuan ($844.8 million) last year. That figure was 1.7 fold the industry's total profits in 1992.
