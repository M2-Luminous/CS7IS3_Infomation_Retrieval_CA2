Enterprises in the Republic's mining and metallurgical sector are in the worst trouble. The staff of these enterprises are being sent en masse on vacations for an indefinite period and, moreover, many have to go without vacation payments being made. The threat of unemployment is hanging over tens of thousands of blue- and white-collar staff in the East Kazakhstan Oblast. Attempts made by the trade unions to persuade the government to set discount tariffs on the use of energy holders for fuel-intensive industries have come to nothing. At present energy holders have reached 70 percent of the cost prices in the production of titanium, zinc, lead, and other commodities. This has forced the enterprises to set prices for their goods at levels that are higher than world prices. According to the trade union leader, Kazbek Valiyev, the working people have appealed to the president and the Supreme Council to dismiss the Republic's government. The collectives of the oblast's enterprises, who have already set up strike committees, have no intention of retracting from the demands they have put forward. If the expected changes do not occur in the next few days, they intend to put forward an initiative for the staging of an all-republican protest strike. Such an appeal could be upheld in the Republic where, at present, 1200 enterprises are standing idle.
