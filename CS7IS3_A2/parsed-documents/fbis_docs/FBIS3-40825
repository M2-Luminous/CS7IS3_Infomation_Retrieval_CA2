Two days ago, the opposition parties protested the way in which the government answers deputies' questions, calling it vague and general. This took place when opposition deputy Abderrahman Haraichi raised a question about the case of Shaykh Abdessalem Yacine, whom the police have kept under house arrest in the city of Sale, north of the capital Rabat, for three years. Human Rights Minister Omar Azzimane replied that, as the case was now on the calendar of the court system, which was studying it, the prerogatives of the justice system had to be respected. The opposition deputy responded that no such case existed in the justice system: that the matter concerned only a complaint that Abdessalem Yacine's lawyers had submitted to the court for a review of his house arrest, and that relevant sources had stated that Shaykh Yacine had submitted a letter on the subject to the departments concerned. Significantly, the raising of the case of Shaykh Abdessalem Yacine, the head of the Association for Justice and Benevolence whose bureau members were recently tried on the charge of distributing illegal publications, coincided with escalating opposition party demands for greater political relaxation, release of all detainees, and the return of exiles. Mohamed Ben Said, head of the opposition Organization of [Popular] Democratic Action, said: "We still demand constitutional and political reform. We also demand respect for human rights and cleansing Morocco of all detention camps like Tazmamart [name as transliterated]." This was a reference to the detention center that used to bear this name. The Moroccan authorities demolished it and released dozens of the military prisoners who were living there. Mohamed Ben Said said, "We are not against trying those accused: an accused person must be tried, whatever the charge against him may be." Here he was quoting the Moroccan opposition figure Mohamed Basri, who, having lived in exile for more than a quarter century, has said he is prepared to return to the country if political relaxation and a return of exiles take place. At a Rabat political meeting last Tuesday celebrating the anniversary of the [1944] independence manifesto, Istiqlal Party leader Mohamed Boucetta said: "Building a state of truth, law, and respect for human rights must not remain merely a wish that pervades civil society. The experience of the recent elections has shown that the Moroccan people are committed to change and ready to sacrifice for it." Mohamed Yazghi, deputy head of the Socialist Union, said: "On the threshold of the 21st century, we cannot accept Morocco's remaining without a truly democratic system. It is unthinkable for the mixing of power to remain as it is now. It is unthinkable for the Constitution to be applied as it is now." This is a renewed affirmation of the opposition parties' refusal to work with the new government that Mohamed Karim Lamrani has formed from technocrats. Opposition figures call it unconstitutional because it did not emerge from the parliamentary majority. Official sources, on the other hand, attribute the government's makeup to the opposition parties' refusal to participate in a proposed government and to the majority parties' request for a respite to reorganize themselves; however, the program the new government is pledged to implement is the same one that King Hassan II proposed to the opposition parties. Against this background, the opposition parties are wagering on creating a political and constitutional vacuum, so that they can resume dialogue with official authorities on forming a new government. Some sources believe that the opposition parties' allusion to human rights cases and the condition of Islamic groups whose attitudes they do not share is aimed at pressuring the government and embarrassing the majority parties, which find themselves called on to support a government in which they are not participating. Signs of dissatisfaction emerged recently in majority circles. These claim that the restructuring process is facing difficulties because of their pledge to support the new government and because the scope of their freedom is being further restricted, while the opposition alone aims more criticisms at the executive apparatus. The former majority parties are expected to hold meetings to coordinate their positions on the proposed new budget, which still has not been able to be approved. Meanwhile, the official authorities have issued administrative decrees to disburse funds in emergency sectors. Interested circles see the call by the opposition parties--Socialist Union of Popular Forces, Istiqlal, and Organization of Democratic Popular Action--for the creation of a constitutional body to oversee elections and for direct election of all members of Parliament as a new attempt to put political pressure on Mohamed Karim Lamrani's government. The least of this was their signaling that they would not accept the invalidation of a limited number of constituencies. This is the view that has prevailed until now for overcoming the current political problem following the issuance of Constitutional Chamber rulings invalidating the results of no fewer than ten election districts, including one of the districts in which a candidate from the opposition Party of Progress and Socialism won. Informed circles do not discount the possible issuance of new rulings affecting figures who belong to opposition parties, particularly Istiqlal and the Socialist Union, particularly because the invalidation ought to include all the results of indirect balloting. This is a demand which, in the view of official sources, has no basis in law or the Constitution. Political circles attribute this escalation to the fact that the opposition parties, which needed no fewer than 40 seats to form a parliamentary majority qualifying them to participate in the government, having made great progress in the results of last June's direct elections, want to achieve this gain by means of political pressure. They believe that the problem that resulted from electing a third of the members of Parliament by indirect balloting has a political nature and therefore must be remedied by a political solution. The least of this would be granting their demand that a large number of outcomes of this balloting be invalidated, since their participation in any anticipated government is subject to their winning a parliamentary majority. On the other hand, official sources repeat that there is nothing to prevent their participating in the government, despite their being a minority, on the basis of seeking a formula of new alliances or taking advantage of the situation of the current majority, which in any case will not withdraw its confidence from the government.
