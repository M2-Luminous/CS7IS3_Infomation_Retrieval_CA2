The 42-year old former United Democratic Front general secretary, is a current African National Congress National Executive Committee member. Born in Sophiatown (now Triomf) in Johannesburg in 1952, Mr Molefe was one of eight children. His mother was a domestic worker and his father a labourer. Vivid memories of being taunted by white children in his earlier life convinced him of the need for change in South Africa. He joined the Black Peoples' Convention while still in school in 1974 and a year later linked up with the South African Students' Union. He first ran into trouble with the police in August 1976 when he was detained for seven months. Mr Molefe was a founder member of Azapo and served as Soweto branch chairman between 1979 and 1980. But he resigned a year later and assisted in formation of the UDF [United Democratic Front] in 1983 as well as sitting on the Soweto Civic Organistion's executive form 1982-1984. He was arrested several times in the early 1980s and in 1985 he was accused along with 22 others in the lengthy Delmas treason trial. Mr Molefe received a 10-year sentence after the three-and-a-half year trial, but the sentence was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1989. In 1990 he was elected ANC Alexandra branch chairman and ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] deputy chairman later in the year. He was appointed ANC national elections commission chairman in 1992. Mr Molefe will presided over an area made up largely of the former pieces of Bophuthatswana with its casinos and platinum mines, the goldfields of Western Transvaal and the arid north-eastern Cape. Married to Boitumelo Elizabeth Plaatjie, he has four children.
