Army Exercises Have Taken Place in the Carpathians"] [Text] The Carpathian-based mountain training center of the Ukrainian Army has engaged the personal attention of Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy. In mid-May he attended the combat training drills of motorized infantry, tank and artillery units that were held in the mountains. The minister was displeased with the degree of his subordinates' readiness to operate in mountainous terrain and recommended that unit commanders "place particular emphasis" on the subject. Curiously, the last time close attention was paid to the troops' mountain training was at the beginning of the 1980s, when the Soviet Army invaded Afghanistan and effectively proved themselves unable to counter the mujahidin operating in local mountains. It seems unlikely, however, that the Ukrainian Army is planning a new march to Kabul. Still, the mountain ambitions of the Kiev minister are entirely explicable if one recalls that the sole mountainous area on Ukrainian territory excepting the Carpathians is the Crimean peninsula. The stepped-up mountain training of Ukrainian Army units could be interpreted as a clear sign of Kiev's comprehensive preparations for the forcible settlement of the Crimean problem. Moreover, one should realize that so specific and purposeful an activity by the Defense Ministry indicates that the stage of making a political decision in principle on the matter is long past. Apparently, it is the existence of a specific mission that explains Mr. Radetskiy's concern over the state of the troops' mountain training. However, one cannot read without a smile a report by the Kiev-based GOLOS UKRAINY newspaper which, while analyzing the Ukrainian troops' combat readiness, cites an inadequate grasp of the state language by soldiers and officers as one of the main reasons for the drawbacks exposed, something that "jeopardizes the command and control of troops." I think that the Ukrainian journalists' fears about a lack of command and control of troops are somewhat exaggerated. Vitaliy Radetskiy and all his subordinates have a perfect grasp of Russian, in which they actually express themselves when discussing any more or less serious matters.
