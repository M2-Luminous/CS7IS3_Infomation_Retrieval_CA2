Presidential Media Secretary Raul Burzaco told journalists that despite U.S. pressure, Cavallo, who now is in Washington, informed Argentine President Carlos Menem that Argentina "remains in the race to enter NAFTA." Burzaco indicated that the cabinet and the president reviewed the situation raised by the government of U.S. President Bill Clinton after Menem said on 27 April that "Argentina will not cease to function" if Washington implements sanctions against his country. Cavallo told U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that Washington's pressure "will make more difficult the approval of a patents law on pharmaceuticals" in Argentina, a law that Congress has been studying for two years. Argentine laboratories, which have a 56-percent share of the local pharmaceuticals market with yearly sales totaling $3 billion, challenge the payment of royalties, involving annual payments of $500 million to foreign laboratories, mostly U.S. laboratories.
