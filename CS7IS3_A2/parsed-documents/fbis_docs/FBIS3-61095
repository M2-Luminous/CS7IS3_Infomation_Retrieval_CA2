But there are no longer either soviets or socialism or the Union. Does B. Yeltsin remain a competent president? If so, will this be for long? All things pass, all things change. Not even two months had elapsed before the president of Russia, without a moment's hesitation, was abandoning the promise to present himself for the verdict of the people and agree to early elections. Obliging people long since found a justification of this ostensibly surprise step, and more than one, of course. Let us see how convincing they are. First, it is maintained that the president has already put himself up for election repeatedly and has on just as many occasions obtained the people's trust. Particularly enthusiastic admirers speak about a whole five rounds of elections successfully negotiated by Yeltsin (to the Union parliament, to the Russian parliament, for chairman of the Russian Parliament, for president and at the 25 April referendum). There is much dissembling and misrepresentation here. Elections to the supreme organ of legislative power have nothing in common with presidential elections. Different branches of power, rights, authority, and procedure of election. It is absurd even to speak about the fact that a positive outcome of parliamentary elections endows the highest officer of the state with some particular legal validity. Never has it! Yeltsin's victory at the referendum is indisputable. As a statesman, he obtained the trust of the people, but this has a very tangential bearing on presidential elections, that is, a particular political action on a competitive basis in accordance with legislatively specified rules. It has to be recognized that Yeltsin has thus far been elected president only once. It remains to be elucidated in legally dispassionate fashion of what he was elected president. For me the answer is clear: president of the RSFSR, that is, not of an independent state, not a subject of international law, but of a component of an integral federal formation going by the name of the USSR. Strictly legally, Yeltsin acquired that same extent of authority which the president of the republics within the Russian Federation (of Kalmykia or Tatarstan, say) have currently. For the RSFSR was, I repeat, merely a Union republic within the USSR, no more. By a wicked irony of political fate, Yeltsin, by furthering the demolition of the USSR, undermined the legal basis of his own authority. In the new independent state (according to the rules of international law) the competence of all the old state institutions of the RSFSR (the president, the Congress, the Supreme Soviet, the Constitutional Court) have been depreciated and become legally worthless. And there have been no new elections as yet, and, consequently, there is in the Russian Federation no legitimately elected president; there is merely an official invested with the trust of the people for the provisional discharge of his obligations. And from the legal viewpoint it can in no way be a question of new presidential elections but of the first elections of a president of Russia (as, equally, of the parliament, the local authorities, judges, and so forth). Second, it is maintained that Yeltsin promised to put himself up for reelection as a concession to the now nonexistent Supreme Soviet. There is no one now, as it were, before whom the highly significant words are to be kept. But this is at least unconvincing. For they were not simply words but strict legal instruments--Yeltsin's Decree 1400 and others, still not rescinded, it would appear, which speak of new presidential elections within an established time frame. But even were they only words, they were uttered repeatedly, publicly, openly, before the entire people. In a word, a given word, and whereas forswearing such is barely excusable even in everyday life, in political life it is absolutely intolerable. Third, as our Palmerston or Talleyrand, Mr. Kozyrev, elegantly put it, Russia is in dire need of continuity of power, and for this reason "allow the president to complete his appointed term." It sounds impressive, does it not? But the president's laudatory desire to see the business through to a conclusion in no way cancels out the simple fact that he does not possess for this the requisite legal capacity! The mandate he obtained from the people in 1991 was appreciably different in terms of the extent of rights and authority, and, essentially, in terms of its nature also. I also would like a president endeavoring, albeit none too successfully, to break with the communist past to remain at the helm of power until 1996. But, as distinct from Kozyrev, I am clearly aware that the president of a Union republic cannot have the full legal value that would make him a genuine guarantor of the constitutional system of a fully sovereign state. Having adopted the deplorable decision, Yeltsin made, from all viewpoints, a mistake. Having broken his word, he is once again giving the opposition splendid opportunities for playing the card of the president's unscrupulousness and political hypocrisy. The slogan "Send Yeltsin Packing!" gains a second wind under these conditions. The political forces and the electorate who are the president's staunch supporters are put in an awkward position here. Unpleasant legal repercussions are possible also. The president now, in the absence of parliament, has become the most important source of law. But even after the commencement of the activity of the Federal Assembly, Yeltsin will remain, with the scheduled arrangement of political power, a most important constitutional figure. And his incomplete legal sufficiency connected with the limited nature of the presidential mandate he obtained could in the near future compel a reconsideration of many decisions of the executive as being legally deficient. We would recall also that Yeltsin primordially entrusted his fate, as it were, to the Federal Assembly. Having emphatically changed his own opinion, the president--knowingly or otherwise--has humiliated the future parliament and the representative authority altogether. I do not believe that this will be that easily forgotten. No less deplorable is another mistake of the president's also. He announced that he had altered his decision before the Constitution, with the idea of a far-advanced presidential republic, had been approved at a referendum. It transpires that Yeltsin was deciding for the people, as it were, the kind of reform of the constitutional arrangement that Russia needs. In declaring that he would remain in office until 1996, Yeltsin was making it clearly understood (to whom, to the people?) that there could be in Russia only a presidential republic. For heaven's sake, did not the republics in Spain and Cambodia become constitutional monarchies before our eyes? And have we not known in contemporary history instances of the conversion of presidential into parliamentary republics? And, finally, the last point. Following the disbandment of the USSR, multiple voids have, as of January 1992, arisen in Russia in the legal respect. Neither the president nor parliament nor the judicial authorities have possessed full and exhaustive legal sufficiency. Since the April referendum the president undoubtedly became more legally sufficient than parliament, but still not to the extent necessary for a democratic state based on the rule of law. But circumstances could now change abruptly to his disadvantage. Parliament, elected for the first time in an independent Russia, even if in accordance with deficient rules, will inevitably be perceived in the world as an institution of fuller legal value than a president who was sworn in under other constitutional and legal conditions of an order of magnitude lower. Both the president's friends and enemies have known how at the right time to emphasize this impressive difference repeatedly. Of course, the president and his circle had ostensibly reasonable motives for the refusal to put himself up for election again. It is possible that some people consider themselves to be the winners, who, as we all know, are not judged. Being the victor, you can, naturally, permit yourself to go back on your word and dictate new conditions of the political game. It cannot be ruled out that the president sincerely believes in his mission of transformer of Russia and wants to use these years to arrange in the country a better life as he sees it. In addition, Yeltsin, who is not required to delve into legal niceties, may not sense the frailty of his legal position and because of this does not see the practical point of new elections. The president's circle, however, is seriously afraid of the possibility of his not being reelected. This would mean for many of them the end of their political careers, for some, an unpleasant investigation of financial matters, and not just financial. Political persecution and revenge are possible also. No one wants to take such a risk under today's supercharged political conditions. These people may be understood at the human level, but in the highest interests of Russia it is, for all that, impossible to agree with them. The damage to the extremely imperfect Russian statehood and to the genuine, not selfishly misinterpreted, ideas of democracy and a state based on the rule of law would be all too palpable. Strictly speaking, the damage to the president also would be inordinate. Politics is a dirty, immoral business, no question. But within certain bounds, which even the Chinese emperor could not transgress without loss of face. Nor could any ruler thinking if only to a negligible extent about his good name--no, not about his own even but that of his country and people. It is as necessary as the air he breathes (this is self-evident) to the person who considers himself the unifier and spokesman for the spirit of the nation, society, and the state. I believe that the president will damage himself greatly if he goes back on his promise to put himself up for election again. Words under some conditions count for a very great deal, but only when they are not at variance with deeds. "Word and deed!" Russians exclaimed in the old days, wishing to call the attention of the highest authorities to important state interests. I believe that this should be an inner requirement of all statesmen declaring themselves genuine spokesmen for the people's needs. And the president should, undoubtedly, stand in the front row of these people.
