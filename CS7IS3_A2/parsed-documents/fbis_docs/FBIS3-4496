The third plenary session of the provincial discipline inspection commission held second meeting on the afternoon of 25 March. Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, gave a speech, entitled: "Submit Ourselves to and Serve the Overall Situation of the Whole's Party's Work and Conduct Anticorruption Struggle in a Sustained, In-Depth, and More Effective Manner. Provincial Leaders, including Shao Qihui, Zhou Wenhua, Ma Guoliang, Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Li Qinglin, and Yu Jingchang attended the meeting. Sun Weiben pointed out: Constantly and deeply fighting corruption is a strategic policy decision made by the party Central Committee after correctly appraising the previous stage of work, the further demand of deepening reform and accelerating development, the important guarantee for political and social stability, and the current strong desire and demand of cadres inside and outside the party. To this end, our party and government leading comrades at all levels must be soberly minded in this aspect. Sun Weiben pointed out: This year the general demand of our province's anticorruption work is to comprehensively fulfill the three central tasks, to consolidate the achievement, and to carry it out in an in-depth and more effective way. To consolidate achievements means that we must grasp the anticorruption work which we started last year until good results are achieved; places which have achieved good results in this aspect should continue to improve their work. To pay attention to in-depth work means that we must resolutely straighten out and handle the problems which have been discovered and step up efforts to formulate and improve the relevant management regulations and preventive measures. To pay attention to effective results means that we must sum up and popularize the experiences and lessons gained in the previous stage of work and improve and strengthen work measures in an effort to achieve greater achievements. Sun Weiben said: The current anticorruption struggle must be carried out in the course of accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. The work of fighting corruption and promoting honesty must be combined with the implementation of the major reform measures. In addition to providing conditions and a guarantee for the implementation of the four reform tasks through anticorruption struggle, we should also fundamentally check the appearance of corrupt phenomena by deepening reform and building systems so as to achieve results in bringing about a temporary solution and in getting at the root of the problem. Sun Weiben stressed: Taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both is a strategic principle and leadership method which our party has persistently upheld. According to the past experiences and lessons, the phenomenon of being tough with one hand and soft with the other hand will easily occur when the reform and economic work tasks are arduous. This year more reform measures will be issued, the reform strength will be strong, and risks will appear. Under such circumstance, we should all the more persist in taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both, and should strengthen leadership over the anticorruption struggle. Therefore, we should continue to implement the responsibility system in anticorruption work, strengthen supervision, inspection, and work guidance, and earnestly support discipline inspection and procuratorial organs to exercise their duties. Provincial leaders, including Li Genshen, Xie Yong, Sun Kuiwen, Zhou Tienong, Yang Zhihai, and Ma Shuji, comrades of the leading group for building party style and administrative honesty of the provincial party committee, and principal responsible comrades of various provincial-level departments also attended the meeting.
