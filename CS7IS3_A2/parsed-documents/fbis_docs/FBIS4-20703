Therefore, based on the results of one of the Science and Technology Agency's projects aimed at researching basic nuclear materials, construction commenced in fiscal 1990 on a distributed materials database called the ``Data Freeway'' that would be capable of being mutually utilized by all participating research organs. Basic nuclear materials research is being carried out by large numbers of research organs, each specializing in a particular branch or field of this research. For this reason, the Data Freeway will serve as a network system interconnecting various databases constructed by individual research organs and enabling all participating nuclear materials research organs to make mutual use of these databases taking the proprietary rights and timeliness of results and advanced specialization into consideration. The development of the Data Freeway system is the joint responsibility of the National Research Institute for Metals (NRIM), the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) and the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC), who are striving to construct the fundamental portions of this system by fiscal 1994.[.sup]1-3)[/] Once completed, this system should efficiently promote nuclear materials selection and materials development. 1. Current State of the Data Freeway 1.1 System Configuration In order to achieve maximum system performance, and to ensure smooth operability and sufficient compatibility, NRIM, JAERI and PNC all opted for the same hardware and software. The hardware used by each of the research organs consists of Unix-based electronic workstations (EWS), two gigabytes or more of storage capacity, hard disks, and communications control equipment. And the various research organs are interconnected with one another via a network comprised of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Corporations 9,600 bps DDX-P and/or net 64 public telephone lines. They are using the TCP/IP communications protocol. Software being used includes a relational database management system (RDBMS) called ORACLE, programs for processing images and displaying image data and programs for processing diagram preparation operations, and the programming languages C and Fortran, which can support science and technology calculation libraries (ASL). In addition to networks and databases, the Data Freeway system is also steadily being outfitted with data-manipulating scientific environments. The Data Freeway network links together the research organs shown in Figure 1. By the end of fiscal 1993, users should be able to access the data they require from NRIM, JAERI, PNC, the National Research Lab of Metrology (NRLM), the Ship Research Institute (SRI) and the Japan Information Center of Science and Technology (JICST) without consciously being aware of where (which of these organizations) the data is actually coming from. Figure 1. Data Freeway Network 1.2 System Functions Figure 2 provides an overview of the functions being built into the Data Freeway system. The system features functions for retrieving data from the database, applications software for processing data, electronic mail/bulletin boards and even a function that explains in summary form how the system works. To access these various functions, all the user has to do is click a button. The operation screens feature pull-down menus operated by clicking the button on an electronic mouse input device; keyboard input is held to the absolute minimum. This makes the Data Freeway system so easy to operate that even a novice can use it with no problems. Figure 2. System Overview 1.3 Database Overview The Data Freeway database has been developed so that the data structure can rationally describe the irradiation, high temperature and environmental parameters peculiar to nuclear materials, beginning with the manufacturing process, chemical composition, basic materials and mechanical properties for Fe-Ni alloy or ceramic materials. As shown in Figure 3, the database possesses a three-tiered structure, comprising six table categories, including raw materials, specimen processing, test conditions and test results, roughly 60 types of data tables, including raw material data, manufacturing methods, testing devices and test atmosphere, and approximately 800 data elements, included among which are the name of the raw materials manufacturers, irradiation dose, corrosion volume and impact values. Figure 3. Database Structure The smallest unit or element in the basic data set is a single specimen. That is, data is stored in the database so that a user can search backward from the results of testing a single specimen to find out about raw materials, manufacturing methods and test methods. Therefore, when abnormalities turn up in retrieved data, the user can check the chemical composition of the raw materials, the manufacturing history and test methods, etc. that produced the abnormal test results, determine the cause(s) of the abnormality and then decide whether or not to use the data. The Data Freeway database is also capable of handling structural photographs in the form of image data. 1.4 Data Retrieval Data retrieval is carried out in accordance with the operational flow indicated in Figure 2 above. The user makes use of a multi-window display to pull down menus from the various windows and select the functions he wants to use, then implements these functions with the simple click of a button on the mouse. The mechanism used to retrieve required data from the databases maintained by NRIM, JAERI and PNC is described below. First, a sub-window is displayed outlining the data elements necessary to retrieve data on materials by speciality field, and the user selects from this sub-window the field he requires. Next, the Data Freeway system automatically checks to determine which of the three research organs maintains data related to the specified field, and connects the network up with that organizations database system. To perform this check, the Data Freeway system queries its data table address management file which specifies the address of that data. The system must therefore add to its address management tables for each participating research organ the names of tables containing data newly added to those respective organs' databases. And when the system doesn't connect up to the organ maintaining the specified data, it displays a message to that effect. The following method is employed to retrieve data using the data retrieval operation screen. Ordinarily, a structured query language (SQL) has to be used to retrieve data stored in a relational database. However, novices can not use an SQL without prior knowledge of the database system. This is because SQL retrieval operations require the user to specify the particular database tables and data elements in which the desired data is stored, and to execute instructions that describe one-by-one the search conditions. And to do this, the user has to be familiar with the names of the tables and data elements that comprise the database, as well as with the descriptive syntax used to define search conditions. The developers of the Data Freeway system therefore put together an operation screen capable of automatically executing SQL. They also added a function to the system that would enable the user to change the units of retrieved data to data units of his liking. Figure 4 (not reproduced) shows the retrieval screen and search results display screen displayed with a data retrieval operation carried out using this operation screen. These screens are examples of a retrieval operation that sought the results (presence or absence of rupture, test load, time to rupture, reduction in area, etc.) of creep tests conducted at temperatures in excess of 1,000ï¿½C on materials containing the character string ``Inco'' in their name. The search results display screen is equipped with functions for maintaining those results in a file for processing and print out. As explained above, the Data Freeway system makes it easy for users to retrieve and analyze information they need. And the operation screen, operation instructions screen, etc. are in both Japanese and English to enable foreigners to use the system as well. 1.5 Data Contents Table 1 shows the types and amounts of data currently stored in the Data Freeway system. The system presently contains a total of 6,600 data sets, the combined total of information in NRIM, JAERI and PNC databases. The contents of the Data Freeway relational database system are scheduled to be expanded to include data on numerous new types of materials such as ceramic-metal compounds, slope function materials and functional structure materials.[.sup]3)[/] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Examples of Results of Inter-organizational Cooperation NRIM, JAERI and PNC are pushing ahead with the development of the Data Freeway system for their mutual utilization. As a means of reviewing methods of mutual utilization, the developers took up as a sample problem helium embrittlement in type 316 steel. Type 316 steel is used in the fuel cladding pipes of high-speed breeder reactors and in the blanket structural material of nuclear fusion reactors, but since the helium generated as a result of neutron irradiation is closely linked with void swelling and embrittlement in type 316 steel, users must determine its material degradation behavior. NRIM, JAERI and PNC therefore brought together their respective data on the high temperature tensile and creep characteristics of type 316 steel to see what advantages could be gained by this type of inter-organizational cooperation.[.sup]1)[/] 2.1 Data Integration Figure 5 provides an example of the data brought together by NRIM, JAERI and PNC, showing the total elongation data at various temperatures held by each organization on irradiated type 316 steel, and the results of integrating that data. The data held by NRIM shows the total elongation of type 316 steel hypothetically for use as blanket structural material for a fusion reactor following experiments in which it was irradiated with helium ions at relatively high temperatures. JAERI's data shows the results of similar tests at a wide range of temperatures. And PNC's data focuses primarily on the total elongation of type 316 steel at temperatures ranging between 700-800K in line with its targeting of high-speed breeder reactors. Integrating all three organizations' data produced the graph labeled ``Irradiated Material'' in the bottom right corner of Figure 5. Figure 5. Broad Range of Material Characteristics Revealed By integrating their respective data in this way, the three Data Freeway developers were able to determine the elongation temperature dependency of type 316 steel across a broad range of temperatures extending from room temperature to 1,000K. And they also learned that whereas the lowest value indicated for elongation temperature dependency in non-irradiated materials was around 700K, that for irradiated material exhibited an unvaried decline in proportion to increases in test temperatures. Therefore, integration of the respective research organizations' data made it possible to grasp a broad range of material characteristics. 2.2 Using Analysis Tools The Data Freeway system offers a variety of applications programs to enable more useful analysis of data retrieved from the databases that make up this system. And the developers are outfitting the system so that users can execute these applications programs at the click of a mouse button. For example, the system makes available programs for preparing diagrams, processing images, estimating the volume of helium generated during neutron irradiation and the induced radioactivity in various types of reactors. These tools are used to complement and grasp the overall image of the data retrieved.[.sup]1-3)[/] 3. Future Plans 3.1 Facilitation of Data Input In constructing databases, using the minimum amount of labor to store data of the highest reliability is always a problem. JAERI has therefore taken the lead in promoting the development of a data input support system. The design concept calls for an input support system that will make it possible to input the data contained in the reports of material test results prepared by researchers at the same time they are writing them. That is, the data input support system will create a corresponding relationship between data to be stored and the data elements in the database, and then guide data input in line with data entry procedures. This will require the construction of common databases that contain synonyms, units and material standards. In line with this, the Data Freeway developers are planning to promote data collection for common databases. 3.2 Network Expansion The Data Freeway system uses a telecommunication network to make possible the automatic retrieval of required data from among that data stored in participating research organizations' databases. Participating research organs will naturally strive to increase the amounts of data contained in their respective databases and to perfect the tools used to analyze this data. However, it will also be essential to expand the network interconnecting participating research organs and to increase the number of organizations participating in the system. 4. Conclusions In order to expand the Data Freeway system and enhance the databases available therein, the operators of this system will have to ensure data reliability, maintain an abundance of data, expand utilization and deal adequately with users' needs. The development of the Data Freeway system should be promoted bearing these points constantly in mind. We are looking forward to the further enhancement and growth of the Data Freeway in line with its scheduled expansion in fiscal 1993 to include NRLM, SRI and JICST. And once the development of the Data Freeway is complete, we can also expect to see the ripple effect expand the areas of expertise covered therein beyond the realm of nuclear materials alone to include other energy fields, outerspace development, and the manufacturing and information industries. We intend to continue to promote the development of the Data Freeway in future to make it a widely used common asset capable of contributing to the efforts of researchers in fields other than nuclear energy as well.
