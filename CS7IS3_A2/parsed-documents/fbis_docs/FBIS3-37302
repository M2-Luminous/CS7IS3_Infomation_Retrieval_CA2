It underlines that there was a recently emerged tendency for internationalization of the Karabakh conflict, meaning involvement of foreign advisors and recruits and utilization of foreign weaponry by Azerbaijan. The Armenian Foreign Ministry believes that the dangerous deterioration of the situation in the region was due to the Azerbaijani official strategic policy aimed at resolving the conflict in Karabakh by force of weapons. The document says that Baku rejected the peaceful proposals put forward by the CSCE Minsk group welcomed by Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh, the mediating activities of Russia and the appeal of the International Olympic Committee's president to establish a temporary cease-fire for the period of the winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer. The Armenian Foreign Ministry regretted that the international community had not blamed Azerbaijan for this.
