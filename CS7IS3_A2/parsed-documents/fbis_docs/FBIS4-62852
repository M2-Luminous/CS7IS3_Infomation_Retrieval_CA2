The legislators from the Russian Federation made their last stop on the way from Beijing to Moscow at the Shenzhen free economic zone in the south of the country, which is always being called "the experimental laboratory of the Chinese reforms and openness policy." The visit, which took place at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, has been successful, Ivan Rybkin said before leaving Shenzhen by air. In an interview with this ITAR-TASS correspondent he noted that careful familiarization with the situation in China would certainly help Russians be more attentive to the experience of their great neighbor and "to adjust their approach to reforms." For example, he explained, Russia is interested in the working of the Shenzhen legislators, who have been granted by the "superior body" -- the country's parliament -- the right to draw up and pass acts of legislation independently. Of no less importance is the legislation itself, thanks to which China has, in the reform years, attracted to the zone foreign investment to the tune of $14,400 million. This topic, as well as bilateral economic cooperation, will be discussed during the forthcoming visit to China by Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Federation Government. In the words of Ivan Rybkin, an understanding has been reached with the leadership of the free economic zone concerning a visit by a group of Russian members of parliament to Shenzhen through the channels of "people's diplomacy," and also on sending some of our industrialists, business people, and bankers there "to enhance their qualifications." "There is no doubt about the desire of the Chinese side to develop mutually profitable cooperation with Russia, and the friendliness of the officials who received us was sincere," he assured journalists.
