FBIS3-47024 "dreas005_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-005 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Jan 1994 North Korea Kim Yong-sam Denounced for Suppression of Labor SK0701045294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0444 GMT 7 Jan 94 SK0701045294 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique recently threatened that the "labour-management disputes" will be "dealt with toughly by law" and "emergency arbitration power" will be invoked against workers' strikes even though they are legal. Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says the labour movement in South Korea can by no means be a target of fascist suppression. Noting that the workers' strikes to push their demands including wage hike are the exercise of their elementary rights for existence, the analyst continues: When he was active in an opposition party, Kim Yong-sam stood by the side of the workers, joining them in strikes at their request. After climbing to power, however, he executed a swift volte-face and began brandishing the sword at the workers. How can such a person be called a human being? Not much penetration is needed to see why the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is threatening the workers with "tough counteraction" and "emergency arbitration power" from the beginning of the year. It is foreseen that the workers' struggle against the puppet regime's flunkeyist and treacherous economic policy and anti-popular labour policy will grow fiercer in South Korea this year. Upset by this, the fascist clique schemes to check their struggle by threatening them at the point of the bayonet from the beginning of the year. Bayonet-brandishing, however, is not almighty. A MINJU CHOSON analyst says the more desperate the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique get in suppressing the people with bayonets, the faster it will precipitate the doom of the "civilian" regime.
