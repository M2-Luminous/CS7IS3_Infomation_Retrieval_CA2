The analyst says: The Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said on March 4 that "it is important to wrest a more drastic step" from the DPRK, which has accepted an inspection of the International Atomic Energy Agency, while Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said Japan would continue "strongly urging" the DPRK to totally withdraw its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, alleging that the DPRK's nuclear development is a factor of instability in the Asia-Pacific region." Their remarks came at a time when an inspection for the continuity of safeguards is under way according to the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. This is aimed at throwing a snag in the way of the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks and hampering the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. In this way, the Japanese reactionary forces are attempting to find a justification for legally pushing ahead with Japan's nuclear armament which has reached a danger line, charging the DPRK with the "nuclear issue." We can never remain an onlooker to the nuclear armament sought by the Japanese reactionaries. If Japan were armed with nuclear weapons, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, even though it were realised, would be meaningless and the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization, too, would be reduced to a sheet of paper. The Japanese reactionaries must promptly stop their sinister political plot and ponder over the matter.
