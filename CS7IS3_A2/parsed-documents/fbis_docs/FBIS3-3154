He said that since June last year, the financial system has rectified the financial order, observed strict financial discipline, promoted financial reform, strengthened macroregulation and control, resolutely implemented "simple rules to be observed by all concerned," and swiftly changed the chaotic situation in the financial order. At the same time, new conditions and problems arising in the national economy have been promptly studied and analyzed, appropriately taking stock of macroregulation and control according to the demand of "blocking the evil door and opening the right door" and resolutely and decisively adjusting the capital flow structure. The rate of availability of promised capital for key state projects exceeded 99 percent, no IOU's were issued in purchasing farm products, the shortage of circulation funds for key production enterprises and foreign trade enterprises was basically alleviated, and excessively big fluctuations in the development of the national economy were avoided effectively. At the same time, the trend of excessive currency issuance was checked, the total volume of currency issued for the whole year was basically controlled within fixed macroregulation and control targets, the market exchange rate was stable, and the state's foreign exchange reserves had increased. Zhu Rongji said that the State Council has decided that the financial work principle this year is to continue to rectify the financial order, steadily promote financial reform, strictly control the total volume of credit, and earnestly strengthen supervision over finance. He raised three new demands for the broad masses of cadres and staff in the financial system. First, they must strictly control the total volume and scale of credit this year. "The crux of controlling the total volume of credit is to control loans for investment in fixed assets released by banks at various levels. Beginning this year, the scale of loans for infrastructure and basic industrial projects are all being handed over to the newly founded State Development Bank to make centralized arrangements. Other banks will not be allowed to squeeze other investment projects. In particular, for projects which involve the total volume of loans being used as circulation funds, projects which have not received approval to begin construction, and projects which break up the whole into parts, no loans will be given, no single project will get a loan, and not a single yuan will be given in excess. Whoever uses undue means to exceed the total volume of credit will be held responsible." Second, after business of a policy nature are separated from them, various specialized banks should transform themselves into commercial banks, and they must courageously try things out and take exploratory steps this year. "Taking into consideration that state-owned enterprises are in the process of changing their operational mechanisms this time, specialized banks should first practice management of a proportionate balance between assets and liabilities under a controlled amount of lending, gradually build self-restraint and risk-taking mechanisms, and be able to make their own decisions regarding operations and take responsibility for gains and losses. To coordinate with the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law, preparatory funds allocated for tackling outstanding amounts this year should be properly used." Third, branches of the People's Bank of China at various levels must earnestly change their functions and duties and should play a dominant role in financial supervision in the localities. "Branches and offices at various levels must really spend most of their energy on stabilizing the currency and financial supervision. At present, particular attention must be paid to stopping the emerging tendency of random fund-raising activities; whenever such activities exist, they must be banned. Only when random loans and random fund-raising activities are brought under control can the scale of investment in fixed assets be brought under control and can inflationary pressures be alleviated." This year will witness the increased weight of financial reform, and it is necessary to boldly carry out reform on the one hand, and, on the other hand, avoid a chaotic financial order like that which emerged last year; therefore, how far Zhu Rongji's financial work principles can be realized is a problem which deserves only cautious optimism.
