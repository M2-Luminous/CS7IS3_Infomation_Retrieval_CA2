K. Sheng and Y. C. Tsai] [Text] Asuncion, April 28 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] and Paraguay Thursday [28 April] entered into an agreement eliminating the need for citizens in one country working in the other to pay income tax to both governments. Augustin Liu, Taiwan's ambassador to Paraguay, and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner inked the accord, which aims to promote reciprocal investments between the two countries. Under the agreement, which will be effective for five years, nationals of each country working in the other country can still be taxed by both governments on income earned from interest, royalties, and property transactions. This is the third such pact Taiwan has signed. It earlier entered into similar agreements with Singapore and South Africa. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Ramirez expressed the hope that Taiwan investors would make more investments in Paraguay, thereby introducing advanced technology into the South American country. Ambassador Liu said the agreement will help boost investment ties between the two countries, which is the Taipei Government's established policy.
