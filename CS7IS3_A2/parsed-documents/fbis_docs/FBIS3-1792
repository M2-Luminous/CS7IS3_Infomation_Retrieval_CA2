Li said this in a meeting with some foreign entrepreneurs at Zhongnanhai, seat of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee and the State Council. He noted that the trend of China's reform, which cannot be reversed, is correct, adding that the gate of China can only be more and more open. To accelerate China's reform, he said, the key point is to speed up the training of specialists. Li met respectively council members of the international council of J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, John Hunter, president of the Coca Cola Company International sector, Chung Se-yong, chairman of Hyundai Business Group, Robert Hormats, vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs, and Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach. Li told the visitors, who attended the 40th session of the J.P. Morgan Council held here from February 27-28, that China requires more advanced specialists having a good command both of modern business management and specialized knowledge. The vice-premier indicated that China is willing to strengthen international cooperation in the field of personnel training through various channels. George Shultz, chairman of the Morgan International Council, Lee Kuan Yew, member of the council and senior minister of Singapore, and former British foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, took part in the meeting. When meeting with Hunter, Li said that China's market for beverages has a great potential, hoping that the Coca Cola Company would further its cooperation with the Chinese beverage industry through China National Light Industry Council, and develop new drinks by using Chinese resources. As the largest international beverage company, Coca-Cola has set up 12 bottling factories with a total investment of some 70 million U.S. dollars, since the first factory of the kind was built in Beijing in 1981. Hunter said that the purpose of his current visit is to promote the cooperation between his company and the beverage industry of China.
