But Kagame said the 5,500-strong force suggested by UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali "to stop the genocide" was too big. The United Nations was strongly condemned by aid agencies for withdrawing all but 400 of its 2,500 soldiers days after the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a suspicious April 6 plane crash hurled Rwanda into an epic bloodbath that has already cost 200,000 lives. "We've done most of the work of the UN," Kagame told reporters in Byumba, northern Rwanda, after talks with UN force commander General Romeo Dallaire and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso. Kagame said he had assured them that the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) would not attack a humanitarian force but stressed that it was too late for military intervention "because the genocide has already been carried out." The United Nations, he said, had left "the Rwandese facing the tragedy." "We have no problem with a force that will come to assist us on a humanitarian basis," Kagame said. "We are only opposed to an intervention force." The RPF had earlier warned that it would treat a foreign intervention force as hostile invaders. Kagame also renewed his call for the resignation of UN envoy to Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, who has denied accusations by the rebels that he supported the government. As dawn rose over Kigali's hills, covered in banana trees, rebel and army gunners pounded each other's positions with intense artillery and mortar barrages for about two hours, a UN military spokesman said. The fighting then subsided, but small arms fire persisted in different areas throughout the day, the spokesman said. The proposed UN force would escort food and medical convoys to more than a million people displaced by the fighting and risking famine. Up to half a million Rwandans have fled to neighbouring countries. The UN force would also establish a neutral zone around Kigali airport, a vital lifeline if mass starvation is to be averted. Fighting between rebels and government soldiers encamped around the airport has repeatedly prevented relief flights landing. The new UN troops would be allowed to fire back if attacked. But they would not be empowered to shoot first in offensive "peacemaking" operations as they did in Somalia. [passage omitted] UN military officials have described the current fighting in Kigali as the rebels' final onslaught against battered government forces, many of whose soldiers have deserted. But General Dallaire told reporters that the battle for Kigali could last a long time. "It would be unreasonable to say that the Rwanda Patriotic Front will take Kigali in three days," he said, explaining that "both armies are small" and neither side could sustain a big offensive. The rebels brought in munitions and evacuated casualties in small trucks or "on their backs," he said. Some army soldiers fought well, though the government has lost the military initiative to the rebels, who now control two-thirds of the country, he said.
