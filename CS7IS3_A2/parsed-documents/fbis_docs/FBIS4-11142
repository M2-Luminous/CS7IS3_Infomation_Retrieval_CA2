The proposals are now centered on 1 July, but a lot of people inside and outside the government consider it possible that the new currency will be put into circulation on 1 August. As the government imposed upon itself the regulation that the public be informed of the launching of the new currency with 35 days' notice, the first decisive date is 27 April. The government thus has 10 days to evaluate whether the conditions exist for putting the real into circulation on 1 June. That is very little time for resolving the many problems the economic plan is facing. There are at least two basic conditions to be met before the real can be implemented. The first condition is that the economy should be operating in URV's (real value units). The second is that inflation in real cruzeiros remain stable, that is, the same inflation rate should be repeated for a reasonable period of time, such as, for example, three months. The first condition is far from being accomplished. The (energy, fuel, and telephone, etc.) utility rates will not be converted into URV's until the end of May, according to Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero. These utility rates are important factors in the production costs of any merchandise. It will thus not be possible to conduct internal economic activity in URV's until after the end of May, when the utility rate values are known. Aside from this, industry and commerce do not yet conduct their business in URV's. Commerce, which paid industries in installments and collected cash from consumers, obtained financial profits by putting the money received on the financial market. This profit will disappear with the URV. In turn the industries, knowing they would receive their money in 30 or 60 days, added to their prices the financial cost of the expected inflation. In sales in URV's this financial cost will have to be eliminated -- that is, industries should give discounts. It is just that commerce wants a discount that is large enough to compensate for the losses it will suffer with the end of the market gains. And the industries, of course, want to give the smallest discount possible. As long as this is not defined, the economy will not be stabilized. The other condition for the implementation of the real -- the stabilization of inflation -- can only be evaluated in June. During the first month of the URV, that is, in March, inflation in real cruzeiros varied between 41.9 percent and 45.7 percent. This means that inflation in URV's was 43.5 percent. It is possible that this index will be repeated this month, indicating there is no new inflation. In May, however, the prices of winter clothes may make the inflation rate surpass 43.5 percent, and then it will be necessary to wait for the inflation of June to verify whether other factors are fueling inflation. The government is not in a hurry. The rules for issuing the real are not even defined, according to statements by Central Bank President Pedro Malan. He denies that the government is being delayed. "We are not lost," he said, "we are benefiting from the time the debate is taking."
