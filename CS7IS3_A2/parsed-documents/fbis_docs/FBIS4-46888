Usoskin, doctor of economic sciences, professor, and sector head of the Institute of World Economics and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMEMO RAN): "Should We `Introduce' a Federal Reserve System?"] [Text] The idea of the need to reform the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) on the model of the United States Federal Reserve System [FRS] has been more and more often expressed in the press recently. The latest evidence of this is an article in FINANSOVYE IZVESTIYA (No. 13, 31 March-6 April 1994), entitled "The Central Bank Is Ready To Establish a Federal Reserve System". Alluding to an interview with the responsible representative of the CBR, the article says that "there is no basic difference between an FRS and the CBR," that "they fulfill identical functions," that "the CBR is ready to start conversion to an FRS and the consolidation of regional administrations, reducing their number from 80 to 20," etc. If one compares these statements with other publications on this subject, it is essentially a question of "dispersing the power" of the CBR and turning over to the regional level the solutions to a number of important problems of credit policy and other functions. The details of the plan being developed so far have not become public property and one can speak only of the general idea. It is a fact that the CBR in its present form has found itself little adaptable to fulfilling the role of coordinator and regulator of the processes in the monetary-credit sphere, under the conditions of the difficult transition of the country's economy to the market rails. With the departure from the planned-administrative model, control over monetary circulation and the movement of credit flows was serious weakened. No reliable and integral mechanism of financial management has been created yet, although individual elements of it are already springing up. Reform of the CBR is necessary and inevitable. Quite a different matter is--how and in what forms to carry out the reform of the CBR. Should we take "as the basis" the structure and functioning mechanism of a "strong" foreign central bank, such as, for example, the United States FRS, or should we attempt, on the basis of a careful study of world experience, to create our own model of a CBR, oriented toward our potentials, economic conditions and the degree of development of the financial infrastructure and market relations? The second path is naturally preferable, although it requires more time and a large amount of preparatory work. The readiness with which our officials, without sufficiently thorough study of the problem and broad public discussion of it, are inclined toward the first variant is therefore puzzling. Incidentally, this is not the only attempt to blindly "introduce" the FRS model on Russian soil, on the basis of superficial analogies. As far back as the period of preparing the Law on the USSR State Bank in 1990, the idea of a transition to a federal structure for the CBR (with the republic offices of Gosbank converted to "central banks of the republics") was discussed by the developers as some sort of a stunt to preserve the Union's unified banking system. This approach, stimulated by current political considerations and not based on a realistic model of the functioning of the institutions being created, is not very effective and fraught with serious losses. For example, the "Western" methods of credit regulation transferred from the 1990 USSR law to Russian banking legislation were not efficiently activated because the appropriate conditions were lacking. They say that "conversion to an FRS" can be accomplished rapidly and painlessly, that the functions of central banks throughout the world are identical. In reality, central banks everywhere control the emission of money, make monetary settlements on a nationwide scale, grant loans to commercial banks, fulfill the role of financial agent for the Treasury, etc. Here the analogy ends, however, for all central banks solve the problems facing them in a different way. The relations of these banks with the government and Ministry of Finance are different, the set of administrative and market methods of regulation when following a credit policy are different, and the scale and forms of refinancing for commercial banks are different, and this is true not only for the CBR of Russia and the FRS of the United States, but also for the FRS, on the one hand, and the central banks of France, Japan, Germany and Great Britain, on the other. Our legislators are primarily attracted to the FRS by its external facade--a decentralized structure that at first glance resembles Russia with its vast territory, existence of large regions with organized national economic complexes, and difficulty in central administration under the conditions of abolishing the iron discipline inherent in the administrative-bureaucratic model. Hence the natural impulse to copy the already prepared form. One must, however, take into consideration the fact that the external decentralization of the central bank structure of the United States is the result of the long historical development of the banking sector in that country and the complex interweaving of political and socioeconomic factors. In the course of many years, a situation of conflict formed around the creation of the central bank in the United States. Small banks saw in the central bank an instrument of the dictates of the large banking associations. Industrialists wanted to establish a bank independent of government pressure and to ensure the stability of the monetary unit. Agrarians, however, defended the idea of decentralizing functions and inexpensive loans. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is the model for the political commission. Its authors idea was that the "decentralizing principle" of the FRS was ensured by establishing 12 regional federal banks (one in each of the districts created for this purpose). These banks, in the aggregate, formed something like a "collective" central bank; their capital belonged to the member-banks of the FRS of the given district, and they represented local interests when a credit policy was formed. Centralization was achieved through the head agency of the system--the Federal Reserve Administration (subsequently--the FRS Board of Governors) in Washington. The members of the Board are appointed by the President of the United States with congressional approval. The law specifies a number of measures here to lessen FRS dependence on the executive power (the members of the Board are appointed for long terms--up to 14 years, the FRS has independent sources of income, etc.). In the years that followed, the system underwent considerable evolution, the main result of which consisted of the narrowing of the autonomy of the federal banks and the establishment of a centralizing principle. Externally, however, the system preserved the features of a decentralized institution and its basic principles, incorporated in the Federal Reserve Act, were not changed. The FRS differs considerably from other Western central banks, not only in its unique "three-stage" structure (Board of Governors-Federal Reserve Banks-FRS member-banks), but also in many functional features. It retains greater independence from the Treasury than many West European central banks, which are often directly subordinate to the force of edicts from the Ministry of Finance. The basic specific characteristic, however, is related to the system of regulating the monetary mass and interest rates. In contrast to the countries of Western Europe, where administrative (selective) methods of control, in the form of credit quotas and limits for individual sectors, groups of banks and major credit institutions are quite widespread, the FRS relies on the "classic triad" of common methods of credit regulation and rarely resorts to selective control. In this case, operations on the open market--buying and selling of state securities by the central bank--serve as the main means of operational regulation of the money market situation. The basis of controlling credit flows is the system of minimum compulsory reserves, to which the FRS is bound by its title and which arose long before a central bank was established in the United States. As far back as the 1830's, legislation introduced a compulsory metal reserve that was to guarantee the bank notes being issued at that time by commercial banks. Later on, a multistage system of reserve guarantee of liability for deposits was formed, in which the provincial banks kept reserves for accounts in municipal banks, and these in turn--in banks of the main financial centers. This system led to a concentration of the demand for payment funds in large credit institutions, which in turn exacerbated the course of the financial crises. With the formation of the FRS, the function of reserve-keeping was transferred to the regional federal banks, but in this case the guarantee-insurance role of the reserves moved to the background. Minimum reserves became the basis of the mechanism of centralized regulation of the credit market. It should be particularly emphasized that, in contrast to other countries, the reserve accounts of the banks in the FRS are not a "depository" of money taken out of economic circulation; for these accounts the turnover passes through interbank transactions connected with the collection of checks and other payment documents through FRS, interbank loans, securities operations, etc. These are "live," actively functioning accounts, in which some banks temporarily accumulate excess funds, and others incur a deficit (as compared with the compulsory norm). The banks are constantly forced to correct their reserve position, and the FRS, through the reserves, can affect the volume and structure of banking operations and, consequently, the credit market situation. The actual process of correction is very complicated, and it is hard to predict its ultimate outcome. The FRS does not try to determine how the credit infusions into the economy will be used. It tries to influence the general financial climate in the country, at the level of interest rates. Of the three "classic" instruments--the normative of compulsory reserves, the rediscount rate, operations on the open market--the latter, as was stated above, becomes the basic support. The norms for compulsory reserves in the United States have rarely and very carefully been changed in the last few years (for example, with respect to time and Eurodollar deposits, the last change was in December 1990, and for transaction accounts--in December 1992). It is felt that this is too drastic a means and is unsuitable for everyday corrections. As for the crediting of the central banks at the rediscount rate, the federal reserve banks carry out these operations selectively and in minimal amounts, acting as a "creditor in the last instance." In May 1993, unpaid FRS loans to commercial banks constituted $128 million, that is, a little over three-hundredths of a percent of the total sum of the FRS assets on this date. On the other hand, the FRS carries out operations in buying and selling large consignments of state securities regularly, sometimes daily. The FRS management regards them as a means, more suited to American credit market conditions, of influencing business conditions--soft, easily dispensed and quickly producing an effect. The New York Federal Reserve Bank conducts operations on the open market through authorized dealers. The total of the operations varies within a range of from $1 million to $1 billion and more per day. The Federal Open Market Committee, which includes all seven managing members of the Board and the presidents of five federal banks (the latter periodically rotated), gives the instructions for carrying out the operations. It is also the main body for operative control of the credit policy. Even a very fragmentary and incomplete survey of the special features of the FRS shows that it is a central bank system that does not conform to Russian conditions. The system of regulating monetary circulation and credit is based on an "active" mechanism of reserve coverage. At the same time, refinancing of commercial banks at the central bank rate is reduced to the minimum, and the main role is given to operations with state bonds, which in turn are based on the ramified secondary market of these bonds and a powerful dealer network. Such a market does not and will not exist in Russia in the foreseeable future, and the refinancing mechanism, in the form of a system of centralized loans, occupies the leading place in the CBR arsenal for the time being. "Conversion to an FRS" would entail a lot of large and small problems, which are sometimes difficult to foresee. Let us take an apparently technical question such as the arrangement of federal districts and determination of their size. In the United States, this question had an underlying political factor, since the goal in creating the FRS was to prevent a concentration of economic power in any financial grouping. The size of the district territory and the number of banks on this territory were regarded as the "balancing" factor. In the northeast, where the most powerful banks were located, several small reserve districts were created. For example, the New York Federal District includes the state of New York and part of the state of New Jersey. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York accounts for 25 percent of all the FRS assets. In the midwest and western United States, where there were no large banking associations, the federal reserve districts cover vast territories. Let us now picture Russia's "federal reserve system." What principle of federal division should be chosen, if one takes into consideration the tremendous differences in the development of the banking structures, the plurality of Federation constituents, the "war of sovereignties," etc.? Consequently, when selecting a model for the CBR in Russia, we must make use of the wealth of experience accumulated by the world banking fellowship. At the same time, however, there must be thorough and painstaking preliminary work, a comparison of the experience of different countries and a selection of the forms that are promising under the specific conditions of the transitional period. In any case, when solving such a crucial problem, we must not be guided by superficial analogies and the political considerations of the moment.
