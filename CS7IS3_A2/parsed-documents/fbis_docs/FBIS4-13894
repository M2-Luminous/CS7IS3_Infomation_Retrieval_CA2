In an article published in BABIL today, Amir al-Hilu cast doubt about the ability of the United States to continue its hegemony as the sole international power that wants to control the world's resources after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the socialist bloc states. He emphasized that the world cannot be run by a single power because this conflicts with the interests of countries, whether on their national level, or the level of the international blocs. He said the negative impact of the U.S. policy of hegemony and undisputed domination has become clear. This policy, which depends on the logic of force, has a negative impact on the interests of other countries, as demonstrated in its domination of the United Nations and the Security Council and the adoption of resolutions that serve the U.S. politician without any considerations for the interests of other countries. This has happened and is happening now, represented in its insistence on maintaining the siege against Iraq, the threat to use force against Japan, and the intervention in Somali affairs. The article emphasized that political and economic developments in today's world, which the U.S. Administration said will be stable and secure under the umbrella of its new world order, reflect the falseness of these claims because it is a chaotic world in which wars and military interventions prevail.
