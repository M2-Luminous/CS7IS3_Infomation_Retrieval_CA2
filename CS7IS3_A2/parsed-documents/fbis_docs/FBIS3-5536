His speech did express those thoughts. He began by stating that "those of us responsible for government at this historic juncture have a duty to gorge ahead on the path of change and it is demanded of us that we remake politics, the economy and our society no matter how great the difficulties." He also stressed, "I intend to take up the challenge of new reforms, not forgetting the essential spirit of this reform government." This issue consciousness is only to be expected considering the circumstances surrounding Japan both domestically and abroad. In international terms, the Clinton administration has revived the Super 301 provision and has staked out a hard-line position in preparing for trade negotiations. Domestically, taking action to spur economic recovery and reform taxation are urgent matters. To handle these issues, many people are calling for deregulations and administrative reform. Moreover, from the standpoint of the nature of the present recession and international relations, there is a pressing need to review the economic and social structures that had been praised as the Japanese system's strengths. Hosokawa was undoubtedly correct when he said in his speech, "in laying the foundations for a new era of development, it is imperative that we demolish those systems and practices that are no longer compatible with the needs of the times" and that, "we must promote reform that will be conductive to business restructuring and the creation and development of new industries." However, the biggest issue is whether the government can create a structure for implementation that will match the points noted by the prime minister. The ruling coalition's cohesiveness has been visibly shaken with the recent, sudden announcement of a plan to introduce a national welfare tax and the rumblings about a cabinet reshuffle. In more direct terms, there are doubts as to whether the administration structure will follow the dictates of government when there is trouble stirring between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary, who serves as the main coordinator of the cabinet. Implementing deregulation or administrative reform will not be possible unless the political sector cuts into the sacred ground of the bureaucracy. As a result of circumstances surrounding the compilation of the government budget from the closing days of the past year, it became apparent that the coalition parties, which are still trying to become accustomed to controlling the government, had to eventually rely on the bureaucratic apparatus led by the Finance Ministry. There is even the sense that the bureaucrats' power in formulating policy has increased since the Liberal Democratic party controlled government. In his speech, the prime minister said: "It is impossible for the administration alone to stand unchanged when there are such major changes taking place in politics and the economy. Seeking to establish an administration that is fair, transparent, and, above all, has the people's interest as its first priority, we must initiate radical surgery on our administrative structures and systems." From his experience as a committee chairman in the Third Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform, Hosokawa should be well-aware of the strong opposition posed by bureaucrats. If his resolve ends up being nothing more than mere words, he will have problems maintaining control over the government. One hopeful sign for the Hosokawa cabinet is the still-high support it receives from the people. In a poll conducted by ASAHI SHIMBUN at the end of February, the Hosokawa Cabinet was supported by 57 percent of respondents. While the figure was slightly lower than the 60 percent recorded in a poll in December 1993, the support rate did not seem to be affected by the recent fiascoes involving the national welfare tax and the cabinet reshuffle. Now is the time for Hosokawa to return to his initial intent and not take advantage of the people's magnanimity. We would like to further indicate two points that are important to carry out drastic deregulation and administrative reform. The first is to attempt to solidify public opinion by clarifying concrete goals and aims for the policy. Economic and administrative reform covers a wide range of topics. While Hosokawa promised to "promote visible administrative reform," it is important to explain in easily understandable terms what results are being targeted and how the actual changes will be made. The second point is the need to clarify the overall plan and procedures and to create a structure that will implement the process in a step-by-step manner. The government plans to submit a bill in the current Diet session to establish a committee on administrative reform that will promote supervision of the administration and public disclosure of information. That institution should be designed to bring together the power of politics and public opinion.
