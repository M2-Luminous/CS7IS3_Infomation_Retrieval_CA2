FR941205-0-00085 FR941205-0-00024 6. First, on our own motion, we clarify the carriage requirements of a system with more than 36 activated channels. The 1992 Cable Act states that systems with more than 36 channels must carry the signal of all NCE stations requesting carriage, with one exception: systems with more than 36 channels are not required to carry an additional local NCE station if the programming of such station substantially duplicates the programming of a qualified local NCE station already being carried. It has come to our attention that §76.56(a)(1)(iii) of the Commission's rules as adopted in the Report and Order has been interpreted by some cable operators to require that only three stations need be carried. However, with respect to systems with more than 36 channels, we clarify that the reference to the number three is a minimum, not a maximum number. A system with more than 36 channels must carry all NCE stations requesting carriage, but is not required to carry more than three NCE stations if the additional station substantially duplicates the signal of NCE stations already carried by the system. Section 76.56(a)(1)(iii) is being revised accordingly. 7. Second, we emphasize that the requirement in Section 615(c) to continue carriage of stations carried as of March 29, 1990 applies only to qualified local NCE television stations and does not apply to a non-local NCE television station which was being imported as of that date. A cable system which was carrying a non-local NCE station in excess of its mandatory carriage requirements is permitted to drop that station, subject to giving appropriate notice. However, if a cable system which would be required to import a NCE signal pursuant to Section 615 (b)(3)(B) or (b)(2)(B) was importing a non-local qualified NCE station on March 29, 1990, the system is required to continue carriage of such station. Prior carriage of the non-local NCE station generally indicates that a good quality signal is received at the cable system's headend. In addition, where the cable system voluntarily had been importing such signal prior to March 29, 1990, the continued carriage of such station will not result in additional copyright liability for the cable system. In the event a local NCE station subsequently becomes qualified, the cable operator may drop the distant signal (subject to notification requirements) and substitute the qualified local NCE station. Section 76.56(a)(5) is being revised accordingly. 8. Although the Act generally does not require copyright liability to be paid by a cable operator for the carriage of local NCE station signal added after March 29, 1990, in the case of importation, the non-local NCE station has neither must-carry nor retransmission rights. We do not believe it appropriate for a non-local NCE station which is being imported to be required to reimburse the cable operator for copyright costs. The 1992 Cable Act specifically provides that a cable system can recover such costs as part of the basic service tier rate, and we believe that this is the appropriate manner for dealing with such costs. B. Carriage of Local Commercial Television Stations 1. General Signal Carriage Requirements. 9. Small System Exception. Section 614(a) requires carriage of local commercial television stations and qualified low power television stations. Section 614(b) establishes the number of signals which must be carried by cable systems based on their channel capacity. In particular, it provides that a cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels must carry the signals of at least three local commercial television stations. Such a system is exempt from any requirements of Section 614, however, if it serves 300 or fewer subscribers, as long as it does not delete from carriage the signal of any broadcast television station. In the Report and Order, the Commission concluded that, under this exception, a system must not delete any station it carried on October 5, 1992. 10. Although the language of the text accurately reflects this intention, the Community Antenna Television Association (``CATA'') points out that the related rule is misleading because it implies that the system must have 300 or fewer subscribers as of October 5, 1992. We are revising §76.56(b)(1) of our rules to reflect that, at any time that a cable system with 12 or fewer activated channels serves 300 or fewer subscribers, it is exempt from the mandatory carriage requirements under Section 614, as long as it does not delete any signal of a broadcast television station which was carried on that system on October 5, 1992. 11. Definition of Local Commercial Television Station. Section 614(h)(1)(A) defines a local commercial television station for the purpose of the must-carry rules as ``any full power television broadcast station, other than a qualified noncommercial television station within the meaning of Section 615(l)(1), licensed and operating on a channel regularly assigned to its community by the Commission that, with respect to a particular cable system, is within the same television market as the cable system.'' In the Report and Order, we inadvertently defined local commercial television station as ``any full power commercial television station *␣*␣*'', which had the unintended effect of excluding non-qualified noncommercial stations from the definition. A non-qualified NCE station is any NCE station which does not meet the qualification criteria established in Section 615(g). Such a station is not entitled to must-carry rights under that section. We believe that the definition of local commercial television station contained in the 1992 Cable Act clearly includes non-qualified NCE stations; the definition includes all stations other than ``qualified NCE stations.'' Consistent with the language of the 1992 Cable Act, we determine that NCE stations which are not ``qualified'' NCE stations for must-carry purposes may assert must-carry rights under Section 614 within their local market, just like any other broadcast station. 3 3 We interpret local commercial television station to include stations operating under a valid construction permit.
