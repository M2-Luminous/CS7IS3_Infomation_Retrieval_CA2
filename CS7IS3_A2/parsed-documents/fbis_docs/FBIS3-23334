Irish police believe his killers were former associates settling a long-standing feud. McGlinchey, who as head of the Irish National Liberation Army was nicknamed Mad Dog, was shot ten times at point-blank range by three men as he used a telephone box next to a hospital. The killing happened on Thursday night at Drogheda, Co Louth. McGlinchey had been driving home with his 18-year-old son, also called Dominic, who watched from the car as the gunmen shot his father in the knees, stomach, chest, neck and head. Detectives said yesterday that McGlinchey, who was believed to be setting up a new republican paramilitary organisation, was shot by former members of the INLA who had been stalking his movements in Drogheda. Intelligence sources said McGlinchey's killers were believed to have been tortured by him when he tried to root out INLA informers ten years ago. McGlinchey knew he was living under the threat of an attack and escaped a murder attempt last June. The new attack came three months after his release from the republic's Portlaoise prison after a ten-year sentence. A police source said yesterday: "This time they were making no mistake. It was a real professional killing. The men who killed him were settling an old score." The same group is believed to have been responsible for the murder of McGlinchey's wife, Mary, who was shot at pointblank range in front of her two sons in 1987. McGlinchey, who was devastated by her murder, vowed to root out the killers. But it appears that they reached him first. A detective said yesterday: "He lived by the gun and died by the gun. He was not a man who was going to die in his bed of old age." Local people described the scene behind the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. Kevin O'Rourke said: "I heard a couple of bangs and someone screaming. I went out and could see this man lying on the ground with a hole in his chest and head. Blood was everywhere." Margaret Black, 47, who lives near by, said: "I knelt down beside him and felt a weak pulse in his neck. I knew he was on the way out. He then said to me, 'Jesus, help me, Mary.'" This was apparently a reference to his wife. After forensic scientists from dublin examined the area, McGlinchey's body was moved to the hospital mortuary early yesterday for a post-mortem examination. McGlinchey will be buried next week next to his wife in Bellaghy, Co Londonderry.
