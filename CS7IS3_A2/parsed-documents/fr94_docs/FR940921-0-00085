FR940921-0-00085 FR940921-0-00016 30. Section 86.096&hyph;11 of subpart A is amended by revising the section heading, by revising paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(2)(ii) and (c), redesignating paragraph (b)(4) as paragraph (b)(5) and revising it, and adding new paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (b)(4), to read as follows: §86.096&hyph;11 Emission standards for 1996 and later model year diesel heavy-duty engines and vehicles. (a)*␣*␣* (1)(i) Hydrocarbons (for diesel engines fueled with either petroleum-fuel or liquefied petroleum gas). 1.3 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.48 gram per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. * * * * * (iii) Nonmethane hydrocarbons (for natural gas-fueled diesel engines). 1.2 grams per brake horsepower-hour (0.45 gram per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. (2)*␣*␣* (ii) 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle (methanol-, natural gas-, and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel only). * * * * * (b)*␣*␣* (4) Evaporative emissions from 1996 and later model year heavy-duty vehicles equipped with natural gas-fueled or liquefied petroleum gas-fueled heavy-duty engines shall not exceed the following standards. The standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles. (i) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 14,000 pounds for the full three-diurnal test sequence described in §86.1230&hyph;96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 3.0 grams per test. (ii) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than 14,000 pounds for the full three-diurnal test sequence described in §86.1230&hyph;96, diurnal plus hot soak measurements: 4.0 grams per test. (5)(i) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of up to 26,000 pounds, the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section refer to a composite sample of evaporative emissions collected under the conditions set forth in subpart M of this part and measured in accordance with those procedures. (ii) For vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating greater than 26,000 pounds, the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(4)(ii) of this section refer to the manufacturer's engineering design evaluation using good engineering practice (a statement of which is required in §86.091&hyph;23(b)(4)(ii)). (c) No crankcase emissions shall be discharged into the ambient atmosphere from any new 1996 or later model year methanol-fueled diesel, or any naturally-aspirated diesel heavy-duty engine. For petroleum-, natural gas-, and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines only, this provision does not apply to engines using turbochargers, pumps, blowers, or superchargers for air induction. * * * * *
