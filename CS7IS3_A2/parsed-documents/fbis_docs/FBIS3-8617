Churkin said he had discussed Sunday in Sarajevo with Bosnian Moslem Leader Alija Izetbegovic the possibility of taking advantage of the recent positive developments between Moslems and Croats to apply the experience also between Moslems and Serbs to get them to disengage their forces and perhaps place heavy weapons under control, FRANCE PRESSE reports. Serbs, Moslems and Croats have been waging a bitter war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina since April 1992. With U.S. mediation, Bosnian Moslems and Croats signed an agreement in Washington earlier this month on forming a federation in Bosnia- Herzegovina which would later form a confederation with neighbouring Croatia, also a former Yugoslav republic. The possibility of the third warring party joining the federation remains open. After signing the Washington agreement, Croat and Moslem military representatives ratified it Saturday in Split and signed a document on the formation of a joint army. According to a UPI report, after a one-hour talk with Izetbegovic, Churkin pointed out that Sarajevo must remain undivided. Bosnian Serbs and Moslems, he said, must put aside their political differences and start working on restoring electricity, running water, transportation and other services in Sarajevo. According to Churkin, the federation between Bosnian Croats and Moslems is not necessarily contrary to Bosnian Serb interests and could be a useful element of the overall settlement of the Bosnian conflict. According to FRANCE PRESSE, Churkin is due to meet Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic later in the day.
