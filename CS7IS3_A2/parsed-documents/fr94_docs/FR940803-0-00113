FR940803-0-00113 FR940803-0-00040 D. To clarify the definition of the ``c'' factor in 40 CFR 600.513(a)(2) the current language which reads: ``c=1.300×10 ^3 for the 1986 and later model years'' is amended to read: ``c=gas guzzler adjustment factor = 1.300×10 ^3 for the 1986 and later model years''. E. To correct the references for calculating the ``FE'' and ``a g '' terms in CFR 40 600.513&hyph;91(a)(2) each occurrence of the phrase ``in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of the section'' is replaced by the phrase: ``in accordance with §600.207''. F. In its Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles and New Motor Vehicle Engines: Gaseous and Particulate Emission Regulations for 1994 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicles and Light-Duty Trucks; Final Rule (also known as Tier 1), 56 FR 25724 (June 5, 1991), EPA adopted the term ``heavy light duty truck'' (HLDT) for light duty trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 6000 lbs. Pursuant to the definition of test weight in section 216(8) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, the Tier I rule also adopted the term ``adjusted loaded vehicle weight'' (ALVW) (the average of curb weight and GVWR) and required that ALVW be used for emission testing of HLDTs for one-half the fleet in model year 1996 and the entire fleet beginning in model year 1997. Prior to this time, emissions test weights were determined based on loaded vehicle weight (LVW), which is curb weight plus 300 lbs., and this weight was also used for fuel economy testing conducted at the same time. ALVW is higher than LVW. Testing at a higher weight would negatively impact fuel economy values. Increasing the test weight would therefore have the practical effect of increasing the stringency of the fuel economy standard, which might be addressed by adjusting the standard. Under the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (MVICSA), 15 U.S.C. 2003(d)(1), fuel economy is to be measured in accordance with testing procedures established by the EPA Administrator by rule. Also under that provision, fuel economy tests are, to the extent practicable, to be conducted in conjunction with emissions tests under the Clean Air Act. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) is responsible for setting the fuel economy standards. 15 U.S.C. 2002(b). In its Light Truck Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Year 1995; Proposed Rule, 57 FR 61377 (December 24, 1992), NHTSA requested comments on the issue of test weight for light trucks over 6000 lbs. GVWR in the context of setting the MY 1995&hyph;97 light truck fuel economy standards. GM, Ford, Chrysler, American Automobile Manufacturers Association and Rover Group all supported the continuation of fuel economy testing at LVW. In its Light Truck Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Year 1995; Final Rule, 58 FR 18019 (April 7, 1993), NHTSA quoted extensively from a January 7, 1993 letter from EPA to industry trade associations explaining that EPA would consider comments during the NHTSA rulemaking regarding the proper test weight for fuel economy testing when developing EPA guidance or rulemaking on this subject. The EPA letter was further quoted as stating that EPA plans to defer to NHTSA's policy decisions on issues such as the competitiveness effects of the alternatives and would follow NHTSA's resolution of the CAFE issue with conforming amendments to its regulations or policy. NHTSA then concluded in that notice that the preferable solution would be to retain LVW as the test weight for fuel economy purposes. This conclusion was based, in part, on comments expressing the concern that changing the test weight for only a portion of the light truck fleet would cause consumer confusion and affect the competitiveness of manufacturers with a higher proportion of sales of the heavier light trucks. NHTSA finally quoted from a March 4, 1993 letter from EPA to NHTSA that if NHTSA decided against adjusting the CAFE standard to reflect a higher test weight, EPA would undertake ``the regulatory and guidance revisions needed to allow dual testing.'' Accordingly, EPA is today promulgating a technical amendment to provide that while ALVW is required for emission testing of HLDTs, it is not required for fuel economy testing of such vehicles. Manufacturers may, instead, continue to use LVW as the test weight for fuel economy testing. Vehicle manufacturers, however, have had and continue to have the option of performing simultaneous emissions and fuel economy testing using heavier test weights (ALVW in this case). Therefore, for HLDTs, separate testing using ALVW for emissions and LVW for fuel economy, or combined emissions and fuel economy testing using ALVW is acceptable. However, fuel economy adjustments will not be made to account for potentially lower fuel economy values due to the use of the heavier test weight (ALVW). This technical amendment changes 40 CFR 600.006&hyph;89 (b)(1) (i) and (h) and footnote 4 to the table found at 40 CFR 86.129&hyph;94(a) to specify the test weight basis for heavy light duty trucks. The Agency also reiterates that despite the change in the HLDT emission test weight basis, vehicle manufacturers must still assure that fuel economy data vehicles comply with the applicable exhaust emission standards. The Administrator reserves the right to require the manufacturer to either test using ALVW or submit the vehicle for testing by the Administrator for emission standards compliance using ALVW for HLDTs. This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes that this technical amendment is noncontroversial and has been subject to notice and comment through NHTSA's rulemaking and EPA's January 7, 1993 letter referring interested parties to the NHTSA proposed rule and advising that EPA would consider comments from that rulemaking. For these reasons, EPA believes that a prior EPA proposal is unnecessary under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Nevertheless, the public is advised that this action will be effective October 3, 1994, unless notice is received by September 2, 1994, that someone wished to submit adverse or critical comments. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent documents will be published. One document, which will be published before the effective date, will withdraw the final action. Another document will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this proposed approval. EPA will consider all comments received by September 2, 1994. Consequently, this procedure still allows the opportunity for public comment under the Administrative Procedure Act, but provides an expedited procedure for final action where a rulemaking is not expected to be controversial, public comment has already been received by another federal agency, and no adverse comment is expected.
