It would seem that the rosy-cheeked "reformers" have done everything to crush these people, to take away from them their last strength and their will to live. But those people, thrice deceived, lied to, and robbed, nevertheless have preserved their hope of getting a better share. They stood in line waiting to sign the petitions, in order to support the idea of creating a new party -- the Russian Poor People's Party (PBR). That idea had been proposed by Nikolay Ayvazyan, leader of the Charity movement. What tasks does the PBR intend to resolve? First of all, the task of uniting the efforts of all Russians, two-thirds of whom have proven to be at the poverty line, in their search for the quickest way out of the economic and political crisis. Secondly, the task of defending the interests of the indigent and socially unprotected segments of the population -- the workers, peasants, and intellectuals -- who have become the victims of the woeful experimenters. Thirdly, the task of consolidating the poor people to carry out planned and persistent actions to defend their legal rights and freedoms, and to strive for the development and implementation of a state program to protect the indigent. And, obviously, to render specific psychological and material assistance to those who need it. The first PBR congress will be held in May. But already it has been announced that the payment of dues is not mandatory. If this is the case, how will the party exist? In response to this question, N. Ayvazyan answered, "There are a rather large number of businessmen who are ready to take on the expense of maintaining homes for disabled people, boarding homes for the elderly, hospitals, and orphanages, to supply food products, and give grants in aid for the downtrodden. But the exorbitant taxes that are going basically into the maintenance of the apparatus of officials who are no less rapacious than racketeers are killing people's business initiative and stifling production. The PBR will take actions to reduce and even abolish the taxes for those entrepreneurs who take close to their hearts the misfortunes of their compatriots and who engage dynamically in philanthropy. People like this are already expressing today the desire to provide material support to the Poor People's Party and even to enter its ranks. And I understand them well: with the situations that exist, they have the threat of ruination hanging over their heads constantly. Where should they be, if not in the PBR?" The Poor People's Party is not planning to seize the power or carry out a revolution. But if it truly becomes a mass organization, figures both in the legislative and the executive structures will be forced to listen attentively to it. The creation of low-level PBR cells has begun.
