FR940418-2-00121 FR940418-2-00072 OCC also is amending its Rule 705, which describes the forms of margin that may be deposited for cross-margin obligations, to provide that common stock may be deposited as margin only if mutually acceptable to OCC and the participating commodities clearing organization (``CCO''). Such deposits, if acceptable, will be valued in accordance with the cross-margining agreement between OCC and the participating CCO. This amendment is intended to preserve OCC's and the participating CCO's rights to determine whether they will accept common stock as a form of margin collateral, and it provides a means for OCC and the participating CCO to value these deposits without requiring OCC to further amend Rule 705. B. OCC's Valued Securities Program In 1975, OCC proposed to institute a program through which it would accept deposits of common stocks as clearing margin collateral (``valued securities program'') under Rule 604(d). 12 The novelty of the proposed program, however, resulted in extensive regulatory review by the staffs of the FRB and the Commission. As a result of this review process, several significant changes were made to the OCC valued securities program that the Commission subsequently approved in 1982. 13 In 1983, the Commission approved a proposal whereby OCC was authorized to expand the types of stocks that clearing members could deposit to meet their clearing margin obligations. 14 Pursuant to that amendment, however, clearing members are permitted to deposit only stocks that have a market value of greater than $10 a share and either (1) are traded on a national securities exchange that has last sale reports collected and disseminated pursuant to a consolidated transaction reporting plan or (2) are traded in the over-the-counter market and are designated as a National Market System security. 15 The proposal also established that such deposits are to be valued at the lesser of the maximum loan value prescribed by the FRB in Regulation U for margin stocks or 70% of current market value. 16 12 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 11820 (November 12, 1975), 40 FR 53637 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;75&hyph;05] (notice of proposed rule change). This submission did not receive Commission approval. In fact, because of the filing's potential conflicts with FRB regulations, including Regulation T [12 CFR 220], OCC requested that File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;75&hyph;05 be withdrawn and submitted File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;82&hyph;11 in its place. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18994 (August 20, 1982), 47 FR 37731 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;82&hyph;11] (order approving File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;82&hyph;11 and withdrawing File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;75&hyph;05). 13 The valued securities program, as approved, amended OCC Rule 604 to allow OCC clearing members to meet their clearing margin obligations with OCC by depositing common stocks underlying listed options that were not being used as cover for existing options positions. Previously, Rule 604 had limited clearing margin collateral to cash, government securities, or letters of credit. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18994 (August 20, 1982), 47 FR 37731 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;82&hyph;11] (order approving File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;82&hyph;11 and withdrawing File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;75&hyph;05). 14 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20558 (January 13, 1984), 49 FR 2183 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;83&hyph;17]. 15 Id . 16 Pursuant to Regulation U, the maximum loan value for margin stocks was then and currently is 50% of current market value. In 1991, the Commission authorized OCC to add preferred stock and corporate debt to the valued securities program. 17 To be eligible for deposit as clearing margin collateral, preferred stock has to meet the same eligibility standards as those previously approved for common stocks. Corporate bonds are required to be listed on a national securities exchange, to not be in default, and to have a current market value that is readily determinable on a daily basis. The maximum loan value for preferred stocks and corporate debt also was set at 50% of current market value. 18 17 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29576 (August 16, 1991), 56 FR 41873 [File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;88&hyph;03] (order approving proposed rule change). 18 Regulation U defines ``margin stock'' to include convertible debt and thus subjects convertible debt to the 50% loan value limitation. [12 CFR 221.2.(h)(4) and 221.8.(a)]. Regulation U does not include non-convertible debt in its definition of margin stock, and therefore, non-convertible debt is subject to ``good faith loan value.'' [12 CFR 221.8.(b)]. Nevertheless, the OCC filing proposing the inclusion of preferred stock and corporate debt, File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;88&hyph;03, included OCC's I&P .09 to Rule 604 which prescribes that the 50% loan value limitation applies to all debt and equity securities involved in the valued securities program.
