Contrary to widespread reports, he said, no agreement has so far been reached with Minsk on how to run the budget systems, at what rate to exchange Belarusian currency units into rubles and how to readjust the two countries' prices. The main sticking point is prices and fuel prices in particular, President of the National Bank of Belarus Stanislav Bogdankevich told Interfax. He spoke of waiting until Moscow announced uniform prices if the money union agreement was implemented. Kazmin says his ministry is insisting that currencies be stabilized and the gap in their purchasing power narrowed stage by stage as part of implementing the multi-lateral agreement on the new ruble zone. At present, 1 ruble fetches 4.51 Belarusian coupons at the money market in Minsk. The Russian official also said that the movement towards bridging the gap between currency rates must pass through market mechanisms which will take some time to achieve. On financing Belarus' budget deficit, Kazmin called for forming a consolidated joint budget and establishing a special order to grant credits to Minsk to cover its budget deficit. However, Minsk opposes this on the grounds it is an encroachment on its sovereignty, preferring the deficit to be qualified as the country's internal debt instead. The ministry doubts that a final agreement on unifying the monetary systems could be signed later this month despite an earlier announcement. Kazmin says the Russian ministry wants an early but justifiable rapprochement of the two monetary systems and is now considering new proposals from Minsk.
