It has morality and common-sense on its side," begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 21 January in a page-8 editorial. However, the ANC's "good intentions are one thing, mechanisms for successfully implementing them quite another," warns THE STAR. Regarding the ANC's plan to discourage private sector health care, THE STAR believes that "from the ANC's point of view, such restrictions are necessary to achieve equity in health care provision, but they are already being described as having `overtones of socialism.'" BUSINESS DAY ANC Health Plan--"The ANC, like US President Bill Clinton a year ago, will enter government faced with a health service in crisis due to rising costs which are placing health care beyond the means of many people. The draft national health plan published on Wednesday for public debate is an honest attempt to address that crisis," starts an editorial on page 8 of the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 21 January. "Some of its prescriptions, though, are off the mark." Financing the ANC plan "assumes the existing budgets should meet most requirements once savings have been made through the elimination of mismanagement and general inefficiencies which have characterised the apartheid era. This is wishful thinking." "It is naive to think that rationalisation will bring major cost savings." With financing of the plan a given problem, the "main shortcoming is the desire to `discourage' private sector health care." "The test for the ANC is to produce an affordable plan without threatening existing services and standards." Mandela's Violence Accusations Viewed--"There is one glaring flaw in ANC president Nelson Mandela's repeated claim that President FW de Klerk and his government have consciously orchestrated township violence to undermine the ANC's support base," states a second editorial on the same page. "Opinion polls show ANC support has risen steadily in tandem with levels of violence, while NP [National Party] fortunes have declined." "It is easy, as Mandela repeatedly does on this issue, to take cheap shots based on less than rigorous analysis. We could just as easily argue that, to judge by the outcome, Mandela and the ANC orchestrated the violence to improve their own standing at the polls." In conclusion the paper writes that "no one can stop Mandela continuing to make this claim against De Klerk. He has already made it so often that it has become folklore in ANC circles. But it will hardly improve the unifying abilities of the future president of the government of national unity."
