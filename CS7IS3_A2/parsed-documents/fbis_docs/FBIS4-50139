At General Secretary Jiang Zemin's request, Hu Jintao, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, gave an important speech at a meeting today called by the Hunan provincial party committee to mark the occasion. He stressed that all party members and people of all nationalities in the country acknowledge the fact that Comrade Jiao Yulu was a good party member and a good public servant as a county party committee secretary whose good example should be emulated by the vast number of cadres. Hu Jintao said that emulating and fostering Jiao Yulu's spirit is a requirement set for this great era, a call made by people of all nationalities in the country, and a need for building a stronger party and expediting the socialist modernization. The meeting was chaired by Ren Keli, deputy secretary of the Henan provincial party committee. Li Changchun, secretary of the Henan provincial party committee; and Lu Dawei, secretary of the Lankao County party committee, also took the floor at the meeting. On behalf of the CPC, Hu Jintao expressed its profound remembrance of Comrade Jiao Yulu, its sincere sympathy to Comrade Jiao Yulu's family, and its high respects for those Communist Party members, cadres, and other progressive elements who have fostered Jiao Yulu's spirit and distinguished themselves in reforms, opening up, and the modernization drive. Hu Jintao emphatically noted: Comrade Jiao Yulu's life was one in which he dedicated himself entirely to the party's cause and the people's interests. While striving to attain the highest ideal -- communism -- Jiao Yulu also worked earnestly, dedicated himself entirely, strove to explore, served the people wholeheartedly, relied closely on the people, and always linked his heart with those of the people. The brilliant image of an outstanding Communist Party member and cadre, which he created with his personal deeds, has become a majestic monument in the hearts of the people. Over the past three decades, his moving deeds have educated and inspired thousands upon thousands of party members, cadres, and people to move forward, and his great spirit will continue to shine brilliantly in history. Hu Jintao said: Our objective at this stage is to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. The requirement of overall importance for the whole party and the whole nation now is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, expedite development, and maintain stability. Under the new situation, it has become even more necessary for us to uphold the party's goal of serving the people wholeheartedly, inherit and carry forward the party's fine style of forging close ties with the masses and wage arduous struggle, and emulate and foster Jiao Yulu's spirit. Hu Jintao urged the vast number of party members and cadres to do the following: -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and establish the footing based on the current situation, keep the future in mind, and combine efforts to achieve the lofty goal -- communism -- with efforts to achieve socialist modernization; firmly adhere to the party's basic line characterized by "one center, two basic points," heighten their sense of responsibility and sense of mission in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and demonstrate their values while carrying out reforms, opening to the outside world, and proceeding with the modernization drive. -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and serve the people wholeheartedly, forge close ties with them, do everything for them, trust them, and rely on them in everything. While deepening reforms, in particular, we must have a stronger concept of the masses, adhere to the mass line, understand the masses' views, strive to solve the hot issues and problems about which the masses care, properly handle all types of contradictions among the masses, firmly take root among the masses, and serve the people conscientiously. -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and firmly adhere to the party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts, proceed from practical needs in doing everything, speak the truth, do practical work, explore with courage, and work creatively. We must strive to have a firm grip of the essence of Marxism -- namely, emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts -- make painstaking efforts to study and master the scientific view and world outlook and methodology, comprehensively understand and carry out the party's lines and general and specific policies as well as all its reform measures, correctly understand and handle contradictions and problems, guard against one-sidedness and any tendency of doing things in terms of absolutes, combat subjectivism and recklessness, and make constant efforts to improve leadership and proficiency. -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and defy hardship, confront dangers dauntlessly, fight with fortitude, and make painstaking efforts in launching pioneering projects. A great cause needs a great spirit. Waging arduous struggle is both a lofty spirit and a great force needed to cut through thorns and proceed with an exploratory spirit. The spirit of waging arduous struggle is particularly needed when we encounter problems during reform and construction. We must defy hardship and danger, and by no means should we be cowed by them and do nothing. We must make constant efforts to make ourselves stronger and proceed courageously with an exploratory spirit, and by no means should we follow the beaten path and make no efforts to press forward. We must work hard and practice economy and treasure the wealth created by the people, and by no means should we go in for ostentation and extravagance, compete with one another in showing off opulence, and waste our resources. -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and carry out official duties honestly and work diligently for the people. Party and government cadres, especially those in leading positions, must follow Jiao Yulu's example and temper their party spirit, consider the party cause first in doing everything, set strict requirements for themselves, correctly exercise the power given by the people, work hard to provide the people with practical and useful services, and live up to the people's expectations by firmly fighting corruption. Hu Jintao concluded: Party committees at all levels must consider emulating and fostering Jiao Yulu's spirit to be an important task of ideological construction in party and government organs, an important task of intensifying socialist spiritual construction, and an important task of expediting reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. Continual efforts must be made until success has been achieved. While emulating and fostering the spirit of Jiao Yulu, we must also carry out the guidelines laid down by the 14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and safeguard and promote reform, development, and development, which are requirements of overall importance. During this process, we must strive to cultivate and bring up thousands upon thousands of good party members and cadres like Jiao Yulu. Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in setting the example with their personal deeds. They must improve their proficiency in various fields so that they can attain new successes and make even greater contributions during the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics! Present at the meeting were Lu Feng, head of the CPC Central Committee Organization Department; Zeng Qinghong, director of the CPC Central Committee General Office; Zheng Keyang, deputy director of the Central Policy Research Center; and Duan Junyi, Wang Congwu, Liu Jie, Mu Qing, and other veteran comrades as well as persons in charge of relevant central departments.
