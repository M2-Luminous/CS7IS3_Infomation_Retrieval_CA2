How will the unemployment problem of 35 million people in the leading industrial nations be dealt with? The labor ministers conference (employment summit) in Detroit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations agreed to act in concert to create jobs. We appreciate their having set up a plan to create jobs through healthy macroeconomic policies, market opening, and technological innovations, and by rejectiving employment protectionaism, a trap which we tend to fall into because of our eagerness to protect our own employment potential. The employment problem is casting a dark shadow across the economies of leading industrial nations. Although the U.S. economy is on the road to recovery, it is not breaking free from a limiting "growth in joblessness." The recovery of the U.S. economy has begun with rationalization of companies that focused on downsizing the work force. However, the shift to new job areas is not progressing smoothly, and people continue to experience job dissatisfaction brought on by lower real wages. The countries of the European Union (EU) which have double-digit unemployment are burdened by structural unemployment among youthful laborers. With the influx of refugees, the unemployment problem is acute politically. The situation is one of "today's joblessness, tomorrow's lawlessness" (INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE). Although Japan's unemployment rate is low, with adjustments in employment gaining momentum, employment practices put in place since World War II are being undermined. What each leading industrial country is being confronted with by the employment issue is a result of changes in the world economy. In the globalization of the world economy, the countries of Central and South America and Asia have entered on stage as exporting countries by maintaining a manufacturing base with low wages. This is linked to a structure of excess supply and capacity among the leading industrial nations. While the economic development of the emerging countries widens the horizon of world markets, it threatens unemployment among the leading industrial nations. The danger underlying this situation is that we fall into a protectionist trap in order to maintain employment levels and to enhance competitiveness. For that reason we appreciate and value the attitude of the leading industrial nations in cooperation to solve the employment problem. No doubt the key to expanding employment is macro economic policy. At the employment summit, expectations were in particular focused on Japan's expansion of domestic demand. To stimulate domestic demand is Japan's own choice and it is also tied to alleviating the worldwide employment problem. Unfortunately, only the minister of labor attended the employment summit; the minister of finance and minister of international trade and industry decided not to attend. If it was out of fear of pressure on Japan to increase domestic consumption and to open Japan's markets, it was too makeshift an approach. But had it been decided that the employment problem should be left to the responsibility of the Labor Ministry, that would lack in economic common sense. That the employment summit was not quite satisfactory is probably because the cooperative action was left to the responsibility of each individual country. They could have exchanged ideas further on the concept of a "global new deal" to create jobs sponsored by U.S. labor unions. In the post-Cold War world economy, if we are to eliminate the employment crisis as the topic of greatest common interest, we must doggedly hasten to write a global prescription to effect a cure.
