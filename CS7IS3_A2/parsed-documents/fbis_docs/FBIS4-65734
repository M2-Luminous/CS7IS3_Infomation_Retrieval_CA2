Called APTGD, the French acronym for "long-distance precision weapon," this missile -- for so it is -- is, according to Defense Minister Francois Leotard, the only major new program in the 1995-2000 military planning law. Its estimated development cost is 1.65 billion French francs [Fr], of which Fr1.4 billion has been set aside for the period covered by the law. The total cost of the whole program should be at least Fr2 billion. Some 200 missiles will be required. The aim of this APTGD -- with a range of 400 km and accurate to within one meter -- is to strike an enemy and destroy his headquarters, military bases and energy sources without having recourse to nuclear weapons and without harming the civilian population. In short, a kind of French cruise missile, but more modern than the American Tomahawk which had its moment of glory during the Gulf War. The problem is choosing a company to manufacture the missile. While France has one manufacturer of combat aircraft, one tank producer, and one helicopter-maker, it has two missile companies, Aerospatiale and Matra. Each company has very different ideas for the APTGD: Aerospatiale is proposing a conventional (C) version of its ASMP medium-range air-to-ground nuclear missile. The development cost would be around Fr1 billion, and Aerospatiale Missiles boss Jean-Louis Fache is proposing lowering this cost if his company is also given the contract for the ANNG new-generation antiship missile which would also use elements of the ASMP. In his view, the operation would make it possible to lower ASMP-C and ANNG development costs by a global 25 percent. The icing on the cake is that the ASMP missile is equipped with technology currently mastered only by France and Russia -- although U.S. and UK scientists are on the case -- namely the statoreactor. This superturbine means the missile can travel at supersonic speeds. Aerospatiale's reasoning is that even if the missile is detected it will then be too late to try and counter it. Across the board from Aerospatiale is Matra, with its Super-Apache missile. Matra is the current favorite to win the contract and has the backing of current Chief of Staff Admiral Lanxade, Air Force Commander General Lanata, and the influential head of the General Arms Delegation, Henri Conze. The Super-Apache is derived from the original Apache antitrack missile and is a partial offshoot, since the planning law devotes Fr2.6 billion for the purchase of 137 Apaches, just 75 of which are antitrack, the other 62 being the new anti-infrastructure missiles. As a result, the total order remains the same. Lengthened and equipped with a new warhead, the Super-Apache will cost a little more than Fr1 billion to develop, but the unit price of each missile will be lower than that for the ASMP-C. The special feature of the Super-Apache is its stealthiness (specially designed by Matra in a huge "anechoic" chamber), although it flies at subsonic speeds. This low speed must therefore be compensated by radar invisibility. Moreover, according to the defense minister, it will be "more flexible to use and even more precise since it will be adjustable" in flight, unlike its competitor. Even Aerospatiale chiefs realize that they have only a one in three chance of wresting the contract away from Matra. As a result, Aerospatiale managing director Louis Gallois made the sibylline statement: "It is likely that Aerospatiale and Matra will both have a stake in this missile. The distribution already exists for the Apache. If the choice revolves around a supersonic statoreactor program, Matra will doubtless want to participate. Then the question of a redistribution will be raised." Thus, his company seems to be sending a clear message to Matra, perhaps offering a share of the precious ASMP statoreactor technology. Noel Forgeard, head of Matra Defense Espace, could be tempted by this offer. He has no such worries, however. If the Super-Apache wins the day, the industrial distribution of tasks that exist for the Apache will guide the program: Matra will be prime contractor with 12 percent of the contract, while the other 88 percent will go to industrial subcontractors, split 50-50 between Aerospatiale and Matra -- the final share-out will thus be 44 percent and 56 percent respectively. However, the ASNP-C cannot be counted out yet. First, its detractors could be called on to fill new positions. Second, the Americans and the British, with their Casom missile, are starting to reflect on the future of their cruise missiles and are wondering whether it might be time to make the switch to supersonic missiles.
