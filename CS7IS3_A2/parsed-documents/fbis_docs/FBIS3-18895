On the eve of your visit to Tokyo and one month after the signing of the Uruguay Round agreements [as published], is that not a mistake? [Longuet] No. The Twelve felt that this was a decision made by the United States during the interim period separating us from the entry into force of these agreements and, to some extent, that it was the "last" recourse to the Super 301. The Twelve also clearly expressed their great concern and repeated their vigorous opposition to any form of unilateralism used to settle trade disputes. Moreover, the European Commission was given the task of ensuring that the Community's interests are not threatened. [Paoloni] The fact remains that another GATT member, Japan, is itself definitely threatened by unilateral trade sanctions. [Longuet] Mickey Kantor let us know that this decision was made in order to prevent the use of more radical measures, bearing in mind how Congress feels about the conflict between the United States and Japan. In this showdown with the Japanese, the Americans are even asking us if we are prepared to given them a hand. [Paoloni] What is the answer? [Longuet] The Europeans have remained very cautious. They have condemned the unilateralism while at the same time acknowledging that there is a fundamental problem with Japan that will have to be dealt with some day. [Paoloni] Will you take any initiatives in this area during your stay in Tokyo? [Longuet] If I were to suggest an idea, it would be to say to the Japanese that the three large trading powers have an interest in talking together. Experience shows that tete-a-tetes rather quickly turn into conflicts and that it would perhaps be more judicious to move on to a "trilogue." This is all the more true since a bilateral agreement between Japan and the United States may well be useful, but if this agreement is reached to the detriment of other partners, we cannot accept it. Hence the idea of having three of us around the table. There is a roadblock between Washington and Tokyo and both of them need an ally; the Americans so that they do not get themselves condemned for taking excessive unilateral measures and the Japanese so that they can try and make the Americans understand that if there is a trade deficit there are perhaps structural reasons which cannot be solved by coercive measures. [Paoloni] What are the objectives of your visit to Tokyo as far as France is concerned? [Longuet] First of all, I would like to gain information about the economic policy of the Japanese authorities and their objectives; second, about their investment plans in Europe; and lastly, I would like to encourage them to take the path of modest but significant market openings, which we have obtained. Indeed, for six months now, Japan's market has been open to three French products: public works, where GTM [Marseille Heavy Construction Works] won an initial contract; pork; and the purchase of Eurocopter helicopters by Japanese governmental departments. [Paoloni] As regards investments, there must be at least one about which you are primarily concerned. [Longuet] Of course. As a representative of the main shareholder in Bull, I will meet with NEC [Nippon Electronics Corporation], one of the two private shareholders in the French company. However, I will also talk to my interlocutors about other issues of interest to France: the automotive sector, telecommunications, the agrofood sector, etc. Since I will be accompanying the prime minister to China, I am also interested in relations between Japan and China. [Paoloni] With regard to China, how do you view its application to join GATT? [Longuet] These membership negotiations will be a good opportunity to introduce social concerns into relations with that major partner -- concerns which we are not yet in a position to decree and impose within the framework of a world trade organization. Indeed, one cannot imagine Europe supporting this membership if there are no corresponding serious commitments made by China in this area. To some, that might seem to be overly formal, but we must bear in mind the fact that the whole system of international progress advances by small steps. The Uruguay Round took us almost 10 years to complete. Environmental and social concerns are our next objectives in the medium term.
