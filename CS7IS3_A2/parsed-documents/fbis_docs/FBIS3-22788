Zhukeyev told a news conference in Almaty the report was "instigated by forces wishing to introduce additional difficulties in the beginning bilateral negotiations on nuclear arms and a search for mutually acceptable decisions on an equal basis." [sentence as received] "It seems the forces are dissatisfied with the Kazakh suspension of withdrawal of intercontinental ballistic missiles that has begun on Kazakh goodwill. A total of 12 missiles have been withdrawn. Now the work is stopped because of the unsettled problem of compensation for highly-enriched uranium half of which was extracted in Kazakhstan," said the official. The report was published on the eve of a U.S. visit of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. This gives grounds to say the certain forces hope for a possibility of additional international pressure on Kazakhstan in the sphere of nuclear arms. "However, the problem can be settled only through civilized negotiations with due account of interests of all sides. Kazakhstan will not abandon its sovereign rights and interests," said Zhukeyev. The Kazakh stand was taken with understanding by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev during his recent stay in Almaty. As for the IZVESTIYA's concern over the danger-prone situation in nuclear arms storage allegedly created through the fault of Kazakhstan, the state adviser said "nuclear arms are completely safe and well-controlled. Kazakhstan has never hampered the delivery of spares, instruments and equipment for repairs and warranty service of nuclear warheads in contrast to the report's claims. It is also not interested in deteriorated position of Russian servicemen". "We have repeatedly offered the Russian side to begin negotiations and settle all problems on a mutually acceptable basis. Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko timely responded to a letter of his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin on the problem," stressed Zhukeyev. In his words, "the sides can achieve progress on the issue only with due account of their interests".
