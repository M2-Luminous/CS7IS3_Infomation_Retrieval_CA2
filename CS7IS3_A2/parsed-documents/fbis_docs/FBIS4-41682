This was stated today in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Choe Chong-Sun, chief of the external affairs administration of the Committee for Atomic Energy of the DPRK. If anything is required to be replaced in the course of the operation of this equipment, we will consult the IAEA, he pointed out. In addition, two of the agency's inspectors remain on the territory of the republic. They are, it is true, leaving the DPRK tomorrow, but there are two experts coming to replace them on the same day who will continue the inspection work. Representatives of North Korea also remain in Vienna, where the IAEA headquarters are located. In the words of Choe Chong-sun, as before, the DPRK still does not pin especial hopes on cooperation with the IAEA. He estimated the agency's aid to Pyongyang last year at $500,000 in the field of agriculture, medicine and the manufacture of certain goods. The main aim of the reactor in Yongbyob, constructed with the close cooperation of the former USSR, is the development of nuclear energy to supply the requirements for developing the national economy, and the DPRK government is conducting an immutable policy in this respect, he said. This type of graphite reactor is the most rational for the country's conditions, since the country possesses reserves of uranium and graphite. To clear suspicion, the DPRK last year put forward in talks with the United States the idea of replacing the present reactor with a light water reactor. But the main aim is nevertheless not the reactor itself, Choe Chong-sun stressed, but the country's being fully supplied with electricity. In the present conditions we simply cannot help using the existing 5-megawatt reactor for our own needs, he pointed out. Naturally, the USSR provided assistance in the construction of the reactor, but in its successor -- Russia -- there is now a difficult situation, so the republic does not pin especial hopes on it in this matter, he said. I think, Cho'e Cong-sun noted, that we now have hardly any cooperation with Russia in the nuclear field. Nor, he said, is Pyongyang especially counting on other countries in the matter of creating a light water reactor or in the field of nuclear experts. All the work is being carried out by Korean scientists. Overall, the DPRK does not feel any special technological need to replace the reactor and is making such plans only in order to remove from itself the suspicion of secret development of nuclear weapons, he announced. Choe Chong-sun announced that the DPRK has plutonium, which is used for experimental purposes in the radio chemistry laboratory in Yongbyon, but he did not name the existing quantity. Concluding the conversation, he expressed indignation at what in his view is the false coverage of the North Korean nuclear program by the Western mass information media.
