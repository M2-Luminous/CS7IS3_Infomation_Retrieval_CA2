The economy has built up a comprehensive infrastructure for recycling and is thus removing a portion of PVC from critical environmental discussion. PVC is everywhere. It is found as window frame, drainpipe, floor covering, cable sheathing and automobile part, but also as transparent wrap, record, check-cashing card and ring binder. Every year the chemical and plastic processing industries put 1.4 million tons of new PVC in circulation, and approximately 360,000 tons are discarded annually as used products. Producers and processors of PVC praise its resistance, durability, and versatile applicability. Environmentalists, on the other hand, see it as particularly environmentally harmful material: during production the carcinogenic gas vinyl chloride is employed, and PVC also contains toxic materials as softeners, as well as lead and cadmium for UV stabilization. Not least, burning the artifical material can create dioxins and fusanes.The great majority of old PVC is still deposited as trash or burned. But the material is more and more often becoming part of a cycle. Werner Preusker, chief executive of the Bonn working group PVC and Environemnt (AgPU), a coalition of PVC producers, processors and users, private individuals and institutes, emphasizes: "There are functioning recycling possibilities today for the most important PVC products." For windows, floor coverings, pipes and gutters (quantitatively these products make up half of all PVC products) the organization of comprehensive collection systems is in full swing in Germany or has already been completed. The first major plants for reprocessing the used material have started up. Six manufacturers of PVC windows have joined forces in the "Window Recycling Initiative" (FREI), which has reached agreement with numerous window and facade companies about returning used windows. FREI members in turn have committed themselves to using recycled PVC products in the production of new window profiles. The windows are taken for reprocessing to Dekura GmbH in Rahden, in Westphalia. As a rule the recycled material is processed into a profilejnucleus which is surrounded by a layer of new material. Reprocessing is done basically in three steps. After rough shredding and the sorting out of glass splinters, a shredder chops up the frame pieces along with fittings and steel frames. Then magnets and separators separate iron and nonferrous metals out of the mixture, and a socalled heavy goods selector picks out any fragments of glass and metal which remain. The material is then ground into small grains, sifted, extruded at 150 degrees Celsius and finally granulated in pill size. The plant can process 1.5 tons of used windows in an hour. At present it is running a single shift -- not enough material is being supplied for more. Because numerous depositories still accept used windows, according to Dekura's chief executive Horst Detering, "recycling is having the ground cut away under it."Besides FREI, the profile producer VEKA in Sendenhorst also takes back old PVC windows. In the Thuringian town of Behringen, north of Eisenach, VEKA Environmental Technology GmbH has constructed for about DM30 million the "most modern recycling plant in Europe for windows, roller blinds, plates and profile remnants made of PVC." The fully automated plant also uses their different physical properties to separate the window components))glass, metal, rubber and PVC. According to the oprators, 97.5 percent of the material provided can be recovered in reusable quality; only 2.5 percent is unusable waste. Production leader Erich Schulz emphasizes as a particular advantage that soon it will be possible to sort the recycled product into white and colored. For this purpose every grain of PVC is subjected to a flash of light; if it is a white grain, a puff of air from a jet is released by its greater reflectivity and the grain is blown off the conveyor belt, while the colored grains are unaffected and stay where they are. The plant can also reprocess the wooden windows with plastic coating typical of the GDR, socalled plasta)windows. Since the wood is untreated, according to Schulz it is suitable for the manufacture of chip boards. To ensure supplies, VEKA has made agreements with 300 processors of PVC frames to supply dismantled windows, roller blinds and profiles in Behringen. Floor coverings have been collected since 1990 by the working group PVC Bodenbelag Recycling (AgPR) in selected test areas and processed in a plant in Grossefehn in East Frisia. However, it took some time to master the technology. "We needed to find out that you have to proceed quite differently in the reprocessing of used coverings than in the reuse of production residue," reports Hans Juergen Nettelnbreker of the company Huels AG, which developed the procedure for AgPR.The solution they found was socalled cold grinding. The soft PVC is hardened by liquid nitrogen so that it can be reduced to very fine grains with a diameter of 200 micrometers. In this way not only is the quality of the grind improved but a significantly higher throughput is also achieved. The plant's present capacity is 4,000 tons per year according to Nettelnbreker, more is not available at the moment on the used PVC market. The recycled material is reused by the member companies of AgPR as an underlay for floor tiles. After being dismantled last autumn, the plant is now being rebuilt in a more favorable location in Troisdorf near Bonn. A plant is being planned at the same location for the recycling of PVC roof guttering. PVC tubes are collected under the guidance of the Artificial Materials Association (KRV) in Bobb. From the dealers the material goes to four regional centers, where it is sorted and cleaned. The processing is scheduled to begin soon on the premises of the Wavin company in Westeregeln near Magdeburg. A total of approximately 5 percent of PVC waste is now being recycled, in the estimation of Walter Toetsch of the company Huel AG. In the case of pipes and windows, because of their long life, at present there are only minimal quantities of less than one percent. In the case of floor coverings, approximately 20 percent is reprocessed. Recycling stands or falls with the collection system. The purity of the various types and the soiling of the material, and thus ultimately also the quality of the recycled product, are determined by the method of collecting. Since different PVC types are used for different products, the basic rule is: window profiles are made into window profiles, floor coverings are made into floor coverings, and pipes are made into pipes.When collection is carried out by professionals, good results are achieved. Experience has proved, however, that collection in unsupervised containers yields unusable mixtures even when the user is given extensive information.In any case, collection is associated with high costs. That is why recycled products are usually more expensive than raw materials. Toetsch confirms that "the recycling of artificial materials, apart from production wastes, must always be subsidized through the product or through a disposal fee. "At Huels AG, PVC was ground nine times to technical school standards and reformed into products without its mechanical properties deteriorating. But practical recyclability is limited by the structure of the finished products, demands placed on the material during use, and the type of collection. In order to exploit the potential of nine cycles, more than 90 percent of every product generation would have to be recovered and cleanly sorted. "That is unrealistic," Toetsch points out. Even copper, he said, achieves a recycling quota of only 40 percent, which represents 1.7 cycles. Material recycling has its limits for PVC too. Depending on the application, a realistic proportion of recycled material in new products lies between 20 and 30 percent. This gives the upper limit for material processing, as is stressed by AgPU expert Joachim Eckstein. If high reprocessing quotas were demanded, Eckstein calculates that there would unavoidably be large surpluses of recycled material. In his estimation the EU could accumulate a mountain of 50 million tons of used plastics over a period of 10 years. He is firmly convinced that "a return quota of 60 percent with nothing but material recycling cannot possibly be realized." The Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) in Berlin has not yet taken up anjunambiguous position on PVC recycling. It describes its own attitude as "ambivalent"; it is true that recycling reduces wastes, but it does not solve the problems which lie in the material PVC itself. The UBA hopes for clarification from a research project with the title "Ecological Comparison of Products Which Contain Bromides and Chlorides With Those Which Do Not in the Construction Industry." The results should be available by the end of this year.
