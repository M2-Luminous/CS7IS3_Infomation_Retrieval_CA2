This is why "no one has gotten to the bottom" of the homicide of Cardinal Juan Jose Posadas Ocampo and why the Arellano Felix brothers have not been arrested. He said that high-level PGR officials "told me" that they are not absolutely sure which Federal Judicial Police (PJF) agents are trustworthy and honest, and which are linked to drug trafficking. This has complicated the capture of the Arellano Felix brothers, chiefs of the Tijuana Cartel, "because when the police are told they are in a certain place, by the time the police get there they are already somewhere else." The police themselves give them a heads-up, the archbishop said. He said the Catholic Church is not satisfied with the results of the investigation because it has not gotten to the bottom of the matter and the PGR has not arrested the real killers. There is no "room for percentages" in assessing how the investigation is going because we do not know who the real killers are or their motives for the murder. The PGR has fought drug trafficking, but "they have not had the answers" to Cardinal Posadas' case. In light of this, he said, Mexicans run the risk that impunity "may become entrenched in our fatherland and we will end up with a violent society, a dangerous society," if the homicides of Cardinal Posadas and Luis Donaldo Colosio are not solved. The archbishop called a news conference in the capitular room of the Archdiocese of Guadalajara on the day before the first anniversary of the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. Before beginning his remarks, he asked reporters from the international, national, and local media to pray. He then began: "We have always said we still are not satisfied, that the investigation has not gotten to the bottom of the case, that we are not happy because no one has gotten to the bottom of this since the real killers have not been captured. All Mexicans -- not just the Church -- want these investigations to continue and for this crime to be cleared up soon." [Question] What is your evaluation of the authorities' behavior, especially that of the PGR? [Sandoval Iniguez] We have been in touch with high-ranking PGR officials. They have assured me they are very interested in the investigation; they are determined to clear up the murder. In fact, they want some assistance, some of our help. This is why we have called on anyone who may have some information... It could be these people may supply details that may have been misinterpreted by others. "They face many difficulties on this road. First, because a year has already passed and second, because all municipal, state, or federal police forces in Mexico are either contaminated a little or a lot. They were telling me, for example, that 40 percent of the people who work for the PGR are not to be trusted. They say that even they do not know who is who; they do not know who the trustworthy and honest agents are. They do not know who is involved with the drug traffickers or with other groups who buy off these people's consciences. That is how the security forces are infiltrated and why they have people working there who are not trustworthy." [Question] Could this be blocking the investigations? [Sandoval Iniguez] ...They (high-level PGR officers) claim this is one of the reasons why this and other investigations have not been wrapped up. They even told me that when they go to arrest criminals, some people warn the criminals in advance. When they arrive on the scene, the criminals are gone. That could be one of the reasons. The same is true of the Arellano Felix brothers, who escape when they learn that authorities are coming after them. Drug traffickers have plenty of money to corrupt and buy off people's consciences and thus ward off any action against them, he said. But the Catholic Church will not fight that kind of corruption. There will be other ways for that. But it will not stop insisting, as all citizens must, that the homicide should be resolved even after the current six-year presidential term ends, he added. Surrounded by some of his aides in the room housing paintings of the archbishops of Guadalajara, Sandoval Iniguez recalled that the president of the republic said the crime would be solved and said "he should be asked about it." "I would also like to say in this forum that all society should demand, each one of us must demand that justice be done. A democratic country must not leave its hopes and dreams in the hands of two or three people...this is a demand of all society," he said. [Question] Are we living in a country of half-truths? [Sandoval Iniguez] I believe our truths are less than half-truths. We can barely get to a half-truth, he said ironically. [as published] He mentioned that the PGR has not briefed the Archdiocese of Guadalajara on the investigations since November 1993. A journalist asked if he feared any possible reprisals for his statements. The archbishop said: "I do not think I will be the object of reprisals for what I am saying because I am not offending or injuring anyone or telling lies." Sandoval Iniguez said that on Tuesday, 24 May, the crypt containing the remains of the late cardinal will be open from 1000 to 1800. During the evening, the archbishop will officiate at a mass in memory of Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.
