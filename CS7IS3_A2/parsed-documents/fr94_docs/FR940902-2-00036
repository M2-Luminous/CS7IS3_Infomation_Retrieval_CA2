FR940902-2-00036 FR940902-2-00029 Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project: Sanford Cohen and Associates' Technical Working Group; Public Meeting The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces the following meeting: Name: Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project: Sanford Cohen and Associates' Technical Working Group_Public Meeting. Time and date: 8:30 a.m.&hyph;5:30 p.m., September 14, 1994. Place: Best Western-Cottontree Inn, 1415 Bench Road, Pocatello, Idaho 83201. Status: Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available. Purpose: Under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC. An initial step in an analytic epidemiologic study for persons living offsite of a given DOE facility is the reconstruction of radiation doses due to releases from that facility. CDC has begun such an environmental dose reconstruction for DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. A contractor, Sanford Cohen and Associates (SC&A), is gathering the data necessary to perform the dose reconstruction and to provide for logistics of public involvement in this project. The purpose of this public meeting is: SC&A will discuss project progress and responses to public concerns. Members of the public will be asked to provide individual input on technical issues and decisions faced by SC&A's project team. Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.
