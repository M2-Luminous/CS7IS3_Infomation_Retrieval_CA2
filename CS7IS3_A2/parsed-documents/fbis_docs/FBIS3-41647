New Zealand does not have the equipment to destroy the PCBs, which are used as an insulator in electricity transformers, and French Environment Minister Michel Barnier says France has agreed to import the chemical out of ``ecological solidarity.'' The French branch of the environmental organisation said on Wednesday that there were thousands of PCB transformers in France that needed to be processed as a priority. The PCBs are incinerated at a plant operated by the state-owned Tredi group in south-eastern France. Incineration produces a highly toxic residue, a sample of which was left at the New Zealand embassy on Wednesday. Greenpeace said the imports from New Zealand ``will in no way solve the growing problem of New Zealand's toxic wastes.'' Greenpeace last year vainly campaigned aginst French imports of another 500 tonnes of PCBs from Australia.
