As of today, four contracts were signed by the Ukrainian and French partners, which provide for the Yuzhnoe designers' involvement in the following projects: - utilization of SS-24 missiles' oxygen tanks as kerosene and liquid oxygen containers to replace heptyl and amyl. A contract to this effect embraces a seven-month period and is estimated at 100,000 FF; - utilization of SS-24 missiles and their components for manufacture of new small rockets intended for placing satellites on low orbits launched from the French space center in Guiana. The 300,000 FF contract's term may stretch from six to twelve months depending on Aerospaciale's response to the Yuzhnoe designers' draft documentation; - utilization of a solid propellant 30t.-thrust engine as the second-stage booster for small rockets. The 120,000 FF contract's term is three months; - utilization of SS-24 components as Arian-5 boosters (200,000 FF). The Ukrainian party is reported to have arranged all export control formalities. The Yuzhnoe designers' technologies for blasting welding are the object of negotiations underway with a view of contract signing. The Yuzhnoe-Aerospaciale duet is reported as intending to secure the French government's financing of small rocket manufacture designed to lift commercial payloads. According to Andrei Zhalko-Titarenko, deputy director-general of the Ukrainian National Space Agency, Ukraine's skilled and cheap labor makes cooperation attractive and lucrative in the eyes of French space researchers.
