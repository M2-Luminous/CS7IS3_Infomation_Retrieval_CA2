A Russian Foreign Ministry statement said today that Russia has made efforts in carrying out the initiative of lifting the siege of Sarajevo and putting the city under the United Nations control. "We have been seeking and are still seeking the implementation of this initiative by acting openly within the framework of U.N. Security Council resolutions," the statement said. "We continue this line now, despite the serious aggravation of the situation around Sarajevo for well-known reasons." On February 5, a motar attack on a crowded market center in Sarajevo, the capital of the warring Bosnia-Herzegovina, killed at least 68 citizens and injured over 200. Four days later, the NATO issued an ultimatum threatening to impose air strikes on positions around the city. The ultimatum expires on Sunday [20 February]. The statement said that Bosnian Serbs had adopted a decision to withdraw their heavy guns from around Sarajevo in reply to the demand of the U.N. Security Council. "We hope that this expression of goodwill by one of the warring factions at the critical moment for the settlement (of the conflict) will be followed by concrete actions," said the statement. It said: "We are calling on the (Muslim-led) Bosnian Government to hand over its heavy guns around Sarajevo under U.N. control without delay, as envisaged by the U.N. secretary-general's plan proposed in his letter to the Security Council on February 10." The statement also called on the United States and the European Union nations to exert, in the spirit of their statements preferring a political solution of the problem, the necessary influence on the Bosnian Government to make it cooperate with the United Nations in reaching full deblocking and demilitarization of Sarajevo. "At this crucial time it is extremely important to rule out the possibility of any provocation and acts of sabotage of this peace process," the statement stressed. It also said after lifting the siege of Sarajevo the U.N. Security Council could immediately start considering ways to establish U.N. administrative rule in the city, as well as measures to strengthen other safe heavens on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
