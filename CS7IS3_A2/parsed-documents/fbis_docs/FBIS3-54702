[passage omitted] [Foglizzo] We help those countries which are experiencing difficulties in the sphere of foreign payments. On condition, of course, that their policy does not harm other states. Our job is to use money to the maximum advantage and enable a country to implement economic reforms on the one hand while, on the other hand, ensuring the repayment of the debt so that our depositors do not suffer a loss and have an opportunity to promptly invest their repaid resources in the economies of countries that need investment. This is the IMF's philosophy, these are the functions assigned to it by the world community. We are adopting the same approach toward Russia. We need firm guarantees that the reforms here will continue to develop. The government's program designed to run through the end of 1994 is now being implemented. It has been approved by the Council of Ministers Presidium and the prime minister. But how can we rely on that program when a detailed budget for next year has still not been prepared even now, at the end of December? In this case it is not a question of a tough stance by the IMF toward Russia but a desire to build our partnership on firmer foundations. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] What credits has Russia already received from the IMF? [Foglizzo] An accord was signed 5 August 1992, granting Russia a so-called reserve credit of $1 billion. This is the main form of credit which the IMF issues to its members for the support of economic programs. It was received in full by your country by December 1992. During this year Russia has received a further $1.5 billion from the IMF. This is aid within the framework of the recently created program of finance for systemic transformations. It envisages the granting of credits to those countries which are switching to a market economy. The maximum credit of this type is $3 billion. When the IMF granted Russia the first 1.5 billion, we expected that it would receive the remaining 1.5 billion by October or November -- but that did not happen. In August the government was unable to adhere to the course of reforms agreed with and supported by us. There were many reasons for that. The main reason was the conflict between the president and the parliament which led to a destabilization of the situation. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Now this main reason has been removed. Does this mean that our country will soon receive the second part of the systemic credit? [Foglizzo] That depends on the subsequent development of events. A program of urgent measures was elaborated this fall, designed to achieve financial stabilization. We approve it although perhaps not all of its details. Now the problem is to convince the other branches of power and the Russian people that there can be no solution to the crisis without such measures. As I have already said, this year the government was unable to fully maintain the course of financial stabilization. Now the time has come to think about an action program for next year. I do not know what kind of program it will be. The IMF has no "magic figures" -- no universal budget deficit or inflation rate ceilings. The main point is that there must be a firm and unwavering desire for reforms, stabilization of the economy, and radical reduction of the rate of inflation. [passage omitted] [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Is the IMF currently holding talks with the Russian Government on further cooperation? [Foglizzo] An IMF mission visited Moscow in the first half of December. Our specialists would like to come here again as soon as possible. But I do not think that there will be any serious negotiations until the question of the new parliament is finally resolved and the composition of the Russian Government is confirmed. We can hardly construct real plans for next year before 15 January. U.S. President Clinton is due to arrive in Moscow soon. He will have talks with President Yeltsin. IMF Executive Director M. Camdessus has also been invited to Moscow. The IMF's subsequent activity in your country will depend on the results of this top-level meeting. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Clearly, work in Russia has brought the IMF more problems than it anticipated? [Foglizzo] No, we are cooperating quite well with Russia. Of course this does not mean that all our efforts have been successful. But during this year we have come to understand the country better and have learned how various traditional mechanisms influence the economy. In your government we have found people who really understand the situation, who know what must be done, and who know how to explain the decisions that are made in a way that is accessible to the population. First and foremost this applies to Vice Premier and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov. I think that Russia has changed enormously in the past year. Even the actual standard of the debates on economic questions is far higher now than it used to be. The privatization process is making quite successful and rapid progress. We are glad that the currency market has operated without interruption and that the rate of the ruble there has stabilized in the past six months. Markets in vouchers and other securities have been formed. This is an important factor for stabilization. The structural reorganization of industry has begun. This, after all, is the key to a successful economic reform. Production is beginning to respond more flexibly to changes in the situation in the market. New relations are developing between the government and the Central Bank. In May-June the IMF supported the agreement between them. Without that accord we could not have allocated the first $1.5 billion systemic credit to Russia. Our experts working at the Central Bank believe that in recent months relations between it and the government have improved somewhat. The Central Bank nevertheless does want to adapt, albeit cautiously at the moment, to the new market conditions. For example, the interest rate is currently 210 percent a year or 17.5 percent a month whereas inflation in September-November was 15 to 17 percent. This means that a positive interest rate has appeared in Russia for the first time. There are also some alarming tendencies. For example, the raising of customs import duties. It is our hope that this is the exception rather than the beginning of a lengthy process. On the whole I believe that this year's balance has been positive -- inflation has fallen and the slump in production is slowing down even if it has not actually stopped. Thus there are grounds for optimism. [passage omitted]
