"I cannot imagine that in case of police operations a leadership team, some sort of executive committee, would be able to react quickly and with responsibility," the chairman of the Bundestag Internal Affairs Committee said on Monday [7 March] in an interview with Saarland Radio. Bernrath criticized the steps taken by Kanther as a result of the failed antiterrorist operation in Bad Kleinen as "half-hearted measures." They consist of "personnel questions and not organizational tasks." If the minister is of the opinion that BKA chief Hans-Ludwig Zachert is not able to fulfill his task, Zachert must be replaced. It is "certainly not correct" for the ministry to have greater influence on the BKA either, because the ministry is "even more tangled than the BKA and its structure is even less manageable." In his 46-page final report on Bad Kleinen, which became known to DPA at the weekend, Kanther lists many mistakes committed by the security forces. In an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG he also announced that he will include Zachert in a BKA "leadership characterized by teamwork" and intensify the ministry's influence on this authority. For reasons of civil service law, the 56-year-old official cannot be transferred. During the operation in Bad Kleinen, a small town in Mecklenburg, more than eight months ago, Wolfgang Grams, a suspected terrorist of the Red Army Faction (RAF), as well as a GSG-9 man were shot dead. Kanther's final report affirms that the judiciary assumes that Grams committed suicide. His companion, suspected RAF terrorist Birgit Hogefeld, was arrested. In the meantime, experts have obviously come to a new assessment of the terrorist group: "The RAF no longer exists as one single entity," Norbert Wingerter of the Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution writes in the technical journal MAGAZINE FOR ECONOMICS, CRIME, AND SECURITY [Zeitschrift fuer Wirtschaft, Kriminalitaet und Sicherheit]. He is the head of the "Extremism/Terrorism Assessment" Department and summarizes his views: RAF command, arrested terrorists, and sympathizers are profoundly split, in particular regarding the issue of armed operations.
