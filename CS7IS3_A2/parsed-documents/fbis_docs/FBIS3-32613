Garcia's decision responds to the issuance this week of a communique -- the third in less than two years -- questioning the attitude of several military chiefs. Military sources have reported that Army officers received copies of the communique. The text of the communique, which is unsigned and is not identified in any way, was also sent to several members of the media, including BUSQUEDA. The first public appearance of the so-called "Artigas Guard" goes back to April 1992 when it claimed responsibility for the explosion of a bomb outside former President Julio Sanguinetti's office. Sources close to the Army commander's office have reported that Garcia will not comment on the new communique, "in which its leaders are not identified." However, other military sources have said that Garcia "is not amused" over the continued discussions on the "Artigas Guard." The sources added that although he is aware that "it is not easy" to detect these "anonymous plotters," he is "restless" because the investigation did not yield any results. This third communique issued by the "Artigas Guard" addresses messages to Garcia; General Raul Mermot, the Third Army Division chief; and Lieutenant General Hugo Medina, retired, the former Army commander. Alluding to the changes Garcia intends to make in the Army, the communique states that "the fastest path may be the most dangerous." The four-page communique entitled "Preliminary Report of Communique No. 3 of the Artigas Guard", states that "Trying to straighten in a few months a piece of the most noble steel that has been bent for years, will surely break him." It adds that if we do not recover "our self-confidence and loyalty (...) all of us will fail" and "we will be defeated soldiers forever, you and your subordinates." Later, the communique severely questions Gen. Hugo Mermot and former Army Commander Medina who in the last few weeks protested and expressed their opposition to the reforms promoted by Garcia. Mermot was held for 10 days because of a letter he addressed to Garcia demanding participation in the planned reforms. The communique states that during the time he was director of the Armed Forces sanitary services, Mermot did not show the same concern over the difficulties that the families of those soldiers who were hospitalized in the Military Hospital had to face. It adds: "You (...) are now suffering in flesh and blood what your subordinates have suffered for a long time." The Artigas Guard tells Medina: "There is a time to speak and a time to be silent (...) and we believe you did not act accordingly at one time or the other." Medina is also pointed out as "spokesman" of "a group of military men who condition the future of the institution to the holding of their posts." Paraphrasing General Jose Artigas, the communique ends by stating: "We will never allow our common enemy to take the slightest advantage of our disagreements."
