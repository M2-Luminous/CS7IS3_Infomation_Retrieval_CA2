Repeated voting will be held in Kiev's 21 constituencies, in 18 constituencies in Crimea, in 32 constituencies in Dnepropetrovsk oblast, in six constituencies in Ivano-Frankovsk, in 17 constituencies in Vinnitsa, and in all four constituencies in Sevastopol. Why the repeated elections? Because not a single candidate has gathered 50 percent of votes. We had the situation when there were on average 13 candidates in each constituency. There were constituencies with 31 candidates, 32, or 28 candidates. It is very difficult to chose in such a situation. [end recording] [Announcer] Altogether, about 40 deputies to a new parliament were elected in the first round of voting. Our correspondent has learned this at the republican embassy in Moscow. More details about the elections from Vadym Dolganov, press attache of the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow. [Begin Dolganov recording] Those elected include the former Ukrainian prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. He gathered 91 percent of votes in his constituency in Dnepropetrovsk. Also in the lead is the current parliamentary speaker Ivan Plyushch. He also has splendid results - 71 per cent of votes. Furthermore, Volodymyr Pylypchuk, who headed the permanent commission on issues of economic reform, and the well-known Stepan Khmara also became deputies to the new parliament. The former vice premier Volodymyr Lanovyy, an economist and reformer, also had a good lead. Dmytro Pavlychko, the chairman of the permanent commission on international issues of the former parliament, was not elected. [end recording] [Announcer] The Ukrainian diplomat also stressed that none of the deputies was elected in Nikolayev oblast, and only one deputy in Zaporozhye. The second round of voting to the Ukrainian parliament is to be held in three weeks.
