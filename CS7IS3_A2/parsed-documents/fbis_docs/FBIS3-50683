Annoyed at seeing how congressmen have manipulated the national budget over the past few years, the rapporteur of the CPI that is investigating the budget mafia has pledged to include in his report all those whose involvement in corrupt practices has been duly proven. The effort of examining all the documents has consumed Magalhaes' time and health. He wants to submit his report by 15 January and has been working day and night drafting the report. Not even the bad cold he caught last week made him slacken up a little. He said: It does not matter if I am running a temperature or am sick. The CPI cannot come to a grinding halt. Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal Party-Para] follows in Magalhaes' footsteps. He went to Congress to work as usual yesterday. Both Passarinho and Magalhaes know the public demand great responsibility from the CPI. Even though he did not want to preannounce the names of congressmen whose removal he will recommend, Magalhaes made it clear that Senator Ronaldo Aragao (PMDB-RO) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Roraima] and Deputy Carlos Benevides (PMDB-CE) [Ceara], who made a deposition this past week, will be on the list. Furthermore, those congressmen who are sure to appear in the report include Deputies Joao Alves (no party-BA) [Bahia], Cid Carvalho (PMDB-MA) [Maranhao], Manoel Moreira (PMDB-SP) [Sao Paulo], Jose Geraldo Ribeiro (PMDB-MG] [Minas Gerais], Genebaldo Correia (PMDB-BA), Fabio Raunheitti (PTB-RJ) [Brazilian Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro], and Joao de Deus Antunes (PPR-RS) [Rio Grande do Sul]. Feres Nader (PTB-RJ), a substitute member, will also appear. The following congressmen may also be on the list: Ibsen Pinheiro (PMDB-RS), Ricardo Fiuza (PFL-PE), Sergio Guerra (PSB-PE) [Brazilian Socialist Party], Jose Carlos Vasconcellos (PRN-PE) [National Reconstruction Party], Paes Landim (PFL-PI) [Piaui], Flavio Derzi (PP-MS) [Popular Party-Mato Grosso do Sul], and Raquel Candido (PTB-RO). The CPI probe into the budget mafia is drawing to an end. In your capacity as CPI rapporteur, how do you feel at his moment? [Magalhaes] I am becoming terribly indignant at what I consider very serious cases. There have been incredible and long-standing manipulations of the national budget. There was a huge irregular scheme afoot within the Budget Committee. These cases are most grave. I can no longer stand to see all this. [De Moraes] What impression did Senator Aragao's deposition create on you? [Magalhaes] Just to put you in the picture, a senator manages to get appropriations amounting to $600,000 for a foundation that bears his name and is located in Rondonia. I think that more than half the congressmen have never had assets of a comparable value. He used some of that money to buy three ambulances from a company he established and the vehicles are conspicuous by their absence. And so the story continues. [De Moraes] Did the deposition of Deputy Carlos Benevides also irritate you? [Magalhaes] That is another incredible case. An individual chose 54 institutions that now receive social contributions and manages to obtain the minister's okay without any problems. I repeat, I can no longer stomach this type of thing. [De Moraes] Is your report ready? [Magalhaes] I am about to conclude it. Yesterday I received a detailed report from Senator Eduardo Suplicy [PT-SP] [Workers Party], which will help me draft my document. I am waiting for more depositions, but all those involved in irregularities whose guilt is established by the CPI beyond all doubt will be included in the report. [De Moraes] There are those who are in favor of postponing the deadline for the Budget CPI to conclude its findings. Do you endorse this? [Magalhaes] No. I am against postponing it. I have already discussed this with Senator Jose Paulo Bisol [PSB-RS] and explained to him that it would not be possible. There is a group that wants to delay the deadline for the CPI to submit its final report, but we cannot go beyond 15 January. If we do that, the work of the CPI will go unnoticed. [De Moraes] Do you not believe that if the deadline were to be extended the CPI may discover new things? [Magalhaes] Now is the time to reach a conclusion. We can investigate new allegations later. We must meet the deadline established for the CPI report, otherwise these investigations could go on for another six years. [De Moraes] Do you believe your report will herald a new era for Brazilian politics? [Magalhaes] I do not think my report will, but I have no doubt whatsoever that the decision taken by a plenary session of Congress will.
