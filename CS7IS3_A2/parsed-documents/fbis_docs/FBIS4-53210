North Korea is at odds with China, which opposed such a request. This source said that before proposing to the United States to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement, North Korea officially requested in April that all five Chinese members of the liaison delegation, including a colonel-level senior delegate of the Chinese People's Volunteers liaison office of the DPRK-China side of the MAC, be withdrawn because "the historical duty of the Armistice Agreement has ended." The Chinese side replied: "China would be making a big historical mistake if the Chinese side withdrew from the MAC when it has not been abolished." The Chinese side points out that it is trying to persuade North Korea, but it is being stubborn; therefore, China is in an awkward position. While the Chinese side is hesitating to withdraw unilaterally from the MAC, North Korea proposed to the United States to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement late last month and thus withdrew its MAC members to Pyongyang.
