Even if the negotiations take a few months, we will not change our minds. What we are telling the PLO is simple: We have put together a very original package for you. What we proposed in Oslo contained a territorial element which did not come up in the Washington talks. In Washington, discussions were held about principles, but principles alone cannot bring us to an accord. We are telling the Palestinians: We gave you a plan, and you must decide on the timetable. If you decide to slow down, we, too, will not be in a hurry. If you hurry, we, too, will hurry. For some reason, the Palestinians are under the impression that we cannot wait, that we have to finish the thing. We are in no rush." These remarks were made yesterday by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres during a meeting with Labor's Ef'al circle, which convened in Ramat Ef'al. For over an hour, Peres replied to poignant questions posed by members of the Ef'al circle, which is seen as a hawkish Labor forum. It is headed by Minister Ya'aqov Tzur, and its activities are directed by reserves Major General Shay Erez, a former head of the Civil Administration in Judaea and Samaria. In reply to questions reflecting the circle members' anxieties and uncertainty with respect to the arrangement with the PLO and the future arrangement with Syria, Peres delivered an optimistic and visionary speech about a changing world and a new Middle East. "Not only has our region undergone a dramatic change, but the changes we anticipate will be even more dramatic than anything we have witnessed so far," Peres said. The real enemy threatening the Arab world is not Zionist but rather fundamentalist. "I do not think Labor's political adversary is the Likud; it lies within our midst. We are unable to sever ourselves from the past," Peres said, directing his barbs at the hawkish Labor forum members who are not entirely at ease with the government moves. He maintained that the Gaza Strip arrangement will be nothing like the one in Judaea and Samaria and that the latter will not resemble the arrangement on the Golan Heights. "Netzarim does not resemble the 'Etzyon Bloc," Peres said. He added that the Sinai precedent does not have to dictate the Judaea and Samaria arrangement, because there was no Palestinian rule in Judaea and Samaria when Israel conquered the area and because of the problem of Jerusalem and the settlements. Peres refrained from stating explicitly that the peace arrangement with Syria calls for Israel to withdraw from all of the Golan, as his cabinet colleagues, Ministers Shulamit Aloni and Yosi Sarid, have said and his deputy, Yosi Beilin, has implied. "I see no point in starting the negotiations with Syria with offers of concessions on the Heights. I do not endorse the Syrian stand, but I do not intend to commit myself now to moves on which I may be unable to carry through. We are negotiating with Syria, not with ourselves," Peres said, stressing that any peace agreement with Syria will entail painful concessions. "We will have to choose between two conflicting aspirations: the desire to attain a peace agreement with Syria and the desire to hold on to all or most of the Golan. The question that will have to be answered is whether our unwillingness to give up the Golan may not force us to give up the peace agreement," Peres said. He did not voice his view on the referendum idea, and he was not asked about it. Peres added that before reaching an agreement with Syria, the government will seek to attain an agreement with Jordan. In his opinion, the Gaza-Jericho First agreement will be completed in the course of 1994. We will attain peaceful relations (though not necessarily a formal peace agreement) with Jordan that will include, among other things, regional economic cooperation accords on issues such as projects along the Jordan River and in the 'Arava. Peres' list of arrangements anticipated in 1994 did not include a peace agreement with Syria. The foreign minister attacked Meretz faction members, as well as Labor figures, "whose hatred for the ultra-Orthodox has pushed SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] and Agudat Yisra'el to the right." In his opinion, the government will have difficulty reaching political resolutions without the religious-ultra-Orthodox bloc. "I know that I have been accused of staging the `foul maneuver' [which toppled the government in March 1990], but what the ultra-Orthodox wanted -- education budgets -- was their legitimate due. We are not losing the religious public because of a budget but because some of us radiate contempt and hatred toward them." [passage omitted]
