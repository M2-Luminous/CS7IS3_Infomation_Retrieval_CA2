An official of the department said that exports from Shanghai amounted to 7.38 billion U.S. dollars for the whole of 1993. The figure represented a nearly 13 percent rise over the year before, exceeding the nation's average growth rate for the first time in the previous 23 years. The municipal government has decided to mobilize all economic sectors in Shanghai to expand exports, in a bid to spur the city's economic growth in the new year, he said. The manufacturing industry plans to increase exports by at least 15 percent this year, he said. To achieve the goal, local manufacturers will try to increase production of goods popular on the global market, particularly new mechanical and electrical products. Furthermore, the municipal government will do everything within its power to expand production of 50 kinds of products each with an annual export topping five million dollars, and aid 35 key manufacturers each exporting at least 20 million U.S. dollars' worth a year, the official said. Meanwhile, the Pudong New Area, where flexible policies are being pursued to encourage Chinese and overseas investors, will try to broaden its foreign markets by giving full scope to its position as a free trade zone, he said.
