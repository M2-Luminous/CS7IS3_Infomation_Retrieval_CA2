Its maiden flight has been announced for September 1994. The aircraft's real name--the A300-600ST--leaves no doubt about its Airbus family connection. The Satic consortium has indeed developed the future replacement for the Super-Guppies from an A300-600R. But although the new airplane uses several unaltered subassemblies, says Satic President Ugo Drager, "the A300-600ST program is practically equivalent to the development of a new plane" due to the jumbo's size (over 56m long, over 17m high, and 45m in span) and technical complexity. All the same, the program enables Satic to borrow heavily from the know-how of its parent companies and partners, and to cut costs and development time while using top notch technologies. The Satic consortium, a 50/50 joint venture of Aerospatiale Airplanes and Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, is the chief contractor in charge of coordinating the program. Not only is it responsible for negotiations with Airbus Industrie, which is acting as a real launch airline, it also handles the contracts signed with cooperating partners, even those assigned to members of the consortium as part of the program. Commonly referred to as the AST (Airbus Super Transporter) or Belouga, after the great dolphin of the Northern Seas whose image it invariably conjures up, the aircraft is currently undergoing final assembly in the Toulouse halls of Hemet Exploration, a subsidiary of Sogerma-Socea. Using an Airbus aircraft as a starting point enables Satic to cut costs by employing basic structural subassemblies manufactured by the production aircraft's traditional partners. In all other respects, however, the A300-600R's structure had to be substantially altered to boost its maximum carrying capacity to 45.5 metric tons (the Super Guppy can carry 23.8 metric t). Engineers had to increase fuselage diameter from 5.6m on the A300-600R to 7.4m on the AST, resulting in a modification of the entire upper part of the fuselage. Compartment access raised another problem, which was solved by lowering the cockpit below the level of the aircraft's floor, so that the cargo door could be positioned in the nose cone. This configuration makes it easier to open and close the door, which is the biggest ever installed on an aircraft. The door's position results in gains during loading and unloading of the craft: Turnaround time, said program officials during the aircraft's presentation in Toulouse on 3 February, drops from two or even three hours to 45 minutes at most, regardless of the weather. The cargo door can open effortlessly in 45 knot winds, which is not always the case with Super Guppies that are not sheltered in a specific type of hall. But the aerodynamics of such a cargo plane are grossly different from that of the original craft. To compensate, engineers raised the tail fin and reinforced the rear horizontal stabilizer, equipping it with auxiliary fins to improve the aircraft's flight stability. On 3 February, the AST was fitted with one of the key components of its modified portion, the cargo door. As the two diagrams show, work to alter the A300-600R's structure was assigned in batches to European partners. Approximately 80 percent of production work on the AST has been farmed out to European subcontractors. The division of labor on the modified section breaks down as follows: 60.66 percent in France; 16.73 percent in Germany; 13.03 percent in Spain; 8.71 percent in Great Britain; and 0.87 percent in the Netherlands. As one might expect, unaltered subassemblies will be produced in the usual factories of Airbus Industrie partners, to hold down costs.
