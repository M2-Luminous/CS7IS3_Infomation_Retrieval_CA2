FBIS4-51851 "dreas086_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 North Korea Spokesman Denounces South for Blocking Conference Spokesman Denounces South for Blocking Conference SK0405110194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1024 GMT 4 May 94 SK0405110194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) in a statement on May 3 bitterly denounces in the name of the nation the treacherous crime of the Kim Yong-sam group in totally blocking dialogue and negotiation for the relaxation of tensions and peaceful reunification and running about recklessly to unleash a nuclear war for destroying the entire nation, in league with outside forces. Recalling that the present South Korean rulers are opposing the convocation of a national conference with far- fetched arguments and are these days rushing headlong along a dangerous road of war against the North with the encouragement of outside forces, the spokesman says: "It is the unshakable will of the entire nation to break the deadlock and open up a decisive phase for reunification by achieving great national unity this year, one year before the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the country. [no closing quotation mark as received] The Kim Yong-sam group must act with discretion, clearly mindful that their blocking the historical national conference proposed to be convened around August 15 is an unpardonable anti-national crime against reunification. The spokesman ardently calls upon all the political parties, organisations and individual figures in South Korea and overseas Koreans to join in the grand march for reunification with a bold decision. He expresses the hope that all the progressive organisations and people of the world will pay deep attention to the grave situation created on the Korean peninsula and continue to extend active support and solidarity to the Korean people in their just cause of national reconciliation and unity and the peaceful reunification of the country.
