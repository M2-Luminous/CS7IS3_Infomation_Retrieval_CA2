Some medical specialists suggest that central and local governments include parasitic disease control in their social and economic development programmes and increase budgets for parasite eradication. Ministry of Public Health experts, who recently completed a nationwide survey exposing the problem, hoped that extensive publicity and education could raise the public's awareness regarding parasitic illnesses. The survey found that of the 62% of Chinese infected with intestinal parasites, some 43% had two or more species of parasites. Some persons had as many as nine species. The rate of infection is even higher among farmers and ethnic people because of their agricultural activities and dietary customs. Most are infected with roundworm, pinworm, and whipworm. It is estimated that some 531 million people in the country have round-worms. Each year, the central and local governments spend some 150 million yuan (about $26 million) treating people infected with such soil transmitted parasites as roundworm, pinworm, whipworm, and hookworm. The national survey, the first and the largest of its kind in Chinese history, lasted for eight years from 1988 to 1992 [years as published]. The Ministry of Public Health and local governments spent more than 5.2 million yuan (over $900,000) for the survey which involved about 8,000 technicians and medical specialists. The survey selected 2,848 pilot sites in 726 counties, and some 1.5 million persons were surveyed by fecal examination. A total of 56 species of parasites were detected on the mainland. Of those, three species of trematodes detected in Anhui and Fujian provinces are the first recorded in humans on the mainland. Another species, also found in Fujian Province, is the first instance of infection in a human. The highest infection rate--nearly 95%--was reported in South China's Hainan Province. The lowest--17.5%--was in northeastern Heilongjiang Province.
