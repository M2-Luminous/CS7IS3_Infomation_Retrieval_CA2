FR940429-0-00067 FR940429-0-00010 With regard to the waiver of the ``separate and independent'' requirements, the Secretary believes the specific circumstances described by various commenters about a particular accrediting agency should be addressed in the context of that agency's application for the waiver, not through regulation. The Secretary accepts the suggestion to stipulate in regulation that an agency must seek a waiver each time it applies for recognition or renewal of recognition. Change: A requirement has been added that accrediting agencies must seek a waiver of the ``separate and independent'' requirement each time they apply for recognition or renewal of recognition. Section 602.4␣Submission of Information to the Secretary by Recognized Accrediting Agencies Comments: The Secretary received numerous comments that the proposed requirement in §602.4(e)_that an accrediting agency had to submit to the Secretary, upon request, information to assist the Secretary in resolving problems with any institution or program accredited by the agency_exceeded the statute and failed to distinguish adequately between public and private information maintained by accrediting agencies. Commenters generally believed that this requirement put accrediting agencies in the position of being required to do the Secretary's work and threatened to compromise the inherent value of the peer review system on which accreditation is based. Some of these commenters believed that §602.4(e) should be deleted in its entirety, while others suggested that the information to be provided by accrediting agencies should be restricted either to the accreditation status of an institution or program or to the minimum information needed to fulfill the intent of the law. Not all commenters were opposed to §602.4(e), however. Some supported it as written. Some stated their opinion that the less confidential information accrediting agencies kept the better. Several of these commenters suggested that a protocol be developed for the sharing of information and that there should be a single office within the Department that served as contact with accrediting agencies for the purpose of information sharing. One commenter suggested that accrediting agencies be given time to negotiate a new understanding of the information sharing concept with institutions because, as important as the concept was, it was generally in conflict with most agencies' policies on confidentiality. One commenter, while expressing general support for information sharing, cautioned against requiring information to be shared before it was confirmed in fact, the institution had received due process, and any applicable appeals were complete. Many commenters suggested that a possible solution that would allow the Secretary access to the information the Secretary needed without placing agencies in the position of doing the Secretary's work was the use of an administrative subpoena by the Department. Of general concern to all commenters on the issue of information sharing was the kind of information shared by an accrediting agency about an accredited institution or program that would be obtainable by anyone under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). With regard to the comment in the NPRM that the Secretary was considering adding to this section a requirement that an accrediting agency must refer to the Department's Office of Inspector General any fraudulent activities it discovers on the part of an institution or program it accredits, provided that institution or program participates in Title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary received strong support for the general concept but some concern about agencies' liabilities should the institution or program be subsequently found not to have engaged in fraud. Commenters also urged the Secretary to substitute for the term ``fraud,'' which has a very precise legal definition, something more general like ``substantial wrongdoing'' or ``serious abuse.'' Finally, several commenters noted that there was no provision in the proposed regulations that paralleled the proposed requirement in 34 CFR part 667 that the Secretary notify the State postsecondary review entity of Federal actions against an institution. Commenters also suggested that the State postsecondary review entity should be required to notify an accrediting agency of the outcome of any review of an institution accredited by the agency that it makes under the State Postsecondary Review Program. Discussion: The Secretary is aware that most accrediting agencies currently have confidentiality policies that prevent them from releasing information about an accredited institution or program to a third party without the prior approval of the institution. The Secretary is also aware that confidentiality is an important aspect of the peer review system on which accreditation is based. However, the Secretary notes that under section 487(a)(15) of the HEA, by entering into a Title IV, HEA program participation agreement, an institution acknowledges the authority of the Secretary, accrediting agencies, State postsecondary review entities, and others to share with each other information pertaining to the institution's eligibility to participate in Title IV, HEA programs and any information on fraud or abuse by the institution. Therefore, institutions can have no genuine expectation that information they provide to their accrediting agencies pertaining to their Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, fraud, or abuse will be kept confidential from the Secretary or these other entities. Accordingly, the Secretary has revised §602.4(e) to reflect that statutory provision. Thus, the information the Secretary may request from an accrediting agency under §602.4(e) is limited to information concerning an accredited or preaccredited institution's compliance with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, including its eligibility to participate in Title IV, HEA programs. As a result, an agency does not have to provide the Secretary with copies of an institution's self-study report, reports of on-site evaluations of the institution by the accrediting agency, or other documents maintained by the agency about the institution for the purpose of determining the institution's compliance with the agency's standards. However, the agency must provide any information contained in those documents that is relevant to the institution's compliance with its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities. The Secretary notes that, as discussed in connection with §602.10, an accrediting agency must provide any document the Secretary requests relating to whether the agency is complying with the requirements of this part.
