Prior to the document-signing ceremony, Turkmen Oil and Gas Minister Suyunov briefed Premier Li Peng and his party on a tentative plan to build a natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Japan via China. He said: Turkmenistan's current proved reserves of natural gas and petroleum reached 21,000 billion cubic meters and 5 billion to 6 billion tonnes, respectively. The exploitation of these resources will make Turkmenistan become an energy-exporting country. The length of the natural gas pipeline is 6,130 km on land and 880 km to 1,100 km by sea. It will be a project whose implementation will span this century and the next. Its inauguration will be beneficial to Turkmenistan, China, and Japan. Premier Li Peng attentively listened to the briefing and asked detailed questions about the relevant situation. Today, a ceremony conferring on Premier Li Peng the title of academician emeritus of the Turkmenistan Academy of Sciences was also held in the hall of the presidential office. Today at noon, Ismail Amat, state councillor and concurrently minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, and who accompanied Premier Li Peng on his visit, cut the ribbon for the inauguration of the Asia Hotel, a Sino-Turkmen joint venture located in a suburb of Ashkhabat.
