Although the result of investigation has not been completely revealed, the same information which have [word indistinct] proved that the Conservative British government is involved in a big secret deal arms with Iraq in blatant violation of law. The attention of Judge Scott has been specially drawn to the question as to why investigation in the trial of Matrix Churchill company managers was stopped in November 1992 under the government pressure. This was why the involvement of British intelligence service, known as ME6 [as heard] had been somehow clear. As the results of Judge Scott investigations show ME6 organization had direct connection with Mr. Paul Henderson, an accused manager, in the use of gathering of informations from Iraq and that regime's arms activities. Therefore, according to Scott committee's conclusion, the British spying and intelligence agency could not have been uninformed of secret arms deal between Britain and Iraq. Furthermore, Judge Scott, in his investigations, has come to this conclusion that the officials of the Conservative British government, by plying with words and making use of various terms and interpretations, have been trying to justify their act and the breach of law. Nevertheless, one cannot have a clear picture of the British Government's extensive support for Iraq in the war imposed on the Islamic Republic of Iran until the investigations of Judge Scott are published by the end of the current year. The Conservative British government's hostility to the Islamic Republic of Iran was to the extend that the British Government had agreed to be involved in illegal and secret arms deal with Iraq. Judge Scott's investigations, which includes gathering of 200,000 documents and proofs during 400 work hours, are checked by the British Government to prevent disclosure of secret documents showing the government's inner corruption. But since the Scott Committee is popular among people and there is a high demand for the disclosure of truth, Judge Scott finds himself, as a neutral judge, bound to respect national interest and disclosure of truths. For this reason at least part of the Conservative British government's inner corruptions and the hypocritical image of its statesmen are expected to be put to the public judgement with the release of parts of the truth.
