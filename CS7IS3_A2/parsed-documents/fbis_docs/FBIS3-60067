A total of 160 agents from the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR], the State Judicial Police, and the Army participated in the rescue. Tonight, in a communique, the representative of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, Marco Antonio Baez Cardoso, announced that seven other individuals escaped during the confrontation. They include an adult female and two minors, probably the wife and children of one of the criminals. The Federal and State Judicial Police from Veracruz, backed by the Army, are advancing in the area and intensifying their efforts to capture these individuals. The report explained that, as a result of the operation, in which there were no casualties among the Amry forces or police personnel, three of the presumed drug traffickers, including the so-called "Commander Rojo," were killed, and four others arrested. One of the latter sustained serious wounds. Two Federal Judicial Police agents, Miguel Barajas and Oscar Ortiz, who had been kidnapped, were rescued, and three vehicles were confiscated. Tonight, the PGR announced that, on 6 December, Veracruz State Judicial Police personnel began the operations aimed at capturing 14 very well-armed persons, apparently under the influence of some drug. Wearing uniforms similar to those of the Army, they were staying at the El Pueblito Hotel, located in the municipality of Fortin de las Flores. On the previous Saturday, those 14 subjects had put out of commission a small plane with Venezuelan registration, on which they may have been carrying drugs. The plane landed clandestinely in the vicinity of the El Palmar Experimental Center in the municipality of Tezonapa on 16 August of this year, and was subsequently confiscated. Since those individuals had registered at the hotel as members of the Armed Forces of Mexico, "on a high-level military intelligence mission," an operation was mounted with the aid of the Veracruz State Judicial Police. When the building was surrounded, in order to prevent injury to the guests occupying it, the police had to allow the alleged members of the military to escape, because they threatened to explode several grenades that they were carrying in a "poncho." The office reported that four Federal Judicial Police agents were forced to accompany them, as virtual hostages. Later, using force and threatening to blow up everything around them, the criminals also abducted four other members of that corps. After both the Army and Navy had been queried, a report was received indicating that no group had been commissioned, as those individuals claimed. The latter included Jorge Alberto Vazquez Gallardo, better known as "Comandante Rojo," and wanted for nearly 12 years because of his known connections with individuals engaged in drug dealing. The operation was intensified on the afternoon of 6 December when, after pursuing those who pretended to belong to the military, the agents spotted them in the border zone between Veracruz, Puebla, and Oaxaca States: specifically, in the vicinity of the Tonto River. On the same night, six of the eight members of both corps who had been taken hostage were released. The PGR noted that, owing to the conditions prevailing in the area, and the fact that these subjects are extremely dangerous, it was decided to postpone their action and to reinforce the operation. Hence, this morning, with the aid of a helicopter, 30 Federal Judicial Police agents, reinforced by 60 Army troops and 70 members of the Veracruz State Judicial Police, tightened the cordon and prepared for the attack.
