It is important, however, to "have the courage to fight for Poland's position in Europe," the prime minister emphasized during a meeting with trade counselors held in Rynia near Warsaw. Polish trade counsellors from 28 European countries as well as the United States and China are taking part in the meeting. Cooperation within the "Partnership for Development" program gives us a chance to develop economic cooperation abroad. We should make efforts to achieve cooperation that is well balanced within the region and open in all directions. He added that, in the near future, information will be a strategic commodity in trade and in economic activity. Trade counselors' offices play a decisive role in the flow of information between Polish enterprises and their foreign partners. Unfortunately, according to the prime minister, there is no cohesive computer network to facilitate the flow of information.
