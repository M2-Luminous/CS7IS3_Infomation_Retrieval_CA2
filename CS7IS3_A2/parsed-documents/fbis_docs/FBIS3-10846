The minister also announced the construction of 31,000 new three and four story housing units throughout the country to help the poor. The minister said these housing units will be financed by Fonavi [National Housing Fund], mortgage bonds, and a percentage of family savings. The minister added, however, that in some cases the government will provide 100 percent of the financing. Alfaro said the government is anticipating a total investment of approximately $360 million a year. Sixty percent of this total will be financed through the sale of mortgage bonds and 20 percent will come from family savings. The minister did not give figures on investments in Lima or the number of units planed for the capital. He mentioned, however, the largest interior cities of Cajamarca, Ayacucho, Chiclayo, Piura, and Tumbes, among others. Alfaro, who left the Education Ministry and moved to his new post only three days ago, did not mention details, but added that other projects on the drawing board include the feeding of students, increasing the rations of the glass of milk program, building school centers, and implementing electricity projects. "These programs will create new jobs. We are thinking of building 300 schools on top of what is being contemplated by Foncodes [National Compensation and Social Development Fund]," Alfaro said. The minister made these remarks during his swearing in ceremony at government palace. Later, during a meeting with the presidents of Regional Administration Transitory Councils, he called for the immediate implementation of a strategy to fight poverty, defeat recession, and create jobs throughout the country through regional governments and by offering incentives to the private sector. Alfaro said that one of his portfolio's priorities is to fight extreme poverty and asked the 12 regional presidents and the presidents of Corde Lima [Lima Development Corporation] and Corde Callao [El Callao Development Corporation] to begin working seriously, cautiously, responsibly, and honestly. "Let us begin working immediately so that one year from now, in March 1995, the people can say now we have jobs," Alfaro said. "This is what the government wants, to create the greatest possible number of jobs," the minister added. During the meeting, the minister and the presidents discussed this year's projections and the programs that will be implemented in the regions. "We must make optimum use of our human resources. It will greatly help our development," the minister said.
