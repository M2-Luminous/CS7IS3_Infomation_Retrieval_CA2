At 1115 today a resistance group attacked Bra'shit and Bayt Yahun posts and reports say they scored direct hits on both posts. Zionist enemy forces bombarded Bra'shit, Tibnin, and Haddatha. More than 10 shells landed in Bra'shit. The townships of al-Mansuri, Majdal Zun, Buyut al-Sayyid, and Zibqin came under sporadic artillery barrage that continued until noon and caused heavy property damage. An Amal resistance group retaliated by attacking the Jisr al-Hamra' and claimed the destruction of a 12.7-mm machine-gun post.
