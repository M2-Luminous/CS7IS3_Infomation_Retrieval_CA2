Referring to the way Romania is known in Washington, the PUNR senator assessed that this knowledge is simplistic and distorted due to the lack of information for which the diplomatic mission representing us there is to be blamed as well. Mr. Adrian Motiu specified that during his meetings at the State Department and U.S. Congress, he explained that the PUNR is far from the description of extremism and that the verbal attacks of certain leaders have nothing to do with the way of action and thinking of PUNR. Referring to the Hungarian celebration linked to 13-15 March, PUNR believes that they must take place within a legal framework, without harming the national dignity of Romanians, our correspondent Ana Ionescu informed us.
