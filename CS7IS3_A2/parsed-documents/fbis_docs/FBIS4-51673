FBIS4-51673 "dreas085_a_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hata on New Electoral System, Tax Increase Hata on New Electoral System, Tax Increase OW0305125394 Tokyo KYODO in English 1245 GMT 3 May 94 OW0305125394 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Rome, May 3 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Tuesday [3 May] the next general election for the House of Representatives should be held under a new electoral system. Hata, who arrived in Rome earlier in the day on the first leg of a six-day official visit to Italy, France, Germany and Belgium, said the prime minister's power to dissolve the lower house cannot be denied under any circumstances. "However, looking into the reality, the Japanese people hope for an election under a new system. And basically, I am not thinking about dissolution now at all," Hata told Japanese reporters traveling with him. Bills centered on a change in the lower house electoral system became law in late January. Under the new system, 300 members are to be elected from single- seat constituencies and the remaining 200 through a proportional representation system. The present 511-seat lower chamber was elected from the multiseat constituencies. But the new system will not take effect until the single-seat constituencies are delineated in several months. Hata suggested it may take less than a three-month period for voters to learn the locations after they become law. "Some people think it is easier to restore their power under the current system, but it is shameful to hold an election based on such thought," Hata said, referring to opinions of some members in the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] and new party Sakigake [Harbinger], both of which left the coalition recently. The premier inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday, after the SDP withdrew when other ruling parties formed a new parliamentary group, "Kaishin" (Innovation), without consulting the SDP. "I will urge the SDP to reconsider. In apologizing for what happened, I want to appeal to the SDP before anything else," he said. Hata also said he does not rule out the possibility of an alignment of his party, Shinseito, and the leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), but an appeal to the SDP takes precedence. The LDP surrendered its 38-year grip on power last August, when it failed to maintain a majority in the lower house. Sakigake, led by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, was a coalition government member before it defected. It supports the Hata administration but refused to send personnel to his new cabinet. In relation to North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program, Hata pledged that Japan will deal problems with care and "within the framework of the (war-renouncing) constitution." His remark reflects caution on legislation to deal with emergencies, including possible international sanctions against North Korea. Hata also said he will seek the public's acceptance of higher indirect taxes, saying, "A graying society is at hand. It will be difficult to secure necessary financial sources working only with income taxes." He declined to mention the amount or timing of a tax increase.
