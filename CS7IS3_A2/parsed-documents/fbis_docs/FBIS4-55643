Speaking at a press conference in Prishtina, President Rugova said yesterday that "this is a tendency for disintegration of the political life in Kosova and if the Democratic League will be banned, this act would have been one of the grave provocation to the Albanian population in Kosova. Mr. Rugova said also that "it will not be a good step nor for the Serbian regime nor for the Serbians. President Rugova pointed out that the Democratic League of Kosova is the biggest party of Albanians in Kosova and it has been registered since 1990 in the former Yugoslav Federation in which Kosova was a constitutive unit. President Rugova spoke also of the Serbian military exercises in Kosova in which the Serbian defence minister, Bulatovic, participated. Mr. Rugova considered the exercises as "a grave signal at this moment."
