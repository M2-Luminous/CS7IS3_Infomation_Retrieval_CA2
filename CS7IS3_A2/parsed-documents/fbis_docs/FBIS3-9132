This week was marked there by the appointment of the new government and the parliament's approval of the date of the early elections this fall. Could it be said that the political crisis has been successfully resolved? [Havel] I do not think the latest developments mark the end of the crisis in Slovakia and the beginning of an era of stability. For numerous and varied reasons, real stability of the Slovak political scene and the creation of a political culture necessary for the peaceful development of the country are still some distance away. Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly an important and good move; it is a move in the right direction. I would not say it is a victory of some over others. I would say it is a victory for the parliament concept, a victory for democracy. [passage omitted] The whole process was free of chaos, uncertainty, lawlessness, and so on. As far as the government is concerned, I do not wish to provide any assessments or comments on it. I believe it will be a hard-working and nonconfrontational government. It might be relevant to comment briefly on the new Slovak prime minister, Mr. Moravcik, whom I know quite well because, at the time I was federal president, he was federal minister of foreign affairs. Thus, I had quite a lot to do with him. We went to the CSCE summit in Helsinki together. I must say that my cooperation with him was exceptionally good. He is an accommodating and very decent person, who does not miss an opportunity to either express thanks for a job well done or praise it. At the same time, he is a person who expresses himself openly and yet politely if his views differ from those of others. I liked cooperating with him. I think he is a decent man. I believe that a climate of democracy and a spirit of dialogue and cooperation will prevail in the government because these will indeed be necessary. After all, it is the government where, on the one hand, there is the Party of the Democratic Left and, on the other, there is the Christian Democratic Movement. This means that both poles of the political spectrum are present there. Without a real will for compromise, for search for compromise, for cooperation and dialogue, the government could find its work difficult. Let us hope it will succeed, and, above all, let us hope the result of the next elections is good and that this leads to a calmer period in Slovakia's political life. [Tamchyna] I have no idea whether you encountered anything of this kind in your circles, but, speaking for myself, it felt as if some reactions to the current events in Slovakia emanated an unconcealed joy that this political crisis no longer affects us and that the Slovaks should deal with this in their own way. Is this not a little dangerous? [Havel] This is a phenomenon I have frequently criticized, a phenomenon I do not like and one that I tend to brand Czech provincialism. [passage omitted] This policy is completely shortsighted, and the social climate or social mentality promoting this policy is no good, either. We have paid a high price for it in our modern history. This could be documented by many examples. I think that, just as we should not be indifferent to what is taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we should not be indifferent to what is happening in other neighboring countries or in more distant countries. We should all the more not be indifferent to what is going on in Slovakia because Slovakia is our immediate neighbor. Together with Slovakia, we have had many good and bad experiences. There are thousands of threads binding us together with this neighbor. Although we are two independent states now, neither state should interfere in political developments of the other state or influence its history. We must follow each other's actions very attentively and support everything that will facilitate good mutual cooperation. [passage omitted] [Tamchyna] Mr. President, you have mentioned several times in conversation, even here at Lany, the necessity of compensating our citizens for injustices perpetrated against them during World War II. The Czech Government has now stipulated conditions for the so-called humanitarian gesture toward victims of Nazism. Are you not concerned that this humanitarian gesture, based on the amount to be divided among an exact number of victims, could provoke ill will or an inappropriate reaction? [Havel] I think--and it was repeated often enough--that injustices cannot be undone. There are injustices that simply cannot be undone. No one could ever be compensated for spending 10 years in a Nazi concentration camp or in a communist prison, or for not being able to work in his profession for a whole lifetime, even if he were given a million korunas. What we are trying to do, with varied degree of success, is to mitigate these injustices, to demonstrate that we are aware of injustices having been perpetrated. Naturally, it is important that this gesture of providing 1 billion korunas should also express our knowledge of the suffering our compatriots had to endure during World War II; it should show that we are not indifferent to it. We want somehow to demonstrate our awareness of it without any hint of suggestion that this amount would in some way remove the suffering endured. I think it is very good, and it is not important what you call this. It is very important to realize that this gesture of our government does not mean giving up negotiations with Germany about what used to be called compensation, which was paid to many other countries in the form of restitution but which did not happen in our case for various reasons beyond our control. However, we think that this compensation, which the German Government also called a humanitarian gesture for its own legal reasons, is due us, and we are not giving up. These negotiations will continue, and I consider it my own personal duty. I have been engaged in numerous talks on this issue. [passage omitted] I do not consider the matter closed. On the contrary, I firmly believe that we will succeed in getting this settlement with Germany. It will undoubtedly contribute toward cleansing our relations with this big and important neighbor.
