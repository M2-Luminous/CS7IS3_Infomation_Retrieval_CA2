Tudjman has now changed his course. Has harmony been restored in Croatia? [Budisa] Croatia's Bosnia policy was double-faced. One could support what was stated in public, but what actually happened had nothing to do with it. There is now full agreement on the federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Mappes-Niediek] How do you view the planned confederation between the Croats and the federative Bosnia? [Budisa] We have nothing against a confederation. Yet, it has to be a long process. Besides, there is absolutely no reason to rush things. When two of the three constituent nations of Bosnia -- Croats and Muslims -- decide to join Croatia in a confederation, one can, despite all criticism, not deny the Bosnian Serbs the right to join Serbia in a confederation. [Mappes-Niediek] Your president seems to have a different view on that. [Budisa] Tudjman is convinced that it is time to set up a kind of watershed between two worlds that are politically and culturally incompatible. Yet, we want to prevent a new cold war between East and West. As long as Russia is ruled by democrats, we do not need such a watershed. [Mappes-Niediek] How do you perceive a solution for Croatian territories that are held by the Serbs? [Budisa] We have a very good law on the rights of national minorities, which has, unfortunately, never been implemented, not even in that part of Croatia that is controlled by the government. This has weakened our position in the negotiations. I am thinking of the many blown-up houses of Serbs, the difficulties for Serbian citizens to get their certificate of nationality, and of how the proportional representation of the Serbs was implemented in Parliament. The Serbs in Croatia constitute a national community. I think that Croatia will be forced to go somewhat beyond the regulations for national minorities. But there will never be a solution that would turn the Croatian people in any part of Croatia into a minority, as would be the case in a confederative solution. Look at myself, for example. I am from Drnis, in Dalmatia. Before the war 20,000 Croats lived there, constituting 70 percent of the population. Now there are 200. The house I was born in is now occupied by the Serbian police. For these parts of Croatia there cannot be Serbian autonomy. [Mappes-Niediek] As a result of ethnic cleansing, 97 percent of Serbs now live in Krajina. They are determined not to accept any solution beneath a confederation. [Budisa] There cannot be a confederative status for the entire occupied territory. This would only lead to a new war. Territorial autonomy can only be had for areas where the Serbs were a majority before the war -- that is, in the areas around Knin and Glina. [Mappes-Niediek] Do you still expect the violent reconquest of the Krajina by Croatia this spring? [Budisa] This spring? No. The current talks between the two sides are obviously going well. Serbia is being more and more affected by the sanctions, and the Milosevic regime in Belgrade is also the epicenter for the Krajina Serbs. The other side may not be cooperative now, but it will be in a few months.
