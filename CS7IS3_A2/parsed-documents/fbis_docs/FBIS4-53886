Both sides noted that economic cooperation between the two countries is developing satisfactorily. Denmark has resumed cooperation relations with Vietnam since 1992 and has listed Vietnam as a preferential country in its program of overseas aid. It has granted Vietnam a nonrefundable aid of 83 million kroner or $14 million for the restoration and development of Denmark-funded projects in Vietnam such as the Hoang Thach cement factory, the La Nga sugar plant, and the Dalat water work. Both sides noted that Vietnam has effectively managed and exploited these projects. Following the reopening of the Danish Embassy in Hanoi and the Consul General in Ho Chi Minh City, Denmark has informed Vietnam of a long-term strategic cooperation program under which the two countries will accelerate cooperation in preserving and processing of agricultural and sea products, developing cement production and distribution; and improving water supply, environmental protection, and care for women and children.
