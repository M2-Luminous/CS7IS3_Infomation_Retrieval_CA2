FBIS4-31861 "dreeu116_c_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-116 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 CZECH REPUBLIC _O_Health-Care Privatization Discussed _O_Health-Care Privatization Discussed 94P20862A 94P20862A CSO [Editorial Report] A debate is currently taking place in the Czech Republic on the best way to privatize health care to provide better care and operate more efficiently. A HOSPODARSKE NOVINY article of 22 April indicated that, after privatizing most other industries, it is now time to do the same for the health-care system. A total of 5,419 projects have been recommended for 644 health-care facilities, and 4,000 of these still need to be decided on by the Privatization Ministry. A total of approximately 10 billion Czech korunas [Kc] of health-care properties have already been privatized. Referring to the privatization of health care in another article of the same issue, Jan Zamboch noted that "the road there is actually a road back." One of the proposals calls for a centralized office that would disburse insurance funds and control prices for health-care services. Additional service coverage would have to be purchased by individuals privately. However, according to Zamboch, one objection to this plan is that it would prevent competition and that politicians would have too much influence over the health-care system; measures would have to be taken to keep politicians out of such a decision to make it more palatable for the average citizen. An independent Health-Care Commission would decide on the extent of critically required health care, regardless of cost involved; the insurance would not cover routine health care that citizens could provide for themselves. This would make it possible for the patient to choose between purchasing services directly from a doctor or through a commercial insurance company. The resulting competition should make many services less expensive. Zamboch rejected assertions that the quality of care would deteriorate and argued that the threat to a doctor of having an insurance contract canceled should lead to greater efficiency. According to an item in LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE of 11 May, in which a discussion between President Havel and Health Minister Ludek Rubas is described, Rubas stressed that introducing nonprofit organizations into the health-care system would violate the principles of competitiveness between health-care facilities and would cut down on efforts to improve the overall quality of health care. Rubas conceded, however, that exceptions could be made in cases of rehabilitation, child care, and long-term care. Rubas assured Havel that no great problems should be encountered in the course of transformation; the pace and nature of this transformation remains in question. In any case, the creation of some nonprofit organizations could be expected. In the DENNI TELEGRAF of 7 May, Rubas also criticized the low pay of the medical profession, which he said is lower than for other professions because wages were still being set by the government. Rubas admitted, however, that money for higher wages is not currently available. As one consequence, large numbers of nurses left the Czech Republic for Austria, although, fortunately, the Austrian hospitals now have sufficient personnel, and newly trained Czech nurses are entering the profession within the country. Also, insurance companies are compensating the hospitals at a rate of Kc300 per bed, while the actual costs are Kc500 and must be supported by the hospitals themselves. Minister Rubas then stated that he feels that the main task is to finish privatization of the health-care system. HOSPODARSKE NOVINY of 25 April published an interview with Deputy Health Minister Ondrej Typolt by Peter Misur. During the interview, Misur expressed concern that, during the past two years, expenses for health care in the Czech Republic increased with respect to the GDP by almost 3 percent. Misur added that an 8-percent rate would create a situation where "there are no standard solutions." Typolt responded that a major problem is the way government budgets are formed but warned against imposing any solution that would only preserve the current inappropriate structure of health facilities and lead to inflationary increases. In response to other questions, the deputy minister indicated that changes must be made in capital investments and that many of the construction projects will have to cease and more effort be placed on restructuring and modernization of the existing capacities. Typolt indicated that the "health insurance system must be changed from what is really a health tax to a system that would compete on the basis of cost containment, not on income." The minister said that he supported providing primary health care from general insurance but indicated that more controls may be needed over the health-insurance system. Typolt also said that he expected health care and hospital-care insurance to be combined by the year 1996. He concluded that a comprehensive legislative proposal for the entire health-care issue has been prepared and should completely replace the current law.
