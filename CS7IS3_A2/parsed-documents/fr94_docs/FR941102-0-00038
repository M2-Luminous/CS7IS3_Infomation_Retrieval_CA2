FR941102-0-00038 FR941102-0-00006 Contents of Notice To begin the notice period under the interim rule, the notificant organization must submit to the appropriate Reserve Bank a written notice that includes: (1) Certification that the requirements of Section 319 and the Board's implementing rule are met by the proposal; (2) a list of the shareholders of the bank prior to the reorganization and of the holding company following the reorganization, identifying the percentage of shares held by each shareholder in the bank and proposed to be held in the new holding company; (3) a description of the resulting management of the proposed bank holding company and its subsidiary bank, including (i) biographical information regarding any officers, directors or shareholders of the resulting bank holding company who were not senior officers or directors of the bank prior to the reorganization, and (ii) a detailed history of the involvement of any officer, director or shareholder of the resulting bank holding company in any administrative or criminal proceeding; (4) pro forma financial statements for the bank holding company, and a description of the amount, source and terms of debt, if any, that the bank holding company proposes to incur, and information regarding the sources and timing for debt service and retirement; and (5) verification that notice of the proposal has been published in a newspaper of general circulation in the community in which the bank is located that provides an opportunity for interested persons to comment on the notice for a period of at least 15 calendar days. As indicated above, the interim rule requires that the applicant publish notice of the proposed reorganization and invite public comment for a period of at least 15 days. This request for public comment is consistent with the Board's practice of publishing notice of all bank holding company formations and bank expansion proposals so that the public may comment in particular on the bank's record of serving the convenience and needs of the community under the Community Reinvestment Act. Objections to Notices Within 7 calendar days of receipt of a notice containing all the information required under this interim regulation, the appropriate Reserve Bank will provide a written acknowledgement of receipt of the notice indicating that the transaction may be consummated following the 30th calendar day after the date the notice was received by the Reserve Bank unless the Reserve Bank or the Board objects to the proposal during that time. The Reserve Bank may provide written notice of approval of the reorganization at an earlier time during the notice period. If during the notice period the Board or the Reserve Bank objects to the proposal, the bank holding company must file an application under section 3 of the BHC Act. 4 In this case, the notificant will immediately be notified of the reason for the objection, and of any additional information that may be needed to complete an application. 4 See 12 CFR 225.14. If the Reserve Bank or Board believes that issues might readily be resolved within the notice period without having to issue a formal objection, the Reserve Bank or Board may request additional information during the notice period to supplement the notice. Shortening of Post-Approval Waiting Period Under Section 321 Currently, section 11(b)(1) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1849(b)(1)) prohibits a bank holding company that has received approval for a transaction under section 3 of the BHC Act (other than transactions involving a probable bank failure or an emergency) from consummating the transaction prior to the thirtieth day following Board approval of the proposal in order to provide the United States Attorney General time to review the transaction for any adverse effects on competition in banking or the concentration of banking resources. The Bank Merger Act contains a similar provision applying post-approval waiting period to bank merger proposals. See 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(6). Because Section 319 creates an exception from the application and approval process established by section 3 of the BHC Act, a notificant who has met the criteria of Section 319 and the interim rule does not appear to be subject to the post-approval waiting period established under section 11 of the BHC Act. With regard to other acquisitions under section 3 of the BHC Act or under the Bank Merger Act, section 321 of the Riegle Act (``Section 321'') authorizes the Board to shorten the post-approval waiting period in any case to a period of not less than 15 days, provided the Board has received no adverse comment from the Attorney General relating to competitive factors and the Attorney General concurs with the Board's decision to shorten the waiting period. Section 321 does not affect processing of applications involving probable bank failures or emergencies. The interim rule incorporates these revisions to the Board's Regulation Y. The Board is currently discussing with the U.S. Department of Justice the types of cases that may qualify for this shortened post-approval waiting period, and invites public comment on the types of cases where this would be appropriate. As described above, the Board has adopted the following interim rule which shall be effective immediately, and invites public comment on all aspects of this interim rule. The Board also invites suggestions on other means of reducing the regulatory burden associated with its application and notices procedures. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), the Board does not believe that these changes will have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This interim rule will reduce the regulatory burden imposed by the Board's procedures on small bank holding companies in formation, and the Board is inviting public comment on additional ways to reduce regulatory burden.
