Minimum CCC Export Edible Sales Price for Additional Peanuts The minimum price at which additional peanuts owned or controlled by CCC may be sold for use as edible peanuts in export markets is a discretionary action that, by practice, is announced at the same time as quota and additional peanut support levels to facilitate the negotiation of additional peanut contracts by producers and handlers. A proposed rule setting forth the MY 1994 minimum CCC export edible sales price of $400 per st as well as other determinations not related to this notice, was published on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63106). Eight comments were received during the public comment period that ended on December 2, 1993. Comments were submitted by four grower and sheller organizations that supported the proposed $400 per st minimum CCC export edible sales price. Two manufacturers and two manufacturer organizations made no recommendations on this issue. For the reasons given in the proposed rule, the minimum price at which 1994-crop additional peanuts owned or controlled by CCC may be sold for use as edible peanuts in export markets is established at $400 per st.
