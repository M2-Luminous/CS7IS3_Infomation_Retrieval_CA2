Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc., Docket Nos. 50&hyph;348 and 50&hyph;364, Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, Houston County, Alabama Date of amendments request: August 17, 1994. Description of amendments request: The proposed amendment would modify Surveillance Requirement 4.3.1.2, Reactor Trip System Instrumentation, and Surveillance Requirement 4.3.2.1, Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System Instrumentation, to eliminate the periodic pressure sensor response time testing requirements. The Surveillance Requirements would indicate that the total channel response time will be periodically ``verified'' instead of ``tested''. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This change to the Technical Specifications does not result in a condition where the design, material, and construction standards that were applicable prior to the change are altered. The same RTS and ESFAS instrumentation is being used; the time response allocations/modeling assumptions in the FSAR Chapter 15 analyses are still the same; only the method of verifying time response is changed. Periodic calibration of these pressure and differential pressure instruments will detect significant degradation in the sensor response characteristic and assure equipment operability. Flushing of selected sensing lines during each refueling outage as recommended by NUREG/CR5851, ``Long Term Performance and Aging Characteristics of Nuclear Plant Pressure Transmitters,'' will mitigate sensing line response time degradation due to blockage that noise analysis testing techniques would have previously detected. The proposed change will not modify any system interface and could not increase the likelihood of an accident since these events are independent of this change. The proposed activity will not change, degrade or prevent actions or alter any assumptions previously made in evaluating the radiological consequences of an accident described in the FSAR. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not result in any increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. This change does not alter the performance of the pressure and differential pressure transmitters and switches used in the plant protection systems. All sensors will still have response time verified by test before placing the sensors in operational service and after any maintenance that could affect response time. Changing the method of periodically verifying instrument response for certain sensors from time response testing to calibration will not create any new accident initiators or scenarios. Implementation of the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety. This change does not affect the total system response time assumed in the safety analysis. The periodic system response time verification method for selected pressure and differential pressure sensors is modified to allow use of actual test data or engineering data. The method of verification combined with sensing line preventative maintenance provides assurance that the total system response is within the time limit defined in the safety analysis, since calibration tests will detect any degradation which might significantly affect pressure sensor response time and periodic sensing line flushing will minimize the potential for long-term buildup of contaminants which may impact sensing line response. Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed license amendment request does not result in a reduction in margin with respect to plant safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Houston-Love Memorial Library, 212 W.

Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;259, 50&hyph;260 and 50&hyph;296, Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Units 1, 2 and 3, Limestone County, Alabama Date of amendment request: March 30, 1994 (TS 318). Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment consists of six parts, which the licensee has designated ``A'' through ``F'' in the analysis of no significant hazards considerations presented below. The six parts are: A. Mechanical pressure and differential pressure indicating switches in the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) are being replaced with an Analog Transmitter/Trip System (ATTS) for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Unit 3. B. The BFN Units 1 and 3 reactor vessel water level safety limit is being revised to reflect the analytical limit provided by General Electric and the Level 1 Low Reactor Vessel Water Level setpoint is being revised to provide a more conservative limit. C. For BFN Unit 2, RPS and ECCS instrument identifiers are being added or corrected to enhance useability of the Technical Specifications. These changes do not reflect a change in equipment, operation of the associated system, or the safety function of that system.
