However, its unity now faces a challenge. As Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is Shinseito's "trump card," according to the group's secretary general Ichiro Ozawa, the Shinseito-led coalition was behind the formation of a joint floor group called "Kaishin" [Innovation] aimed at strengthening the Hata administration. The attempt, though, triggered the withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition, and the Hata administration has become the weakest government in the last 39 years. This turn of events prompted Shinseito members to express their frustration with Ozawa's political manners. While Ozawa still takes a bullish attitude, the "tremor" in the Shinseito is unlikely to be calmed easily. Ozawa Urges Shinseito Unity "Unexpectedly, we are forced to run a minority government. In such circumstances, we must further strengthen our unity," Ozawa declared at the beginning of the 10 May meeting of Shinseito secretaries. The next day, Acting Secretary General Kozo Watanabe spoke to party members perplexed at recent developments on the political scene: "Our participation in Kaishin was determined through due process, as it was approved by the party secretariat." The party executives responded quickly to questions from rank-and-file members because many younger lawmakers were very irritated with senior officials who, they felt, had not told the truth about the formation of "Kaishin." Even middle-ranking members in charge of interparty negotiations have shown their frustration with Ozawa's "arbitrary decisions." Former Economic Planning Agency head Hajime Aino openly criticized Ozawa at the 6 May press conference in Saga City, saying, "Mr. Ozawa has too much power." Friction Among Senior Officials On 9 May, Aino called on Ozawa at his office in the Diet to apologize for and withdraw his remark in Saga City. Nevertheless, Ozawa reportedly exploded at Aino, instead of forgiving him. Since the coalition has lost its majority in the lower house, the opposition is urging an early reshuffle of the lower house standing committee chairmen. Shinseito's Eiji Okuda, who is chairman of the lower house Committee on Rules and Administration, called for consultations with the opposition, saying, "As the minority government, the coalition will have to accept almost all demands from opposition parties, or they will open all-out war against us." However, Ozawa and other coalition leaders adopted a policy of "filling the vacant seats according to the coalition's interests." Okuda made his debut as a lower house member in the 1969 general election. Prime Minister Hata and Ozawa are also from the "class of '69," and Okuda is now a top Shinseito leader, ranked alongside Acting Secretary General Watanabe. A senior party official, though, said, "Mr. Ozawa has been showing strong displeasure with Mr. Okuda since the inauguration of the Hosokawa administration because Mr. Okuda listens positively to the opinions of the opposition." The official said relations between the two leaders became even worse after that, and now: "Mr. Ozawa never meets Mr. Okuda in person, even in the Diet." The class of '69 met on the evening of 9 May to reconfirm the unity of Shinseito's leaders' backing for Prime Minister Hata, but Ozawa did not show up. The "monolithic" unity of Shinseito has been shaken, but the controversy over "Kaishin" is not the only reason for its critical condition. No-confidence motions against the Hata cabinet could be adopted whenever they are submitted, and the coalition always faces the possibility of a general election followed by a dissolution of the lower house. As a younger Shinseito member noted: In such circumstances, the party "cannot rely on Mr. Ozawa's charisma alone." Some senior members are calling for a complete revision of party strategy, noting that "Shinseito would be better off seeking ties with the majority group in the LDP if Mr. Ozawa is really serious about policy-oriented reorganization of politics." Another senior official said "Shinseito has to adhere to an anti-LDP stance only because of his personal feelings." Members, therefore, are losing confidence in the party's political stance. Ozawa Still Shows Bullish Attitude "Anti-Ozawa opinions" have come to the surface at the local level, too. Representatives of the Shinseito Nara Prefecture branch called at the party headquarters on 12 May, and handed over a written opinion directed to Prime Minister Hata and Secretary General Ozawa. The representatives called for more democratic decision-making procedures in Shinseito. The representatives said: "It is hard for us to see the party's decision-making process. We believe this is a good opportunity to establish bottom-to-top communication in the party." In response, Acting Secretary General Watanabe politely said "we have no excuses." The party executives said "no other local organization would take such action," but they are troubled by the protest. Even in such circumstances, Ozawa still shows a bullish attitude. Following the inauguration of the Hata cabinet, Acting Secretary General Watanabe and Secretary Hajime Funada called at Ozawa's office to receive instructions on how to manage future political schemes. Ozawa reportedly told them he was confident he could break the LDP from the SDPJ because "the LDP will certainly become more arrogant." In a press conference on the evening of 10 May, he declared the inauguration of the minority government is "a good chance to clarify our own policies." Ozawa's political manner is often called the "logic of the majority and power." What will be the result of breaking the political deadlock now that Ozawa has lost the "majority" that was his ultimate weapon? Shinseito executives plan to meet younger members at the party headquarters on 16 May to try to cool their criticism. Yet, Ozawa is still the key person when it comes to forecasting the direction of Shinseito.
