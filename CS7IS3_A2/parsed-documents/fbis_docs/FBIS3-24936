In an address to Durban businessmen, Mr Buthelezi stressed constitutional issues surrounding regional powers were crucial for the IFP's participation in the poll. "Even if the government and the ANC/SA Communist Party alliance do relent on this issue of the double ballot, the double ballot by itself is quite meaningless if regions do not have the autonomy which cannot be interfered with by the constituent assembly," Mr Buthelezi said in a speech for delivery. The ANC has reportedly agreed to separate votes for regional and national parliaments, a major stumbling block in protracted talks between the ANC, government and Freedom Alliance aimed at getting the alliance, including the IFP, to participate in the poll. Mr Buthelezi had recently said this was one of the biggest reason for staying out of the election. But, the IFP leader said on Thursday regional powers outlined in the interim constitution were unacceptable. "The...constitution affords to the provinces less powers than under the present unitary dispensation.... No independent political expression is possible at the provincial level." Mr Buthelezi said the constitution did not allow regional parliaments to collect their own taxes, and suggested this would enable the national parliament to manipulate the regions through their budgets. He cited recent efforts by the Transitional Executive Council to replace the kwaZulu Police with the SA Police. Mr Buthelezi rejected the argument that kwaZulu/Natal was too poor to go it alone in a federal dispensation. He said an equalisation fund, normal among federations around the world, would be used to give the region required money. Mr Buthelezi further reiterated the need for a constitution recognising Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. "As the traditional prime minister to the king, there can therefore be no question of myself accepting a cabinet position in a constitutional set-up which excludes my king."
