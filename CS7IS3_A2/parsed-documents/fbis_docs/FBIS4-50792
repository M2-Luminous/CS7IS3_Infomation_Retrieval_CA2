Antwerp Mayor (Kors) welcomed Chairman Li Ruihuan and made an ebullient and friendly speech at a ceremony in the City Hall. (Kors) said: Antwerp is a small city with a population of less than 500,000, but it maintains good, cooperative relations with the "largest country" in the world. It received such distinguished Chinese guests as former President Li Xiannian and President Jiang Zemin. Now it is a great pleasure for the government and the people of Antwerp city to have the opportunity to receive Chairman Li Ruihuan. (Kors) said: Since Antwerp established a friendly-city relationship with Shanghai in 1984, the two sides have increased exchanges and enhanced cooperation in the economic, trade, scientific, technological and cultural fields day by day. To date, almost all big companies and enterprises in Antwerp have set up branches or offices in Shanghai or other Chinese cities. Among them, the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company has entered a very successful cooperation with Shanghai, and their cooperation may be called a model. (Kors) expressed the belief that Chairman Li's current visit will further promote the cooperation between the two countries in economic, trade, cultural and other fields. Li Ruihuan said in his speech: Antwerp is a world famous, major port. With advanced diamond, electronics, telecommunications, chemical, pharmaceutical, and shipbuilding industries, it holds a very important position in Belgium's economic life. Li Ruihuan was satisfied with the friendship and cooperation between Antwerp and Shanghai. He said: Since Antwerp established a friendly-city relationship with Shanghai, the two cities not only have constantly promoted economic cooperation and trade and cultural exchanges between them, but they have also made important contributions to promoting the political, economic, trade, scientific and technological, and cultural relations between China and Belgium. While China has entered a new stage of development in reform, opening up, and economic construction, Li Ruihuan hoped that Antwerp would fully play a leading role in further promoting the mutually-beneficial and cooperative relations between the two countries. Then, Li Ruihuan, accompanied by officials of relevant departments of Belgium and Antwerp, visited the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company and the Belgium Diamond Center, and toured Antwerp harbor.
