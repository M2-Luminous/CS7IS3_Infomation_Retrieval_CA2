Tokyo Moving Slowly on Market Opening Measures SUMMARY The Japanese Government appears to be making only slow progress on the package of measures it is drawing up to demonstrate to the United States that it is willing to open Japanese markets and deregulate the Japanese economy. This slowness is apparently due in part to divisions within the government over prospective parts of the package, such as increases in long-term investment and tax cuts. Infighting within the coalition government and a growing perception that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government is ineffective also appear to be slowing progress on the market opening package. END SUMMARY Japanese Government leaders continue to send signals that progress on the package of market opening measures that Tokyo is drawing up is proceeding slowly and will not be completed by the originally projected date at the end of March. According to the 16 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference on 15 March that a final package of measures would not be presented to the United States until the G-7 Summit in July. Although earlier reporting indicated that an interim package might be ready by the end of March, the 16 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun report did not quote Takemura as saying anything about such a package. Similarly, the 16 March Mainichi Shimbun quoted Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai as telling reporters on 15 March that it would be "impossible" to complete measures designed to deregulate the Japanese economy by the end of March. Kumagai reportedly added that it would "probably take until the end of June to resolve" issues connected with the measures. One of the factors delaying progress on the package appears to be that the government is divided over several of the most important measures in the package. One of these measures is reportedly a plan to increase investment under Japan's current 10-year plan for investment in public works projects by about 100 trillion yen over the current 430 trillion yen. This plan appears to have support from several cabinet ministers, including Director General of the Economic Planning Agency Manae Kubota, Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, and Transport Minister Shigeru Ito, all of whom belong to the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), the largest party in the ruling coalition. According to a 4 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun report, Kubota came out in favor of increasing the investment plan during a 4 March news conference, arguing that the increase would help jump start the sagging Japanese economy. A 4 March Kyodo report indicated that Igarashi supported Kubota and advocated increasing investment to 600 trillion yen. The 10 March Yomiuri Shimbun identified Ito as another supporter of the plan. In addition, Japan's two leading business groups, the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) and the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) have also supported the increase, according to 7 March Kyodo and 8 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun reports. The Ministry of Finance (MOF), however, reportedly opposes the increase because there are no clear sources of revenue to finance it. The 1O March Yomiuri Shimbun quoted Minister of Finance Hirohisa Fujii, a member of the Shinseito, a key party in the ruling coalition, as telling a 9 March news conference that discussions of the increase, "including financial resources, are just beginning and there is no need to change our pace." The paper also cited an unnamed MOF official as stating that "it would be irresponsible to make a pledge to expand investment when there is no hope of securing financial resources." According to Yomiuri Shimbun, MOF is particularly concerned about increasing investment in public works when reform of the tax system is still under debate. In addition, the paper reported that unnamed officials in MOF are arguing that there was no need to include an increase in the 1O-year investment plan in the measures the government is currently drawing up in the wake of the collapse of U.S.-Japan trade talks because the United States "has not once asked for expansion of public investment during the framework talks." Tax Reform Another contentious issue among the market opening measures is tax reform, particularly the timing and scope of proposed tax cuts. Some ministries and some bureaucrats, including some officials in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), appear to be pressing the coalition to decide quickly on a tax reform package to include in the package of market opening measures. An unnamed senior MITI official told an Asahi Shimbun reporter on 10 March that the ruling coalition should make a "quick decision" about tax system reform and include tax reform plans in the market opening measures (Asahi Shimbun, 11 March). Speaking at a news conference several days later, MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai also reportedly pressed for a rapid decision on tax cuts, stating that the government must come up with a plan by the end of June. The SDPJ has also been widely reported to be a strong supporter of tax cuts. Here too, however, the MOF appears to be blocking progress. The ministry apparently continues to oppose any measures to cut taxes unless sources of revenue other than deficit financing bonds can be identified to offset the cuts. During a news conference on 11 March, Finance Minister Fujii argued that the Japanese Government should not make hasty decisions about tax reform or tax cuts only in order to include them in the package of measures designed to address U.S.-Japan trade friction, according to an 11 March Kyodo report. Bureaucratic Resistance Resistance from elsewhere within the government bureaucracy may also be stalling work on some of the market opening measures, particularly those designed to deregulate the Japanese economy. The 10 March Asahi Shimbun quoted unnamed officials in the Cabinet Councilors' Office on Internal Affairs, which is reportedly charged with compiling deregulation measures, as complaining that the ministries were "reluctant" to draw up any measures beyond those that they have already presented to the Hosokawa administration. Similarly, according to the 10 March Yomiuri Shimbun, many government ministries and agencies are arguing that they have already implemented as many measures to deregulate their operations as they are currently capable of doing. Coalition Infighting A fourth factor delaying progress on the market opening package appears to be infighting within the ruling coalition government over the handling of the package. In particular, tensions between Prime Minister Hosokawa and Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa on the one hand and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura on the other seem to be spilling over into the handling of the market opening package. According to the 10 March Asahi Shimbun, Takemura was charged with overseeing work on the market opening package. However, because of the tension between Hosokawa and Takemura, some government offices seem to have been reluctant to work with the Chief Cabinet Secretary. The 10 March Asahi Shimbun reported that some ministry officials question whether he has Hosokawa's confidence. Tensions between Ozawa and Takemura and also between the coalition and the bureaucracy may have derailed Ozawa's planned trip to Washington at the end of March to discuss market opening measures. According to the 16 March Yomiuri Shimbun, both Ozawa and Takemura appear to have been working from different directions to resolve bilateral trade frictions, and Takemura may have seen Ozawa's trip as as undercutting Takemura's official role in coordinating work on the market opening package. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) appears to have resented Ozawa's plans to get involved in bilateral relations. The 13 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted MOFA and Japanese Embassy officials as claiming they never heard of plans for Ozawa's trip and denying that it had been approved by the Japanese Government. According to the 16 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, MOFA officials were miffed that they were not consulted about the trip. Outlook The divisions within the government, the resistance of parts of the bureaucracy, and infighting within the coalition will probably not only continue to delay progress on the market opening measures, but also to limit the scope of any measures that are ultimately drawn up. Some of the steps being debated, such as tax reform, involve deep, long-standing divisions among the parties in the ruling coalition that will probably be very difficult to resolve in the near future. In order to incorporate such steps in the market opening package without threatening the unity of the already splintering coalition, the coalition parties will probably have to work out compromises that will water down the measures to the point that they will have relatively little impact.
