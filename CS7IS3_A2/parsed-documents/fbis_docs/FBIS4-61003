This has been declared in an interview with journalists in Stepanakert by Karen Baburyan, the acting chairman of the parliament of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. He leads a Karabakh delegation to Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek to take part in a meeting of the heads of Armenian and Azerbaijani parliaments. Mediated by the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, the meeting has been scheduled for 3-6 May. In Baburyan's words, the gathering in Bishkek will largely depend on the position of Azerbaijan, "whose leadership is not too willing to maintain contact with Karabakh." He noted that broader contacts "would help to lead the conflict out of the deadlock." Taking part in the Bishkek meeting, initiated by the Kyrgyz Parliament's Chairman Meditkan Sherimkulov and the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, will be the Assembly's Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko, the head of Russia's Federation Council.
