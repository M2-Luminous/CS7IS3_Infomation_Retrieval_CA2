ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Georgia Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide iprodione (CAS 36734&hyph;19&hyph;7) to control target spot on up to 940 acres of tobacco transplants in Georgia. In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of written comments, bearing the identification notation ``OPP&hyph;180915,'' should be submitted by mail to: Public Response and Human Resource Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information.''

A copy of the comment that does not contain Confidential Business Information must be provided by the submitter for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments filed pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Susan Stanton, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC. 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, Crystal Station I, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202 (703&hyph;308&hyph;8327). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of the fungicide, iprodione, available as Rovral 4 Flowable Fungicide (EPA Reg. No. 264&hyph;482) and Rovral Fungicide (EPA Reg. No. 264&hyph;453) from Rhone Poulenc Ag Company, to control target spot, caused by Rhizoctonia solani , on up to 940 acres of tobacco transplants in Georgia. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. According to the Applicant, target spot became a statewide disease problem on flue-cured tobacco for the first time in 1991. Under conditions conducive to disease development, the disease may cause serious losses in transplant beds and field tobacco plantings. Growers who raise their own transplants could be faced with a shortage or complete lack of planting material if a severe outbreak occurs, since other sources of planting material are generally not available unless contracted for prior to the growing season. Also, the disease may spread to the field and cause tobacco yield losses if transplants become infected. The Applicant claims that none of the registered pesticides is effective against this disease and that, without an effective control, growers will incur a significant economic loss during the 1994 growing season. Applications would be made under the proposed exemption at 0.5 to 1.0 pound of active ingredient per acre of transplants in plant beds and greenhouses. Applications would begin when watersoaked spots first appear on leaves and be repeated 7 to 14 days later if conditions are favorable for disease development. A maximum of 3.0 pounds of active ingredient per acre would be applied per year. Applications would be made between February 1, 1994 and May 1, 1994. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the Federal Register and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption if an emergency exemption has been requested or granted for that use in any 3 previous years, and a complete application for registration of that use has not been submitted to the Agency [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(6)]. Exemptions for the use of iprodione on tobacco transplants have been requested and granted for the past three years, and an application for registration of this use has not been submitted to the Agency. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
