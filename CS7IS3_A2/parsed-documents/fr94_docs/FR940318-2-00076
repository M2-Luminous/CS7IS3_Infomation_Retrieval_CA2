L. 100&hyph;656) established the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and designated nine (9) agencies, including GSA, to conduct the program over a four (4) year period from January 1, 1989 to December 31, 1992. The Small Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;366) extended the demonstration program until September 1996 and made certain changes in the procedures for operation of the demonstration program. The law designated four (4) industry groups for testing whether the competitive capabilities of the specified industry groups will enable them to successfully compete on an unrestricted basis. The four (4) industry groups are: Construction (except dredging); architectural and engineering (A&E) services (including surveying and mapping); refuse systems and related services (limited to trash/garbage collection); and non-nuclear ship repair. Under the program, when a participating agency misses its small business participation goal, restricted competition is reinstituted only for those contracting activities that failed to attain the goal. The small business goal is 40 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for construction, trash/garbage collection services, and non-nuclear ship repair and 35 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for architect-engineer services. This notice announces modifications to GSA's solicitation practices under the demonstration program based on a review of the agency's performance during the period from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1993.
