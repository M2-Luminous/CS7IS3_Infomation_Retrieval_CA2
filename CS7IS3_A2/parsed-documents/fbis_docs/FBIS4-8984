FBIS4-8984 "dreeu076_p_94010" FBIS-EEU-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 POLAND No Agreement on Status of Russian Mission No Agreement on Status of Russian Mission LD2004114594 Warsaw PAP in Polish 1041 GMT 20 Apr 94 LD2004114594 Warsaw PAP Polish BFN [Text] Warsaw, 20 Apr--No agreement has been reached yet and no protocol signed on the legal status of the Russian military mission in Poland that supervises the transit of its troops from Germany to Russia, Maj-Gen Zdzislaw Ostrowski, Polish Government plenipotentiary for the stationing of Russian troops in Poland, announced today. In the first quarter of this year, the transit of Russian Federation troops from the FRG through Poland proceeded according to plan. The problem of the mission's legal status has been dragging on since the last meeting of the Polish-Russian mixed commission in September of last year, when no protocol was signed. Among the matters at issue was the question of expanding the mission's competences, as suggested by the Polish side. The Poles proposed the setting up of a new commission attached to the military mission, which would deal with claims concerning damage caused by the troops stationed in Poland and unpaid bills for communal services. The Russians suggested that the matters at issue should be dealt with through diplomatic channels; they also claimed they had paid their dues. There were six claims by Polish citizens and institutions in the first quarter of this year for damage totalling over 2 billion zlotys [Z]. In March, the Polish-Russian mixed commission examined 12 cases with claims exceeding Z3 billion, one claim for $331,000, and one for 122,000 DM [German marks]. Eleven of these cases were directed to diplomatic channels. The last subunit of the Russian Army left Poland on 18 September of last year. About 25 servicemen stayed in the military mission. It is expected that in May of this year eight members of the mission, together with their families, will leave Poland.
