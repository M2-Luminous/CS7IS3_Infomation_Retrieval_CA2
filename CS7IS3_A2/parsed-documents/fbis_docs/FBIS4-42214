The decision follows a report from Canadian observers that said last month's multiracial general election was fair and free. It ended decades of white minority rule. The secretary of state for Latin America and Africa, Christine Stewart, says this means Ottawa can now lift the embargo on government-to-government aid. Canada was a world leader in imposing sanctions against the white minority government to end apartheid.
