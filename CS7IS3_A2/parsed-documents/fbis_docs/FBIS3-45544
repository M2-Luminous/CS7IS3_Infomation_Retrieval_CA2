This is being done to safeguard the economic reform in the country and defend lawful rights of the foreign investors, Ren said when calling on Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew this afternoon. Ren and his 8-member delegation arrived here from Indonesia on Wednesday [12 January] for an official visit from 11 to 15 January at the invitation of Singapore's Chief Justice Yang Pung How. He told Lee that China and Singapore agreed to sign a judicial agreement in a proper time to better protect the lawful interests and rights of Singapore investors in China and to ensure a smooth development of the economic cooperation between the two countries, especially the planned Singapore-Suzhou industrial township which is a government-support project. Lee said it was only after 35 years of consistent and great efforts that Singapore established its current legal system, and it is just understandable that China, with its vast land and large population, would need several decades to achieve it. Ren expressed his appreciation to Lee's view and said that China is determined to reinforce its legal system with the efforts of not only this generation but also the following one.
