He was met at the airport by representatives of the mass media of Russia and a number of foreign countries. Our correspondent, Oleg Padenko, was present at the meeting, and here is his report. [Begin recording] The brief visit by Kim Yong-sam, president of the Republic of Korea, took place immediately after his talks with Boris Yeltsin and the signing of the joint Russo-Korean declaration on economic, political, and cultural cooperation between Moscow and Seoul. And here I will note that Kim Yong-sam is the first president of the Republic of Korea to visit Maritime Kray where 60,000 of his countrymen currently reside having, in one way or another, settled here after the Second World War. Thus, not only is Maritime Kray close to South Korea geographically, but it also has special historical significance for the Koreans. As was highlighted at this meeting, Korean immigration to the Maritime Kray began over 100 years ago. Some settled here for reasons of poverty and war, others with the aim of continuing the struggle for national independence. For them, the Maritime Kray was the promised land, a firm base for the struggle for independence. It was also noted that the Maritime Kray now is progressively turning into a center for Russo-Korean cooperation. Specifically, work on a joint fishing program is already being actively carried out here. Our kray is directly associated with the Yakutia, Republic of Sakha, gas project, and a new plan for the development of natural resources of the Russian Far East. Industrial cooperation is developing, evidenced as we know by the creation of the Nakhodka Technical Park, comprised of Korean enterprises; the establishment of sea routes connecting Vladivostok and the port of Pusan; the commissioning of the first direct Vladivostok-Seoul satellite telephone link here in Vladivostok; and finally, the opening of regular air services this year between Vladivostok and Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Today, the South Korean leader visited the Pacific Fleet's combat ship Admiral Vinogradov, where he specifically noted that such a visit is also a demonstration of partnership and mutual cooperation in assuring international security, specifically on the high seas. During the brief talks with the high-ranking guest, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of Maritime Kray, discussed the possibility of mutually profitable ties and guarantees from Seoul in attracting South Korean investment into the kray economy, primarily capital investment in the coal producing enterprises of the kray.
