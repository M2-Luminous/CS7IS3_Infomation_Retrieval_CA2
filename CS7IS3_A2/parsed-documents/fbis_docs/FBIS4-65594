The German-Dutch initiative presented to the Steering Committee of the 52-nation CSCE was published by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn and is addressed to the summit of the CSCE heads of state and government, which will be held in Budapest from 7 to 9 December. Kinkel and Kooijmans demand from the December summit the right for the CSCE to call on the UN Security Council, to work out recommendations, and to support their implementation by the United Nations if necessary also without the approval of the affected or defendant members. The two ministers voiced the demand for a considerable strengthening of the position of the secretary general, which is currently occupied by German diplomat Wilhelm Hoeynck. In certain areas he is to be able to call for majority decisions and to initiate himself immediate measures in critical situations involving members, such as observer missions.
