Moreover, it overturned the steps of simultaneous action [tongsi haengdong chochi] which was agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, aborted the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks by giving unreasonable excuses, and is scheming to isolate and stifle [apsal] our Republic under the name of the United Nations by laying our nuclear issue before the UN Security Council and instigating some insidious officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency. On top of that, while babbling that it will not rule out a preemptive military attack against North Korea, the U.S. bellicose class is bringing in nuclear war equipment, including Patriot missiles, to South Korea. Also, it is concentrating nuclear aircraft carriers and many military vessels around our country's neighboring waters. This clearly shows that the United States does not have the will to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through peaceful means, and that it is trying to resolve it through force. The hostile policy toward Korea by the U.S. imperialists is being all the more promoted by the South Korean nation-selling traitors and is bringing about a more grave situation. [passage omitted]
