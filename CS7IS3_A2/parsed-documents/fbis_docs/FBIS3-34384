In statements to MENA, he said that all the Jordanian Government did was request that the number of Iranian diplomats in Amman be close to the number of Jordanian diplomats in Tehran. He added that the Iranian Government did not object, and understood the motives of the Jordanian request, which was made according to diplomatic norms. He affirmed that the request had nothing to do with any incident before or after it was made. He noted that current Jordanian-Iranian relations are normal, that both countries have embassies in each other's capitals, that there is normal trade exchange between them, and that Jordan always seeks friendly relations with Arab and Islamic countries. The Jordanian Government had requested the departure of 21 out of the 26 diplomats at the Iranian Embassy by the end of February. In its request, the Jordanian Government explained that the move was aimed at achieving a balance in the diplomatic representation between the two countries because only three diplomats are working at the Jordanian Embassy in Tehran. While Iran announced its acceptance of Jordan's request, Arab diplomatic sources in Cairo said that relations between Jordan and Iran are somewhat clouded after Iran recently submitted to the Jordanian Government a number of proposals for relations between the two countries to be enhanced through popular, not official, political channels, over which Amman expressed reservations. The diplomatic sources interpreted this as fear of infiltration by pro-Iranian forces into Jordanian political life as was the case with Hizballah in Lebanon, especially at a time when the Jordanian Government is strenuously trying to contain the Islamic extremist trend that overshadows the country's political life. These developments come at a time when the Jordanian Government has expressed displeasure at the recent burglary attack on the home of Jordanian Ambassador in Tehran Yasin Istanbuli. The Jordanian Government believes that the Iranian authorities did not deal with the incident properly. These developments also coincide with the assassination of the Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut by people believed to be extremists and with explosions at two movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa' last week. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry has announced that it arrested a group of Afghan Arab returnees who received military training during the Afghan war against the former Soviet occupation. The Jordanian Interior Ministry said that these Afghans were responsible for the explosions at the two movie theaters. The Jordanian-Iranian relations improved after the end of the Gulf crisis. Diplomatic relations between Amman and Tehran were resumed in 1991 after a 10-year hiatus because of Jordan's support for Iraq in its war against Iran.
