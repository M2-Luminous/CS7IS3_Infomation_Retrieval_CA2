The basic purpose of our party is to serve the people wholeheartedly. It is all the more important for leading cadres to firmly foster a concept of identifying oneself with the masses. Reform and economic development require us to emancipate our minds and adopt new ideas. But this does not in the least mean that the concept of doing everything possible for the people can be allowed to become diluted. Yao Liejue's deeds show us: In the final analysis, whether a leading cadre can be honest and upright is a question of how to treat the masses. A leader's power is given by the people, and all the money and materials in his charge are the people's property which is created by them through hard toil. A leader who always keeps the masses in mind will never abuse the power given by them to appropriate their property. As reform deepens, our leaders at all levels should care for and cherish the masses all the more, help them surmount various practical difficulties, and share the same fate and breathe the same air with the masses.
