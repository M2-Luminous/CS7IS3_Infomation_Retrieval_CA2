He said: They talk to us as if peace has already been achieved. In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Dudin said that the Israeli negotiators' method of negotiation is completely different from the Jordanian method, for whereas the Jordanians are looking for a clear way of establishing a just, lasting, and durable peace on the basis of the specific Jordanian and Arab constant principles pertaining to the entire peace process, the Israelis are following a completely different approach and talking about matters and issues which are supposed to be discussed in detail after full and comprehensive agreement is reached on the main issues on the agenda of the Jordanian-Israeli negotiation track, the same as on other tracks. Dudin, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT after returning to Amman with the other members of the Jordanian delegation to the negoatiations, said: We believe that there is a clear and specific agenda including major issues which should be negotiated in depth. If we cannot reach full agreement on them, the peace we aspire to and work for sincerely and with open minds, will not be achieved. He said that their method of negotiation is basically focused on what they call "Israel's security" irrespective of reaching agreement on the issues on which specific agreements must be reached. The members of the Jordanian delegation had returned to Amman in implementation of the decision of the Arab parties to the peace process to suspend the negotiations temporarily following the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. Dudin said: To us, the topics on the Jordanian-Israeli agenda are of paramount importance. We well understand that it would be illogical to discuss very advanced issues that are supposed to come as a result of the peace process or of the peace agreements, before a comprehensive agreement is reached on solutions for the main issues still unresolved.... We are talking about the issues of water and our right to it, the occupied Jordanian territory, and return of the refugees. We cannot imagine any possibility of signing a peace agreement or moving on to other details which, in our view and in the view of the entire international community, would be results of the peace agreement, before clear and acceptable agreements are reached on all these issues. Dudin also said: I believe that there is no agreement so far between the Jordanian and Israeli views. The Israelis are using a negotiating language and approach only to serve their own interests without any clear inclination so far to discuss the main issues on the Jordanian-Israeli agenda. For instance, they say why should we not talk about tourism and combating natural disasters, why should we not be allowed to visit Petra, and why should we not discuss commercial issues, for your trade is going to be with us and not with the Palestinians, and other such issues which could only be tackled at later stages and can only be discussed after peace is actually established through agreement on the fundamental issues and topics, the most important being water, and our full undiminished rights to it must be fulfilled, our occupied territory where full Jordanian sovereignty must be restored, and the issue of the refugee problem which must be radically solved. Dudin added: All I can say is that, in the negotiations, we expressed our views strongly on the various issues and we told them that all the matters they have been raising would come after the establishment of a comprehensive, just, and durable peace acceptable to us and to future generations. [passage omitted] Dudin further said: The negotiations are clearly at a standstill now because of our different philosophies. We say that we will not sign any peace agreement before full agreement is reached on the issues on the agenda, but they clearly concentrate on matters that would arise later on and that, in our view, cannot be discussed before the main pending issues are resolved.
