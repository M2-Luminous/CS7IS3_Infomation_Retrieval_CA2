The polling area was broadened in 1994 owing to the inclusion of Karaganda and Almaty Oblasts. A total of more than 2,500 persons took part. [end boxed item] The high degree of trust in each other among all ethnic groups that was noted in 1992 is also characteristic of the beginning of this year. Sixty-four percent of respondents answered in the first poll that they trust the people who live with them in the same locality (the sum of affirmative answers: "yes"--42.5 percent and "sooner 'yes' than 'no'"--21.5 percent. In 1994 this sum amounted to 62 percent (41.5 and 20.5). People's perception and assessment of the condition and quality of interethnic relations also did not change. In 1992, 70.1 percent of those polled characterized them as friendly (27.2) and peaceful (48.0). The result is the same today. The number of Kazakhstan citizens who assessed the status of international [mezhnatsionalnyy] relations negatively is likewise almost unchanged. Stability and absence of signs of interethnic [mezhetnicheskiy] conflict are also indicated by the answers to the question "Have you witnessed malevolent treatment of representatives of your nationality or quarrels and disputes on national grounds?" The number of witnesses to these kinds of cases dropped by 20 percent. Data such as these point to the profound international character of interpersonal and group relations: 88.4 percent of the residents of the republic older than 16 years of age have friends of various nationalities, and a third of families are international. Of those Kazakhstan residents who responded, 83.2 percent live in multinational collectives, 85.4 percent live in multinational microrayons, and 93 percent have lived a large part of their life in Kazakhstan. More than 80 percent of respondents answered that their parents also live in Kazakhstan, and if it is at the same time taken into account that one-fifth of those questioned are people older than 50 years of age, it can be asserted that more than 90 percent of Kazakhstan residents are natives who have lived here for more than one generation. The results of the poll confirm that they really lived and continue to live in a peaceful and friendly situation: More than 76 percent did not take part in any kind of actions in defense of their people, and 15.7 percent took part in arguments in this regard. Analysis of ethnosocial relations in a national context showed that in 1993 certain new trends appeared in the mood and behavior of representatives of various ethnic groups, their treatment of one another, evaluation of their own social situation, and their reaction to the processes occurring in society. Two of them are of particular interest to the largest ethnic groups of the republic--Russians and Kazakhs. For the Kazakhs it is a realization of their responsibility for the preservation of international peace and accord and an understanding of the need to observe equal rights and opportunities for representatives of all nationalities that populate the republic. The dynamics of the indicators of national feelings, moods, and stereotypes of thinking and behavior of the Kazakhs show that there is an increase in trust toward people, a reduction in the level of intolerance and claims to special rights and privileges, and a realization of the necessity of international coexistence. In other words, a departure from ethnoegoism and ethnic narrow-mindedness, which to a certain degree was characteristic of the Kazakhs in 1992--the first year of Kazakhstan's independence. Despite the existence and strengthening of negative factors (socioeconomic and foreign, in the first place), the Kazakhs sensed that it was vitally important for them to maintain international accord and peace in the country. The number of Kazakhs who on the list of the most alarming contemporary problems named an exacerbation of relations between nationalities increased by 7.3 percent. But on the whole this problem was singled out by 22.6 percent of Kazakh respondents. There was a 10 percent decrease in the number of Kazakhs who prefer to live in a family of one nationality, and a 15 percent decrease in those who prefer to work in a multinational collective, but only 19 percent prefer to live in isolation from other nations--less by a factor of two than in 1992. But this is already at the level of other nations: Russians--13.7 percent, Germans--15.2 percent, Uzbeks--16 percent, and Koreans 14.3 percent. To the question: "Do you think that people of your nationality should enjoy an advantage?" more than half of the Kazakhs last year answered in the affirmative from the standpoint of elections to organs of authority. Only 32.5 percent think this way this year. A decrease of 11-18 percent occurred among Kazakhs who think that persons of their nationality should have advantages in the provision of commodities, privatization, allotment of land, enrollment in a higher educational institution, and job promotion. A year ago 28.7 percent of the Kazakhs supported the departure of non-Kazakhs, this year--14.82. There is a change in positions: While last year the number of those who supported the migration of non-Kazakhs was approximately equal to those who did not support it, this year there are three times as many of the latter. On the other hand, a reverse change occurred in the position of representatives of Russian nationality: There was an increase by a factor of 2.5 in the number of supporters of non-Kazakhs (the highest indicator among nationalities that live in Kazakhstan). Changes in the positions of the Russian population deserve attention. In the main, they retain friendly and peaceful relations with those people who live in the republic. And for those who do not intend to leave Kazakhstan, and this is an overwhelming majority (more than 85 percent), there is a characteristic understanding of the problems of national revival of the Kazakhs, the formation of a republic as an independent state, and the strengthening of peace and accord in society. At the same time, the results of the poll show that a feeling of alarm is growing among Russians over uncertainty in the future and in migration and separatist attitudes, and the level of trust in the people who live with them and in state structures is falling. Only 7.67 percent of Russians are confident of their own welfare in the future--this is less by a factor of three than optimists among Kazakhs (23.29 percent). While in 1992 the proportion of potential migrants among Russians was at an average republic level (7.7 percent), in 1994 it doubled (14.5). More than two-thirds of Russians were in favor of dual citizenship. In comparison with representatives of other nations, trust in the organs of state authority among Russian respondents was 10-12 percent lower, and the level of trust in people who lived alongside them dropped by 7 percent. Answers to the question "What do you think of the idea of retaining the territorial integrity of Kazakhstan?" are an indirect indication of separatist tendencies in individual regions of the republic. In North-Kazakhstan Oblast this idea is supported by 61.9 percent (79.7 in 1992), among the Russian population--only 51.7 percent (not supporting--23 percent, and 23.9 percent found it difficult to answer). Thus in this region in the course of one year a significant strengthening of separatist attitudes occurred. In the east of the country the number not supporting territorial integrity remained at the same level--10.6 percent. Interesting data were acquired on the question "How is an unfriendly attitude toward another people reflected?" While for Kazakhs last year this attitude was reflected predominantly in three positions: undervaluation of the people's past (18.8 percent), disrespect for traditions and customs (14.7), and a haughty attitude toward language (13.7 percent), this year, along with the first and third positions in the trio of leaders, there was Kazakh dissatisfaction with respect to people's preference for their own nationality in selection of personnel--16 percent (in 1992--8.2 percent). Among Russians this percentage increased by a third and is higher by a factor of two than among Kazakhs. In the opinion of almost a third of the respondents, the most unfriendly attitude toward them is reflected exactly in the sphere of personnel policy. However, this fact calls attention to itself--that the level of dissatisfaction among other nationalities on the placement of personnel according to national criteria is at the Kazakh level (among Germans--9 percent, Uzbeks--16 percent, Tatars--18.8 percent, and Koreans--14.3 percent). Moreover, if it is taken into account that the managers of a majority of enterprises in construction, industry, transport, communications, trade, and consumer services are Russian, then the sharp dissatisfaction of Russians on the personnel question can be explained by their reaction to the changes that are occurring in the existing status quo in personnel placement and also to the results of the propaganda of Russians and some Russian-language mass media in the republic. But on the whole the high percentage (22.1) on this position apparently indicates that personnel placement has been turned over to the control of managers, and also indicates a trend taking place in the establishment of multinational collectives, although this trend contradicts the polyethnic nature of our society and is losing the support of Kazakhs--only 15.1 percent of respondents would like to work in a collective where all the people are of the same nationality (23 percent in 1992). These are some of the first results of the research we have conducted. Processing and analysis is continuing. Interesting data were acquired on the largest nationalities after the Kazakhs and Russians: Ukrainians, Germans, Uzbeks, Tatars, Koreans, and also Cossacks. A conceptualization is required of the attitude of Kazakhs toward various parties and movements and religions. Finally, on the basis of the results acquired, light will be shed on the reasons for and factors in ethnosocial tension, and measures will be determined that could influence its curtailment in different regions of the country.
