FR941220-0-00054 FR941220-0-00010 Issue 8: Several commenters were concerned with potential impacts the listing of the Cherokee darter and the Etowah darter might have on normal agricultural activities and those of other private property owners in the watershed. Response: Based on the results of listing other aquatic organisms in north Georgia streams, the Service does not believe there will be any major impact to these activities as a result of listing these two fishes. Concerning the use of agricultural chemicals, the Service consults with the Environmental Protection Agency to determine if pesticides they register are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species. When the use of a particular chemical is likely to jeopardize a listed species, the use of that chemical is restricted. Thus, it is possible that the use of a pesticide could be restricted to avoid jeopardizing either of these darters. Any other new restrictions that might be placed on farmers or other local landowners would be due to activities involving Federal agencies, which must review their actions and determine, under Section 7 of the Act, if such actions would adversely affect these species (see the ``Available Conservation Measures'' section of this rule and the response to Issue 6 above). The Service stresses to landowners the importance of maintaining development-free streamside buffer zones to protect stream habitat and water quality upon which the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter depend. Maintaining such buffers should avoid many potential impacts to these two fishes. Issue 9: One commenter stated that reservoirs act as sediment traps, and suggested that dams may actually improve habitat conditions in downstream areas. Response: The Service concurs that dams may act as traps of alluvial sediments that are conducted down stream beds and overbank areas during flood conditions. However, conditions below Allatoona Reservoir, despite an obvious reduction in the bed load and other transported sediments, have deteriorated since reservoir construction several decades ago. Riverine habitat has been altered due primarily to the disruption of the normal flow and temperature regime in the lower Etowah River below Allatoona Dam. Dams should not be perceived as beneficial sediment traps; rather efforts should be made on a watershed-wide basis to abate sources of silt and other sediments resulting from poor landuse practices from entering streams in the first place. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter should be classified as threatened and endangered, respectively. Procedures found at Section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Cherokee darter ( Etheostoma ( Ulocentra ) sp.) and the Etowah darter ( Etheostoma etowahae ) are as follows: A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. The Cherokee darter and Etowah darter are both endemic to the Etowah River system in north Georgia (Burkhead 1993). These species have been rendered vulnerable to extinction by significant loss of habitat within their restricted range in the Etowah River system. The primary causes of habitat loss in the Etowah River system result from impoundments, siltation, point source and nonpoint source pollution which includes, but is not limited to, municipal and industrial waste discharges, agricultural runoff from crop monoculture and poultry farms, poultry processing plants, and silvicultural activities. Much non-agricultural and non-silvicultural habitat degradation in the watershed can be attributed to increased urbanization in the Atlanta metropolitan area. All such forms of habitat degradation and pollution disrupt the aquatic ecosystem, particularly impacting benthic (bottom) habitat. Certain pollutants may be particularly harmful in cumulative concentrations or if synergistic interactions with other pollutants or chemicals occur. Impoundments have destroyed a significant portion of the free-flowing stream habitat in which the Cherokee darter lives, and to a lesser extent they have impacted the Etowah darter as well. Based on museum records, at least five preimpoundment populations of the Cherokee darter were extirpated by the inundation of the 4,800 hectare (11,856 acre) Allatoona Reservoir, which was completed in 1955. Undoubtedly other, undocumented, Cherokee darter populations were destroyed by the filling of Allatoona Reservoir. The lower portions of some of the tributary systems that harbor populations of the Cherokee darter are inundated by Allatoona Reservoir, isolating these populations from other populations in adjacent tributaries. These tributaries include Butler, Shoal, and Stamp Creeks. Besides Allatoona Reservoir, numerous small impoundments and ponds are scattered throughout the range of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter. Impoundments directly destroy stream habitat by converting free-flowing streams to man-made lakes and ponds and by causing population isolation. Furthermore, small impoundments are numerous enough in the Etowah system to have a negative effect on both these species by causing population fragmentation and isolation, thereby blocking genetic interchange. Impoundments also alter the thermal regimen of the stream sections immediately below the dam and can cause community shifts favoring centrarchid fishes (Brim 1991), potential predators on both Cherokee darters and Etowah darters. The Yellow Creek population of the Cherokee darter is directly threatened by a proposed water supply impoundment planned by the Cherokee County government. During low flow periods, 30 percent of the flow in the Etowah River above a known Etowah darter site will be comprised of water from Yellow Creek reservoir. Although the effects of this flow augmentation in the Etowah River are not known, the change in water quality and temperature could potentially have a negative impact on the Etowah darter.
