Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told a joint meeting of the government and ruling party officials for foreign affairs that the remarks of Ambassador Kong are not the official position of the Foreign Ministry. Kong said Monday that the present ban on Japanese culture should be lifted soon in light of the current age of advanced telecommunications and mass media, which is rendering borders insignificant. Kong said, "it is desirable for Korea to open its markets now to good Japanese cultural products including movies." Paek Nam-chi, the party's policy coordinator, quoted Minister Han as saying at the meeting, "the government is not studying the issue of market opening to Japanese cultural products at this stage." Paek said, "the joint meeting agreed that studying importation of Japanese culture is not feasible at this stage because it could pave the way for a flood of foreign culture. And considering the special national sentiment toward Japan, it is not desirable either, as most participants agreed. The DLP is therefore opposed to any cultural market opening." The party's position is to refrain from mentioning the issue anymore, as the Foreign Ministry has decided not to study opening the market, he added. Meanwhile, DLP chairman Kim Chong-pil told journalists on Tuesday that now is not the time to begin importation of Japanese culture considering the national sentiment. He clarified his opposition to the issue, saying that the country should take a prudent attitude toward allowing in Japanese culture.
