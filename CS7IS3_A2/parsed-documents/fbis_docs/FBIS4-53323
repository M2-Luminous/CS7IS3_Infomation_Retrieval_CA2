Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), criticized the government over the planned toll hike in a press conference last week. The rise in highway tolls would have a strong impact on overall prices, he said. Nagano said he will try to testify at a public hearing to be held later this month over the proposed increase in highway charges. The hearing, cosponsored by the Construction Ministry and the Transport Ministry, will be held next Tuesday over the plan by Japan Highway Public Corp. for an average 10.4 percent rise in the tolls. In the meeting with Morimoto, Nagano said he doesn't oppose the construction of highways, the funding of which the highway corporation cites as a reason for hiking the tolls. It is not fair that only public charges are raised while other prices are falling, Nagano told the construction minister. Morimoto said, "I take the (Nikkeiren) president's remarks seriously."
