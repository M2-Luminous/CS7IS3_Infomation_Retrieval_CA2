Rossigneux affirms that the Czech Republic is willing to play the role of intermediary in such a transaction. She cites as evidence the minutes of a 20 October government-industry meeting in Paris and a report on the results of a 25-27 October visit to East European countries by the Aeronautics and Space Industries Group (GIFAS) commission in charge of exports. At the 20 October meeting, Rossigneux reports, the Ministry of Defense delegation on international relations asked French arms manufacturers to submit their sales proposals "as massively as possible," with special emphasis on "sensitive countries, notably Taiwan and South Africa." She cites an excerpt from the GIFAS commission report explaining the advantages of working with the Czechs: "Czech officials offer Western companies qualified and inexpensive manpower, a capable and underemployed labor instrument, and access to export markets such as Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Thailand, and New Zealand."
