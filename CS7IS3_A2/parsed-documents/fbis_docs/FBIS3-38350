On Tuesday morning there were at least three casualties, and houses were once again set on fire in the Burundian capital, but the Army and Gendarmerie are not interceding, added the ambassador, speaking at a news conference given in Brussels. It should be remembered that the Army consists primarily of members of the Tutsi ethnic minority. "We are asking Belgium and the European Union to increase their aid to Burundi, and to improve its distribution, so as to ensure that it reaches those for whom it is intended. A large proportion of this aid is actually being hijacked," reiterated the ambassador. The interethnic confrontations have been provoked by a new power struggle between the government of Mrs. Sylvie Kinigi and the extremist opposition, following the removal from office on Saturday by the minister of justice of five of the seven members of the Constitutional Court, which has to rule on whether or not the choice of Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira to succeed Mr. Ndadaye is constitutional. The dismissed magistrates are all Tutsis. The members of the Constitutional Court were ready to invalidate the election of Mr. Ntaryamira, explained the ambassador. However, the current atmosphere of violence has rendered it impossible to hold a new presidential election. It is for this reason that the Parliament (the majority of whose members are Hutus -- BELGA editor's note) elected Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira as the new president of Burundi on 20 January in an emergency procedure. This choice represented a consensus between all the political forces, for 78 out of the 79 deputies present had come out in favor of the election of Mr. Ntaryamira, and it is inadmissible that his appointment now be called into question, added the ambassador. The assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, during a coup d'etat by the Tutsi-dominated Army last October, had provoked an outbreak of violence between the Hutus and Tutsis, resulting in several tens of thousands of deaths and creating hundreds of thousands of refugees.
