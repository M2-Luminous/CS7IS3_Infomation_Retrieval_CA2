FBIS4-9616 "dreeu083_k_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 CROATIA Sarinic: Serbs Not Complying With Agreement Sarinic: Serbs Not Complying With Agreement LD2804182794 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network in Serbo-Croatian 1700 GMT 28 Apr 94 LD2804182794 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] Hrvoje Sarinic, head of the Croatian delegation for talks with Serbs in the occupied areas, and head of the state delegation for relations with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], has sent a letter to Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special envoy, concerning the results achieved in the implementation of the 29 March cease-fire agreement and problems in this connection, as well as the normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations on the entire territory of the Republic of Croatia. The letter reads, inter alia: The main precondition on which the talks were based was that the cease-fire agreement was only the first step toward the normalization of relations, after which talks were scheduled to take place on the opening of roads, oil pipeline, long-distance power lines -- i.e. on the normalization of the economic situation. The final part of the talks concerns the political solution: The inclusion of UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] in the legal and economic system of Croatia. The sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia has never been called into question and that was the clear and resolute stand of the international community. In keeping with the cease-fire agreement, the Croatian side has so far implemented all points of the agreement within the agreed deadline. The Serbian side failed to fulfill numerous obligations that it took upon itself -- we single out the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the separation of forces -- and it rejected the work of the police, in accordance with the proposal of UNPROFOR's civilian sector. All this goes to show that only a small part of the agreement has been implemented and that its key points have not been implemented in full. For this reason the UNPROFOR could not say that the implementation of the agreement was proceeding well and that both sides had a positive approach to and a desire to implement it. In response to our frequent demands that the agreed obligations must be met, the UNPROFOR asked us to be patient and give the Serbian side time. In our assessment the Serbian side has been stalling the implementation of the agreement intentionally, ultimately wishing to avoid its obligations. The key tasks laid down in the agreement were not implemented by the time of the last session of the joint delegation, held on 23 April. An agreement on the place where the new meeting is to be held has not been reached either. The Serb side has put forward as its condition for resuming negotiations the abolition of a part of a UN Security Council resolution regarding the supervision of imports and exports of goods on the occupied territories of Croatia. Even though the official representatives of the Croatian authorities have been trying to create a favorable climate for negotiations, the Serb representatives have been creating extreme tensions. In addition, they have been trying to equate the cease-fire agreement with the settlement between the two states, their goal being the Cypriotization of the Republic of Croatia, Hrvoje Sarinic writes in his letter to Yasushi Akashi, adding that Martic, Mikelic and others have been speaking about the need to open up the process of succession, about access to the sea, a corridor to Hungary, Slovenia, and so on. Their demand that meetings be held only on the border between the occupied and the free areas or abroad is also indicative. There are no indications today when the next meeting could be held, even though we proposed that negotiations may be held in Knin, Plitvice, or in any place in Croatia. We are aware of the connection between the situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina and behavior of the Serbs living in the occupied areas of the Republic of Croatia, but we are also convinced that such behavior and arrogance should no longer be tolerated and that there will be no positive results until the international community has forced the Serbs to comply with the resolutions and agreements that they have signed, not to flout everything and make a mockery of everybody and not be punished for it. From our viewpoint, the establishment of the supervision of borders, as envisaged by UN Security Council Resolution 769, is a condition without which it is impossible to bring the situation back to normal and create conditions for the resolution of the crisis, as links between Belgrade and Knin are stronger than ever before.
