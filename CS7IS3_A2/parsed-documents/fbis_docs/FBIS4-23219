For decades politicians have told us that the land issue was at the root of the opposition to racial discrimination and Apartheid. Even the most politically illiterate politicians or journalists bewailed the fact that only 13 percent of South Africa was available for use and occupation by the African people. These were the miserable bits of land that remained after the conquest of the African people. These were the so-called "Reserves", "scheduled areas" or "homelands" of the various tribes. Even the most oppressive White governments promised not to take away these lands from the King, Paramount chiefs, and chiefs who administered the lands in accordance with the hallowed principles of African customary law. Throughout the negotiations politicians of all parties gave "assurances" that the communal land system would be safeguarded and that the position of traditional leadership would be preserved. Any doubts expressed by anyone were met with indignant and vehement denials combined with hypocritical expressions of respect for traditional rulers. Numerous meetings were held in which traditional rulers were told that their interests would be safe under the government of national unity. When His Majesty the King of the Zulus demanded actual legal and constitutional guarantees it was alleged that His Majesty was acting as a pawn of Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, President of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. Expensive advertisements presented the so-called "offer" of "power" to the King. It was pointed out that His Majesty did not want anything personal but that the issues were those of the Kingdom, communal lands and judicial powers in terms of customary law. Much verbal propaganda and even abuse followed the rejection of the inadequate ANC "offer". The KwaZulu Legislative Assembly in the exercise of its legitimate constitutional powers transferred the KwaZulu communal lands to a Trust with His Majesty the King as the sole Trustee. This is not only in accordance with modern law but represents the position in indigenous customary law. The law passed by the KwaZulu legislature was submitted to the then State President for signature and became law. In this way the communal lands continued to be the property of the Zulu people and the status quo on land was preserved. The furor that has broken out has been extremely revealing. We are now told that the object was to place communal lands in the hands of the state for purposes of distribution! We had all along believed that distribution meant taking land from the rich and giving it to poor black farmers. State land is governed by Roman-Dutch law principles. Communal land is governmed by African customary law. At a stroke of the pen the World Trade Centre negotiators by "sufficient consensus" gave all the communal lands in South Africa to the central state. We all owe a debt of gratitude to the members of the KwaZulu Legislative Council for doing their utmost to safeguard the communal lands. In so doing they have exposed the hollow hypocrisy of those who have shouted from the housetops that they respect the King of the Zulus and all other traditional rulers and chiefs. The wholesale movement of millions of people to the cities that would follow state manipulation of communal lands would render the impractical Reconstruction and Development Programme even more difficult to fulfill. Instead of the partisan castigation of KwaZulu and its leadership all reasonable politicians and commentators should avoid superficial generalities and recognise the need not only to safeguard the existing communal lands but to greatly increase them as an essential feature of land reform.
