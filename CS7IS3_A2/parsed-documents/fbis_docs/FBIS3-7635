In March alone Pyongyang has sent nine missions abroad, chiefly to non-aligned nations, with a view to easing international pressure for sanctions and avoiding full outside inspection of its nuclear facilities, according to the official North Korea watcher here, NAEWOE press. Among the nine missions were three sent directly by the Foreign Ministry, each headed by a vice minister-level official. One led by Kim Yong-il is traveling to West African countries: It has already visited Mali and Senegal and will proceed to Guinea and Ghana. Another headed by Pak Myong-ku visited Mongolia, meeting the Mongolian premier in Ulaanbaatar last Friday, NAEWOE quoted North Korean media as reporting. The third led by Kim Chang-kyu visited Thailand from March 18-22 and Malaysia from March 25-28. Meeting the premiers and foreign ministers of these two countries, Kim reportedly explained North Korea's plans to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if Washington continues applying pressure. He is scheduled to visit Singapore from March 29-31 and Indonesia from April 1-3. Earlier, a Workers' Party mission headed by Secretary Hwang Chang-yop visited Vietnam and Laos. In a meeting with Vietnamese Communist Party leaders on March 7, Hwang sought to increase cooperation between the two countries and win Vietnamese support. In Laos, he met with Laotian political leaders on March 10. Other missions sent overseas were led by Vice President Kim Pyong-sik, Education Commission Chairman Choe Ki-yong, Vice Premier Hong Song-nam, Supreme People's Assembly Secretariat Director Yi Mong-ho and Vice Information Committee Chairman Yi Pong-hui. Vice President Kim's team is currently visiting Venezuela after stopping in Peru and Ecuador, while Education Commission Chairman Choe is in Syria as President Kim Il-song's special envoy after a trip to Egypt from March 20-23. Vice Premier Hong is visiting Pakistan from March 25 to April 13 to boost bilateral economic cooperation and seek Pakistani support in the nuclear row. Heading the North Korean delegation to the 91st Inter- Parliamentary Union general meeting held in Paris, Supreme People's Assembly Secretariat Director Yi explained Pyongyang's position on the nuclear dispute in meetings with national delegations. Joining in this diplomatic campaign to evade international pressure over the nuclear standoff are North Korean diplomats in Africa and Latin America, according to NAEWOE.
