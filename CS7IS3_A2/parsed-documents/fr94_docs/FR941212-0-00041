FR941212-0-00041 FR941212-0-00015 10. By contrast, if we eliminate the ban, LECs might seek to acquire cable systems in their service areas to eliminate competition in the provision of video delivery services. They might also have incentives to acquire cable facilities to eliminate a likely competitor in the provision of local telephone services. At the same time, elimination of the ban would unacceptably increase cable operator's incentives to move their video programming to a LEC's video dialtone system, rather than make the changes necessary to respond effectively to competition. We therefore disagree with parties who argue that eliminating the ban would allow market forces to dictate the deployment of video dialtone technology. 11. While we thus generally retain the ban on acquisitions of cable facilities for provision of video dialtone, we conclude that allowing telephone companies to lease cable company drop wires, if the lease is limited in scope and duration, should be permitted. Our prohibition on acquisitions of in-region cable facilities is intended generally to encourage the development of competing LEC and cable video delivery systems. We do not believe that permitting LECs to lease drop wires from a cable operator for a limited term of three years on a non-exclusive basis will impede the realization of this goal. In particular, we do not believe that any revenues that a cable operator may derive from such leases would be sufficient to affect materially its decision to use video dialtone or provide a competitive transmission service. Moreover, permitting LECs to lease cable drops could accelerate the delivery of video dialtone services to end users and thus increase competition in the video marketplace. Therefore, we do not prohibit such leasing arrangements, provided they are executed for non-renewable terms no longer than three years. At the conclusion of the three-year period, LECs are prohibited from acquiring the cable drop wires. 12. We also prohibit LECs from acquiring exclusive rights to use cable drops. Specifically, LECs may not unreasonably restrict the access of any video programmer to leased cable drops, nor may they restrict cable operators from providing to third parties drops not covered by the LEC lease. We will require any LEC proposing to lease cable drop wires to describe in its Section 214 video dialtone application the material terms of that lease, including the cost of the lease to the LEC. We will scrutinize these terms to ensure that they are reasonable and, in particular, do not undermine our goal of promoting competitive wire-based video systems. C. Ownership Affiliation Standards 13. We affirm the ownership affiliation standard of up to 5%, as adopted in the Second Report and Order. We modify the Second Report and Order, however, by defining more clearly the application of the standard. For example, we hold that, while a nonvoting ownership interest, which confers no power to control or influence decision making, may not implicate the purposes of the mass media multiple ownership rules, that same interest may raise concern about incentives for discrimination. The same could be true for a 49% interest in an entity with a single majority shareholder. In light of these different goals, we decline to apply all aspects of the mass media multiple ownership rules to video dialtone. We do, however, modify the Second Report and Order, by clarifying that the provisions of our mass media multiple ownership standards relating to vertical ownership chains, not involving investment companies, do apply in the video dialtone context. While the Second Report and Order did not specifically address this issue, these rules are essential to ensure that LECs cannot avoid ownership limitations by using intervening corporate entities. We also hold that, consistent with the statutory prohibition on provision by LECs of video programming to subscribers in their telephone service areas, an LEC may not hold an ownership interest of 5% or greater in a video programmer that offers service in the LEC's telephone service area. For purposes of the video dialtone rules, we define a video programmer as any person who provides video programming directly, or indirectly through an affiliate, to subscribers. Any entity shall be deemed to ``provide'' video programming if it determines how video programming is presented for sale to subscribers, including making decisions concerning the bundling or ``tiering'' of the programming or the price, terms, or conditions on which the programming is offered to subscribers. 14. We clarify that our cross-ownership rules do not prohibit LECs from owning video programming, even programming that another, independent programmer ( i.e. , a programmer neither owned nor controlled by the LEC) provides over the LEC's video dialtone system. Nor is any LEC prohibited from owning entities that provide video programming outside its service area. LECs may not, however, provide or distribute any video programming directly to subscribers in their telephone service area. Further, LECs may not hold a cognizable ownership interest, as defined above, in any entity that provides video programming directly to subscribers in their telephone service area. D. Non-Ownership Relationships and Activities Between Telephone Companies and Video Programmers 15. We affirm our decision to permit LECs to enter into non-ownership relationships that exceed a carrier-user relationship with video programmers, but modify our rules in this area in several respects. We relax these rules in two respects: First, we permit LECs to offer enhanced and other nonregulated services related to video programming to any video programmer, in areas substantially served by a video dialtone platform, without regard to whether the video programmer purchasing such services has a nexus to that platform. An area shall be considered substantially served by a video dialtone platform if video dialtone service is available to a significant majority_ i.e. , 70%_of the households in that area. Second, we permit LECs to enter into certain other types of non-ownership relationships with video programmers who are not franchised cable operators, without regard to the existence of a video dialtone platform.
