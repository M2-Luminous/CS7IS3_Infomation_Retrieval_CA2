What problems does the president's inner circle work on? These questions are definitely of interest to many citizens of Kazakhstan. Therefore we decided to pose these questions to Imangali Tasmagambetov. Our choice is not accidental: Imangali Nurgaliyevich has daily contacts with the president probably more often than anybody else, participates in discussions of various problems, and sees him during moments of rest. [Question] Why not start the conversation with the question of how you met the president? [Tasmagambetov] It was in 1989, on the eve of the organizational plenum of the Central Committee of Kazakhstan Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], to which Nursultan Abishevich was invited. On the agenda were multicandidate elections for first secretary, with six contenders on the slate. Before the plenum began, Nursultan Abishevich gathered all six and announced over a cup of tea: "Consider us acquainted. I completely trust your plenum and am ready to work with whoever is elected." FROM OUR FILE. Before becoming the president's aide, Imangali Tasmagambetov had worked as a teacher, first secretary of the Atyrau Oblast Komsomol Committee, and first secretary of the Kazakhstan Komsomol Central Committee, as well as chairman of the republic State Committee for Youth Affairs. Candidate of philosophy. Married. Father of three. The youngest--a son--just turned one month. [Question] Did you study in Atyrau? [Tasmagambetov] No. I graduated from the Department of Natural Sciences and Geography of the Urals Pedagogical Institute. Its distinction lay in its preservation of the traditions established by talented scholars from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Many are no longer with us, but the traditions remained in Uralsk. I consider myself very lucky to have graduated from this school. [Question] Was your candidate thesis in philosophy somehow related to pedagogic issues? [Tasmagambetov] Not quite. It was titled "Philosophical Aspects of Ecological Problems." The topic, as you may see, is on the border of two sciences--geography and biology. The task was to attempt to analyze, by comparing the interrelations of various social groups, their views on ecological problems. [Question] You see in your line of work how the president's team is formed. Our readers will probably be interested to know about this process. [Tasmagambetov] Forming a team is a complex process, since we are talking about putting together a collective of like-minded people. This means it is necessary not only to find intelligent, competent specialists. It is also necessary for each person who comes to work here to be able to see the problem they are facing from the viewpoint of the state. And while in the past candidates for high-level positions were selected from among people with "practical experience," now everyone in the president's circle must be first and foremost an ideologue, whether we are speaking of banking or a market economy. [Question] How many specialists are there working on the president's team? [Tasmagambetov] Three hundred and ninety persons in positions of responsibility. [Question] That is all?! [Tasmagambetov] Yes. You are surprised, but some people may think this is too many. I will tell you for comparison that just a few years ago the apparat of the VLKSM [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] Central Committee, which I knew, had more than 1,000 staff in positions of responsibility. Now we are talking about the apparat of the president of a large state. You cannot economize on talented specialists. We are used to economizing, and that is why we live such a life... [Question] But people not only come. To put together a perfect team, you have to let some go... [Tasmagambetov] This is very painful. And not only for those who have to leave. I have noticed that Nursultan Abishevich takes it very hard when he has to part with someone. And the main reason is not personal qualities but the loss of the sense of the times: For a number of reasons a person cannot work in the dynamic rhythm life demands of us, does not perceive the logic of change. [Question] By the way, speaking about dynamics. What does the president's day look like? [Tasmagambetov] His schedule is very busy. As a rule, no days off. Take, for instance, a recent day--10 March. From 0900 to 0930 the president prepared for his working day and reviewed documents. At 0930 he received the leaders of another state. At 1030 at an expanded meeting he listened to the report on recently held elections. From 1200 to 1600 (with a break for lunch) he conducted intensive negotiations with representatives of the Chevron company. From 1600 to 1800 listened to a report on the progress of privatization in Semipalatinsk Oblast. From 1800 to 2000 the president looked through business mail, conducted telephone conversations with top officials of oblasts and the republic. At 2000 he began studying documents related to a brief visit by Geydar Aliyev. From 2100 to 0030--meeting with Aliyev and a press conference for journalists on the results of the visit. [Question] Are you with the president the entire work day? [Tasmagambetov] Yes. I am at work by 0800 in order to prepare all the necessary information for the president, and go home half an hour to an hour after Nursultan Abishevich leaves, after "transcribing" his comments and proposals regarding the next work day. [Question] What else is included in your duties? [Tasmagambetov] Together with members of other departments, I study and analyze the sociopolitical situation in the republic. [Question] How do you manage to sustain such a pace? [Tasmagambetov] I have to. You should ask whether the president has any chance to rest. [Question] Consider it asked. [Tasmagambetov] Generally, it is practically impossible to talk him into taking some rest. But sometimes he does cave in and leaves for an hour to shake off the stress on the tennis court. I have noticed that tennis is the best way for the president to relieve tension. Once a week is an absolute necessity. And also--songs. You will be surprised, even professional performers are surprised, that Nursultan Abishevich knows by heart a tremendous number of songs--both modern and folk. Generally, the Nazarbayevs are a very musical family. As a example I will tell you an incident that took place in America during a reception given by Vice President Gore. Gore told his guests what a wonderful singer Nursultan Abishevich is, recollecting his visit to Kazakhstan. The guests began to applaud and asked him to sing. They came out as a trio--Nursultan Abishevich, Sara Alpysovna, and their daughter. They sang together, and then Dariga sang a song on Abay's lyrics. And finally the Americans were totally elated when they heard Dariga sing an Elvis Presley song in English. Nursultan Abishevich joked later: "All the things you have to do for your country!" [Question] Does Nursultan Abishevich visit his native parts? [Tasmagambetov] Over the seven months that I have been working with the president, this has happened only once, when he went to a class reunion on the occasion of his school's anniversary. [Question] We have been talking to you for an hour now, and we have noticed, Imangali Nurgaliyevich, that during this time you were twice asked for an appointment. And you did not say either "yes" or "no." Is this diplomatic finesse? [Tasmagambetov] This is reality. I understand very well that in both instances an appointment is needed on an urgent matter. But there is a tight schedule, and it is very difficult to squeeze anything in. Therefore, both meetings had to be moved to another time, after coordinating with the president. Right now the president's schedule is filled by the hour for a month ahead. International visits are scheduled and discussed half a year in advance. [Question] What particularly concerns the president today? [Tasmagambetov] First and foremost economic issues. The president is not satisfied with the progress of reform in the republic. Therefore, in the second part of April and in May a considerable amount of time will be devoted to the country's economic problems, in order to define in detail the strategy and tactics of the reform. The second item that concerns the president is preservation of stability and interethnic accord in our society. You can put it this way: The president's unchangeable credo at all times is the idea of a single economic and spiritual space. [Question] We are frequently visited by foreign consultants. This practice is somewhat disturbing. Sometimes one gets the impression that we know more about their life than they about ours. But the spiritual and intellectual potential of our people is certainly just as high. Can it be that we are short on educated people? [Tasmagambetov] I understand that many people now have an opportunity to travel. And suddenly everybody began to appreciate the advantages of a market economy. But visual comparison is not the same as analysis; it is not a scientific approach to the problem. Therefore we need to both send our specialists there for internship and invite the most authoritative specialists of the world here. [Question] The president certainly receives a lot of mail. And in that sea of mail surely there are some letters that deserve attention from the viewpoint of economic transformations. How does the president react to comments and proposals from the local level? [Tasmagambetov] You are right. There is a sack of letters for the president every day. We have a letters department, which selects and sorts out correspondence. Nursultan Abishevich is indeed interested in letters whose authors contemplate ways of getting out of the crisis, problems of state importance, and offer competent economic advice. Some of them the president answers personally. All in all, however, there are all kinds of letters--with words of support, gratitude; there are congratulations on some or other occasion; and quite a few complaints. [Question] It is hard to imagine Clinton or Mitterrand receiving complaints. We, however, have developed a habit over decades: If anything happens--write to the newspaper or the president. [Tasmagambetov] Unfortunately, this is our reality. I cannot reproach people for turning to the president with complaints or requests at a time that is difficult in the socioeconomic sense. Because this is the way it has been for decades, when we were told that everything will be decided for you up there, at the top. But the real question as I understand it is whether you yourself have done everything possible to solve your own problems and whether the letter really should go all the way to the level of the president. I am convinced that when we achieve economic well-being, the number of letters to the president will not diminish. Perhaps only the character of the mail will change. [Question] Do you ever argue with the president? [Tasmagambetov] The president is a man open to a debate and polemics. He is willing to listen to his opponent's arguments, and if they sound convincing he will agree with the interlocutor. [Question] Do you go on all trips with the president? [Tasmagambetov] Almost all. I can even tell you the figure--how many "flight" hours we have accumulated over the past five months. It comes to more than 140 hours. [Question] Much has already been written about the president's visit to the United States. It was clear from television reports that Nazarbayev and Clinton liked each other. Did this happen right away? [Tasmagambetov] I think that much depended on the personal qualities of the two leaders. As to liking, it is only extended to equals. The Americans could not fail to appreciate Nazarbayev's sincere desire for democratic and economic reforms and his enormous conviction of their necessity; his ability to think in world categories, the desire to absorb the best there is in world practice, and to build a truly secular state taking into account historic traditions and multiethnic nature of his people. After all, as the hero of a Marcel Proust novel said: "...the world was not created just once; it is being created an indefinite number of times."
