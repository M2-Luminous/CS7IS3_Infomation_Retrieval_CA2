[Al-Husayni] [words indistinct] ready to hear even about that. [Ben-Menahem] But there has been progress today in the Taba talks. [Al-Husayni] Yes, progress has been achieved in the Taba talks and I believe that it is possible to reach agreement by the end of this month, but all this is conditional on the Palestinian people's perception that something is happening on the ground. Otherwise, even if, ultimately, after further delay a good agreement is reached, a stage will come where the people will no longer be prepared to hear what we are saying. Consequently, it will be difficult to implement any agreement that is reached. [Ben-Menahem] What do you expect now from the Israelis? [Al-Husayni] I believe that the Israelis should begin releasing prisoners, should clearly state that no prisoner will remain in Israeli jails, should change the firing orders in the streets, and should stop demolishing homes under different pretexts. It is unnecessary now for certain parties to embark on demolishing homes becuase their owners had obtained or did not obtain a license. Some issues pertaining to land must be frozen until the end of the negotiating process. The continuation of all these acts, the continued construction of new buildings in settlements, the expansion in Ma'ale Adumim, all these things actually lead to a single outcome, namely, that the Palestinian street will become more convinced that Israel is not serious in the peace process.
