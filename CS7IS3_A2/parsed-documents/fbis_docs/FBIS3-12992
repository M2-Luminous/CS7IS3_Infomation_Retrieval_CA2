The head of the delegation, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, briefly described it as follows: [Begin Birkavs recording] The visit to Israel took place in a very complex situation regarding foreign and domestic policy, which has evolved in Israel after the Hebron tragedy when many dozens of people were killed in a sacred place. There were perhaps only small schedule changes during the visit; in general the visit proceeded according to schedule. I think that this is an indicator of Israel's especially favorable attitude and wish to maintain contacts with us on a wide scale. As far as the main essence of the visit itself, in several words I would characterize it as a new leaf which has been turned over in our mutual relations, a leaf on which we made several significant inscriptions. These inscriptions are an agreement on cooperation in the spheres of education, culture and science, and on promotion and mutual protection of investment. But all the talks which we held with the Israeli president, the Israeli prime minister, the Israeli foreign minister, and other ministers are practical evidence of the fact that we have very wide possibilities for mutual cooperation. And Israel, if the peace process develops successfully there, will be a country which will develop rapidly. And as we do not have a representation in that region, then the government's plan to open an embassy in Israel -- possible in the fall -- was received with great understanding and it will be a guarantee that our relations will widen. [end recording] Mr. Birkavs also reported that during the visit, the Latvian Government delegation received from the Israeli Government an offer for arms sale. Representatives of the Latvian Government also visited a language teaching center in Israel, where they familiarized themselves with the system of teaching Hebrew. As Birkavs said, discussing problems of citizenship in Latvia, representatives of the Israeli Government stressed that the knowledge of the language should be put forward as the main criterion for granting citizenship. A visit by Israeli experts in power engineering and internal affairs to Latvia is also expected soon, as well as a visit by representatives of the Knesset, i.e. parliament.
