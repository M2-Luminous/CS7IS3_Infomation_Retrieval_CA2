Establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea and between Japan and North Korea has emerged to be a new issue under the precondition of solution of the North Korean nuclear question. The government believes the North Korean nuclear issue will be resolved no later than the end of the first half of the year. Accordingly, it considers North Korea's establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan to be the most important issue for this year and is preparing various measures for this. This viewpoint of the government is based on the situation providing three amicable conditions [segaji uhojok sanghwang]. First, the United States and North Korea have nearly reached an agreement on the point at issue, that is, nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and resumption of South-North dialogue. North Korea has reportedly decided to allow the IAEA's ordinary [tongsang] inspections of its seven reported facilities and to accede to South-North dialogue. The United States and North Korea have already agreed to the method of lump-sum solution which requires, along with nuclear inspection, North Korea to resume working-level contacts for the envoy exchange between South and North Korea, the United States to release its schedule for the third high-level talks with North Korea, and the ROK to announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise in this new year. This means no further revised proposal is available as the sides have extremely narrowed their differences. Second, North Korea has recently shown a series of changes in its reaction. In Kim Il-song's New Year address following the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's 30 December statement, North Korea considered an agreement between the United States and itself to be an established fact. The government analyzed this as North Korea's new attitude that it had never showed in the past. Secret changes inside North Korea are worth watching in connection with this. In particular, North Korea admitted the failure of its economic development plan in the Supreme People's Assembly's [SPA] meeting held last month. It has also rearranged its internal system by deploying key members for South-North dialogue at the front. The government attaches significance to this fact. It believes that North Korea has closely analyzed the effectiveness of the nuclear card during the meeting. After the SPA meeting, North Korea changed its inactive attitude toward dialogue with the United States, which was just aimed at avoiding sanctions by the United Nations, and is now very active in dialogue with the United States. The government noted that this change was a result of North Korea's reflection on its nuclear policy. A senior official of the government analyzed, "The North Korean nuclear card ends in failure. If North Korea had not used the nuclear card, it could have achieved an earlier establishment of diplomatic ties with the United States and Japan." He views that as North Korea came to know this well, the nuclear issue will be resolved after passing its final crisis in the first half of this year. No matter what the reason was, the United States and North Korea have reached an agreement to resolve the issue by making mutual concessions at the critical moment that required them to choose dialogue or sanctions. Observers say that a U.S.-North Korean agreement has been made though it has not yet been announced, and anticipate that things will go on in the following order: negotiations between the IAEA and North Korea on the nuclear inspection, an IAEA inspection team's visit to North Korea for the nuclear inspection, suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, an envoy exchange between South and North Korea, and the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. Further, it is expected that South-North summit talks will be held when the nuclear issue is nearly resolved. President Kim Yong-sam said that "the North Korean nuclear issue will be resolved early this year," and that "an important turning point will be prepared in the new year," based on this viewpoint. It is true that the North Korean nuclear question has now entered a stage of a smooth solution. It is a prevailing observation that the Korean peninsula will ride on the thawing tide. However, how long this trend will be maintained is still unclear because many potential obstacles still remain. In particular, the special [tukpyol] inspection issue to be discussed in the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks is delicate enough to bring North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
