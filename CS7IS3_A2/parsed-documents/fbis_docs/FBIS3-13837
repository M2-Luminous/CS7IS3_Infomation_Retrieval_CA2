The new U.S. position clearly means that the word "First" has been dropped from the famous Oslo agreement, that there is no more room to talk about the post-Gaza-Jericho phase, and that Resolution 904 canceled the reported postponement of the discussions on Jerusalem and the sovereignty over it. Above all, this also means that the televised display that took place at the White House on 13 September was sent off to the U.S. archives to be stored with other shows labeled: No longer suitable for broadcast! The Palestinians, along with other Arabs, have gained a condemnation of the Ramadan massacre, which was registered against unknown perpetrators. This is because the Security Council resolution did not condemn the Zionist enemy or hold it responsible for not committing itself to protecting the Palestinian citizens in accordance with the Geneva conventions. Meanwhile, the Israelis-- in return for accepting the condemnation of the massacre, rather than its perpetrators--gained recognition of their usurpation of Jerusalem and other Palestinian territories, except for the small areas of Gaza and Jericho. This humiliating deal raises the question: Is it worthwhile for the Arab delegations to return to Washington for negotiations, and what issues will be discussed after the United States has granted legitimacy to the occupation of land? While realizing the bitterness of returning to the negotiating table, we should not hesitate to assert that it is the Palestinian side that chose to return and that prompted the other Arab delegations to do so. When the PLO decides to agree on resuming the negotiations, we are confident that the Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese parties will not have enough bargaining chips to continue to boycott the negotiations as an expression of their indignation over Resolution 904. It is essential here to note that the few months between mid-September 1993 and mid-March 1994 have placed us all before the fact that the peace that Washington and the Zionist enemy are seeking is not a just peace, that what is left of the bases of the Madrid conference is not worthwhile, and that the Gaza-Jericho First agreement has become insignificant since the word "First" was dropped and after the enemy clearly pursued policies regarding Gaza and Jericho as two new Palestinian camps on Palestinian national soil!
