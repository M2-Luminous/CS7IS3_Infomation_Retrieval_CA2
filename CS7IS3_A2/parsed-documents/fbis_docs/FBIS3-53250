It was agreed that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the Fatah Hawks would not fire at each other, and the agreement has so far been honored. It was also agreed that the Fatah Hawks would not keep firearms, which would only be held by the Fatah apparatus in the Gaza Strip." These remarks were made yesterday by former Fatah Hawks commander Muhammad Dahlan, in an interview with HA'ARETZ. Dahlan is now one of the leaders of Fatah Tunis' security apparatus, after being deported from the Gaza Strip by Israel. Dahlan and other Fatah leaders are expected to receive significant control on the ground when the withdrawal agreement is implemented. [Bekhor] Dahlan, let us assume a Palestinian terrorist commits murder in Israeli territory and escapes to territory under Palestinian control. What will be his fate? [Dahlan] It seems to me that we would try him, but that is something that still has to be negotiated. There are hundreds of similar questions, such as the area of jurisdiction, which will be discussed in the negotiations. [Bekhor] The delegations are now discussing the upcoming withdrawal from Gaza, and a central issue, such as the area of jurisdiction, has still not been resolved? [Dahlan] I am sure that such issues can be solved within two hours. Anyway, we already have a plan to safeguard the roads within the Palestinian area. [Bekhor] What about intelligence coordination with the Shin Bet? [Dahlan] That has still not been discussed, but is due to come up in the respective committee. Cooperation between the Israel Police and the Palestinian police has already been discussed, but how to deal with terrorism has still not been worked out. We are divided on the basic issue of what constitutes terrorism. [Bekhor] How do you plan to deal with the problem of collaborators? [Dahlan] They all belong to the underworld: pimps and drug dealers who found refuge in Israel, so take them. This is our decision and the decision of Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]: Take them, and we, for humanitarian reasons, will take only their women and children. In the past a decision was made to liquidate the collaborators, but after the signing of the agreement in Washington in September, the approach changed. That was also the leadership's decision. [Bekhor] In the past there were rumors that you had ordered the extermination of Fatah activist Muhammad Abu-Sha'ban. [Dahlan] They are only rumors. The Fatah Hawks have no part in murders. Had Fatah done it, it would have been known. I was a friend of Muhammad's. [Bekhor] How do you think the Palestinian security system will deal with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists? [Dahlan] I can tell you that we agreed that there would be no terrorism between the Palestinian entity and the Islamic elements. [Bekhor] The bad relations between the nationalist regimes and the Islamic streams are, in fact, a regional problem. [Dahlan] In the Palestinian camp it is different. Hamas and Islamic Jihad are anti-Israeli and not anti-Palestinian. They are not opposed to us. [Bekhor] What is the security outlook that will guide you on your return to the Gaza Strip? [Dahlan] The way we see the security issue is different from how the Shin Bet views it. Their concept is built on threats, revenge, and undermining, while we will base our policy on four things: First, forging a link between the Palestinian people and their security apparatus. Second, building a security system that will be accompanied by economic and social moves, which will reduce the level of pressure on the Palestinians. Third, we intend to employ young men with a security background in our security system, nationalists with whom others can identify. [Bekhor] In other words, men on the wanted list? [Dahlan] You can call them that. Fourth, there will be cooperation between the Palestinian and Israeli systems. We will use all the Shin Bet and IDF installations, which will be evacuated when the withdrawal starts. We agreed between us that the Army and police will not destroy any installations but will transfer them to us. [Bekhor] Have the commanders of the Palestinian police force and the security apparatus already been appointed? [Dahlan] No names have not been finalized. There is a security committee in Tunis, of which I am a member, and the commanders will be chosen from among the members. [Bekhor] Who will appoint the commanders? [Dahlan] Abu-'Ammar does the appointing. Who else makes such appointments in the Third World?
