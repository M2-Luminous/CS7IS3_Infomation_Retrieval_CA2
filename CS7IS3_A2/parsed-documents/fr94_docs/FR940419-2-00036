ACTION: Response to citizens' petition. SUMMARY: On December 22, 1993, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America-UAW (UAW) petitioned EPA under section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2620, to issue test rules under section 4 of TSCA to develop data to aid in the determination of whether machining fluids pose an unreasonable risk to public health or the environment. This Notice announces EPA's response to UAW's petition. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;545B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554-0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Summary of Petition and Response On December 22, 1993, EPA received a petition under section 21 of TSCA from UAW. The petitioner subsequently agreed at EPA's request to extend the statutory deadline for EPA review until April 12, 1993. The petitioner requested that EPA issue test rules under section 4 of TSCA to evaluate whether machining fluids pose an unreasonable risk to public health or the environment. UAW requests the testing because it believes that although the available epidemiology data is sufficient to establish the hazards of machining fluids as mixtures, more and better toxicology data is needed to characterize the health and environmental risks resulting from exposure to particular components or partial mixtures of machining fluids. The petitioner alleges that sufficient evidence exists to establish that occupational exposure to machining fluids at currently permissible levels poses a risk of cancer and adverse effects on respiratory function. UAW says that the information derived from the additional testing requested, including measurements of environmental release in the occupational setting, would contribute to refining control strategies. It asserts that such information would more clearly define the toxicity of specific components constituting machining fluids and of different combinations of those components. The petitioner also believes that additional testing data will provide needed information regarding workplace exposure to specific components or partial mixtures of machining fluids. The petitioner does not identify the specific chemical substances or chemical mixtures for which testing is requested. UAW states that the petition applies to all machining fluids, including generic categories such as straight oils, soluble oils, and synthetic fluids, and drawing compounds for metal stamping which are similar in composition to machining fluids. EPA estimates that the UAW petition potentially applies to hundreds of chemical substances or mixtures of chemical substances. The petitioner says that test rules issued in response to the petition should include, but not be limited to requiring: mutagenicity, respiratory irritancy, and sensitization bioassays of machining fluid components, partial combinations and in-use machining fluids; carcinogenesis bioassays for selected classes of components; chemical analysis of bulk fluids and aerosols for nitrosamines, bacterial degradation products (including endotoxin) and higher molecular weight polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon formation from use; and health effects studies. In addition, the petitioner requests test rules requiring measurement of release to the environment of various machining fluid components to gauge workplace exposure from airborne machining fluid components. On December 9, 1993, UAW petitioned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) to lower the current OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for oil mist from machining fluids. The UAW petition to OSHA includes a request that OSHA approach EPA to determine the need for test rules for particular ingredients of metalworking fluids, using authority under TSCA. The UAW petition to OSHA, a copy of which was filed with the TSCA section 21 petition, is accompanied by a paper entitled ``Health Effects of Occupational Exposure to Machining Fluids,'' which contains a summary of selected epidemiological studies of cancer and respiratory diseases among workers exposed to machining fluids. In a statement made at the time of the filing, UAW president Owen Bieber said that additional joint union-company studies are underway at General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, and that within a few years, study sponsors will know far more about, among other things, what specific ingredients in machining fluids are causing health problems for workers. EPA believes that additional testing of machining fluids may be necessary to adequately characterize the health effects of these fluids on exposed workers. However, EPA has decided that it is not in a position at this time to conclude that the requisite section 4 criteria have been met for the hundreds of chemical substances and mixtures to which the petition arguably applies. Before deciding to require testing of machining fluids, EPA will work with OSHA and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in a specially convened Interagency Workgroup to identify specific components of machining fluids, the combinations in which these chemical substances are used in the workplace, and the level of workplace exposure to these chemical substances, and then determine which chemical substances, if any, have been adequately tested in the past or are currently undergoing testing. In addition, before imposing testing requirements, EPA must determine which machining fluid chemicals meet the section 4 standards for presenting potentially unreasonable risks or evidencing adequate release or exposure to require testing under TSCA. A more detailed discussion of these standards is contained in Unit II.A. of this Notice. EPA anticipates that it will be able to complete the phase of this process that will result in decisions on whether to initiate section 4 test rules within 1 year. Over the last several years, EPA has also taken a number of additional initiatives as described in Unit IV of this Notice. These activities help to address potential adverse health effects on workers exposed to machining fluids. II. Background A. Statutory Requirements Section 21 of TSCA provides that any person may petition EPA to initiate proceedings for the issuance of rules under sections 4, 6, and 8 of TSCA. A section 21 petition must set forth the facts which the petitioner believes establish the need for the rules requested. EPA is required to grant or deny the petition within 90 days. If EPA grants the petition, the Agency must promptly commence an appropriate proceeding. If EPA denies the petition, the Agency must publish its reasons in the Federal Register . Within 60 days of denial, the petitioner may commence a civil action in a U.S. district court to compel the initiation of the rulemaking requested in its petition. The court must, for a petition for a new rule, provide an opportunity for the petition to be considered de novo . After hearing the evidence, the court can order EPA to initiate the action requested if the petitioner has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, support for particular conclusions described in section 21. In a challenge to an EPA denial of a section 21 petition requesting a section 4 rule, the petitioner would have to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that information available to the Agency is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the effects of a chemical substance or mixture, and that the chemical substance or mixture either may present an unreasonable risk of injury or will be produced in substantial amounts and may result in significant or substantial human exposure or substantial environmental release, and that testing is necessary to characterize the risks. Section 21 does not provide specific direction as to how the Agency should evaluate a citizen's petition, but merely states that EPA must grant or deny within 90 days. However, there are standards under section 4 for issuing regulations, and in determining whether to grant or deny, EPA must consider whether the requirements for section 4 rulemaking can be met. Under section 4 of TSCA, EPA may issue rules to require chemical manufacturers and processors to test the chemical substances and mixtures (chemicals) that they produce. To issue a section 4 rule on a chemical, EPA must find either that activities involving the chemical may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, or that the chemical is or will be produced in substantial quantities and that there is or will be significant or substantial human exposure to the chemical or that the chemical is or will be released to the environment in substantial quantities. In addition, EPA must find that existing data are insufficient to determine or predict the effects of the chemical and that testing is necessary to develop that data. EPA must be able to make all of the above findings to issue a test rule; if EPA believes on the basis of the information obtained from the petition, and from its investigation during the 90&hyph;day review period, that it cannot make all of the necessary findings, EPA will deny the section 21 petition. One of the criteria most relevant to a section 21 petition is whether testing is necessary. Section 4 expands the concept of sufficiency provided in the section 21 standards established for the purposes of district court review, requiring that EPA find that testing a chemical is necessary to develop the data needed to evaluate the chemical before it may issue a rule requiring testing of that chemical. B. Description of Machining Fluid Problems Machining fluids, also called metalworking fluids, are used to lubricate and cool industrial equipment and the metal being shaped during a variety of machining operations. These may include metal removing operations such as cutting or drilling, metal forming such as stamping or drawing, or similar operations. In its petition to OSHA, UAW states that NIOSH estimates that up to 10 million U.S. workers are routinely exposed to oil mists from machining fluids. Exposure is primarily occupational; however, there are limited exposure data. There may be as many as 400 commercial products (EPA, 1992) belonging to one of four major metalworking fluid types: straight and soluble oils and semi-synthetic and synthetic fluids. All but the synthetic fluids contain mineral oil. There are no standard formulations of chemical components among commercial machining fluids. The following Table 1, which is illustrative only, indicates the diversity and use patterns of the generic types of machining fluids and components: Table 1._ Typical Additives Which May be Found in Various Metalworking Fluids 1␣ 1Straight1 oil 1Soluble oil 1Semi-synthetic 1Synthetic Base Mineral oil l i0X l i0X l i0X l i0␣ Additive Surfactant l i0␣ l i0X l i0X l i0␣ Coupler l i0␣ l i0X l i0(X) l i0␣ Thickener l i0␣ l i0␣ l i0␣ l i0X Detergent l i0X l i0X l i0X l i0X Plasticizer l i0␣ l i0␣ l i0(X) l i0X Anti-Misting l i0X l i0␣ l i0␣ l i0␣ Oiliness Agent l i0X l i0␣ l i0␣ l i0␣ Dispersant l i0X l i0␣ l i0␣ l i0␣ Extreme Pressure l i0X l i0X l i0(X) l i0␣ Passivator l i0X l i0␣ l i0␣ l i0␣ Anti-Foam l i0␣ l i0X l i0X l i0X Alkaline Reserve l i0X l i0X l i0X l i0X Solid Lubricant l i0X l i0(X) l i0␣ l i0␣ Odor Mask l i0X l i0X l i0X l i0(X) Corrosion Inhibitor l i0X l i0X l i0X l i0X Anti-Microbial Agent l i0X l i0X l i0X l i0X 1 The term ``straight oil'' and ``insoluble oil'' may be used interchangeably.

Sources: Atmenkins, Howell, Luke, Leiter, 1994; Nachtman, 1990. UAW attached a list of 14 epidemiology studies to its OSHA petition, along with a general description of the findings of these studies. Eight studies have been published; the remaining six studies have not been published and presumably have undergone peer review. These studies covered several operations including grinding operations in which inhalation of fine particles of the material being machined became a concern, as well as exposures in machining operations that did not involve grinding. The UAW-represented plants in the studies made a variety of products, using different processes with different machining fluid compositions and presumably different exposure levels. Taken together, the studies covered workers in foundry and engine plants exposed to substances characterized as straight, soluble, and insoluble oils, synthetic water-based cutting fluids, other synthetic fluids, cutting oils, metal fumes, abrasives, dusts, oil smoke, coolants, organic solvents, and nitrosamines. The studies found some evidence of increased risks of esophageal, rectal, laryngeal and stomach cancer. However, information regarding the level of exposure was limited or lacking altogether. For example, only two of the studies provided any quantitative measurement of exposure and both measures were reflective of current rather than historical levels to which workers were exposed. According to UAW, excess stomach cancers were found in seven of the nine studies conducted at the UAW-represented plants. Of all 14 studies listed, however, only three studies actually found a statistically significant increased risk of stomach cancer (Austin et al., unpublished; Park et al. 1988; Silverstein et al. 1988). UAW has commented that it ``believe[s] that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that exposure to machining fluids poses a risk of occupational cancer and adverse effects of respiratory health at levels permitted by the current OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit.'' The epidemiology studies are consistent with toxicology studies, which have generally shown that the respiratory tract is sensitive to the effects of machining fluid exposure. The increased incidence of cancer and respiratory effects in the epidemiology studies were associated with several types of machining fluid oils. III. EPA's Approach to Obtaining Information on Workplace Health Risks from Exposure to Machining Fluids EPA agrees with UAW that laboratory work on machining fluids should be expanded and that additional testing may be needed to more clearly define the toxicity of specific components of machining fluids and of different combinations of those components. However, EPA is not at this time convinced of the necessity to initiate section 4 test rules under TSCA for all the more than 400 components of machining fluids and the many hundreds of combinations of those components that are in use today. EPA believes that before it issues test rules, existing laboratory data must be reviewed to determine which machining fluid components have already been tested adequately. EPA believes that it is important for OSHA and NIOSH to help decide, possibly with additional input from both unions and industry, which of the hundreds of untested or inadequately tested machining fluid components or combinations are most likely to increase health risks to workers because they appear to have the greatest potential toxicity or are found in the most widely used machining fluids. To select machining fluid chemicals for testing in response to this petition, EPA has recently formed an Interagency Workgroup with representatives from EPA, OSHA, and NIOSH. This group will review information regarding the composition of currently-used machining fluids and existing health effects and exposure data on machining fluids, and will recommend specific chemicals for testing to the OSHA/NIOSH/EPA Committee (ONE Committee). The ONE Committee was established pursuant to a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 1988 to provide a focal point for coordination and exchange of information on occupational issues including toxic chemical assessment and regulatory activities of the three agencies. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) was later added to the Committee. Following review of the Interagency Workgroup's recommendations for testing (including monitoring) of specific machining fluid chemical substances or mixtures, the ONE Committee will refer data needs for specific chemical substances or mixtures to EPA for development of proposed test rules. EPA will then undertake to make the necessary findings under section 4 and develop test rules covering the recommended substances or mixtures. The identity and number of specific chemicals referred for testing will depend on the selections of the Interagency Workgroup, as reviewed by the ONE Committee. EPA has received letters from OSHA and NIOSH officials expressing their approval of the Interagency Workgroup's formation, appointing representatives to serve on the group, and indicating their understanding that the purpose of the group is to assist in addressing UAW's concerns regarding occupational health risks associated with exposure to machining fluids. Prior to receiving the ONE Committee's referral of data needs the Interagency Workgroup's recommendations of substances or mixtures for testing, and Agency review with regard to section 4 criteria, EPA is not in a position to require testing for the hundreds of combinations of machining fluid chemical substances (or some subset thereof) which are currently in use. Specifically, EPA needs to select the chemicals and combinations that will support the findings required under TSCA section 4 before EPA can promulgate a test rule. In addition to evaluating the toxicity of chemicals and mixtures found in machining fluids, EPA needs to evaluate the potential exposure that occurs during use. Moreover, thermal and degradation products, and particulates from the metal work being machined can add to the potentially toxic exposures. These issues may need further review. It should also be noted that EPA probably cannot promulgate a TSCA section 4 test rule for one category of additives mentioned in the petition. Section 3 of TSCA excludes certain types of chemicals from the definition of ``chemical substances,'' and therefore from regulation under TSCA, including chemicals ``manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce, for use as pesticides.'' When biocides are added to machining fluids to act as pesticides, they would not normally be the subject of a TSCA section 4 rule. However, they are regulated by EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq. and EPA has authority to require health and environmental data under FIFRA. In summary, the Agency recognizes that additional laboratory testing may be needed to determine the toxicity of inadequately tested machining fluids. In addition, studies to better characterize worker exposure to machining fluids may be needed. EPA agrees with UAW that exposure to toxic machining fluid components and combinations of such components should be minimized. EPA also agrees with UAW that EPA, OSHA, and NIOSH should work together to determine the need for TSCA section 4 rules for particular ingredients and mixtures of metalworking fluids. EPA has initiated actions that will enable EPA, OSHA and NIOSH to navigate through the complex and extremely large universe of machining fluid components and mixtures to select appropriate substances for testing. The agencies may also seek the assistance of unions and industry in this effort. EPA believes that consultation with unions and industry may be particularly useful in handling nomenclature and product definition issues that must be resolved prior to promulgating test rules under section 4. IV. Specific Actions to Address Workplace Exposure to Toxic Machining Fluid Components Prior to receiving the December 22, 1993 petition, EPA had identified machining fluids as a potential source for concern. EPA had also begun to evaluate the toxicity of these materials. On June 28, 1990, EPA received a letter from Dr. Franklin Mirer of UAW indicating UAW's intent to submit a petition under TSCA section 21 requesting TSCA section 4 carcinogenicity testing of cutting oil components and formulations. In response to this letter and a TSCA section 8(e) submission, EPA initiated a review of the toxicity of machining oil components and mixtures under its screening level risk management process (RM1). After reviewing available data on oil-based metalworking fluids, EPA concluded on September 9, 1992, that there were insufficient data at that time to define the agent(s) of concern for toxicity testing, and EPA presented this conclusion to the ONE Committee. As a result of this review, EPA decided to group machining fluid additives by their use (e.g., anti-oxidants, biocides, etc.) into use clusters for screening with respect to potential human risk, ecological risk, and pollution prevention. To date, 11 such clusters have been identified and are under review. In addition, the following actions were not contemplated by EPA in response to any UAW initiative. These actions have been taken previously or are planned unilaterally by EPA to reduce, among other things, workplace exposure to certain toxic components of machining fluids. EPA recently completed an investigation of chlorinated paraffins and olefins (CP/Os), substances used extensively in cutting fluids. Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) came to the attention of EPA in 1977, when the National Toxicology Program (NTP) nominated them for testing. Earlier that year, an international group of CP manufacturers had formed a Consortium to test their products for both health and environmental effects. EPA had discussed the planned testing with the Consortium and had accepted the Consortium's proposal for voluntary health and environmental effects testing of CPs. Consequently, EPA at that time did not propose a section 4(a) rule requiring such health or environmental effects testing. Following completion of testing by industry in 1984, EPA tentatively estimated that CPs could pose potential risks to aquatic life at concentrations at or below the concentrations that might be expected to occur frequently in the environment. In addition, NTP, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the State of California had classified short chain CPs as probable human carcinogens. In September of 1993, EPA concluded that CP/Os do not present a general environmental risk, although a few cities with heavy concentrations of metalworking operations were identified in which CP/O water concentrations could reach levels of concern to some aquatic species. The investigation also concluded that CP/Os may pose cancer risks to specific limited populations, primarily to workers using metalworking fluids and thus exposed to CP/Os in oil mists. EPA also concluded that, to a lesser extent, CP/Os also could pose potential cancer risks to small populations of subsistence fish-eaters in a few metropolitan areas, and possibly to anyone exposed to dioxin that might be generated during metalworking operations or when spent fluids are incinerated. Consequently, EPA is proposing to list CP/Os on the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), based primarily on concerns about potential cancer risks. In addition, EPA has communicated to OSHA the potential occupational risk to metalworkers at the current PEL. On May 12, 1993, (58 FR 27944) EPA promulgated a Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) under TSCA for alkali metal nitrites (AMNs), another frequent machining fluid additive. EPA has determined that the use of AMNs as ingredients in machining fluids containing amines may result in significant exposure to N -nitrosamines and pose a significant cancer risk to human health. The SNUR applies to any person that manufactures, imports, or processes AMNs for use as an ingredient in machining fluids containing amines. Such persons must notify EPA 90 days before undertaking the activity. This time period gives EPA an opportunity to evaluate the intended use of the AMNs in question to ensure that workers are protected from the risks of exposure to N -nitrosamines. Finally, to address concerns over environmental releases of machining fluids and components, EPA is planning to propose the Metal Products and Machinery Phase I Effluent Guideline by November 1994. This guideline, which is scheduled for promulgation by May 1996, is intended to cover facilities that manufacture, rebuild or maintain metal parts, products or machines and that discharge effluent to surface waters and indirectly to publicly owned treatment facilities. The phase I guideline will cover the aerospace, aircraft, electronic equipment, hardware, mobile industrial equipment, ordnance, and stationary equipment industries. The guideline will regulate discharges of several pollutants, including some substances that are components of machining fluids or that constitute machining fluids. V.
