"There are enough missile silos and infrastructure left by a missile division which operated here, to start space explorations," he added. Besides, many servicemen and missile specialists will remain at the cosmodrome to work, he noted. Venediktov sees his main task in preparing the cosmodrome for operations and in providing it with adequate equipment. The reduction of the missile division which was on duty in Svobodniy-18, started in 1992 under the START II Treaty. The last regiment was released from duty here less than a month ago. The cosmodrome needs twice the number of commissioned officers now, but the new tasks have to be tackled with the present personnel. Venediktov hopes that new specialists will come here, including graduates from the Mozhayskiy Military Space Engineering Academy.
