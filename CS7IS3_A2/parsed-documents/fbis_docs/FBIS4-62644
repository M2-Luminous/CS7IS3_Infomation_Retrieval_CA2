FBIS4-62644 "drsov096_c_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 Federal Assembly Deputies Concerned With U.S. Vote on Bosnia Embargo Deputies Concerned With U.S. Vote on Bosnia Embargo LD1705193994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1632 GMT 17 May 94 LD1705193994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The International Affairs Committee of the Russian parliament's Federation Council expressed its concern over the unilateral lifting of the embargo against Bosnia by the U.S. Senate. In its Tuesday statement, made available to Interfax, the committee said that such steps could obstruct the joint Russian, U.S. and EU policy in Bosnia and said that weapons should not reach the warring parties. The committee thought that as the Serbs complied with the peace plan the suspension and, at a later stage, lifting of the sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) would promote peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The upper house deputies expressed their willingness to consult and act jointly with the U.S. senators in resolving the Bosnian crisis. The State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, had earlier passed a resolution under which, if the embargo on weapons supplies to Bosnia were unilaterally lifted, Russia was to respond adequately, going as far as lifting its own sanctions.
