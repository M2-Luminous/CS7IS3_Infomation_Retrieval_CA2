Two thousand signatures for an independent candidate without guaranteed free advertising--this barrier is very hard to break through. For electoral coalitions the rules are more lenient. Having collected 35,000 signatures, they can nominate candidates in all 50 districts and on top of that reshuffle them until the last moment, searching for the most winnable district for each. In addition, there is the opportunity to hold press conferences to make oneself and one's position known. It is no wonder the idea of a coalition has become extremely attractive. Registration applications were received from 38 blocs; 34 of them were granted the right to enter the electoral race; 24 realistically began signature collection. The big question is how many will make it to the finish line. It is already clear, however, that the romanticism of the elections-90 is a thing of the past. No more boys with fiery eyes willing to distribute leaflets for free around the clock. Now agitators ask: How much? I was at the electoral commission when they received a call from a woman who wanted information on some bloc needing help. "What kind of bloc?" commission members asked. "Democratic? Communist?"--"It does not matter. Whoever pays more." Professional signature collectors get paid 400-500 rubles [R] for each signature. In principle, there is nothing shameful in this--work has to be paid for. Except that not all of them can find R17 million. Directors of major enterprises can also help in signature collection. Practically all the coalitions vied for their support and, again, there is nothing shameful here. But suppose all directors running in the elections suddenly win their mandates--the future assembly will look suspiciously like a meeting of party and economic activists. We have a lot of parties. Good and bad, big and small. There are some who think that the proposed mechanism of nominating candidates stimulates the creation of large viable organizations. Alas, in reality it only stands in the way of their emergence. Some wanted to find sponsors; others wanted to expand their electorate; in the end, however, most blocs' lists resemble a Noah's Arc, with a pair of each creature. And it is naive to assume that after the elections they will live in peace and accord, remembering their joint programs. But even during the period of signature collection the eclectic nature of the lists has not brought about the desired effect. A politically aware voter would find a name of one candidate whom for some reason he did not like and--goodbye. A politically unaware voter says goodbye much faster and not always politely... The growing passivity became noticeable back in December. Today it is manifesting itself to the fullest extent. Most of the coalitions insisted on--and got--changes in the statute on elections: They will be conducted in two rounds. This is good, because it precludes the possibility of splitting the vote between candidates with similar programs. On the other hand, sociologists are sounding the alarm: A runoff election may not take place at all. "Why do we need it, this assembly?" many people ask. March 1990 was a time of hope. Placing our faith in the omnipotence of the deputies, we expected of them much more than they could realistically deliver. Much less is expected of the current ones. This is a good time to remember, however, that St. Petersburg is a component of the Russian Federation. In keeping with the Federation Treaty, on a score of vitally important issues the Russian parliament can only adopt basic legislation, leaving the regions the opportunity to finalize it with local conditions in mind. Many matters have been placed completely within the competence of Federation components, and local laws need to be adopted on them. In addition, it is necessary to make adjustments to the existing regulations regarding disposal of land and municipal property and monitor compliance. There is also control over execution of the budget. Dozens of sore issues are awaiting resolution, and the latter depends on who comes to the assembly. I hear sometimes: "Well, let the mayoralty do everything and bear responsibility for everything." These are rather utopian hopes. As already mentioned, a considerable number of norms and rules must be established here, in the city. Are we to allow the executive branch to set them for itself and then oversee itself on compliance? Or hope that there will be a wise King Solomon on each committee, who will resolve disputes fairly? The ability to dispose of property at one's own discretion at best leads to bias: Whoever they like more will get it. And practically always the result is a loss for the city budget, which is already full of holes. It appears that the traditional Russian maximalism is raising its head again. While calling the mean golden, we gravitate to extremes. One gets the impression that we have perceived the idea of a democratic reorganization of society as a sort of revelation that will allow us to build paradise on earth in the shortest of time. This did not happen--disenchantment sets in. And there is a real danger that the romantic democratism of the late 1980's will be replaced by equally romantic national-authoritarianism... In this sense it is not bad perhaps that we do not look at our future deputies as saviors: This makes it probable that we will elect not demagogues but people who are willing to move toward the goal in small steps, and engage in painstaking work. Of course, drafting laws is not a romantic business. But this is precisely what we need today. Otherwise we will not be able to either lay a foundation for the new system of city administration or escape great cataclysms.
