The election is scheduled for April 17. He is expected to explain his decision to the Supreme Soviet's session to be held in Petrozavodsk Friday. The incumbent Chairman Viktor Stepanov who is also running for this position told Interfax that he regretted what happened. He said that the interest of the electorate would not be met if there was no alternative candidate. He also said that he did not intend to quit the race and would not do so unless there were important personal reasons. He described his rival's decision as disrespectful of the electorate and thought that the opposition would say that there was no choice in the election. Observers noted that while 5,000 signatures were needed to register a candidate in the election, Blinnikov's supporters had collected 6,000 while Stepanov's had a total of 15,500 signatures.
