In a statement released on Thursday the press secretary noted that "the president is concerned that the resumption of information dictate may lead to the fall of the State Duma's prestige, and this in turn would damage the process of strengthening civil accord." The practice of infringement by the former Supreme Council on the prerogatives of a free media being reanimated in the new parliament has already been resolutely rejected by Russian public opinion, the statement says. Kostikov pointed out that neither the president, nor the government, nor the Federation Council have their own broadcasting service. The State Duma's attempts to in essence create information privileges for itself can be described as an aspiration of one of the power branches to violate the division of powers already fixed in the Constitution, the statement points out. "The pernicious consequences of such tactics are well known." "The president urges deputies of the State Duma to show wisdom, political tact, and to take into account lessons of history," Kostikov noted.
