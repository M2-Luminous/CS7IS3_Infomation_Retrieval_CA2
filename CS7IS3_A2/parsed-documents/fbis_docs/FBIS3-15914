Judging from what is going on, a scandal is brewing. [Unidentified correspondent] It seems that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has not been able to prevent a split in his party. Today Viktor Kobelev, the chief of staff of the LDPR's Central Committee, in an interview to our program, announced his definitive break with the head of the party. We remind you that almost a month ago, Viktor Kobelev tried to leave the faction but the LDPR leader persuaded him not to do it, while telling the press that the party's second man's attempt to leave was a planned action necessary to expose special service agents in the ranks of the party. According to Kobelev, this claim is absolutely groundless. Moreover, as became clear today, the chief of staff, together with his deputy, Aleksandr Pronin, left the faction at their first attempt, having concluded a certain truce with Zhirinovskiy, which the latter has recently violated by insisting on an amendment to the law on the status of deputies. This amendment would allow Duma leaders to recall deputies who are members of their factions at their own volition. Kobelev is now in a determined and definite frame of mind. [Begin Kobelev recording] I chose my credo very clearly -- I am outside the faction while Zhirinovskiy is the leader of the faction. [end recording] [Correspondent] According to the chief of staff, after he, Pronin, and Anatoliy Kashpirovskiy leave, the majority of Liberal Democrats are ready to leave the faction, but at the moment are frightened that Zhirinivoskiy might be able to influence their deputy places. Incidentally, the position of the head of the LDPR himself in the Duma is a bit shaky today, since the Shchelkov Rayon court deemed his deputy mandate invalid. Viktor Kobelev is ready to take the vacant place of the faction leader, that is, if that is the decision of the party. But even if this does not happen, the former chief of staff, who knows all the secrets of the party's money, is the most dangerous figure today for the LDPR head; he is capable of heading a powerful internal party opposition. [Begin Kobelev recording] I will save -- I am not afraid of that word -- or at least I will try to save Russia from unpredictable politicians. [end recording]
