"Of course." Will [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi get the job? "It is extremely likely. There are no problems as far as we are concerned." Senator Gianfranco Miglio, the ideologue of the Northern League, comfortably relaxed in a velvet armchair in his beautiful house in Como, answers the questions in a friendly way. He returned to Lombardy yesterday morning, after the long marathon of electing the Chamber of Deputies speaker. [Avagliano] Were you excited to see a member of the Northern League elected speaker? [Miglio] No. I have studied politics for 50 years. I have become so absorbed in it that I can participate without ever getting excited. [Avagliano] You were not even excited over the confrontation between [outgoing Senate speaker] Spadolini and [newly-elected Forza Italia Senate speaker] Scognamiglio? [Miglio] I enjoyed the Senate votevery much. It was thrilling. Probably not for Spadolini. [Avagliano] What do you think of the new speaker Scognamiglio? [Miglio] He is a well-balanced person. He has experience in the field of economics and could be a very tactful speaker at the Senate. Above all, it has been revealed that Spadolini is not the only person in Italy who could possibly be Senate speaker. It was a legend. In a democracy a high turnover rate is the basis of good health. [Avagliano] What about the new lower house speaker, Irene Pivetti? [Miglio] She has a strong character. She will play her part well, having an elevated ethical conception of her role. [Northern League Secretary] Bossi made a good choice. He is always the one who chooses, with absolute authority And then it is a nice way to patch up the old hostilities between the church and the League. [Avagliano] Both the new speakers come from Lombardy. Are you getting ready to "storm" the institutions, given that Berlusconi is also from Milan? [Miglio] Since the League started, it has been evident that there would be a lot of people from the North. Forza Italia is also basically a northern movement. [Avagliano] Do you think that this is positive? [Miglio] Of course. The strong protest against the First Republic, which was Roman, came from the North. It is natural for Roman centralism to be swept away by a wave coming from the North. [Avagliano] Berlusconi has opened up to the center. Do you agree with him? [Miglio] Some of the former Christian democrats at the center have ideas that are similar enough to those of Forza Italia and the League. However, the current political situation is anomalous. Christian Democrats embracing Social Communists. [Avagliano] Why anomalous? [Miglio] It is a mortal embrace for the PPI [Italian Popular Party] members. And since there are two poles, they will soon gravitate into the pole that welcomes them best. We need their votes to make up a solid majority in the Senate. [Avagliano] Should [President] Scalfaro resign when the government has been formed? [Miglio] The moment will soon come. The SISDE [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service] judicial proceedings should reach a turning point before the end of the month and this will create a very difficult situation. However, it is important that he first gets everything completed before the new government starts working.
