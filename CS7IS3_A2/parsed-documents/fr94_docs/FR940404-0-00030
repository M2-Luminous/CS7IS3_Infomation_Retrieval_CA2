FR940404-0-00030 FR940404-0-00014 40 CFR Part 80 [FRL&hyph;4857&hyph;2] Approval of Colorado's Petition To Relax the Federal Reid Vapor Pressure Volatility Standard for Colorado in 1994 and 1995 AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Direct final rulemaking. SUMMARY: In today's action EPA is issuing as a direct final rule approving the State of Colorado's petition to relax the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) Standard applicable to gasoline introduced into commerce in the Denver-Boulder ozone nonattainment area from June 1 to September 15 from 7.8 pounds per square inches (psi) to 9.0 psi for the years 1994 and 1995. Federal RVP standards were promulgated by EPA on June 11, 1990 and revised on December 12, 1991, pursuant to the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act). Colorado's petition is based on evidence that the Denver-Boulder area does not need the 7.8 psi standard to maintain ozone attainment in the near term and that the 7.8 psi standard would impose significant costs on industry and consumers. Colorado's petition requests a continuation of a previous relaxation for the RVP standard approved by the EPA for the years 1992 and 1993. This action is being taken without prior notice because EPA believes that this rulemaking is noncontroversial due to the limited scope of this rulemaking, Colorado's continued attainment of the ozone standard and for the reasons discussed in this notice. DATES: This action will be effective on June 3, 1994 unless notice is received within 30 days that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If notice of intention to submit adverse comments is received within the 30 days, EPA will withdraw this final rule and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register . Please direct all correspondence to the following addresses. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted (in duplicate if possible) to Docket A&hyph;94&hyph;01.
