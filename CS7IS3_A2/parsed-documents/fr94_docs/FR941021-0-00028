FR941021-0-00028 FR941021-0-00001 (iv) Axial pullout resistance. A minimum of three sets of 25 terminals shall be tested with the test specimens stabilized at temperatures of ^40 ○C, 20 ○C, and 71 ○C (^40 ○F, +68 ○F, and 100 ○ F). The test arrangement shall include the terminals along the matrix edge at mid-span locations as well as centrally located terminals. A force measuring device, such as a dynamometer, shall be attached to a terminal and a force of 16 kg (35 lb) applied on axis as shown in Figure 14. There shall be no permanent deformation in excess of 0.08 cm (0.03 in.), any structural damage, or terminal pull-out in either the terminal or the faceplate. Figure 14 is as follows: BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;15&hyph;P ␣ E:GRAPHICSER21OC94.013 BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;15&hyph;C
