SUMMARY: On August 12, 1994, U.S. Steel, a Division of USX Corp., Inland Steel Company, I/N Kote, and LTV Steel filed a First Request for Panel Review with the Canadian Section of the NAFTA Secretariat pursuant to Article 1904 of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Panel review was requested of the final determination of dumping made by the Canadian Deputy Minister Of National Revenue (Customs, Taxation and Excise) respecting Certain Corrosion-Resistant Steel Sheet Products from the United States of America. This determination was published in the Canada Gazette on July 16, 1994. The NAFTA Secretariat has assigned Case Number CDA&hyph;94&hyph;1904&hyph;03 to this request. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James R. Holbein, United States Secretary, NAFTA Secretariat, Suite 2061, 14th and Constitution Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20230, (202) 482&hyph;5438. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Chapter 19 of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace domestic judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from a NAFTA country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination. Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1994, the Government of the United States, the Government of Canada and the Government of Mexico established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews (``Rules''). These Rules were published in the Federal Register on February 23, 1994 (59 F.R. 8686). The panel review in this matter will be conducted in accordance with these rules. A first Request for Panel Review was filed with the Canadian Section of the NAFTA Secretariat, pursuant to Article 1904 of the Agreement, on August 12, 1994, requesting panel review of the final determination of dumping described above. Rule 39(1) of the Rules provides, inter alia that: (a) A Party or interested person may challenge the final determination in whole or in part by filing a Complaint in accordance with Rule 39 within 30 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review (the deadline for filing a Complaint is September 12, 1994); (b) A Party, investigating authority or interested person that does not file a Complaint but that intends to appear in support of any reviewable portion of the final determination may participate in the panel review by filing a Notice of Appearance in accordance with Rule 40 within 45 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review (the deadline for filing a Notice of Appearance is September 26, 1994); and (c) The panel review shall be limited to the allegations of error of fact or law, including the jurisdiction of the investigating authority, that are set out in the Complaints filed in the panel review and the procedural and substantive defenses raised in the panel review. Dated: August 18, 1994. James R. Holbein, United States Secretary, NAFTA Secretariat. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20976 Filed 8&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;GT&hyph;M
