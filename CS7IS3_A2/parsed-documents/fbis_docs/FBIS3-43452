This has emerged from a Markinor Gallup poll which shows that 60 percent of blacks and only 31 percent of whites think conditions will improve in 1994. Optimism has improved markedly among blacks with 29 percent more than last year being positive about prospects. This is in sharp contrast to last year when blacks and whites were equally pessimistic about the future. Coloreds and Indians are only slightly less optimistic than blacks. Close on 60 percent of blacks and just over 40 percent of coloreds feel that there will be fewer strikes this year. Forty percent of whites and 40 percent of Indians believe industrial strife will increase.
