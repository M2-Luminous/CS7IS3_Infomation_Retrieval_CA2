Under the headline "The Fingerprints of Crime and Blood," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: In mid-Ramadan and while worshipers were prostrating during the dawn prayers at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, the Israelis' treacherous bullets killed and wounded hundreds of worshipers in a grisly massacre that has dumbfounded people everywhere. AL-BA'TH adds: The massacre is a new chapter in the Zionists' terrorist record, which is replete with all kinds of killings, slayings, and crimes perpetrated over the past 50 years. The paper holds Israeli rulers responsible for the massacre, because it is they who recruited and armed the settlers. Moreover, it is they who disarmed the Palestinian Arabs and prevented them from carrying even kitchen knives so they can be easy prey for these hateful vagabonds. The paper goes on to say: Israeli hands were stained with the blood of victims in the massacres committed in Qibyah, Dayr Yasin, Bahr al-Baqar, the al-Aqsa Mosque, Sabra, and Shatila, and many other places. Now, these criminal hands have been stained with worshipers' blood at the Ibrahimi Mosque. The paper wonders: Can there be more heinous and dastardly criminal murders than those being supported by Israeli rulers, who profess to be advocates of peace and civilized conduct, while attacking Arabs with weapons and instigating strangers whom they brought from the farthest points in the globe? Israeli rulers have turned the settlements into safe havens for murderers and criminals, who are killing defenseless and innocent people in cold blood. AL-BA'TH says: Since the convening of the Madrid conference, and throughout all phases of the peace talks, Israeli rulers, and the Rabin government in particular, have been adamant in their refusal to discuss the issue of settlements, arguing that this issue must be discussed only during the final status negotiations. The paper wonders: Does this not provide glaring evidence that the Israeli rulers are harboring criminal intentions to evict the residents of the territories through massacres, displacement, eviction, and killings, so there will be nothing to negotiate on during the later stage of the negotiations? Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH wonders: What kind of peace can be achieved when criminal slayings continue to be carried out? What kind of coexistence can there be with these killers? For the fingerprints of crime, blood, and shame are engraved on their foreheads. Besides, the world community is convinced, now more than ever before, that there can be no stability, security, or peace in the region unless the Israeli occupation is dismantled, and unless the Palestinian Arab people regain their right to self- determination. For its part, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The heinous massacre perpetrated by Israeli settlers inside the holy Ibrahimi Mosque confirms for the one thousandth time that Israel is a racist hostile entity that flouts all humanitarian and ethical values. The reality is that this massacre is the epitome of the law of the jungle upheld by the Tel Aviv rulers, under the very nose of the world community. They feel immune from any punishment. The paper adds: The Yitzhaq Rabin government is responsible for this massacre. Blame cannot be placed on an insane settler, nor can it be put on an unpremeditated individual act. For had it not encouraged and endorsed such a criminal act, the Rabin government would not have ordered its troops to kill Arabs who took to the streets throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in the immediate aftermath of the massacre to express their sadness and anger. AL-THAWRAH notes that the entire world community has condemned this heinous crime. Statements and communiques condemning this heinous crime and urging measures to prevent a recurrence of what has happened have been issued by various world capitals. The paper wonders: Are statements enough to deter Israel and curb its belligerence, and to return it to its senses? Is the use of condemnations and denunciations the proper means of dealing with an entity that flaunts its disobedience of international legitimacy? AL-THAWRAH urges the world community and the UN Security Council to go beyond the issuance of condemnatory and denunciatory statements to institute new firm formulas and measures to make Israel understand that it cannot remain immune from deterrent punitive measures indefinitely. Concluding its commentary, the paper says: The issue is now to be decided by the Security Council. It is hoped that the Security Council will pass a clear and unequivocal resolution providing for the protection of the Palestinians and disarming the settlers, and expressing a determination to see the relevant previous Security Council resolutions implemented. Such a resolution must also express strong support for the peace process, and underscore the removal of Israeli obstacles standing in the way of peace efforts. This is because without the achievement of just and comprehensive peace that returns rights to their lawful owners, the region will remain fertile ground for violence, chaos, and terrorism. The newspaper TISHRIN also comments on the same issue, but from a different angle. The paper says: It is no coincidence that the occupied Syrian Golan settlers council has expressed full support for Rabin's policy, which is extending support and backing to the settlement drive in the occupied Syrian territories. This stand by the settlers council was also prompted by Rabin's frustration with the Washington talks, and also by the efforts he has made to block a just and comprehensive peace in the region. The paper adds: It is Rabin who armed the settlers, and authorized the deployment of joint army-settler patrols. It is Rabin who blinded himself to the launching of an army of settlers, and to their recent continuous threats to perpetrate massacres if the Palestinians fail to quickly vacate their lands and abandon their property. The paper goes on to say: Rabin has consecrated settlement activities as a constant pillar of his government's policy. The Washington peace talks ran into the intransigence of the Israeli negotiating teams. Meanwhile, Rabin was expanding settlements in the West Bank and the Golan and building new settlements. TISHRIN maintains that peace is the antithesis of settlement activities, and that the achievement of peace is contingent upon the dismantlement of the settlements and the evacuation of settlers. TISHRIN touches on the Washington peace talks, saying that they are moving in a vicious circle, because the Israeli Government is opposed to withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. Besides, the paper says, the efforts made by many international parties have failed to persuade Israeli rulers that peace is far more important than settlement activities and territorial expansion. Had Rabin responded favorably to the Arab demand for withdrawal from the occupied territories, peace would have been close at hand, and the Washington talks would have made great progress along the path of achieving just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. However, Rabin, the paper adds, has chosen to lend deaf ears to the calls for true and durable peace, and dragged the Palestinian negotiators to a flawed and lame agreement that consecrates occupation and settlement activities. The end result has been the horrifying Friday massacre, which killed more than 60 innocent Palestinians, and wounded hundreds of others. Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: By its perpetration of subsequent crimes and its rejection of the requirements of just, durable, and permanent peace, Zionism is addressing a message to the world community, through this massacre, telling it that it has not changed, even by a hairbreadth, its racist and aggressive colors, and that it will proceed with its criminal schemes, even if thousands of innocent victims are to fall.
