Shortly after his election success, the leader of National Alliance referred to Benito Mussolini as "the greatest statesman this century has seen," to the horror of the international press. And even within the composite Pole for Freedom, Umberto Bossi has not changed his mind: "Fini is the head of a reactionary right wing." Nevertheless, even Berlusconi would do well to keep an eye on this young partner of his. At 25, he was a modest editor on the obscure SECOLO D'ITALIA, the organ of the untouchable MSI [Italian Social Movement]. At 44, he is at the head of the third-largest force (105 deputies and 43 senators) in the 12th republican parliament, and the fulcrum for any government majority. What is more, they say he is already working on eventually becoming the leader of an Italy brought once more under the yoke of the Right. What is Fini like in person? Polite, moderate, controlled; cold as only those who have a lot of scores to settle can be. What is he hiding under his double-breasted jacket? In an attempt to find out, L'ESPRESSO subjected him to a long third degree. [Padellaro] Berlusconi's greatest quality? [Fini] Spontaneity, enthusiasm. [Padellaro] His worst drawback? [Fini] Inexperience, a total lack of political experience. [Padellaro] How long can a Berlusconi government last? [Fini] It can go full term, just as it may not even see the light of day. [Padellaro] What is it about Bossi that astounds you? [Fini] His absolute unpredictability. He spends his time giving the lie to himself without ever suffering the consequences. [Padellaro] What is it that you cannot stand in him? [Fini] He is really coarse. He is more propaganda than policy, more rallying than reasoning. [Padellaro] And how does Fini assess himself? [Fini] Persevering, more obstinate, I think, than anyone in the world. [Padellaro] Faults? [Fini] Too methodical and mentally organized, so tending to be unimaginative. [Padellaro] What use would you have for imagination? [Fini] For keeping my opponents off balance. [Padellaro] A definition for Francesco Cossiga? [Fini] The Unfinished. [Padellaro] Why unfinished? [Fini] He was fantastic when he realized that the system was collapsing, when, as president of the republic, he broached the issue of renewal by taking a pick to it. However, when it was time to rebuild, he disappeared. [Padellaro] And what associations does Giovanni Spadolini bring to mind? [Fini] Well, beatific tranquillity. No false notes, and no screeching. [Padellaro] Which members of the old nomenclature are worth saving in your opinion? [Fini] Very few, or rather none. [Padellaro] And President Scalfaro? [Fini] He acquitted himself very well during the election campaign. He was impartial and, when necessary, he defended national unity. [Padellaro] So he can stay on at the Quirinale. [Fini] Scalfaro is the last president of the old republic. If the new one is born, it is inevitable that he must step down. [Padellaro] So all power will be vested in the Pole for Freedom? [Fini] Of the three of us, I have been the only one to say that the lower house and senate speakers can be elected with a wider majority, as they are institutional appointments. [Padellaro] Which features of fascism do you think ought to live on in Italy today? [Fini] The attempt that fascism made to give our populace dignity. The ability to get things done that transformed little agricultural Italy, as it was in 1919, into a socially advanced nation. [Padellaro] A quality in which you would like to take after Mussolini? [Fini] Oh my God.... [Padellaro] His autocratic style? The magnetism that he exerted so skillfully? [Fini] No, no. I think that the one thing a secretary of National Alliance has to avoid is being compared with Mussolini. [Padellaro] Oh come on, do not overdo it. There must be something you admire in him. [Fini] Yes, the concordat, the reconciliation between state and church. Not for nothing the pope called him a man of providence. [Padellaro] And your other great mentor, Giorgio Almirante? Did he ever have the feeling that there was no room for the Right any more? [Fini] The split in '76 had very grave consequences for the party. [Padellaro] Did Almirante ever imagine the MSI in government? [Fini] I remember that he told some of us in '78 or '79: "My generation will never see our ideas get into government, but yours will." [Padellaro] Have you ever beaten a communist up? [Fini] I have given as good as I got, but I have never been a prize fighter in my life. D'Alema Is More Dangerous [Padellaro] How did you get on with communist students when you were at university? [Fini] With some you could reason, talk about things, perhaps as you would in a drawing room with friends who have different ideas. Then there were those who said that killing a fascist was not a crime. [Padellaro] And in parliament? [Fini] I have known PCI [Italian Communist Party], then PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] deputies of great substance and great ability. And I have met some who were real animals. [Padellaro] Name names. [Fini] I prefer not to talk about the animals. A left-winger that I respect is Farniano Crucianelli of Communist Renewal, a highly civilized person with whom I have peaceful discussions and play soccer. [Padellaro] Do you see anything in the communist ideology worth saving? [Fini] Nothing whatsoever. Communism has not been defeated in a world war; it collapsed by itself because it no longer responded to the needs of the peoples concerned. [Padellaro] Berlusconi continues to identify the PDS disparagingly with the old PCI. Do you think this is right? [Fini] No, I call them PDS members or postcommunists. What I mean is that I accept that they no longer call themselves communists. [Padellaro] What has the PDS taken over from the old style of communism? [Fini] Illiberality. For example, for the Left of a certain type, an opponent has to be criminalized as soon as he proves dangerous. [Padellaro] Do you feel criminalized by the Left? [Fini] The Left has assumed a schizophrenic attitude to me. I was criminalized from 21 November to 5 December 1993, which was when I might have become mayor of Rome. Then I was a fascist. Afterwards, when Rutelli had won, I became a fair, correct opponent. [Padellaro] Nevertheless, the progressives did not treat you too badly during the recent election campaign. [Fini] While I disagreed with Berlusconi, they told him: "You cannot form an alliance with the fascists, otherwise you will become the black knight. Then, when the alliance was formed, they turned to me and said: `Are you crazy? Someone like you with a certain social element forming an alliance with the capitalist, an enemy of the workers.'" [Padellaro] Is the fair play that the PDS has largely shown you merely tactical? [Fini] No, I do not think so. When Occhetto and D'Alema say that there must be a European Right in Italy, I believe they mean it, if only because a European Left needs a European Right in a two-party system. [Padellaro] Which is better: Occhetto or D'Alema? [Fini] They are two very different people. [Padellaro] How do they differ? [Fini] D'Alema is much colder, more methodical, more lucid, more determined, a real product of the party school. Occhetto has a penchant for witty remarks. On a human level, I like him better, but politically speaking, D'Alema is much more dangerous. [Padellaro] Once you are in government, will your party reopen the issue of autonomy for the Alto Adige region? [Fini] We feel the time has come to open a sort of second package to give the Italians equality with the Germans. [Padellaro] And Istria must become Italian again? [Fini] First of all, the Italian character of the area must be protected under a bilateral treaty. However, the frontier question remains an open one. [Padellaro] How can your nationalism be reconciled with the League's federalism? [Fini] I would describe myself as patriotic rather than nationalist. [Padellaro] Is Bossi patriotic? [Fini] Not in my view, indeed I do not even know if he is aware of the distinction between native country and nation. [Padellaro] But what brand of federalism can AN [National Alliance] accept? [Fini] Our brand of federalism is compatible solely with the presidential republic, like the United States. The League's macroregions run the risk of shattering what little we have left in terms of national identity and state. [Padellaro] Are you in favor of the Europe that emerges from the Treaty of Maastricht? [Fini] It is an unequal match for Italy. It is as if the Solbiatese [minor soccer team] were to challenge Milan. Something has to be changed. [Padellaro] And what must Italy call for at the forthcoming G-7 summit in Naples? [Fini] That Europe pay strategic attention to the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East. The new trading markets are to the south, particularly now that peace may well break out between the Israelis and the Palestinians. [Padellaro] Talking of Arabs and Jews, which side does your heart beat on? [Fini] The trouble is that both sides are right. However, my sympathy was with Israel during the `67 war. I admired their military organization, the structure of their state. But I was 15 years old at the time. [Padellaro] The death penalty. Are you [plural] still in favor? [Fini] It is not a matter of current priority, and we have never called for the reintroduction of capital punishment. [Padellaro] And what do you call for? [Fini] We demand that the sentences laid down in the penal code be served right to the end. I believe that 30 years in jail means civil death for a man, but they must be 30 years in jail and not 10 that then become eight with concessions and may even be reduced to six. Craxi? Off To Work in a Factory! [Padellaro] Is it time to bring the kickback city investigations to an end? [Fini] To bring them to a proper end, those found guilty must give back their ill-gotten gains. [Padellaro] Do you want to see Bettino Craxi in jail? [Fini] I want to see Craxi get up at half past six every morning, catch a bus, go to the factory, clock on, and find 1.5 million lire in his pay packet at the end of the month. It seems to me a fitting punishment for a symbol of corruption under 60 years of age. Let us have those over 60, on the other hand, live on the welfare pension, which is undoubtedly the harshest sentence. [Padellaro] The RAI [Italian Radio and Television]. [Fini] It must remain public, but under completely new management. This leveling of debts must cease. [Padellaro] And what about the media? [Fini] We call for true pluralism, guaranteed by the professionalism of the journalists. [Padellaro] The name of a television journalist that you cannot stand? [Fini] Look, journalists with a political bias do not bother me, provided they do the job well. Santoro is factious in the extreme, but he is certainly no fool. What I cannot stand is a factious fool. [Padellaro] So Santoro can go on presenting "Il Rosso e Il Nero" [The Red and the Black]? [Fini] I would have nothing against leaving him there. It is the Santoro clones who are unbearable. [Padellaro] For example? [Fini] For example, there is a journalist who reads the TG3 [Channel 3 news] press survey in the evening, a woman who even gets her accents wrong, who cannot even read Italian. I should like to know how she got where she is. She will undoubtedly be carrying the right party card. [Padellaro] And which of the Fininvest newscasters is better, Fede or Mentana? [Fini] From the professional point of view, Mentana. [Padellaro] And your top favorite television journalist? [Fini] Gad Lerner. And Giuliano Ferrara as well. [Padellaro] Are there a lot of people wanting to jump on your bandwagon now? [Fini] I have been noticing in the last few days that the national sport is not soccer but the running jump onto the winners' car. We have the world champions at this sport, as I think Berlusconi is noticing as well. [Padellaro] How about naming a few specialists? [Fini] Mainly top civil servants and managers with state-held corporations, the RAI, and the banks, figures that would not even have given me the time of day a few days ago but are now calling me obsequiously: My dear fellow, how are you.... No, we shall not let ourselves be corrupted by those who have undergone last-minute conversions. [Padellaro] Whey did you decide not to be a member of the government? [Fini] Along with a small number of friends, I had the winning idea of National Alliance, which is now the third-largest party in the country. Now I want to devote my energies entirely to pursuing a strategy that sets out to achieve right-wing government. [Padellaro] The Right on its own? [Fini] Not even the DC [Christian Democratic Party] managed to govern Italy on its own. Let us say the Right in a constantly consolidated position. [Padellaro] Abortion. Will you call for the law to be amended? [Fini] The right to life must be guaranteed. The right to abortion as a last resort must be guaranteed only in cases of rape or when the mother's life is at risk. I reject the view of abortion as basically a method of contraception. [Padellaro] Convincing Pannella will be no easy matter if you go into government with him. [Fini] There is no doubt about that. But he will definitely not convince us. [Padellaro] Drugs? [Fini] The referendum abolishing the principle whereby drug abuse is an illegal deed that should be punished was madness, and it must be remedied. We also call for a more determined defense of family values. [Padellaro] How? [Fini] For instance, giving homosexual unions legal recognition would be a violation of principle. The Flame Remains [Padellaro] Racial intolerance? [Fini] It must be stamped out with the utmost severity, but the Martelli Act [on immigration] needs rewriting. There is a limit beyond which integration is not possible, if we do not want an outbreak of xenophobic tension and agitation. [Padellaro] Your comrade Buontempo is crusading against prostitution and the transvestites. Are you in favor of bringing back brothels? [Fini] I am not very up on this issue. However, I would tend to be skeptical about legalization. [Padellaro] Has any book been of fundamental significance to you? [Fini] Giuseppe Prezzolini's Il Manifesto dei Conservatori [The Conservatives' Manifesto]. Until I read the book, I had always been convinced that conservative was a pejorative term. [Padellaro] What was it that persuaded you to join the Right? [Fini] My aversion for the arrogance and barbarism of a certain type of left wing. And a movie. [Padellaro] Which movie? [Fini] The John Wayne movie, "The Green Berets," the one about American intervention in Vietnam. I was 17, and a Lotta Continua [Continuous Struggle] picket wanted to stop me going into the cinema. The day after, there was a placard at school saying "Fini, you fascist, you're first on the list." So I said, hell, you just want to go a movie and you end up pilloried. The only ones who took my side were the guys from Giovane Italia [Young Italy]. [Padellaro] Do you think that the preconceived hostility to fascism has died out now? [Fini] Antifascism served to legitimize the old communist party in Italy. Perhaps it no longer serves any purpose now, but if it did, it would be revived, make no mistake about that. [Padellaro] A lot of right-wing youths were seen giving the Roman salute during your election victory celebrations. [Fini] This is ritualistic behavior, and it has no political significance. Those youths just want to express a need for identity. Nevertheless, I hope that our young people will make their presence felt in a different manner. [Padellaro] Is it true that the base from which the tricolored flame issues in the MSI's emblem represents the coffin of the Duce? [Fini] That belongs to the realm of mythology, to the tales told around the right-wing fireside. I asked Almirante, and he replied that he had heard of it, just as they used to say after the war that MSI meant "Mussolini is forever immortal." Really, the flame symbolizes boldness, and the object under it is a trapezium. [Padellaro] Will the flame symbol survive? [Fini] Yes.
