FR940203-2-00089 FR940203-2-00055 Alternate Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the FES. Agencies and Persons Contacted The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and contacted the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Bureau of Radiation Protection, which had no objection to the proposed license extension. Finding of No Significant Impact The NRC staff has reviewed the proposed change to the expiration dates of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3 operating licenses relative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR part 51. Based on the environmental assessment, the Commission concluded that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological impacts associated with the proposed action and that the proposed license amendment will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed amendment. For further details with respect to this action, see: (1) The application for amendment dated May 21, 1992; (2) the ``Final Environmental Statement Related to Operation of Peach Bottom Power Station, Units 2 and 3,'' issued April 1973; and (3) the Environmental Assessment dated January 24, 1994.
