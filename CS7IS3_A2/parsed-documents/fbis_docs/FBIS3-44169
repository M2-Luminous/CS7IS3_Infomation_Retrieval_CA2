Speaking at a local government seminar in Durban, Mr Miller said there should be "no question" about kwaZulu and the IFP's commitment to the Local Government Transition Act which was signed into law last week. This was in spite of the IFP and kwaZulu government having withdrawn from national negotiations on the act. At the signing of the act last week, Mr Miller caused excitement when he said the IFP would "participate fully and absolutely in third-tier government". Some political observers said his announcement might have paved the way for IFP participation in national elections on April 27. However, IFP national spokesman Ziba Jiyane said Mr Miller was probably just expressing his own "hopeful" opinion. But, speaking in Pietermaritzburg on Monday, Mr Miller said IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had personally endorsed his party's full participation in new, democratic local government structures. In Durban on Tuesday, Mr Miller said he also had the full backing of the kwaZulu government in committing it to participation in transitional local government structures. "We'll participate fully. We want to be part of the solution, not the problem. Let's go into this process together, determined to make it work." While Mr Miller is known to support IFP participation in the April 27 elections, a final decision on the party's stance will become clear only at the weekend at a special general conference in Ulundi.
