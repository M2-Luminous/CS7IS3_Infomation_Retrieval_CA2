Major crimes that get a lot of attention force them to take action. But with the passage of time, things go back to "business as usual," as exemplified by the gangs of drug traffickers who wallow in bloodbaths in the Acari shantytown, the scene of a dispute over drug markets. Under the eyes of police who are in league with them, the rival bands portray the two faces of the collusion-dependent personality of organized crime: Parazao, the Red Command's enforcer, accused on one occasion of having cut up a 10-year-old boy with a chain saw because he had been playing on their turf, is the bad side, the one that encourages terrorism. His archenemy, Jorge Luis, is worshipped as a god by the community for maintaining an atmosphere of tranquility, as if he were the good side. The shantytown is the stage where the gang members cavort, always with violence. These gangs prosper only because there is no police presence. Filling the vacuum, the drug traffic and the numbers game lords take their positions, give orders, and revoke them, counting on the complicity of the police. In last week's bloodbath, in which 12 people were killed after 30 traffickers arrived by truck and vans, armed with machine guns and grenades--there is, as always, a suspicion that the police were involved. Before the violence broke out, three [police] vehicles had driven through the favela, as if casing the area. Traffickers identify police from the Drug Enforcement Division as being associates of Parazao. Thus accused of corruption and complicity, the Rio de Janeiro police are once again the focus of attention, in a privileged position alongside the traffickers in their fury. That is where one finds the examples of insubordination, corruption, abuse of power, violence, and promiscuous collusion with organized crime. The police complain about low wages--a pretext for under-the-table actions. But money is not their only problem. The cancer originates in poor training, of both civil and military police. Society itself, at the mercy of organized crime and corrupt policemen, has contributed to the spread of the outrages. When the three police forces--federal, civil, and military--work together under pressure from public opinion, we get some results. But normally they are rivals, very often pursuing the same booty. The drug traffic should long ago have been made the number one priority of the police because of its toxic effects, the violence, its tremendous power to fragment a society. What characterizes the Brazilian police is precisely its failure to set priorities: its activities dissolve into indecision, into lack of purpose. The result is a disproportion that is less and less perceived, between the ability of the police to curb delinquency and the increase in the security crisis. The Acari favela is a typical example: the police know the gangs are there, know who the leaders are, know their hideouts, and know what territories they are fighting over. But the police cannot manage to get organized--or do not want to organize--to combat them. The dispute has become so acrimonious that it has been suggested that the army intervene to battle the traffic in the shantytowns. Political considerations have killed that initiative. After the massacre, the police visited the favela. Strategically, organized crime waited for them to leave before going back into action. It is a vicious circle. It has come to the point where violence not associated with any spiritual principle has degenerated into a gratuitous force, into satanic frolic, into violence for violence's sake, and it will ultimately destroy everything around it. Meanwhile, the police are still standing by, arms folded.
