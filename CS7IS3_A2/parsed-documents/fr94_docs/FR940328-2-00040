FR940328-2-00040 FR940328-2-00022 Western Area Power Administration Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects Electric Power Marketing Draft Environmental Impact Statement AGENCY: Western Area Power Administration, DOE. ACTION: Notice of availability and notice of public hearings. SUMMARY: In 1980, the Western Area Power Administration (Western) began examining its marketing criteria for long-term capacity and energy sales from the Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects (SLCA/IP) due to the impending expiration of existing long-term contracts in 1989. Western proceeded to develop the Post-1989 General Power Marketing Criteria and Allocation Criteria for the Salt Lake City Area, and completed an environmental assessment (EA) in late 1985. In response to controversy over the potential environmental effects of the proposed marketing criteria, Western announced in the Federal Register on April 4, 1990, its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on its power marketing and allocation criteria (55 FR 12550). Following extensive public involvement and analysis, Western's SLCA/IP Electric Power Marketing Draft EIS has been prepared and is now available for public review and comment. Five public hearings will be held to discuss the alternatives presented in the draft SLCA/IP Electric Power Marketing EIS, and allow the public to ask questions and provide formal comments for the record. A 90-day comment period will extend until June 29, 1994. During the public hearings, written and oral statements will be accepted. A court reporter will record the proceedings. Persons, organizations, or agencies wishing to make oral statements will be asked to register at the door prior to the beginning of the hearing. Western will respond to comments in the final EIS. There will be an informal public information session before each hearing where the public can discuss aspects of the draft EIS with Western representatives at several information stations.
