[Al-'Anani] The Jordanian Government met on Saturday morning following the announcement and held an extensive debate on it. The government decided that the resolution, Security Council Resolution 904, is generally positive, contains some points that we regard as positive, and advances the issue it dealt with, primarily the protection of the Palestinian people and their security on their national soil. We found the clear reference to the occupied Arab territories, including Arab Jerusalem, to be positive. We believe that the clear and strong denunciation of the massacre was one of the positive points. The note on the need for Israel to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1945 in all occupied Arab territories, including east Jerusalem, was a positive point in that resolution. We believe it is now necessary to adopt practical measures to translate the resolution into a tangible reality, because the Jordanian Government notes with extreme concern that the injuries and killings in the occupied Arab land since the massacre on 25 February are increasing considerably. We must take measures that will guarantee the protection and security of the Palestinian people. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] After Security Council Resolution 904 denouncing the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was passed, is it now certain that the peace process will be resumed? [Al-'Anani] You know the massacre happened while consultations were under way among the heads of the delegations of the countries participating in the negotiating process. But after consultations among themselves, these delegations made a collective decision on the need to suspend the negotiations until measures are decided following the horrible carnage in Hebron. We believe the resolution has contributed to creating a favorable atmosphere for resuming negotiations to reach a comprehensive, just, and durable solution based on UN Resolutions 242 and 338 as well as 425, which concerns Lebanon. Jordan believes the road is now open to return to negotiations but, as happened before, the decision [to resume talks] must come after coordination among the negotiating countries or among the foreign ministers of the cordon states that held previous meetings in which Egypt participated, represented by its foreign minister. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Where does the Jordanian-Israeli track stand? [Al-'Anani] The Jordanian-Israeli track of the negotiations at the end of the consultations among the delegation heads in Washington almost reached the point of formulating some topics on the agenda and a detailed subagenda was agreed for negotiating these topics. On water, energy, and the environment, there was agreement on most of the topics that must be discussed in this framework. But security and the borders, as some of the key topics on the agenda, on the basis of which an agreement will be reached on the mechanism of Israel's withdrawal from the Jordanian occupied territories, are not yet settled. Besides, the issue of refugees still needs discussion. We can say that there is an atmosphere that calls for optimism about progress but we cannot say that any (?positive) progress has occurred on substantial issues. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is your [words indistinct] Arab coordination, especially with the resumption of the peace process in April? [Al-'Anani] Jordan has always believed in the need for full Arab coordination to support and continue the peace process because Arab coordination unifies Arab stances and precludes unilateral measures. Some issues on the agenda on the Arab track are interlinked and we want to make sure that the Arab stances are harmonious and integrated. We believe the horrible massacre of Hebron has provided clear evidence that any decision or measure affecting a single track, such as the Palestinian-Israeli track, is bound to have obvious repercussions and effects on other Arab tracks that would block their progress. We believe that Arab coordination (?strengthens) Arab stances and prevents unilateral measures and competition among Arab tracks at their own expense.
