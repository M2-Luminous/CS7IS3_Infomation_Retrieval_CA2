Lula invited Mercadante to go with him to the United States as the PT's leading economist. During a lecture for 800 bankers, Mercadante yesterday said that he would give "a big headache to Bill Rhodes." In this he was alluding to William Rhodes, the representative of the steering committee for Brazil's creditor banks. The phrase caused great displeasure, and to the audience sounded like a threat. Lula sought to minimize the issue, but the U.S. investors still left the meeting fearing that a PT government would eventually break the recent debt agreement.
