Launching the manifesto at Nasrec outside Soweto, ANC President Nelson Mandela said the future government billed increased jobs with higher incomes, housing with electricity and water, education and health care as priorities. The theme of the ANC's election manifesto is "a better life for all". Apart from promising to uphold all the basic conditions experienced in an ideal democratic society, the ANC have an ambitious reconstruction and development programme. An ANC government hopes to be successful in stopping the violence, which will encourage foreign investment. Thus with expectations of a dynamic and growing economy, the ANC plans to address the high unemployment. Their national public works programme alone promises training and jobs for about 2.5 million people over the next 10 years, building roads and much-needed facilities. Education was also a top priority and the ANC plan to use the R[Rand]23 billion already set aside for education to give, among other education programmes, all youths 10 years of free and compulsory education and double the number of free text books The ANC promise to focus on the seven million squatters and homeless by tackling the housing crisis. They promise that within the next five years, an ANC government could build over one million new homes, provide running water and flush toilet to more than one million families and electrify 2.5 million rural and urban homes. As for land reform, the ANC government will guarantee victims of forced removals restitution, to be carried out fairly through a land claims court. State land will be used to implement land reform. Health will become more affordable under an ANC government with cheaper treatment and medicines and free health care for children under five years old Overall, the ANC plans to increase public expenditure without raising taxes on ordinary people. The ANC will end vat on basic foods like flour, milk and sugar, reduce income taxes on those earning under R4,000 a month and end unfair taxation of women, married and single. But they will make sure every business pays its fair share. By investing in jobs, housing and education, the ANC believe the economy will grow and bring in more revenue. They are also relying on beneficial international aid and loans. Plus, their objective is to carefully use money available carefully without squandering funds to corruption and bureaucracy, as in the past. All security forces will be reformed to reflect the national character and a new volunteer army will deal with the defence of the country without being involved in political matters. Detention without trial will be done away with and the system of justice will be made more accessible, cheap and fair to everyone. In foreign affairs, the ANC government will become a full member of the Organisation of African Unity, United Nations, non-aligned movement, the Commonwealth and other international bodies. The question is: Can Mr Mandela fulfill these extravagant campaign promises? Criticism has already begun. Vague on many vital question like taxation and land reform, it could give masses the impression they will be all be enjoying the living standards of the white middle class. Critics say the manifesto was irresponsible and could create problems. Should the sad reality not meet their expectations, there are fears their disillusionment could turn to violence. So far, Mr Mandela has been careful to avoid making wild promises. He has been reported as saying it could take "some years" for a government to respond fully to the need of black people after 300 years of white supremacy. As the ANC stressed in their manifesto, only if everyone works together in an environment of peace and stability, can their plans succeed.
