He said it is clear that general calls to the Bophuthatswana government have not helped and that if necessary discipline must be enforced by the security forces in an impartial manner. At a news conference on the last day of his northern Transvaal election campaign road show, President de Klerk said he had discussed the issue with ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson Mandela. Mr. Mandela had raised the question of state intervention in Bophuthatswana with him. President de Klerk said he had told Mr. Mandela that his security and other advisers were keeping him fully briefed on the situation in the homeland and that any intervention would depend on whether the lives and property of South Africans were in danger. He said he would possibly make a statement on the matter by tomorrow.
