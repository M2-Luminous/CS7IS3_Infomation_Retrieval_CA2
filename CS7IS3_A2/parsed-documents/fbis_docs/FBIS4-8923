Can you hear me? [Pernod] Good evening, I can hear you. [passage omitted] There have been developments. Since 2000 this evening the weapons have started to be brought in, that is, we have been putting them under our control. Four have already arrived, the others are following. According to Major (Endic), the situation should be back to normal tomorrow, to what it was before the UN air strikes. This is of course [word indistinct] but we will see how things turn out tomorrow. [Announcer] Colonel, what pressure is being put on the Serbs to return these weapons? [Pernod] Well, we have continued the negotiations all afternoon. I assume that these negotiations are in conjunction with other negotiations of which, evidently, I am not aware. These negotiations are undoubtedly being conducted at a higher international level. I refer to Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Mr. Yakushi Akashi and at the level of governments. As far as we are concerned, we have negotiated all afternoon and the pressure has drastically decreased. Tomorrow in theory, we expect to have the freedom of movement we enjoyed before last week's air strikes. [Announcer] Thank you, Colonel.
