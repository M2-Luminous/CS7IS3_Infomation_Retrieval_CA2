The delegation is one of the three that are scheduled to visit several post-communist countries this and next week, to help launch the preparation of individual programs within the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace agreement. Bierring said the principal issue at talks in Lithuania were consultations on how to prepare a presentation document, which is the first step toward developing an individual partnership program with NATO. In Lithuania, the delegation held consultations with a special working group that was created immediately after Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas signed up for the partnership plan at the NATO headquarters in Brussels last week. Albinas Januska, deputy minister of foreign affairs and head of the group, said the presentation document will be ready quite soon. "It is a matter of several months," he said. "Lithuania is on the way to active participation" in the partnership, Hermann Freiherr von Richthofen, German ambassador to NATO, said, commenting on whether Lithuania is now considered "an active partnership member." According to the Partnership for Peace framework document, NATO will consult with any active participant in the partnership if that partner perceives a direct threat to its territorial integrity, political independence or security. Januska said Lithuania's goal is absolutely clear - transition from partnership to membership in NATO. Hence, the Lithuanian version of the presentation document will identify the steps that should be taken to achieve this goal, including joint military exercises and changing arms according to NATO standards, he said. "It is necessary to direct the money that Lithuania spends on defense toward closer cooperation with NATO. Lithuania is not so rich as to spend money on cheap things," Januska said. Sarunas Vasiliauskas, Lithuanian deputy minister of foreign affairs, said Lithuania is prepared to invest in projects that would meet NATO standards. "A system of air space control would be an example of this." Januska said Lithuania intends to ask NATO countries to donate some of their arms. But the visiting NATO officials did not mention any advancement in discussions on possibly donating weapons that must be destroyed according to international agreements. Colonel Richard Cohen, branch chief of the NATO Military Cooperation, Plans and Policy Division, said the United States and Great Britain earlier cascaded weapons to Turkey, Spain and Portugal. But the colonel doubted whether there is any suitable equipment left for the purpose. Cohen said, however, that the Baltics might get something through separate agreements with NATO countries. The NATO delegation leaves for Tallinn Wednesday evening. It also includes Klaus Steinkopff, special assistant to the Supreme Allied Command Europe, and John Barret, representative of the NATO Political Affairs Division.
