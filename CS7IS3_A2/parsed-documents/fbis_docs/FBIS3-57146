Not only our country, but the whole world has been engaged in speculation: Who is going to occupy the ministerial offices in Moscow in the end? As is the custom, as the Christmas holidays approached, everyone started trying to frighten each other. And very successful they were, too. It is said that the blackest day in the history of the Tokyo stock exchange was the day of Stalin's death. On that occasion shares fell by hundreds of points and there was ruin on a mass scale. Naturally, Gaydar's resignation cannot be compared to a "father of the peoples" departing this world. But it too had an explosive effect. There was a disastrous fall in the ruble rate and a sharp increase in prices within the country. The rate of the West German [as published] mark against the dollar fell markedly. As did the currencies of the states with the closest economic links to Russia. Naturally, as always at a time of instability, gold prices rose rapidly. The simplest explanation for what happened is that the threat of the departure from the Russian Government of the people they call reformers is causing doubts about the continuation of the course of reforms. In short, it transpires that industrial and financial circles, both in our country and elsewhere, did not have too much faith in assurances from the Kremlin that the policy of reforms will continue. But surely the point here is not speculation about whether or not the reforms will continue. The government crisis is making people think about what these reforms, now in their third year, actually consist of. This is no idle question. After all, if the purpose and strategy of the reforms were obvious, then reactions would have been prompted by changes in that strategy (about which nothing is yet known), not in the composition of the government. But, as was the case 40 years ago, both for citizens of Russia and for the world in general, this country's economic policy is unpredictable. And this leaves no alternative but to think in terms not of the policy, but of specific individuals, be it Pavlov, Gaydar, or Chernomyrdin, whose actions in specific situations can be predicted, at least to some extent. And when those people go, the panic starts. Maybe that is in fact the chief weakness of the Russian reforms. Because these reforms do not constitute a concrete program. They are a highly individual mix of slogans and reactions to developing situations in the economy. I realize that Gaydar and his team, when they took over the management of the economy, had no time for strategy. A situation close to chaos prevailed in the country: barter, empty stores, ration cards. The reformers found a lever with which to lessen that chaos -- price liberalization. And they tried to implement that liberalization as strictly -- not to say cruelly -- as possible. Basically, all the long-term loan bonds which past governments had given out to the population were scrapped. As a result, by bringing about a considerable fall in living standards, the reformers managed to bring domestic prices into line with world prices. This promptly uncovered a fact which our economic isolation had concealed for a long time. Namely, that virtually all sectors of our industry are cost-based and not competitive. It was not a conspiracy, but the operation of objective laws unleashed by the reformers, which made us see our economy in its true light. It emerged that the majority of goods produced in Russia are not only worse, but more expensive than those produced abroad. That if you are guided solely by the economic expediency of today, it is far more advantageous to put large padlocks on virtually every sector. And to export oil, gas, and other raw materials, and buy all you need with the funds thus earned. But Russia is not a Persian Gulf state. Although nowadays even there they are trying to diversify the economy, making use of the funds earned from oil sales. Our own reformers stopped short of what should in fact have been the essence of the reform -- restructuring of the economy. I cannot say whether this was a strategic error or whether they simply could not do it, because of the fierce political struggle which has become one of the most important factors in our economy. In any case, it transpired that hope was pinned mainly on the idea that the required restructuring would take place of its own accord, under the influence of objective market laws. Yet the reformers knew that spontaneous market forces brought the Western world to crisis in the early thirties. Since then the governments of developed countries, which have always had market economies, have not let go of the economic helm. And if we have decided to enter the world market, it was of fundamental importance for the reformers to decide exactly what we were taking to that market. That is, to decide exactly which sectors, if not today, then tomorrow, are capable of producing goods that will be in demand. And then to support those specific sectors, not every sector. Today, when this kind of support is mentioned, for some reason it immediately prompts alarmist talk of concessionary credits and subsidies which the government is going to start handing out right and left without the reformers' supervision. Those who have political and personal influence know how to raise the threat of strikes or simply to shout loudly. I agree that such credits do in fact stimulate only one area of production -- the printing of money that is worth less and less. But maybe this abnormal situation occurs because our captains of industry are simply disoriented. They do not know which sectors, apart from the fuel and energy complex, Moscow considers priorities. If they had some idea of that, they would be able to plan their own strategy right now. Curtail one area of production and try to start up another. Move free capital into sectors with a future. And citizens would not be in a state of total confusion, not knowing where to go with their vouchers. After all, credits are not the only thing in the world. You could support priority sectors through tax concessions, or even not demand tax from them at all. Thereby promoting an influx of Russian and foreign capital. That is, try to do everything that is done by economic departments in the countries whose example we are trying to follow. It would be the height of impudence for me to embark on a concrete analysis of an economic program. That is what the professionals should be doing. Instead of trying to frighten each other with talk of impending chaos. A citizen has a right to know what the reforms really mean for him personally, apart from rising prices, declining living standards, the threat of unemployment, and being splashed with mud from the wheels of the proliferating Mercedes. If his sphere of activity has no future from the government's viewpoint, he should have been told this long ago. Along with a suggestion of what speciality -- other than selling sausages in the square outside the station -- might bring in a stable and honest income. Heaven knows, I have great respect for Yegor Gaydar, who possesses a combination of determination and intelligence that is rare in Russian politicians. But I do not want my well-being to depend on whether he or anyone else is still in the government. I want to be able to plan my own life. But I can only do that if I know what the state wants to do.
