This microphone, concealed inside a wall, had been transmitting the ongoing talks and conversations in the Iranian Embassy in London to Britain's espionage apparatus. The action of the British Government in eavesdropping and diplomatic espionage in the embassy is totally contrary to international laws and is considered as interference in our country's internal affairs. The embassy of a country is regarded as that country's territory and, on the basis of the Vienna 1961 Convention, enjoys special privileges and immunity. The British Conservative government therefore, by resorting to espionage in the Iranian Embassy, has violated the Iran's sovereignty, too. The British Government, which considers itself the vanguard of international law, human rights, the fight against terrorism, and other similar titles, has directly resorted to espionage inside the Iranian Embassy in London. Almost simultaneously with the exposure of the British espionage activity in our London embassy, John Major's government, in order to provide a cover for this huge disgrace, began some baseless propaganda on contacts between Iran and the Irish Republican Army. This show was not even effective in Britain, so much so that the British press and media too confessed that these allegations are false and vague. Unfortunately Britain, this permanent member of the Security Council and the so-called protector of international peace and security -- the same as some of its western allies -- is pursuing its anti-human objectives without care for any regulations and law. This country's behavior in the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue has exposed in the best possible manner the true face of this so-called free democratic state. Britain brings pressure to bear on any state which opposes its policies, by resorting to such accusations as human rights violations, attempting to obtain nuclear weapons, and terrorism. Whereas Britain itself is classed as one of the major international lawbreakers.
