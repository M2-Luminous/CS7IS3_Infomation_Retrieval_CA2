Delegates will assess the period of the HZDS government, elect a new leadership and approve a new election manifesto and statutes. According to the latest public opinion poll conducted immediately after the March 14 dismissal of Vladimir Meciar from the post of Slovak premier and the ousting of his cabinet, HZDS's shift to the opposition increased its popularity among voters to more than 26 percent (against 22 percent in February). Given this trend, the fragmented political scene and the loss of interest by a considerable part of the population in politics, Meciar's comeback as head of a new government after the autumn elections cannot be ruled out. Observers do not rule out that a further split of Meciar's movement, which now has 56 deputies, down from a total of 74 after the June 1992 parliamentary elections, can occur at the congress. According to speculations, the postponement of the movement's change into a party could result in the withdrawal from the movement of social democratic-minded deputies with parliamentary foreign committee chairman Ivan Laluha at their head. Attending the congress are representatives of the Slovak historical cultural institution Matica Slovenska, the Confederation of Trade Unions and the Farmers Party. Members of the diplomatic corps of the United States, Russia, China and other countries are also taking part. Slovak President Michal Kovac sent a letter to the congress, but it was not read. At the HZDS conference in Presov, east Slovakia, HZDS Deputy Chairwoman Olga Keltosova today said that it was unacceptable for the movement to be reduced to maintaining a defensive policy before the early elections in autumn. She rejected politicking by individual HZDS members who want to act in line with their "conscience," and said that the HZDS's election policy should be unified. The foundation of Milan Knazko's Alliance of Slovak Democrats and Ludovit Cernak's National Democratic Party-New Alternative caused a personal and institutional catharsis in the political centre, to which the HZDS belongs, whilst the political spectrum on the right and the left has remained stable, Keltosova said. The process abetted by various media has strengthened "political anti-culture," she added. In a letter sent to the conference, Slovak President Michal Kovac described the HZDS as a meaningful political force. "It would be no good if I hid the tension between the HZDS chairman (Meciar) and the president which had gradually grown into open attacks on the Slovak President," said the letter, read at the conference. Kovac said this conflict had not been personal, but because of its social and political character it had had a negative impact on developments in Slovakia. At a brief press conference in a break of the HZDS conference, HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej Kozlik said the movement would develop as a pragmatic centre party after the autumn elections. The HZDS would seek to cover up a broader spectrum of opinions and thus follow the line common in other European countries, Kozlik said. Keltosova told journalists after the first day of the HZDS conference that the HZDS would develop as a political centre party and rejected the idea of the HZDS being a "pragmatic centre party." She said that the HZDS was not likely to change into a party at the current two-day conference and added that in future the HZDS would maintain a clear political profile. She described as the most acceptable option the movement's entry into the liberal international. Keltosova confirmed that ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar's shadow cabinet would meet regularly once a week. She said former HZDS ministers would participate in the work of the cabinet and that the vacancies would be gradually filled.
