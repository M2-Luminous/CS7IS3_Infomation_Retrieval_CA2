"This is always the position of the Chinese side," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin at a routine news conference here this afternoon. He made the remark when responding to a question about the British Hong Kong Government having last week asked the Legislative Council to make allocation of funds to the provisional administration of the airport. "Before agreement is reached between the two sides, unilateral actions will do no good to the settlement of the financial arrangements," the spokesman said. He revealed that the Chinese and British sides still have working contacts within the new airport committee.
