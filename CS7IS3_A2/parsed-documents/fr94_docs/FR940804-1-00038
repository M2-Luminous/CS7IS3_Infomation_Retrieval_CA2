FR940804-1-00038 FR940804-1-00013 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC83 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Rule to List the San Diego Fairy Shrimp as Endangered AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list the San Diego fairy shrimp ( Branchinecta sandiegoensis ) as endangered throughout its range in southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This species occurs in vernal pools and is threatened by a variety of factors including: Habitat destruction and fragmentation from agricultural and urban development, alterations of wetland hydrology by draining, off-road vehicle activity, and cattle and sheep grazing. This proposed rule, if made final, would extend the Act's protection to the San Diego fairy shrimp. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by October 3, 1994. Public hearing requests must be received by September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials concerning this proposal should be sent to the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Carlsbad Field Office, 2730 Loker Avenue West, Carlsbad, California 92008. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Fred M. Roberts, at the above address (telephone 619/431&hyph;9440). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The San Diego fairy shrimp ( Branchinecta sandiegoensis ) is a member of Branchinectidae, a freshwater crustacean family in the Order Anostraca (fairy shrimp). The species was first described by Michael Fugate (1993) based on collections made at Del Mar Mesa in San Diego County in 1990 by himself and M. Simovich. The San Diego fairy shrimp is closely allied with, and has historically been misidentified as, B. lindahli , a species widely distributed in western North America. The San Diego fairy shrimp was first collected (but then identified as B. lindahli ) in Poway and Ramona, San Diego County, in 1962; additional collections were made on Kearny Mesa in 1979 (Simovich and Fugate 1992). The San Diego fairy shrimp is restricted to vernal pools, which occur in areas with shallow depressions that have a clay hardpan soil layer that inhibits water percolation. This results in a perched water table during the winter rainy season and the following spring. Vernal pools retain water only long enough to support relatively few species of aquatic emergent plants and invertebrates. As the pools dry and the surface water recedes toward the center of the pool, a unique and dynamic flora develops in its place. Vernal pools typically occur on mesa tops or valley floors and are surrounded by very low hills, usually referred to as mima mounds (Zedler 1987). The San Diego fairy shrimp is a small and delicate animal with large stalked compound eyes, no carapace, and 11 pairs of swimming legs. Mature males are from 9 to 16 mm (0.4 to 0.6 in) in length and females are 8 to 14 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in) in length. They swim or glide upside down by means of complex beating movements of the legs that pass in a wave-like anterior to posterior direction. The second pair of antennae on the adult female are cylindrical and elongate, but in the male are greatly enlarged and specialized for clasping the female during copulation. The female carries the eggs in an oval or elongate ventral brood sac. The eggs are either released or remain attached to the female until she dies and sinks. The thick-shelled eggs are capable of withstanding high heat, cold, and prolonged desiccation.
