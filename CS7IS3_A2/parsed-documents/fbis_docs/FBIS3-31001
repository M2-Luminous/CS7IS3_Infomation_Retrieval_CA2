The meeting, which came a week ahead of the Febuary 21 deadline set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for the Serbs to pull back their heavy guns, grouped Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special representative Yasushi Akashi, the UNPROFOR commanders for ex-Yugoslavia and Bosnia -- Generals Jean Cot and Michael Rose -- and Admiral Jeremy Boorda, commander of NATO's Southern Command. Akashi told reporters afterwards that the meeting "was to make sure that UN and NATO work in concert with each other. It was fruitful. It seems that we think in the same way." The talks, held at UNPROFOR's logistics base at Zagreb airport, marked the third time since Tuesday that General Cot and Admiral Boorda had met here to discuss possible NATO air action against Serb positions around the Bosnian capital. "This meeting is very important to the success of our mutual endeavour," said Boorda's spokesman Captain Jim Mitchell. He added that the talks aimed to define "whose the responsibilities are" on "both sides of this team."
