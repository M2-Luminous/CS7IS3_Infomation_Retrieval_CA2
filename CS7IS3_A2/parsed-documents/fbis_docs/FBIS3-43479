The parties are discussing the issue of the national police. Our correspondent Pedro Manuel has further details from Lusaka: [Manuel] Good evening. The second round of peace talks has already begun and there has already been a break. During this morning's plenary session, the United Nations presented a document on the national police to be examined by the negotiating teams. This is the issue that is currently being discussed. The negotiating teams examined the document and UNITA requested a break to give a reply. Thus, there was no meeting this afternoon. Political observers here in Lusaka are questioning the powers of UNITA's new negotiating team. We say new team, because the head now is General Eugenio Manuvakola and the deputy head is Jorge Valentim. Antonio Dembo, the former head of the delegation, and Generals Ben-Ben and Gato did not return to Lusaka. Some people say that all this is part of UNITA strategy to [words indistinct] things. This not the first time that this is happening. In each negotiating round, UNITA always changes the heads of its delegations. According to political observers, this change is part of its strategy not to bind the new head by agreements made by the former head [words indistinct]. This was the case in Addis Ababa and also in Abidjan. Here, we have to wait and see [words indistinct] duly sign agreements reached. Meanwhile, Angolan Ambassador to Zambia Pedro Fernando Mavunza convened the national and foreign press to report that UNITA continues to carry out a movement of its war machinery. The ambassador cites a communique from the General Staff of the Angolan Armed Forces. According to a reliable source, UNITA continues to reaffirm its intention to occupy some key posts in the government and favors the holding of local elections. All this will be placed on the negotiating table after the discussion of the issue of the national police. UNITA asked Alioune Blondin Beye to give it a break to examine the UN document on the national police [words indistinct].
