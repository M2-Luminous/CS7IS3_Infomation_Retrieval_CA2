The solution to the problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not lie in the shelling of particular armed positions for this is absurd and ridiculous. It is a cover up for there are two issues which are separate from each other. They are the racial annihilation of Muslims and the political issue of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as far as the method of governing it and the representation of each party. This is purely a political problem which does not require weapons nor be solved by shelling. But the annihilation of Muslims is another issue and beyond Sarajevo. For Muslims are being annihilated everywhere in Yugoslavia and not in Sarajevo. The shelling of some positions has nothing to do with this even if it stopped the annihilation of Muslims. We are with the Serbs in the political problem of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and against them in the racial annihilation of Muslims which is not at all a political issue.
