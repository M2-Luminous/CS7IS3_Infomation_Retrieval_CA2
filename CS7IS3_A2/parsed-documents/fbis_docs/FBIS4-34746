The minister, who said Cuba "works with determination," admitted the U.S. Administration "does what it can rather than what it wants" regarding Cuba, and he characterized this government as being less aggressive than that of its Republican predecessors. Mentioning the critical economic situation, Robaina said there is nothing more tense or a greater challenge in Cuba today than a housewife trying to prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner for her family. He said the country is living and changing, however. Robaina said those of the new generation, which includes half the Cuban population, have their goals and desires, but they dream with their feet firmly planted on the ground. "Twice we removed forms of government and mechanisms that did not conform to our reality. We have had this experience for the second time." He said he hopes the changes will be implemented as rapidly as possible "because we Cubans are the most interested in eliminating shortages." Robaina told the more than 170 businessmen and bankers attending the event that Cuba "is not interested in other people sharing their views but, rather, in these views being considered when Cuba is discussed." He added: "Most of those who invest in Cuba are neither for nor against our economic model, but they are tired of hearing predictions that the Cuban Government will collapse, predictions which do not happen." Robaina also said: "The mere fact that you are present here and helping us look at our situation from a different angle is an indication of the changes and credibility of our project. You are already part of that miracle." The participants of the event will attended a reception tonight, offered by the Cuban Government.
