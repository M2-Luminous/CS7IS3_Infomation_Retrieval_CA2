The Zionist enemy's calculations would have been totally different as well, especially since it is a usurper entity, whose true aims cannot be concealed by claims of security and military superiority while the memory of the glorious battle and al-Husayn missiles is still vivid in our minds. Unfortunately, many Arab rulers and officials have degraded themselves, Palestine, and Iraq, whom they are now blockading after participating in the aggression against it. They were against Iraq when it was facing Israel alone; a sole warrior knowing no hesitation or compromise over rights despite all the support Israel garnered from the imperialist and neo-imperialist forces. Here the degradation and the compromises have produced their racist Zionist puss. The Zionist entity has dared to commit a hideous massacre, killing prostrate worshipers in the mosque of Ibrahimi, the grandfather of prophets, at dawn prayer on a Friday in the holy month of Ramadan. Could there be anything more degrading than this massacre?!! If the boiling public anger were to react by avenging Arab honor, becoming an anger for Palestine, its people, martyrs, and our holy places, then it is also bound to clash with those governments that pledged to guarantee the security of Israel and the safety of its existence and borders. They used all their political, financial, and military weight to kill the Palestinian revolution, as a weapon and a source of strength. They have also gone a long way toward sponsoring and encouraging submission and deviation, until some of them joined the U.S. settlement bandwagon, which was started by Bush and Baker and is now continued by Clinton and Christopher. When everything -- the land, the people, the holy places, and the factors of history and geography -- becomes negotiable, then even the martyrs' blood is seen by these degraded weaklings as a surmountable problem. For instance, they think it is sufficient to switch the talks from Cairo to Washington, amid theatrical appeals for self-restraint, in order to continue the negotiations so as not to hamper the negotiation process. This is itself a political massacre of the Palestine question. We wonder, had this crime been committed by someone else, would we have heard the same calm U.S. diplomatic talk? Or would we have witnessed threats, fast UN resolutions, military reinforcements from all direction, pressures, sanctions, and land, air, and sea blockades on all political and economic levels?! With the Ibrahimi Mosque bloodbath, the world stands face to face with the U.S. sword that threatens world nations, their rights, and honor. Here is the UN Security Council, despite all the martyrs who fell on their national soil at the tombs of the prophets and martyrs razed by Israeli Army bullets as a punishment for their bereavement; here is the Security Council, after quarter of a century of occupation and half a century of usurpation, destitution, and murder, still holding consultations in unofficial sessions to draft a resolution renewing its confidence in the Israeli Government's ability to tackle the situation in a just and wise manner. In order to throw dust in our eyes, the capitals of domination and oppression have issued verbal condemnations, shed crocodile tears over the victims, and declared their deep concern about the fate of the settlement and the negotiation process!! Amid this Arab fragmentation and all this degradation and submission to the tyrant and the enemy, amid the absence of international legality and the Arab League's use of the American language rather than the Arabic language, and amid the dwarfing of the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic Conference Organization, this massacre has occurred with all its ugliness and implications. It has shown to the people of Palestine, the Arab nation, and all Muslims a glaring picture of their present status and what their future will hold if this weakness, fragmentation, and absence become solidified under agreements that are now being dictated by Washington so that Tel Aviv, with all its power and nuclear weapons, would be free to shed more Arab blood and to occupy our lands and holy places. What the enemies want must not be our inevitable fate. Here is giant Iraq standing high and proud with its full willpower, honor, and historic leadership; and here are the heroes of the intifadah with all their vigor, filling the land of Palestine with stones, bullets, and martyrs to prove that they are strong and that their resolve knows no despair or fatigue. These heroes disdain every false and crafty condemnation, because they and all honorable Arabs and Muslims know that they have the final say in this epic struggle, whose fire could not be extinguished for 75 years on the land of Palestine. Their epic is Palestine's modern history, which will become more radiant with the blood of the righteous martyrs of the Ibrahimi Mosque. Immortality and glory to the martyrs. Glory to the fighting revolutionaries. Long live Palestine free and Arab. Long live our glorious Arab nation. God is great.
