FBIS3-28727 "dreas028__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-028-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Officials Comment on `Wide Gap' in U.S. Talks OW1002131994 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1002131994 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Unattributed report] [Text] A government official disclosed on 9 February that a U.S. official in charge of the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks has proposed a plan to submit at the 11 February Japanese-U.S. summit meeting an "interim report on consultations" which includes a side-by-side listing of points of dispute between Japan and the United States as they currently stand. The United States has apparently taken this step after judging that it has become difficult to reach an agreement with Japan in such individual trade sectors as automobiles and auto parts, over which negotiations have been stalled. Because the United States has termed this report as being "interim" in nature, there is a strong possibility that the trade talks will virtually be extended. Therefore, prospects are that negotiations now will turn to dealing with the case of the two nations failing to reach an agreement. The interim report plan has been proposed by W. Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy and who is the U.S. official in charge of deputy-level negotiations. The report is said to list, side by side, Japanese and U.S. assertions over such issues as "numerical targets." The agreement reached by Japan and the United States last July concerning the new framework trade talks stipulates that an assessment be made of the progress in the trade talks at a deputy-level meeting prior to the summit meeting and that a report subsequently be submitted to the leaders of the two nations. A Japanese Government official asserts that "because the United States has further pressed for setting numerical targets even in the area of government procurement, where negotiations have made relative progress, the trade talks as a whole have regressed instead." In this connection, a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said on the evening of 9 February: "No work has been done to narrow the gap between Japan and the United States at the resumed negotiations in Washington between Koichiro Matsuura, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs, and W. Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy. They are already talking about what to do now." On the same evening, MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said, "There is a wide gap (between Japanese and U.S. assertions)." He expressed the hope that a negative impact on bilateral relations can be kept to a minimum even in the case of an agreement not being reached.
