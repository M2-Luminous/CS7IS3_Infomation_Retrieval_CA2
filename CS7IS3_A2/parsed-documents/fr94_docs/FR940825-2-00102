FR940825-2-00102 FR940825-2-00070 The CIT has observed that ``Congress carefully limited the availability of §1675(b) investigations'' and that ``the party seeking review bears the initial burden of showing the existence of changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a review.'' Avesta I, 689 F. Supp. at 1180, 1181; Avesta II, 724 F. Supp. at 978; A. Hirsh, Inc. v. United States, 729 F. Supp. 1360 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1990) (Hirsh I), aff'd following remand, 737 F. Supp. 1186 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1990) (Hirsh II). This burden is placed upon the party seeking review because the review investigation does not begin with a clean slate as though it were an original investigation. Matsushita, 750 F.2d at 932. Although a petition for institution of a review need not ``prove'' that changed circumstances exist such that injury would not recur upon revocation, it must nevertheless contain credible evidence which, if uncontroverted by other evidence, would persuade the Commission that a full review is warranted. Avesta I, 689 F. Supp. at 1181. In determining whether a full review is warranted, the Commission is permitted to weigh the evidence presented to it. The Commission analyzes the specific facts alleged in the petition and fully evaluates all the evidence submitted in support of, and in opposition to, the petition. Full reviews will not be instituted based upon mere allegations in a petition, allegations that are clearly contradicted by evidence submitted by others in response to the Commission's notice, or allegations that are contradicted or undermined by a petitioner's own data. Thus, the Commission decides whether to initiate a review, not based solely on the allegations contained in a petition, but also upon a critical evaluation of the entire record. Avesta I, 689 F. Supp. at 1181. In this case, the request alleged three changed circumstances warranting review: (1) Changes in enforcement of country of origin marking requirements for manhole covers; (2) the extension of Buy America restrictions to procurement of iron construction castings in airport construction; and (3) the extension of Buy America restrictions to procurement of iron construction castings in all highway construction that receives federal financing. The information available on the record does not persuade us that a full investigation is warranted for any of the three allegations. The changes in country of origin marking requirements for manhole covers significantly predate the Commission's original determination. The statutory change occurred in 1984, and there is documented evidence of its enforcement by Customs prior to 1986. Because those requirements were in effect prior to the Commission's injury determination, they are not ``changed'' circumstances. The two separate extensions of Buy America restrictions, however, occurred after the Commission's determination and do constitute ``changed circumstances'' that are not the natural and direct consequence of the imposition of the order. With respect to the extension of Buy America restrictions to airport construction, the Canadian industry admits that the change only affects 2 percent of total U.S. consumption. In the context of this market and the relative shares of the market reflected in the original record, such a marginal impact alone is not a changed circumstance sufficient to warrant review. The third ``changed circumstance'' concerns a 1991 amendment to the Buy America provisions (Section 165(a)) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. Section 1048 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 extended those Buy America restrictions to iron. Amended section 165(a) reads as follows: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Transportation shall not obligate any funds authorized to be appropriated by the Act *␣*␣* unless steel, iron, cement, and manufactured products used in such project are produced in the United States. 23 U.S.C. 101 note (emphasis added). The Canadian producers insist that this amendment has effectively precluded them from competing with the domestic industry in 60&hyph;75 percent of the U.S. market. In this case, because ``the vast bulk of construction castings are ultimately purchased and used by utilities, municipalities, and other such entities for civil construction purposes,'' government contracts comprise a substantial portion of total sales. Iron Construction Castings from Canada, USITC Pub. 1811 at A&hyph;9. It is not at all clear, however, what percentage of the total market is covered by Buy America restrictions and how the extension of Buy America restrictions has affected the U.S. market generally, or any segment of the market in particular. The only available objective evidence of the impact of the Buy America restrictions on U.S. sales of Canadian castings_import trends_suggests that the restrictions have not had a significant impact on such sales. If the extension of Buy America restrictions had a significant impact on the ability of Canadian producers to compete in the U.S. market, then one would expect to see a decline in imports from Canada, and from all other sources as well, shortly after the extensions took effect. Data supplied by the Canadian producers regarding import trends, however, indicate that, after the extension of the Buy America restrictions, imports did not decline significantly. In 1986, when the order was first imposed, imports of iron construction castings from Canada reached 21,377 short tons. While imports declined subsequently, the significant decline in imports predates the extension of Buy America restrictions in 1991. Imports declined from 18,312 short tons in 1989 to 11,996 short tons in 1990. In 1991, such imports declined slightly to 10,233 short tons. Although imports dropped further to 8,312 short tons in 1992, data available for the first three quarters of 1993 indicate that imports from Canada already exceeded 1992 full-year levels and were likely to exceed 12,000 short tons by the end of the year. See Petition at Appendix 22. Declines in imports followed by larger increases in recent periods do not support the claim that the 1991 amendments have significantly affected the ability of Canadian producers to compete in the U.S. market. To support their assertion of the size of the Buy America market, the Canadian producers submitted only a conclusory and unsubstantiated declaration by a member of the Canadian Foundry Association. No methodology was identified and no source was cited for the estimates. Further, the Canadian producers acknowledge that their estimates are based on favorable assumptions regarding future actions by state and local authorities in extending their own Buy America restrictions to cover iron construction castings. They argue that such actions, while not mandatory, ``are reasonable to expect.'' We find persuasive the domestic producers' objection that such expectations of future state and local administrative actions do not constitute changed circumstances. See Avesta I, 689 F. Supp. at 1185 (``A future intention does not show changed circumstances in the present.''). Moreover, the Canadian producers did not provide any evidence regarding their shipments to particular U.S. market segments and the effect of the extension of Buy America restrictions, if any, on shipments to each of those market segments. In sum, we believe that the Canadian estimates of the Buy America market are overstated. Although Buy America restrictions have been expanded as the result of federal legislation, it is not clear how broad they are and how much of the iron construction casting market is now affected by them. Although the Canadian producers have arguably raised an issue of fact that may have merit, if true, they have not provided sufficient evidence to persuade us that the petition shows changed circumstances warranting review. While the petitioner need not prove its case at the institution stage, the petition, as filed, must contain more than the conclusory allegations submitted in this case. Because neither probative supporting evidence, an explanation of methodology, nor any concrete indication of the significance of the extension of Buy America restrictions has been provided, there is insufficient evidence to warrant a full investigation. Absent such evidence, we determine that it is inappropriate to institute a review. Accordingly, the request for a review is denied. Finally, in the absence of a review of the Canadian order, a self-initiated review of the order covering iron construction castings from Brazil, India, and China is inappropriate. By order of the Commission. Issued: August 17, 1994. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20931 Filed 8&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
