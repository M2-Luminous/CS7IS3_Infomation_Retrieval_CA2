He was met by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' at Damascus International Airport. Christopher came 4 hours later than what was scheduled and the American Embassy here did not explain the reason. He is going to hold talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and hand him the Israeli peace plan on returning the Golan Heights to Syria. Israel seized the Golan in the 1967 Middle East war. According to a statement issued Friday [29 April] by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, the Israeli plan includes Israeli perspective on phased withdrawal from the plateau and normalization of relations between the two countries. Christopher stated in Israel Friday that he is going to hold important talks here to revive the Syrian-Israeli talks. He said that the aim the U.S. tries to reach is establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region, something which necessitates enhancing the talks on the Syrian-Israeli track. During his current Mideast tour, Christopher has already visited Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel.
