CTK learnt this from a source close to the Czech delegation led by Baudys which started a three-day official visit to France today. According to the source, the Czech Republic has been maintaining close relations with MATRA since 1992. Experts and parliamentarians from both countries had agreed to test the Magique-2 missiles on MiG-23ML planes with which the Czech Army is equipped. The relevant agreement was signed in January and the tests were carried out by Czech pilots on two MiG-23MLs from March 28 to April 11 in France. The result was very good, the source said. It also said that the two types of missiles were too costly for the Czech Republic and that Baudys only wanted to know conditions offered by MATRA. "Though the negotiations have progressed quite far, no trade agreement is in the offing. But it cannot be ruled out in the future," the source said. The French party offers direct and indirect compensation for the missiles, the source said. "In case of direct compensations, the Czech Republic would produce mechanical parts for French guided missiles which would then be supplied to other countries," the source said. Indirect compensation consist in supplies for MATRA's civilian programmes. The company produces Renault-Espace cars and MATRA-Hachette publishes books and magazines. According to the source, the French recently supplied guided missiles to Finland, Norway and Austria in exchange for supplies of component parts for cars and of paper.
