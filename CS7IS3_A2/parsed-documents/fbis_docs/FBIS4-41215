New Draft Criminal Code Reflects New Crime Situation"] [Text] Russian citizens have always found it hard to comprehend the winged phrase uttered by the literary hero that the Criminal Code ought to be respected. Even more so in these new times of troubles, when everything at home is topsy-turvy. And especially since the archaic nature, ideologization, and conservatism of the criminal legislation currently in force are obvious to everyone. The attempt to produce a new Criminal Code (two years ago) was successfully thwarted. A fresh attempt is being made now. A working group comprising specialists from the Ministry of Justice and the State Legal Administration and eminent legal scientists has completed its work on the general section of Russia's new Criminal Code. Working group member Sergey Romazin, chief of the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice Administration for Elaboration of Legislation on Judicial Reform and Struggle Against Lawbreaking, answers ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's questions. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Sergey Borisovich! You must agree that the reality in our country is harsh. Explosions echo in the streets, contract killers operate, all and sundry talk about mafia and corruption. The president's latest edict "On Urgent Measures..." is a kind of line drawn beneath a far from brilliant state of affairs. Will the new Criminal Code provide a kind of panacea against criminal misfortunes? [Romazin] It is necessary to make this clear straightaway: The general section of the new Criminal Code is the part which formulates the general principles of criminal policy, offers material definition of crimes, categorizes crimes, explains terms like "recidivism" and "organized forms of crime," and elucidates questions concerning the system and categories of punishment, criminal records, and others. The special section of the Criminal Code -- which is not yet ready -- will cover specific crimes and the punishment for them. Now let us turn to explosions and panaceas. One of the tasks facing the working group was to bring criminal legislation in line with the criminological realities of today. Of course, these questions will be largely resolved when drafting the Criminal Code's special section. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What is and what is not deemed a crime? [Romazin] The definition of "crime" is fairly brief: "Any act (whether of commission or omission), prohibited by criminal law and causing damage or threatening to cause damage to an individual, society, or the state, is deemed a crime." Let me draw attention to the fact that this definition already reflects the contemporary hierarchy of values protected by the state from criminal infringements: the individual, society, and the state. This sequence will also provide the foundations on which the system of the new Criminal Code's special section will be built. The following also stems from this definition: People cannot be punished for acts which are rejected by society on moral or ethical grounds but are not specified in the criminal law. The Ancient Roman jurists used to say: "There is neither crime nor punishment unless so provided by the law." Substantial amendments have been introduced in the Criminal Code's general section on punishment. Censure, the imposition of an obligation to make restitution for any damage caused, and corrective labor have been excluded from the list of punishments. The latter category of punishment is purely Soviet because, until quite recently, we had the socialist idea of "re-education through labor." You have to agree that this is an anachronism in the market era. The Criminal Code retains forms of punishment like fines, deprivation of the right to hold certain office or engage in certain activity, deprivation of military or special ranks, confiscation of property, and imprisonment. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] How about the death penalty? [Romazin] The draft's authors failed to reach unanimity on this question. Under the Constitution, the imposition of the death penalty is restricted only to cases involving the commission of especially grave crimes against life. By way of an alternative, it was proposed to altogether abolish the death penalty as a form of punishment and introduce life imprisonment. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] When talking about organized crime, the law and order organs blame the lack of a legislative base for the struggle against it. Does the draft Criminal Code fill these loopholes? [Romazin] Having worked for more than 30 years in the courts, let me say that all references to the lack of a law in the struggle against organized crime are more myth than reality. Even the Criminal Code currently in force makes it possible to institute proceedings not only against "underlings" but also against the top mafia bosses. As a matter of fact, this should be the topic of a separate conversation. But as regards the draft, let me say this: Staffers of law enforcement organs will be given a clear definition of what constitutes a group of persons conspiring to commit a crime, and the very term of an organized criminal fraternity group will be explained. The struggle against this type of crime will probably be helped by the formulation that all persons participating in a group crime are equally liable regardless of the function they may have performed, according to previous agreement, during the commission of the crime. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] In other words, henceforth anyone hiring a killer will be held liable for premeditated murder. [Romazin] Exactly. Moreover, participation in any form of group criminal activity will always attract harsher punishment. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] It is well known that criminality is now "getting younger." Has this trend been taken into account by the draft's authors? [Romazin] Most certainly. Taking into account the results of age psychology studies and criminological indicators, a standard age of criminal responsibility is brought in at 14 years. At the same time, if a 14-years old adolescent accused of having committed a crime is psychologically retarded, he will be deemed not liable to criminal proceedings. For the first time, it is proposed to introduce in our legislation a norm imparting legal significance to the fact that a crime has been committed by someone aged between 18 and 20 years. What does this mean? In exceptional cases, taking into account the nature of the committed crime and the specific features of the accused's personality, the court may apply measures of punishment provided for minors against persons who are 18, 19, or 20 years old. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] The press and academic literature have expressed the opinion that it would not be a bad thing to introduce criminal liability for legal persons. [Romazin] At present only physical persons can be held criminally liable, in other words citizens who have reached a certain age, are mentally healthy, and so on. At the same time, there are frequent situations when criminal liability for any damage caused to the environment or the health of millions of citizens as a result of harmful discharges by industrial enterprises attaches to some "fall guy" (as a rule the shop foreman, shift or section chief, and so on who has been forced to implement an unlawful decision made by the legal person's collegial organ -- board of directors, shareholders' meeting, and others -- under fear of punishment, dismissal from work, and so on). This is, to use the legal language, an objective imputation. Consequently, a person is sentenced but the crime goes unpunished. Our authors' collective sees just one way out of this legal arbitrariness: In the event of any act specified by the criminal law, the actual legal person itself will be subject to criminal -- and I emphasize: criminal, not any other -- liability. A few words at this point about punitive measures. The draft makes provisions for fines, prohibition to engage in certain activity, confiscation of property, and winding up of legal persons. Let us hope that the fear of criminal punishment will force our firms, joint-stock companies, enterprises, and other organizations to adopt a more respectful attitude toward the law and bring their corporate interests in line with the interests of individuals, society, and the state. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] So, work on the Criminal Code's first section is completed. What happens next? [Romazin] The draft, whose discussion is not yet complete, will be submitted to the president for onward submission to the State Duma once all remarks and proposals have been summed up. I assume that this will happen this year. There is no room for any further delay -- I think that everyone realizes this. Especially today, when State Duma deputies, numerous jurists, and the mass media are perfectly justified in sounding the alarm about divergences between the edict "On Urgent Measures..." and the Constitution. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] One last question. Quite often staffers of law and order organs advocate making the Criminal Code harsher. What is your opinion? [Romazin] Any professional would confirm that the main point in the struggle against crime is not the harshness of punishment but its inevitability. According to militia statistics, more than 2.5 million crimes are committed each year but only something like 800,000 criminals actually stand trial. Anyone can draw his own conclusions. Nonetheless, I would not say that the draft is all that liberal. Any persistent criminal, murderer, rapist, and anyone who crudely tramples the law is "entitled" to expect harsh punitive measures and look at the draft Criminal Code as quite tough. At the same time, persons who have committed nonviolent crimes, who have repented for doing so, and who have made restitution for any damage caused, can hope for lenience by the law. Thus, it would be more appropriate to talk not about harshness but about the principle of differentiated criminal liability, which is consistently implemented in the draft new Criminal Code.
