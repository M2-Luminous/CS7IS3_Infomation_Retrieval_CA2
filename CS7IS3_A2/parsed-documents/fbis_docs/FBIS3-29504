The outline, endorsed at a morning cabinet meeting, is based on a tax revision framework produced by the ruling coalition parties and a report by the Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, both issued earlier this month. The government's package to amend tax laws will be submitted to the current ordinary Diet session. The platform calls for tax cuts worth 4,391 billion yen but leaves out any decision on a possible consumption tax hike and other measures to finance the tax cuts. The government "will continue discussing tax reform to realize it by the end of the year," it says. The tax cuts comprise 3,843 billion yen in national income taxes, 172 billion yen in inheritance taxes, 306 billion yen in abolition of special corporate taxes, and 70 billion yen in reducing the 4.5 percent consumption tax rate on passenger cars to 3 percent. The income tax cuts are limited to one year, and the reduction amount does not include planned local resident's tax cuts. The platform recommends revising land and housing tax systems to stimulate the land market and facilitate home purchases, estimating tax breaks worth 15 billion yen. To back smaller businesses, deadlines on special tax breaks on their streamlining investments will be extended for six months to three years. Various unfair tax treatments are also subject to revision, including donations at nonprofit organizations and entertainment expenses on smaller companies. On unexplained expenses that are said to be used by companies to write off political donations and bribes, the government is to impose a punitive levy of 40 percent on top of regular corporate tax, but this will be limited to a period between April 1, 1994 to March 31, 1998. The outline also calls for higher liquor tax rates.
