SUMMARY: In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S. Code, chapter 35), this notice announces a request for a reclearance of an information collection. SF 3104, Application for Death Benefits (FERS), is needed for the Office of Personnel Management to determine whether death benefits should be paid, to whom, and in what amount. SF 3104A (attached to SF 3104), requests information from the survivor which is used by OPM to determine entitlement to a survivor annuity supplement (supplementary annuity). SF 3104B is used by the deceased employee's former employing agency in death-in-service cases, to supply the survivor's application for death benefits (SF 3104). Approximately 3,546 SF 3104s are completed annually. We estimate that it takes 60 minutes to fill out the form. The annual burden is 3,546 hours. Approximately 2,766 SF 3104Bs are completed annually. We estimate that it takes 60 minutes to fill out the form. The annual burden is 2,766 hours. The combined total annual burden is 6,312 hours. For copies of this proposal, contact C.
