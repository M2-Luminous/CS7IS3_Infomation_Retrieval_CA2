The new order of entry to the zone was set up by the regional administration in accordance with the law on the state frontier of the Russian Federation. The border zone has turned recently into a place with high criminal activities. A lot of people rushed to the area to collect wild hemp used for drug production, to steal agricultural products, vehicles and so on. Frontier guards have stopped quite a few attempt to smuggle goods by Chinese citizens across the Amur River.
