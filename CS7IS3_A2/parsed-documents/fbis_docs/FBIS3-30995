[Bartisek] Ten members of the HZDS club of deputies to the Slovakian National Council see a certain new solution to the current crisis in an option to create a government of reason, a so-called government of broad coalition. Mr. Prime Minister, people from the HZDS, the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], the Christian Democratic Party [KDH], the Slovak National Party [SNS], and the Alliance of Democrats are being considered for this--however, without leading figures of those parties. You will give your view on participating in the government only following tomorrow's session of the HZDS caucus. Nevertheless, could you give us your view now on this proposal? [Meciar] There are two matters here. One concerns the content of the proposal, and the other one is the way it came about. At yesterday's session, under the weight of evidence, Mr. Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik finally admitted that, without the knowledge of the Movement's political bodies, without the knowledge of the government members, they had held talks with opposition political parties about a different alternative solution. As they were not strong enough, they attempted to gain support within the HZDS club, and, so far, they have been joined by 10 deputies. This does not mean that all those 10 deputies would vote against the government during a vote of no-confidence in the government. Some of them would, and some would not. The way they acted contradicts the principles of democracy, it contradicts the HZDS's principles. It is immoral because, during talks, they looked their colleagues straight in the eye, pretending to be friends, and, in fact, they were working for the fall of this government. They must assume political responsibility for this. The proposal itself assumes the following solution. The first part is to remove political heads from the leadership. This means the political heads of the HZDS and the SNS. Logically, those others are not in the government. And we are in the government not illegitimately but on the basis of election results. The second part is the formation of such a broad coalition. What will be keeping them together besides material interests? Nothing. This does not have any chance of surviving. Some assume that elections might take place in a year's time--it is not to be expected [passage indistinct]. They would settle their personal, material, and group interests and then would hand over the ransacked state to those who win the elections. Third, it is the matter for the HZDS bodies to decide whether such a coalition would be viable. All its district congresses, with the exception of one--and that was more a technical matter--expressed their support for the government. This means that, if deputies are taking such a stance, they are acting against the resolutions of their district congresses, which are binding for them. There is yet another factor here: The HZDS did not express its interest in participating in any such government. My personal view is not to participate in such a government, not to participate in something that is being prepared under the pretext of the government's reconstruction if we want to have clean hands for the next elections. [Bartisek] The Party of the Democratic Left admits the possibility of a broad coalition. However, this has to be discussed by the political entities concerned. We have learned that, following your departure from Papiernicka [where HZDS deputies held session] yesterday, you held a telephone conversation with Mr. Weiss [SDL chairman], above all about the amendment of the privatization law. However, a proposal was also voiced about taking a vote of confidence in the government at the same time. What is the reason for such a link? [Meciar] This involves several things. First, this concerns system measures in the sphere of privatization that are to be implemented. Second, all of the opposition parties insist that we do not enjoy support in the parliament. They criticize the government and deprive the government of tools to carry out economic policy. This is like someone giving you a job but keeping the purse in his hands. This is nonsense. The government is expected to take responsibility, but the tools of responsibility are held by someone else. So, if they want to cripple the government economically to prevent government activities, let them to do it immediately. If the government enjoys confidence, they should not deprive the government of tools it can use in the sphere of politics. Regarding the linking of confidence in the government to the adoption of the law on privatization, no final decision on this matter has been made so far--roughly 50 percent are in favor and 50 percent against. Let us wait until tomorrow to see the decision made by the HZDS leadership.
