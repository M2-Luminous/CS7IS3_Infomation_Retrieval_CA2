FBIS4-2209 "drchi067_a_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General Foreign Ministry Spokesman News Conference Foreign Ministry Spokesman News Conference `Nobody' Going to Pyongyang HK0704094094 Hong Kong AFP in English 0923 GMT 7 Apr 94 HK0704094094 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP) -- China said Thursday it would send "nobody" to Pyongyang this month for President Kim Il-song's birthday party, in a sign of a brewing showdown between the communist allies over the Korean nuclear crisis. "The Chinese side will send nobody to the DPRK to attend the birthday celebrations of President Kim Il-song," said foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin, when asked at a weekly press briefing whether even a low-level delegation would go. Wu insisted Beijing enjoyed "good relations" with Pyongyang, despite reports in Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUN newspaper Thursday that North Korea had targetted some surface-to-surface missiles on China. The spokesman said Beijing had not sent any senior leaders to Kim's 81st birthday last year -- however, Beijing's dispatch then of only two artistic delegations was widely interpreted as a snub to its long-time allies in Pyongyang. China has tried to distance itself from Stalinist North Korea in recent years and the ongoing crisis over Pyongyang's suspected development of nuclear missiles has heightened the tension. While refusing to support sanctions against North Korea to force it to open its nuclear facilities to international inspection, China -- a UN Security Council member -- has not thrown its support fully behind Pyongyang while refusing a role as an intermediary in the dispute. On Monday, Pyongyang rejected a China-framed appeal from the Security Council for it to allow full International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. Wu dismissed suggestions the rejection had humiliated Beijing. "We are always of the view that the nuclear inspections issue of the DPRK should be settled through dialogue and all parties concerned in this issue also expressed their desire to continue resolving this issue through dialogue. So there is no such thing as losing one's face," he said. The Chinese ministry spokesman meanwhile reiterated Beijing's support for a negotiated settlement to the dispute, critizing the U.S. dispatch this week of Patriot missiles to South Korea. "Any action detrimental to the relaxation and stability of the situation on the peninsula, be it military exercise or deployment of missiles, is something we are not in favour of," he said. "Under the current circumstances, all parties concerned should in particular refrain from taking actions that will exacerbate the conflict," said Wu, urging all sides to show "patience."
