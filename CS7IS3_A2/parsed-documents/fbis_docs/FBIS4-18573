The National Council position is included in a joint statement issued this afternoon following the council's two-hour meeting chaired by President Glavkos Kliridhis. The president briefed the members of the National Council on the latest developments in the Cyprus issue in view of the UN secretary general's report on the direction of the proximity talks. The joint statement notes that the National Council wants to express its displeasure and disappointment with the Butrus-Ghali report to the Security Council. The statement adds that the National Council affirmed that the negative Turkish stance and lack of political will for a Cyprus solution, which make continuation of the dialogue unproductive, were ignored. Replying to a question after the National Council meeting, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that President Kliridhis will decide how to handle the issue when such a decision becomes necessary. Asked what President Kliridhis will do by the end of April and whether he will receive the UN secretary general's representatives to continue the proximity talks, the spokesman referred to the president's statement issued yesterday according to which he does not accept discussion of new documents or new amendments to the existing documents. Referring to the political leadership's trip to Athens to coordinate with the Greek Government, an issue raised by every political leader at the National Council meeting, the spokesman said the government does not object to the visit. He added that the time for such a meeting would be decided after consultations between the two governments. Reliable information obtained by CyBC [the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] notes that in the letter he will send to the UN secretary general, President Kliridhis stresses that he will accept no discussion of any new document or new amendments to the latest UN document of 21 March. Kliridhis notes that he accepts that document as it is. He emphasizes that the Security Council should proceed to examine alternative ways to implement its decisions.
