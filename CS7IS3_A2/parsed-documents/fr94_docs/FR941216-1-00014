FR941216-1-00014 FR941216-1-00005 The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. Class D airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only effect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).
