The businessmen had been meeting in Havana since Monday. PECA's final communique stressed the need for the U.S. Government to lift the blockade against Cuba. In a communique released to the press at the end of the meeting and read by PECA Coordinator Roberto Solis, it was reported that during the past three days the entrepreneurs continued to explore investment possibilities in Cuba that will be possible when the blockade comes to an end. The document added that the conference scheduled by the Cuban Government for April must contribute to normalizing relations between the country and Cuban emigrees, which for more than three decades have been negligible and intermittent. The Cuban-American professionals and entrepreneurs praised the fraternal and respectful atmosphere that prevailed during all of their discussions -- discussions in which specific proposals were made. Upon closing the seminar, Sergio Corrieri, the president of ICAP -- the Cuban Friendship with the Peoples Institute -- stressed that although there were differences of opinion, all statements by the Cuban-American professionals and entrepreneurs will be analyzed because they were made within a framework of understanding that must exist between Cubans here and those Cubans in the United States who have adopted a constructive attitude toward the Cuban revolutionary process.
