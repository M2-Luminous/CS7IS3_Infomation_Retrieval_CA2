Two recent tightenings by the Federal Reserve Board have pushed up short-term rates while worries of overheating boost longer-term rates and make Wall Street skittish, the central bank said in its monthly report on overseas economies. Fears are emerging about whether the American economy will grow at a sustainable pace around 3 percent or whether a recent surge will reignite inflation, a BOJ economist told reporters. In Europe, France is beginning to show clear progress in its stock adjustments, while Britain remains in a gentle recovery led by personal consumption, with employment conditions improving and industrial production on the rise, the report said. But growing German exports cannot overcome slumping domestic demand to put the country clearly on the path of recovery, despite production recovery in the former East Germany, it said. Gross domestic product in Western Germany fell in the fourth quarter after two quarters of gains as worsening employment weighed on consumption and delayed stock adjustments depressed capital spending, the report said. By contrast, it said that in China such investment in plant and equipment continues to fuel strong growth despite credit-tightening starting at the end of January to curb inflation. South Korea's economy is improving as exports rise, while Southeast Asia continues to grow strongly with increasing infrastructure spending and growing trade within the countries of the region, according to the BOJ report.
