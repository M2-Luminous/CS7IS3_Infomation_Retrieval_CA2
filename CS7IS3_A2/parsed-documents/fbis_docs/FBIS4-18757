Speaking on Saarland Radio today, Klose said: "The United Nations resolutions are constantly being violated; now the United Nations has reacted." In certain situations the international community has no other option but to reply to force with force. Klose said he was skeptical about a unanimous stance by the UN Security Council toward the Serb troops. To him, Russia's real role in the conflict remained unclear. On the other hand, the determination of the Americans regarding the Serbs had obviously grown.
