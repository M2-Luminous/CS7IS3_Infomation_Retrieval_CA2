The public relations office of the Ministry of Commerce reports that based on a joint proposal from the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a committee will soon be formed to study the Islamic Republic of Iran's membership in GATT. This committee's duties include a careful study of the pros and cons of GATT membership and its likely consequences, appropriate recommendations, proposals and policies to reduce the negative consequences of membership or nonmembership, identifying the political and legal obstacles and problems with membership or nonmembership in GATT and coordinating the utilization of GATT's technical and specialist resources. Some of Tehran's newspapers have recently vigorously opposed Iran's membership in GATT, and have seen it as a factor in the destruction of the nation's production units. In a series of harshly critical articles under the title "Consequences of the GATT Agreement for Developing Nations," the newspaper RESALAT questioned this organization's goals and wrote: "It appears that ultimately GATT has targeted the economic independence of the developing nations. If these nations submit to the GATT agreement, it will damage their economic independence, which is the foundation of their political independence and sovereignty, and the developing nations will become second-class members of the global village." On the other hand the Institute for Trade Studies and Research recently published a book called Understanding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and a Study of the Consequences of the Islamic Republic of Iran Becoming a Member. Esfandiar Omidbakhsh and Mas'ud Taromsari, the book's authors, write concerning the long-term consequences of membership: "Iran's economy is in a state of transition and we are in the phase of testing the effects of structural adjustments on the nation's overall economy and trade. We are still a long way from reaching an established and fully formed economic system. Yet membership in GATT is basically a long-term cycle and every nation desiring membership in this organization must make decisions in this regard in terms of its long-term economic and trade objectives. Therefore, the proper procedure for studying the issue of GATT membership for a nation such as ours, which does not have firm programs and policies--and, of course, this is a characteristic of a period of transition--must certainly be based on a long-term view." The authors of the aforementioned book add: "An important point is the question of what state our economy will be in after this period of transition is over. What characteristics will our economic structure have? In essence, Iran's foreign trade structure in the years following the triumph of the Islamic revolution, despite controls and deregulation, has more or less followed the same pattern that was followed in the country during the previous three decades. We have not yet succeeded in making proper use of foreign trade as a tool for industrial and economic development...therefore with this kind of foreign trade structure, in the long term GATT membership will not benefit the country that much."
