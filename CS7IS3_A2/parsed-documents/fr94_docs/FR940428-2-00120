FR940428-2-00120 FR940428-2-00054 [Docket No. 50&hyph;368] Entergy Operations, Inc.; Partial Denial of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity for Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has partially denied a request by Entergy Operations. Inc., (licensee) for an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;6 issued to the licensee for operation of the Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 2, located in Pope County, Arkansas. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of this amendment was published in the Federal Register on September 1, 1993 (58 FR 46230). The purpose of the licensee's amendment request was to revise the Technical Specifications (TSs) to remove the cycle-specific variables from the TSs and control them under a new document called the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR), in accordance with Generic Letter (GL) 88&hyph;16. In addition, the proposed amendment would also revise the definition of shutdown margin in TS 1.13. The NRC staff has concluded that the licensee's request concerning the shutdown margin (SDM) definition, which is not related to GL 88&hyph;16, is denied since it does not accurately define the starting point for shutdown margin. The licensee was notified of the Commission's partial denial of the proposed change by a letter dated *␣*␣* By May 27, 1994, the licensee may demand a hearing with respect to the partial denial described above. Any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding may file a written petition for leave to intervene. A request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555 by the above date.

Reynolds, Esquire, Winston and Strawn, 1400 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;3502, attorney for the licensee. For further details with respect to this action, see: (1) The application for amendment dated July 22, 1993, as supplemented by letter dated October 20, 1993, and (2) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated *␣*␣* These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Tomlinson Library, Arkansas Tech University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801.
