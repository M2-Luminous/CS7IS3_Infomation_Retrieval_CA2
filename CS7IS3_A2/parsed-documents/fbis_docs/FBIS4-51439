He encourages cadres and soldiers to emancipate their minds, study the major tactics well, and make contributions to Heilongjiang's social stability and economic development. Acting Governor Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, and Wang Xinmin, secretary general of the provincial party committee, participated in the visiting activities. At the institute of a certain army unit stationed in Harbin, Yue Qifeng carefully listened to briefings and asked in detail about the training and living of officers and men. Yue Qifeng said: Economic development can never be separated from the army, and a modernized army must also rely on economic development. He called on the institute to train more qualified personnel and to exert efforts to and offer plans for strengthening the national defense force and developing the local economy. At a certain combined arms army stationed in Harbin, Yue Qifeng highly affirmed the contributions to local development and stability of the new generation of officers and men defending the border areas and expressed hope that the local people and the army will jointly emancipate the mind, help each other, and invigorate Heilongjiang. Yue Qifeng said to the leading comrades of the provincial military district: It is necessary to organize the militia to actively develop the processing, aquaculture, and [words indistinct] industries. On hearing that militia have contributed to township enterprises, he expressed appreciation and pointed out: All cadres and soldiers should be organized to study professional knowledge. We have a good prospect for training dual-purpose personnel and making them play a part in the main economic battlefield. Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party committee, emphatically pointed out: The key to accelerating economic development is to emancipate the mind and change concepts. Once the concepts are changed, tremendous potentials will be seen. Those who rapidly change their concepts will gain the initiative. Heilongjiang is quite strong in natural resources, trained personnel, science and technology, and the quality of the masses. As long as it breaks away from the planned economy on its own initiative and rapidly enters the market economy, it will achieve great development.
