ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The rules below revise the rules currently governing how certain health care facilities, assisted under Titles VI and XVI of the Public Health Service Act, fulfill the assurance given in their applications for assistance that they would provide a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay for such services. The revisions below amend the rules to permit facilities that provide substantial free or below cost medical services but nonetheless cannot receive credit for such services under current requirements with an alternative method of compliance that will enable them to fulfill their uncompensated services obligations. DATES: This rule is effective on August 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Eulas Dortch, 301&hyph;443&hyph;5656. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 4, 1993, the Secretary of Health and Human Services published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to revise the rules governing what is popularly known as the Hill-Burton uncompensated services program. 58 FR 58828. Health care facilities covered by the program received construction assistance under two titles of the Public Health Service Act, Title VI (the ``Hill-Burton Act'', 42 U.S.C. 291, et seq. ) and Title XVI (42 U.S.C. 300q, et seq. ). Under both titles, facilities receiving construction assistance have been required, as a condition of receiving the construction assistance, to provide an assurance that ``there will be available in the facility or portion thereof to be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor *␣*␣*.'' 42 U.S.C. 291c(e)(2). See also 42 U.S.C. 300s-1(b)(1)(K)(ii). This assurance is known as the ``uncompensated services assurance.'' Background of the Regulations The groundwork of the present uncompensated services compliance requirements was laid by comprehensive regulations that were issued in 1979. 44 FR 29372 (May 18, 1979). The 1979 regulations established numerous compliance requirements for uncompensated services programs. These included requirements for a minimum level of uncompensated services to be provided by facilities, an annual compliance level (ACL) of uncompensated services to be provided, make-up of any deficit in meeting the ACL, national eligibility criteria for determining who is unable to pay, notice requirements, requirements regarding the timing and documentation of eligibility determinations, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and so on.
