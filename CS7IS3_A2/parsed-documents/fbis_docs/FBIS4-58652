FBIS4-58652 "drnes088_l_94004" FBIS-NES-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 ISRAEL `Sources' in Washington on Christopher's Role `Sources' in Washington on Christopher's Role TA0605054494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0400 GMT 6 May 94 TA0605054494 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Sources in Washington believe that U.S. Secretary of State Christopher's willingness to mediate between Israel and Syria practically ends the previous modus operandi for negotiations in Washington between December 1991 and the Hebron massacre [in February 1994]. An Israeli source in Washington has said that, in the peace package offered to Syria, Israel did not promise a full withdrawal, nor did it offer a withdrawal from Majdal Shams first. The terms the Syrians used in their reaction to the Israeli proposal contained more concrete terms than in the past regarding the definition of peace and normalization. The Syrians have gone from using general terms such as demilitarization to using numbers, according to the source.
