Serezhina: ``Fight Cholera and...Mushrooms''] [Text] As specialists have confirmed, the cholera outbreak in russia is not unexpected. A sharp increase in this disease throughout the world has recently been noted. International statistics give the following figures: 118,000 persons in just the first half of this year. Naturally, this disease has been brought to us primarily from the countries of the Hindustan Peninsula. But cholera has not just been ``imported'' into our country. For many years, epidemiologists have found the cholera causative agent, vibrio Eltor Ogawa, on Russian territory in objects in the environment -- generally in open water reservoirs. Only adherence to sanitary and hygiene rules can protect us from this terrifying disease: Do not drink untreated water (Moscow residents may because their tap water conforms to public health standards), and wash your hands carefully with soap before eating... It is not just cholera, however, that currently presents a serious threat to health. The overall epidemiological situation is bad. This was the subject of a recent press conference organized by the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. Each year, up to 1 million cases of acute intestinal infections are recorded in the country. The cause is poor-quality products and water. Specialists have serious concerns about the increase in mushroom poisonings. Death-cup amanitas are the most frequent but not the only cause. Physicians believe that paxils are poisonous and unsuitable for use.
