Moscow says they are. For a long time Washington also stuck to its anti-Ukrainian course, while the Kiev government feels that it has been wrongfully branded as the scapegoat. FOCUS talked about the background of the missile controversy with Ukrainian Chief of Staff Anatoliy Lopata. The 53- year-old former Soviet commander sees himself as belonging to the new generation of the Ukrainian Army. FOCUS: General Lopata, what is going to happen with the 1,800 nuclear warheads and 176 missiles? Lopata: We regard the nuclear arms as a legacy from the Soviet Union. The missiles are under Ukrainian control only in the administrative sense, while operationally they are controlled by Moscow. We have no control over the guiding systems, which means they are not operational for us. Ukraine only services and maintains the missiles. They are rather like red-hot coals that were put into our hands. We may turn them round and round but they will always burn our hand. FOCUS: How safe are the missiles? Lopata: This question is one of our main challenges. The SS- 19 are quite outdated systems. Each missile base has exact rules for servicing. Both, the Russian Defense Ministry and Ukraine are responsible for their maintenance. Our joint responsibility has been settled in treaties. FOCUS: But there were problems with the Russian specialists.... Lopata: You are right. Russia can use this lever to exert political pressure. However, the supervisory guarantee lies with the Russian specialists, and we have to pay them for their services. FOCUS: But they can also refuse to.... Lopata: No, they are bound by contract. As far as the nuclear warheads are concerned, we must not forget that all combat components were produced in Russia. Ukraine set up the missiles, provided the bases, while the production center was always in Russia. Hundreds of enterprises used to be involved in one missile and its warheads. That is why the treaty establishes that the very enterprise that assembled the components is responsible for its return. Each missile has certain dates for inspection. Sometimes the deadlines for certain components are missed as a result of the political insecurities. Nevertheless, we have so far carried out all necessary work. FOCUS: It has been said that the lifespan of some warheads will expire in 1994. Lopata: This year it affects only an insignificant part of the warheads, 10 percent may have to be inspected. Yet, next year it will be more, and so it will continue year after year. The lifespan of most missiles does not expire before the year 2000. FOCUS: Does this means that the nuclear threat remains? Lopata: I would like to emphasize that Ukraine does not regard the nuclear missiles on its territory as arms. They are mainly of significant material value. Our objective is to return the fissile material that is produced through the destruction of the missiles, to Ukraine -- for our nuclear power plants. The United States, Russia, and Ukraine have agreed that, with the help of the Americans, Russia will take care of dismantling the warheads and reprocessing the fissile material and returning it to Ukraine. Of course, Russia would like to keep its secrets. FOCUS: Are there still any real secrets between the major superpowers in this day and age? Lopata: The greatest secret remains the technology for the production in the individual enterprises. The United States does not have systems such as our SS-24, and will not have them in the near future, either. These are absolutely new and powerful systems with a very high accuracy. It is almost impossible to destroy these missile bases, even if their location is known. After each strike the missile starts automatically and carries out a counterstrike. FOCUS: Yeltsin has promised that the missiles would no longer be targeted at the United States. How can he say that, considering that the missiles start automatically? Lopata: When the program is removed the missile cannot start. There is one program block that contains various targets. Each target can be automatically selected, even during flight -- yet if this block is removed all that remains is a missile that is only potentially operational. I prefer not to tell you for how long, though. FOCUS: What is the nationality of the missile personnel? Lopata: The soldiers and sergeants are all Ukrainian citizens, while at the level of officers it is about 50 percent. They all can choose their place of living and work -- either in Ukraine or in Russia. This is the personal decision of each individual. A large part was ready to swear to defend Ukraine. Another part -- mostly Russians -- opted for Russia. According to our estimates some 70 percent remain in Ukraine. All this is taking place in a very friendly atmosphere. FOCUS: Yet, in the Crimea things are different.... Lopata: True, but we are trying to solve the problem with great caution. One condition is not to raise mutual territorial claims. The future of the Black Sea fleet and the Crimea are closely linked. It is not just a question of dividing up the fleet but also of the territory of the Crimea for the infrastructure of the fleet. Communication systems, energy supply, and infrastructure of the Crimea are organically connected with Ukraine. The Crimea does not contribute anything to the state budget, but only causes expenses. Tourism does not yield any profits, the water and energy supply is paid for by Ukraine. FOCUS: There are many countries in the Third World that are interested in the production of nuclear missiles. Do you know cases of Russia or Ukraine having supplied material to such countries? Lopata: No, no, and no again. FOCUS: But there have been most lucrative offers -- a great temptation for scientists who only earn some $20 a month. Lopata: This danger will always exist. Besides, we only have limited possibilities to verify whether a scientist does not also works for somebody else. Every single one is personally responsible for one component or for a certain piece of information. It is necessary to create prospects for these people here. FOCUS: Have there been cases where other countries wanted to buy nuclear arms or nuclear technology? Lopata: I suspect that such attempts have been made. FOCUS: How big is the military-industrial complex in Ukraine? Lopata: Taking into account that the main part of the complex of the Soviet Union was shared between Russia and Ukraine, then Ukraine comes second today, after Russia. We used to have two academies, including one for missile technology, 34 military schools, research institutes, and test laboratories. FOCUS: How many plants are there? Lopata: Well, not even we ourselves know that exactly. Nobody ever thought of counting them. You must understand the system. In the Soviet Union each plant, each enterprise fulfilled tasks even for the military complex. Today we are using no more than 15 percent of the former armament enterprises for military purposes. We gave up financing the huge complexes. Ukraine no longer places any arms orders. FOCUS: So who still buys the arms that are still being produced? Lopata: We hardly produce any more arms. If we do not order tanks they are not produced. For economic reasons, we have been forced to embark on the path of disarmament. For the future we would need research to launch our new Ukrainian tank on the market, for example. Yet, we do not have the money to produce it. FOCUS: If somebody from Syria or Iraq were to ask, would you sell him something? Lopata: If the offer were worthwhile, the government would examine it. We must look for customers. FOCUS: Ukraine has demanded security guarantees against its powerful neighbor, Russia. Still, you do not have any troops at your eastern border. Lopata: The creation of new structures along our eastern border is currently impossible for money problems. Ukraine does not need large armed forces but mobile reaction forces to protect its borders.
