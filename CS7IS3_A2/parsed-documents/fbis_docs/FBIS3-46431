Regretfully, incidents of interfering in other countries' internal affairs have taken place one after another. In the past, when the two superpowers dominated the world, it was primarily the United States and the USSR that interfered with other countries' internal affairs. The Soviet Army's invasion of Afghanistan and U.S. Army's invasion of Panama are the most conspicuous examples in our memory. In the wake of the disintegration of the USSR, the United States is the only country that can constantly interfere with other countries' internal affairs while claiming itself the international policeman. The Inauguration of "Radio Free Asia" Is a Hegemonist Act In recent years, the United States has consistently created disputes in its relations with China and has interfered with China's internal affairs, resulting in great disharmony in bilateral relations. Since U.S. President Clinton held a summit and invited Chinese State President Jiang Zemin to visit Seattle, the U.S. Administration's attitude toward China has tended to be realistic; ties between officials of the two sides have markedly increased; their mutual understanding has been greatly enhanced; and the momentum of development has been sound. However, anyone can see that there is always some element within the United States that is unwilling to see the normalization of international relations, especially Sino-U.S. relations, and is doing all it can to set up hurdles. The so-called "Radio Free Asia" that primarily targets China is precisely one of their most up-to-date inventions. A few days ago, the U.S. Senate officially adopted the bill on establishing "Radio Free Asia." Due to the U.S. economic recession, the United States is having difficulty making ends meet in its financial situation; the U.S. Federal Government has already received complaints from Los Angeles earthquake victims because it is unable to provide Los Angeles more money for relief purposes. Nevertheless, at this particular moment, they would rather spend a huge sum starting up "Radio Free Asia" -- why? Its real aim is precisely to utilize the station to create disputes, instigate turmoil, and realize the goal of interfering the internal affairs of China as well as other Asian countries. This being the case, the bill has naturally met with opposition from China and the other Asian countries. Such behavior of brazenly trampling upon international law and the criterion of international relations is a demonstration of its stubborn hegemonist ideas. Be Vigilant Against the Americans' Frame-Up Not long ago, news suddenly appeared in the U.S. press that prohibited chemicals that had been manufactured in China were found on a German vessel berthed in a Saudi Arabian port. The reports claimed that the marketing of these substances had been banned by an international agreement, and they could be used to create nuclear and biochemical weapons. When the news spread, many people associated it with the "Yinhe" incident that had been unilaterally created by the United States last summer. That incident went bankrupt due to the Americans' inferior handling of the situation; their plot was seen through and ended with their losing face throughout the world. The day before yesterday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman explained the current issue. The fact was that, in response to the repeated requests of a U.S. company, a Chinese company sold a certain quantity of prohibited chemicals to that company in violation of the relevant regulations of the Chinese Government. The destination and purpose of those chemicals were entirely the business of the U.S. company in question. Of course, the matter must be investigated and clarified. Nevertheless, people cannot help but ask why the U.S. press should have singled out Saudi Arabia, Germany and China, but left out the country that was most directly related, namely, the United States? Was it out of neglect, omission, or a trick to feint to the east and attack in the west to deceive the public? Drawing a lesson from the "Yinhe" incident, people have ample grounds for asking a few more questions.
