Spectroscopic measurements were carried out on a fluorescent X-ray spectrometer of sophisticated design[.sup]4,5[/] installed on an undulator beamline (BL-16U)[.sup]6,7[/] at the Photon Factory. A prominent increase in the high-energy satellite peak heights was first observed when the excitation energy was tuned to the narrow pre-edge peak in the B1s absorption spectrum corresponding to the transition from B(1s) to an unoccupied anti-bonding orbital (p�*). It is therefore confirmed that the high-energy satellites originate from resonant reemission due to a B(1s)-p�* -B(1s[.sup]-l[/]) transition. This resonant reemission phenomenon reflects the electric structure of the localized anti-bonding p�* orbital in trigonal-planar-structured boron compounds. References 1. R.D. Deslattes, R.E.
