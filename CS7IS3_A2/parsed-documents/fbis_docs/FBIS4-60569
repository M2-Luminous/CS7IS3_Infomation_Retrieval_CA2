Our heroic forces were able to deliver crushing blows to enemy forces on all battlefronts in the Kharaz-bab al-Mandeb, al-'Anad-Kirsh, Abyan, and Shabwah Governorate areas. Reports from these battlefronts indicate that our forces, which are being supported widely by the people of our young Republic, have inflicted great defeats on the oppressive enemy forces in the Abyan Governorate, inflicting heavy losses of life and material on them. Our forces there captured an infantry battalion, complete with its arms and equipment. Yesterday, our forces destroyed a number of tanks and four Katyusha rocket launching vehicles, and also captured four tanks and two Katyusha rocket launching vehicles. They inflicted heavy losses of life on the enemy on this front, with hundreds of them killed or wounded. On the al-'Anad-Kirsh front, our forces dealt mortal blows to the forces of aggression and enmity, inflicting heavy casualties of over 200 killed and wounded. Our forces destroyed eight enemy tanks and three Katyusha rocket launching vehicles. They also captured three tanks and four enemy Katyusha rocket launching vehicles. As a result of these heavy losses, the enemy forces were forced to take flight or surrender, particularly after realizing that the al-Ahmar gang had literally thrust them into the fire from which there was no escape, except through retreat or surrender. The morale of our forces is very high, and they will win their victory, God willing. God is great. God is great. Issued by the command of the Armed Forces of the DRY.
