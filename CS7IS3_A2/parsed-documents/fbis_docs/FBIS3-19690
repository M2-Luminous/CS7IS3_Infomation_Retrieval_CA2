After the next land parliament election, it might have to clear some of the ministers' seats for the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. According to a poll conducted for BILD AM SONNTAG by the Forsa Institute, the CSU will lose so many votes that the only possibility for Bavaria might be a grand coalition. While the CSU is still slightly ahead of the SPD on the land level, it would only come second in Bavaria in Bundestag elections. Last Thursday [17 March] and Friday, Forsa asked 609 Bavarian voters: For which party would you vote if land parliament or Bundestag elections were held on Sunday? In both cases, the CSU achieved less than 40 percent. The Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] might not get back into the land parliament in Bavaria either. But even if the Liberals manage to get over the 5-percent hurdle -- a coalition with the CSU would not get a majority. The Greens/Alliance 90 and the Republikaner are too strong -- and the CSU would certainly not form a coalition with them. This only leaves the SPD as partner. The main reason why the CSU is experiencing such a decline with the voters is obvious: It is the affairs surrounding its top politicians Streibl, Gauweiler, and Tandler. Asked to name the biggest problems in Bavaria, 53 percent mentioned unemployment, and as many as 38 percent said "scandals and politicians." Other issues, such as the housing shortage or crime, play only a minor role. Are the CSU's chances of being elected getting any worse on account of the Amigo affair? There is a clear answer to this as well: Of those asked, 73 percent said yes, only 19 percent do not thinks so, and 8 percent do not have any opinion on the matter. Is Minister-President Edmund Stoiber in a position to start afresh in Bavarian politics, without scandals? Of those asked, 58 percent think he cannot do it. Only 27 percent think Stoiber is capable of making a scandal-free new start. A total of 39 percent of the voters prefer Stoiber to his SPD competitor Renate Schmidt, who would get 35 percent of the votes. Among CSU supporters, the minister-president is clearly ahead with an 80-percent approval rating, with only 68 percent of SPD voters approving of Ms. Schmidt. With regard to Bavaria, the CSU still has a "land bonus" due to its experience in government. This is why things look brighter here than at the Bundestag elections, where SPD Chairman Scharping can hope to win 45 percent of the Bavarian votes, while CSU Chairman Waigel could offer his chancellor only a small dowry of 37 percent.
