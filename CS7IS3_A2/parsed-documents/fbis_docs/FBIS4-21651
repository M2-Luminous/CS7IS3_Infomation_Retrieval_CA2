As an incentive it is now willing to allow Pakistan to take delivery of the 38 F-16s that Pakistan has already paid for but which it cannot have owing to the Pressler Amendment. This is the exchange that is apparently proposed in U.S. non-papers to the Pakistan government. Thse is no doubt that the acquisition of the advanced aircraft will go a long way in redressing the military imbalance between India and Pakistan, but the price being demanded has to be carefully assessed. Pakistan should not in the process of narrowing the gap in conventional weapon capability between the two countries end up bartering away whatever it has by way of maintaining a nuclear deterrent vis-a-vis India. It is significant that while Pakistan is being made such an offer nothing similar is being proposed to India in order to get it to cap its nuclear programme. A number of things have to be considered here. To put it bluntly Pakistan no longer has the room for manoeuvre that it enjoyed during the years when US foreign policy placed a high premium on getting the Soviets out of Afghanistan. In a world that has changed in more ways than one since then we will have to proceed carefully in order to meet the requirements of our security on the one hand and to avoid getting totally isolated on the other. While the Kashmir issue remains unsettled and a hostile India increases its defence budget by 20 per cent we cannot afford any laxity with regard to our security concerns. Equally, however, as the experience of the erstwhile Soviet Union falling apart has clearly demonstrated, nuclear capability alone is no guarantee of national strength. Pakistan may continue to insist on linking whatever steps it takes in the direction of nuclear non-proliferation with India's actions in this context. At the same time, however, it should also avoid the pitfall of getting into a debilitating nuclear arms race with India that will impose relatively far greater costs on it. To that extent it is for Pakistan to determine first what it considers as the necessary minimum in terms of its nuclear capability and then examine the US proposals. According to one report the US Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel, currently visiting India, has said that the sale of F-16s to Pakistan is linked to a major non- proliferation step on the part of Pakistan. Just what kind of a step we can take in this direction should be a matter of careful deliberation of all aspects relating to our security. What she has said on the subject could well be taken to mean that Pakistan's existing means of nuclear deterrence would not be affected by the US proposal of stopping the production of nuclear material for weapons and verification of this step. If so, this could have significant implications for the choices Pakistan has. In any case the visit of the US Deputy Secretary of State to New Delhi and Islamabad early next month as well as that of Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff at about the same time to Washington will be important in terms of ascertaining the details of the proposal. Before making any definite response or counter-proposals the government would do well to take the opposition into confidence and the latter should refrain from using an issue of such crucial significance in terms of our security for the purpose of gaining political mileage.
