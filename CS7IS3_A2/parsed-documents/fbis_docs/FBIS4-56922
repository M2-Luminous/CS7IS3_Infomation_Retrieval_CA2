They gave statements to the press. They said the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] had offered the Arnulfist Party two ministries. Dr. Perez Balladares also said that there are no partisan positions [espacios politicos] in his government. He also thanked Mrs. Mireya Moscoso de Gruber for welcoming him to her home. [Begin recording] [Moscoso de Gruber] Dr. Perez Balladares visited me this morning to discuss certain matters. One of the offers he made was that of one or two ministries in his government. I have told him that I am not the one to decide and that the party's National Executive Committee [CEN] must be approached with this offer, and whatever the party decides is what will be done. I am not the one who decides. [Jimenez] What ministries could these be? [Moscoso de Gruber] He only offered two ministries; I do not know which ministries. But the party has to decide. [Jimenez] If the Arnulfist Party declares itself in opposition, then would it not be lacking in political principles if it becomes part of the government? [Moscoso de Gruber] After 1 September, my party will definitely be in opposition. The decision must be made by the party's CEN. I am the president of the party. I do like to preside over the meetings in a democratic manner, however, and let the CEN decide. Therefore, we must wait. This must be presented at a meeting to see what happens. [Jimenez] Sousa Lennox has been mentioned as someone to fill a ministerial post. Is he a member of the Arnulfist Party? [Moscoso de Gruber] Yes he is. If any member of the Arnulfist Party makes a decision without previously consulting with the party, that decision will be declared unauthorized by the party. [Jimenez] Would you accept participation in a PRD government? [Moscoso de Gruber] No, I would not. [Jimenez] What about other party members? [Moscoso de Gruber] That would have to be discussed by the CEN. [end recording] These were statements made by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber upon meeting with Perez Balladares at her home. Also in attendance at the meeting were Immigration Director Antonio Dominguez and Government and Justice Minister Jacobo Salas. According to statements by Dr. Perez Balladares, the meeting was cordial. He said they talked about the country's future and not the future of the political parties, in this case the Arnulfist Party and the PRD. Dr. Perez Balladares announced he will be visiting other candidates who ran against him in the 8 May elections in an attempt to create a consensus government.
