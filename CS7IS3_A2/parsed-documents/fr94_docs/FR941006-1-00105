FR941006-1-00105 FR941006-1-00016 Thursday October 6, 1994 Part IV Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 101 et al. Iron-Containing Supplements and Drugs; Label Warning Statements and Unit-Dose Packaging Requirements; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 193␣/␣Thursday, October 6, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Parts 101, 170, and 310 [Docket Nos. 91P&hyph;0186 and 93P&hyph;0306] Iron-Containing Supplements and Drugs; Label Warning Statements and Unit-Dose Packaging Requirements AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing regulations to require label warning statements for products taken in solid oral dosage form to supplement the dietary intake of iron or to provide iron for therapeutic purposes. FDA is also proposing regulations to require unit-dose packaging 1 for iron-containing products that contain 30 milligrams (mg) or more of iron per dosage unit. 2 FDA is proposing these regulations because of the acute iron poisonings, including deaths in children less than 6 years of age, attributable to accidental overdoses of iron-containing products. The intent of these proposed regulations is to reduce the risk of accidental iron poisonings of young children by utilizing FDA's authority in conjunction with the existing requirements of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) for child-resistant packaging for household substances. This proposal responds to three citizen petitions (Docket Nos. 91P&hyph;0186/CP1, 93P&hyph;0306/CP1, and 93&hyph;0306/CP2) that requested that FDA take action to ensure that products containing iron or iron salts do not pose a health hazard to young children and infants. 1 For the purposes of this document ``unit-dose packaging'' means a method of packaging a product into a nonreusable container designed to hold a single dosage unit intended for administration directly from that container, irrespective of whether the recommended dose is one or more than one of these units. 2 In this document, the term ``dosage unit'' will be used to denote the individual physical units of the iron-containing product such as tablets, capsules, caplets, or other physical forms, irrespective of whether one or more than one of these physical units comprises the recommended dose. DATES: Written comments by December 20, 1994. The agency is proposing that any final rule that may be issued based upon this proposal become effective 180 days after its publication in the Federal Register. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857.
