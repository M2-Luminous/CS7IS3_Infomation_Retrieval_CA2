The effects of technical parameters such as the pH values, solvents, and drying processes on gelling time and gel properties are studied. The transition process from gel to PLZT powder is investigated with XRD and TG-DTA [thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis]. The effects of gel structure and roasting temperature on the properties of PLZT powder are also examined with XRD and TG-DTA. Experiments show that the gel forms PLZT solid solution at 520�C and that when roasted at 550�C, the gel produces PLZT powder with particle diameter smaller than 0.2 �m. 1. Introduction The ceramic (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti)O[.sub]3[/] (PLZT) has good electro-optic properties. Especially, PLZT thin film has great application potential in optoelectronic devices such as photo-sensitive valves, electro-optic displays, etc. Recently, other countries have researched various synthesizing methods to make PLZT ceramic powders, among which are the solid state method,[.sup]1[/] the co-precipitation method,[.sup]2[/] the alkoxide hydrolysis method,[.sup]3-5[/] etc. This investigation adopts a sol-gel method. The different raw materials of proper compositions in solution state are first mixed; thus, the mixing proceeds among the molecules. The final powder product made from the solution has superior properties such as very fine particle size, precise chemical composition, good uniformity, high reactivity, and low synthetic temperature. The future of the sol-gel process is appealing. Fine powder with the composition of (Pb[.sub]0.91[/], La[.sub]0.09[/])(Zr[.sub]0.65[/], Ti[.sub]0.35[/])O[.sub]3[/], or PLZT (La/Zr/Ti = 9/65/35) is prepared by the sol-gel method with metal isopropylates as raw materials. The effect of gelation process on gel properties, as well as the effect of gel quality and roasting temperature on powder particle size and properties are studied. Some useful results are obtained. 2. Experimental Work 2.1 Preparation of Raw Materials (Note: All the experimental chemical agents are either analytically pure or chemically pure.) Preparation of Zirconium Isopropylate and Titanium Isopropylate: Zirconium isopropylate and titanium isopropylate are prepared by the following equations: <graphic> </graphic> Preparation of Lead Isopropylate: Pure dehydrated lead acetate is prepared by heating trihydrate lead acetate at 80�C-90�C for 8 hours. Sodium isopropylate is prepared through the refluxed reaction between a proper amount of metallic sodium and isopropyl alcohol at 40�C to 50�C for 1 hour. After that, lead acetate and a proper amount of benzene are added into the bath. The refluxed reaction is continued for another 2 hours. Finally, lead isopropylate is obtained by filtering the solution and removing the benzene at a reduced pressure. The reaction is shown as follows: <graphic> </graphic> Preparation of Lanthanum Isopropylate: First, LaCl[.sub]3[/] is prepared from the reaction between La[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and NH[.sub]4[/]Cl; then the reaction of LaCl[.sub]3[/] with sodium isopropylate produces La(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]3[/] according to the following equation: <graphic> </graphic> 2.2 Preparation of Gel and PLZT According to the molar ratio, specific amounts of Pb(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]2[/] and La(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]3[/] are loaded in a three-port flask. A proper amount of isopropyl alcohol is then added into the flask and the reaction is refluxed for 1 hour. Then, the isopropyl alcohol solutions of Ti(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]4[/] and Zr(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]4[/] are successively and gradually added, and the reaction is refluxed for another hour before a proper amount of water is added to the solution. The specific pH value of the solution is adjusted with HAc and NH[.sub]4[/]OH. The refluxing goes on until the solution turns into sol, which is transferred to a plastic container. The assembly is transferred to a clean location. At room temperature the sol turns into wet gel, then the wet gel is dried into dry gel under certain conditions. The dry gel is loaded in a muffle furnace. After the furnace temperature is raised to 550�C at a prescribed heating rate, and maintained at 550�C for 2 hours, the dry gel decomposes into PLZT microfine powder. 2.3 Property Evaluation The gel apparent density and gel porosity are measured by the ethanol soaking method. The DTA and TG curves of the gel are measured with a PCT-1 differential thermal balance (made by Beijing Optical Instrument Plant). The specific surface area of PLZT powder is measured by the BET low temperature nitrogen adsorption method. The X-ray spectrum of the powder is determined with a Rigaku D/max-rB X-ray spectrometer made in Japan. The powder surface configuration is observed with a Type S-250Mkj scanning electron microscope (SEM). The powder particle diameters (D[.sub]50[/] and D[.sub]v[/]) and their distributions are measured with a BI-90 laser scattering particle analyzer made in the United States. 3. Results and Discussions 3.1 Effect of pH Value on Gelling Time and Gel Structure The sol-gel process of metal isopropylates is generally believed to be a two-step reaction process, the hydrolysis and the polycondensation of the metal isopropylates. The speed and the degree of completion of both reactions are determined by factors such as pH values, catalysts, etc. Measurement of gelling time: The gelling time is measured from the time when the sol reaches room temperature to the time when the gel solidifies to such a condition that its surface does not move while the container is tilted to 45�.[.sup]6[/] Figure 1 shows the effect of pH value (from 2 to 9) on gelling time. It shows that the longest gelling time occurs when the pH value is between 6 and 7. When the pH value is greater than 7 the gelling speed increases rapidly. When the pH value is less than 5, the change of gelling speed is not apparent. It is easier to control the gelling speed by adding acidic solution. Besides, acidic solution also produces uniform transparent gel. It is difficult to control the gelling speed with a basic solution, which also makes the gel less transparent. <graphic> <capt> Figure 1. Effect of pH Value on the Gelation Time</graphic> The pH value of the solvent also clearly affects the gel structure as shown in Figure 2. When the pH value is low, the gel apparent density and gel porosity change only slightly with change in pH value. When the pH value is greater than 6, with increase in the pH value, the apparent density (Curve 1) rapidly decreases and the porosity rapidly increases (Curve 2). <graphic> <capt> Figure 2. Effect of pH Value on the Apparent Density and Porosity of the Gel</graphic> The aforementioned results show that the catalytic effects of acid or base on the sol-gel process are quite different. Further study on the catalytic mechanism is needed. 3.2 Effect of Solvent on Gel Structure Figure 3 displays the apparent densities of gels made with different monohydric alcohols as solvents. It shows that when straight-chain monohydric alcohol is used, the dry gel apparent density increases with the increase of solvent surface tension. During gel drying, the capillary force controls the gel frame contraction. And the capillary force is in direct proportion with the surface tension of the solvent. Therefore, lower surface tension will produce lower contraction pressure, which is favorable to the forming of larger voids, resulting in lower apparent density. On the contrary, higher surface tension produces a gel with higher apparent density. However, this is not the case when isopropanol alcohol is used as solvent. <graphic> <capt> Figure 3. Relationship Between Apparent Density of Gel and Surface Tension of Solvents Used</graphic> Isopropanol alcohol has the lowest surface tension (21.7 x 10[.sup]-3[/] N-m[.sup]-1[/]) but the dry gel produced by it does not have the lowest apparent density. This phenomenon indicates that the effect of solvent on gel structure is not simply reflected in gel apparent density. The apparent density is also affected by other solvent molecular properties. 3.3 Effect of Drying Condition on Gel Properties and the PLZT Powder Particle Size The gel samples made from the isopropanol alcohol as solvent with pH = 4 are dried separately under the following three conditions: (1) dry the sample in an oven at 100�C for 8 hours at a stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the gel sample; (2) dry the sample in an oven at 50�C for 12 hours at a stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the gel sample. After that, the oven temperature is raised to 100�C, and then the gel is dried again according to process (1); (3) dry the sample in vacuum at room temperature for 12 hours at a stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the gel sample. After that, the gel sample is dried according to process (1). Table 1 shows the qualities and apparent densities of the gels dried by the three different methods. It indicates that drying conditions greatly affect gel quality. The higher the temperature, the higher the drying speed, and the more inferior is the gel quality. During high-temperature speed-drying, the uneven stress from volume contraction of the gel surface and the gel interior causes gel cracking. At high temperature, the surface tension of the solvent becomes smaller and produces larger void volume. Consequently, the gel transparency worsens and the gel apparent density is reduced. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1. Comparison of Properties of Gel for Different Drying Conditions | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Drying condition |Quality of the gel |Apparent density/g-cm | | | |[.sup]-3[/] | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |100�C (oven) |Non-transparent and gappy|0.81 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |50�C (oven) |Translucent and massive |0.90 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Room temperature (vacuum)|Transparent and massive |0.94 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Each of the gels made by the three different drying methods is roasted at 550�C for 2 hours to produce PLZT powder. Figure 4 displays the powder particle size cumulative frequency distribution curves. It shows that the PLZT powder made from gels dried in the 100�C oven has the widest range of particle size distribution and the largest grain size, with 345 nm as the median particle diameter D[.sub]50[/] (i.e., the equivalent diameter at 50 percent cumulative frequency). The PLZT powder made from room-temperature vacuum drying has a narrow range of particle diameter distribution and the smallest grain size, with 126 nm as D[.sub]50[/]. High-temperature rapid-drying increases the agglomeration tendency of gel particles, and hence produces PLZT powder with large conglomerations. <graphic> <capt> Figure 4. Particle Size Distribution Curves for PLZT Powders With Different Drying Conditions <annot> 1. 100�C; 2. 50�C; 3. Room temperature</graphic> 3.4 Thermal Analysis of Dry Gel The gel dried in the 50�C oven is analyzed by TG and DTA. Figure 5 shows the TG and DTA curves. The TG curve indicates that the gel decomposition is completed at 500�C because no weight loss occurs after this temperature. In the DTA curve, the endothermic peak around 140�C is caused by the evaporation of water and isopropanol; the exothermic peak around 350�C, by the burning of the organic material; and the exothermic peak around 520�C, by the formation of the PLZT solid solution. <graphic> <capt> Figure 5. DTA and TG Curves of Gel</graphic> 3.5 Effect of Roasting Temperature on PLZT Powder Properties Based on the DTA results, the dry gel samples are divided into batches. Each sample batch is roasted for 2 hours within the temperature range 450�C to 700�C at an increment of 50�C or 100�C. The X-ray diffraction analysis results of the samples after roasting are shown in Figure 6. The curves in Figure 6 shows that the PLZT powder from the 450�C roasted sample has amorphous structure. A small amount of crystals appears in the powder from the 500�C roasted sample. The powder from the 550�C roasted sample completely crystallizes into a single PLZT crystal phase. The powders from samples roasted between 600�C and 700�C show no new phases but stronger and sharper diffraction peaks. This indicates that in the 600�C to 700�C range, the crystal particle size of samples increases with the increase of roasting temperature, but the crystal phase remains unchanged. <graphic> <capt> Figure 6. XRD for PLZT Powder Calcined at Different Temperatures</graphic> Table 2 shows the median diameters D[.sub]50[/], average volume diameters D[.sub]v[/], and the specific surface areas of powders roasted at 550�C, 600�C, and 700�C, respectively. Figure 7 [photographs not reproduced] shows the SEM photographs of the powders. Table 2 and Figure 7 indicate that the particle of PLZT powder grows with increase in roasting temperature -- a result identical with those of the X-ray diffraction. These test results conclude that low-temperature roasting is favorable to the production of microfine PLZT powder. However, at PLZT solid solution does not form at too low a roasting temperature; hence, the optimum roasting temperature range is 550-600�C. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Conclusions (1) The optimum parameters for producing PLZT microfine powder with metal isopropylates as raw materials are: isopropyl alcohol as solvent, acetic acid as catalyst, pH = 3-4, low-temperature and low-speed drying, and roasting temperature within the range of 550-600�C. (2) Under basic condition, gel particles tend to agglomerate, and produce large-diameter PLZT particles. (3) To produce PLZT microfine powder, the gel drying process and the gel roasting temperature must be closely controlled. References 1. Haertling, G.
