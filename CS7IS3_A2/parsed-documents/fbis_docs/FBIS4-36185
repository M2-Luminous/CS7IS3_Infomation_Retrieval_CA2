[Shahal] Good morning, Hayim. [Zissowitz] I suppose you are calling us to react to what the foreign minister said. [Shahal] I am also prepared to talk about that, but first I would like to discuss something else. It is a real shame that you did not talk to me about the report on my meeting with Faysal al-Husayni, because it is entirely untrue. First, I did not meet with Faysal al-Husayni because of the foreign minister's letter. The truth is that I only learned about the existence of a letter to the Norwegian foreign minister yesterday evening. Second, this was not an emergency meeting. Third, what was discussed in it was the exact opposite of what you reported. I unequivocally told Faysal al-Husayni that if any Palestinian security or police personnel are deployed in Orient House or elsewhere [in East Jerusalem], we will arrest them, take them into police custody, and bring them to trial; that if we find a man bearing arms in Jerusalem without a license or permit, he will be thrown in jail; that if we discern any pan-Palestinian activities in Orient House, we will simply take legal action against it. I cited the example of the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics and categorically told him that we will shut it down. I told him in the most unambiguous manner that Jerusalem is unequivocally the capital of Israel; that the status quo will not change as far as Jerusalem is concerned; that it is totally inconceivable to us to allow any change whatsoever, either creeping or otherwise, that would alter the status of Jerusalem during the interim period. This was a very comprehensive meeting, and it was attended by Mr. Moshe Sason and the Jerusalem District police commander. That is why I am very sorry that you aired this report without asking me. [Zissowitz] Well, so you have now clarified what was said in the meeting. Since you called us, I would like to seize this opportunity to ask you: Do you feel embarrassed this morning after learning that you were sent to the Knesset to declare from the podium that no letter was sent to Yasir 'Arafat and that the whole thing was the figment of someone's imagination? [Shahal] First of all, I am not embarrassed when facts are revealed. After asking the Prime Minister's Office for details, I went to the Knesset podium and gave an answer in accordance with what I had been told in the clearest and most categorical fashion. I did not know about the existence of a letter to the Norwegian foreign minister, but after I talked to Foreign Minister Peres yesterday.... [Zissowitz, interrupting] Were you misled? [Shahal] I would not say that. I do not think anybody had such intentions. After talking to the foreign minister yesterday and asking him for explanations, and after he read the letter to me, I must note another point that was not sufficiently stressed, which is that the letter to Holst speaks about institutions for the residents of East Jerusalem. Nevertheless, I did not know about the existence of such a letter. [Zissowitz] Thank you very much, Minister Shahal.
