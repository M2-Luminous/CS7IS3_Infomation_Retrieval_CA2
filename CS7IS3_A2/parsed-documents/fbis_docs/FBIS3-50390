After the meeting General Rose told journalists he was pleased with the meeting today. "The talks were interesting and related to an exchange of views on issues of interest to both sides," he said. Speaking about the specific content of the talks today, General Mladic said: "General Rose presented vague claims in connection with some issues but they were clarified by the Serb side." "I explained the same to General Briquemont. The rotation of UNPROFOR troops in Srebrenica falls within the competence of lower-ranking UNPROFOR commanders and it should not be blown up out of proportion, because that is precisely what Muslims and all those who are sponsoring them want in creating a smokescreen for the world public in order to conceal the Croat-Muslim war," Mladic said. "As regards Tuzla airport, this is a concocted problem serving the same purpose, but the smokescreen is much thicker and bigger. There is no reason why we should haggle over this issue, as all the convoys can enter both Srebrenica and Tuzla as they please," Mladic said. "However, Muslims have got bad advisers and think that we are naive and will easily swallow their bait. I informed General Rose about the fact that the Muslims and Croats declared war on the Serb people. Let them take it back; it will be easy to find a speedy agreement on everything, including Tuzla. There are also airports on Serb territory. Serbs cannot even receive vaccines for babies while the Muslims can even seek to control all international airports. We will talk about this with the warring sides," Mladic said. "We have never had any conflicts with UNPROFOR commanders, nor with any generals, because it was not the United Nations that declared war on us, but Tudjman and Izetbegovic," the Serb commander concluded.
