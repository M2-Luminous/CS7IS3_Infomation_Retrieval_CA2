In an exclusive statement to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA Perez Balladares said that PRD members might occupy the Ministries of Housing, Public Works, Labor, Commerce and Industry, Planning, and Government and Justice. Current Electoral Tribunal Magistrates Eduardo Valdes, Dennis Allen, and Guillermo Marquez will remain in their posts, since they are considered responsible for the holding of the most important elections ever in Panama's political history. Sources told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that Jose de los Santos Chen Barria, a member of the opposition Christian Democratic Party, might be ratified as comptroller general, and Oswaldo Fernandez might be retained as director of the National Police if he is not ratified as a Supreme Court justice. Perez Balladares refused to confirm this possibility, however. An investigation by LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA revealed that the Foreign Ministry might be offered to industrialist Gabriel Lewis Galindo; the Education Ministry to Stanley Muschett, president of the Justice and Peace Commission; the Agricultural Development Ministry to Carlos Souza Lennox, former president of ANAGAN [National Cattlemen's Association]; the Presidency Ministry to Raul Arango Gasteazoro; the Health Ministry to Carlos Garcia de Paredes; and the Commerce and Industry Ministry to Felix Gonzalez, a PRD leader in Chiriqui Province. [as published] PRD Under Secretary General Mitchel Doens might be appointed government and justice minister, and Christian Democratic legislator Jose Antonio Sossa might be appointed attorney general. Two women will be appointed to cabinet posts in the Labor and Planning Ministries, but Perez Balladares did not reveal their names.
