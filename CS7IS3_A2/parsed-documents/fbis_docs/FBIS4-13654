FBIS4-13654 "drnes078dd_94011" FBIS-NES-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Islamic Leader on `Peace Initiative' With Israel Islamic Leader on `Peace Initiative' With Israel TA2104171294 Jerusalem AL-NAHAR in Arabic 21 Apr 94 p 3 TA2104171294 Jerusalem AL-NAHAR Arabic BFN [By Samir Hamtu] [Text] In the first comment on the "peace initiative" proposed by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in Amman, professor Khalid al-Hindi, dean of the Islamic University and a leader of the Islamic Movement in the Gaza Strip, noted that one cannot interpret this initiative as a concession by the Islamic Movement. He said that the Islamic rejection of the Oslo accord and the peace talks between Israel and the PLO stems from the fact that this accord does not respond to the Palestinian people's right to freedom, sovereignty, and independence. Al-Hindi added: If the Israeli-PLO initiative had included full Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967, including Jerusalem, with a commitment to dismantle the settlements, this initiative would not have faced widespread opposition in the Palestinian street and from the Islamic Movement in the current situation. Al-Hindi pointed out that it can be said that Abu-Marzuq's remarks contain new references to international legitimacy. Al-Hindi expressed the belief that this initiative does not address the issue so clearly as much as it refers to international resolutions. He added: The important thing is not the Palestinian side's but Israel's recognition of those resolutions and its readiness to implement them. The PLO recognized and accepted the international resolutions, but Israel refused to implement them and forced the PLO to accept something less. Al-Hindi noted that the Islamic Movement will not accept to undergo the same experience and that everything hinges primarily on Israeli readiness in this field. Al-Hindi denied the possibility of the Islamic Movement's participation in the self-rule bodies. He said: This issue is not relevant. Perhaps there might almost be a consensus to refuse participation in any institutions or bodies supervising the self-rule administration, especially as the Islamic Movement opposes the self-rule plan. On the effect of this initiative on the current talks between Israel and the PLO, al-Hindi expressed the belief that this initiative does not represent a blow to the PLO because Israel does not desire a just peace that gives the Palestinian people their right to land, freedom, and independence. He added: Israel will continue its march with the terms that are suitable for it. Al-Hindi expressed the belief that this initiative will not deal a blow to the peace process, nor will it speed up the realization of the Oslo accord because Israel acts on the basis of whatever serves its interests and security. On his expectations from the Israeli side's response to this initiative, al-Hindi said: I do not expect a significant response from the Israeli side because Israel is not thinking, at all, of implementing international resolutions and withdrawing. Therefore, we do not expect an effective response from the Israeli side since there is agreement to continue the talks with the PLO on the terms that Israel imposes from a position of strength and in which it does not make any concessions. Hamas, through Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of its political bureau in Amman, had proposed a peace initiative with Israel that contained more flexible and realistic conditions than its previous proposals.
