So far as the national interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran and other nations in the Persian Gulf are concerned, nothing is more important than the prevailing situation in and around Saudi Arabia. We are interested in having powerful neighbors and good relations with others. On this basis we believe that there are noteworthy reasons to make us concerned about the future of the Saudi system at home as well as its foreign policies outside its borders. 2. Our major concern about the internal situation of the Saudi rule stems from the change in U.S. policy in the way it approaches the Islamic movement--or what they call Islamic fundamentalism. Over the past decade the opinion of Washington politicians was often that another type of Islam should be put before the Islam of Iran so that the Islamic movement in the Muslim countries could be weakened. They believed that in implementing such a strategy, the prestige of the Saudi rulers in the world of Islam could be counted on and capitalized. Therefore, many mosques sprung up in Egypt, Algeria, Africa, Europe, and Asia built with Saudi money. However, it was not long before all these mosques turned into propaganda centers for "Muslim fundamentalism." The Algerian experience is extremely interesting. Saudi Arabia extended great financial assistance to the Islamic Salvation Front, but apparently when the Muslim masses began to move, the Koran and the holy teachings of the Prophet become more attractive than remarks by friends like Mr. Belhaj and his sort. The conclusion that Washington has drawn is extremely important: It believes that artificial movements cannot withstand the current Islamic movement which is the Islam of Imam Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified. They concluded that in order to harness the Islamic movement, the Egyptian or the Algerian models should be used; that is, dictators without religion should seize power and violently crush popular movements and base the system not only on secularism but also adopt an "anti-religion" ideology or doctrine. It is not necessary to point out how much this policy is in line with America's "democracy" slogan and how disgraceful it is. The issue for us is the practical impact that this policy now has. It is within this framework that America intends to carry out a fundamental change in the Saudi ruling machinery. During some of my recent exchanges of views with European statesmen, I realized that the issue has gone beyond being only a strong viewpoint in the White House and has become a "European" issue as well. 3. The concerns that are felt should not only be a lack of trust in the future of the Saudi regime but also in the fact that over the past couple of years, Saudi rulers have played an active role in numerous tensions in the region. Looking at its differences with Qatar, with the United Arab Emirates, with Yemen in the form of border disputes and, finally, its provocation of the recent bloody and destructive conflicts inside Yemen, the most natural justification that can be given for these Saudi acts is that Saudi Arabia wants to inculcate on the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council that everyone should be under its control, or, in other words, that the said council is the "council of cooperation with Saudi Arabia!" Outside of their borders, they are afraid of the emergence of strong powers in the region. The unification of the two Yemens paved the way for the formation of a powerful country with a rich historical-cultural background, a vast territory, and a strategic position. It is precisely this that is creating problems for the Saudi rule! I think that some of Riyadh's "nervous actions" outside its borders may stem from its worries at home. But nobody in the Persian Gulf should believe that anything can be gained from fanning the flames of tension, from political instigations, and from territorial claims! Those who are weaker are more vulnerable. The stronger a rule, the more populous its territory, and the more experience it gains in the region, the more hopes for the future of the region it can give. I can never forget Sanaa's mistake in supporting Saddam's regime during the imposed war. But our nation and our government can and should focus their attention on the future and recall the heritage of cultural-historical-religious ties of Iran and Yemen instead of looking to the past. We should support Yemen's unity and oppose any type of separatist movement. Undoubtedly this does not stem from hostility toward our friends in Aden but from our profound affection for them. We consider the brothers in Aden to be citizens of Yemen and see their interests lie in the preservation of their country's unity. Our brothers should set aside the war and bloodshed and think of the future of Yemen as the strongest country in the south Persian Gulf. This is the future that awaits them; if only they knew.
