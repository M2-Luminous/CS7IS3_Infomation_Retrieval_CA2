Defense Minister General Humberto Corado stressed the role that the military has played in the country's institutional life, especially in the 1980's. He said the military has always supported past governments and now is no exception, because the military has always believed the country needs stability and calm to progress. The armed institution is "subordinate, obedient, and nondeliberative," stressed Corado. The defense minister stated this yesterday morning shortly before casting his vote at the Central American pavilion at the International Fairground. He indicated that the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation] must give up the conspiratorial, clandestine, and subversive methods it used in the past. "The FMLN must accept the democratic rules of the game and act like any other political party." According to Gen. Corado, "The FMLN has to act according to the times in which it is living, make proper use of the mandate the people gave to its deputies in the Legislative Assembly, and forget the negative methods of the past." He also urged the FMLN deputies to act "like real fathers of the fatherland and representatives of the society which placed its trust in them, so the balance in the Legislative Assembly will be beneficial." Making his appeal to the losing party, he said any political organization that participates in elections must be ready to win or lose: "If it wins, it must govern and legislate, and if it loses, it must accept the people's will and prepare for the next elections."
