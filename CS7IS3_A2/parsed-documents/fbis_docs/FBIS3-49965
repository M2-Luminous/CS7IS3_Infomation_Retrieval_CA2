They included Zhelyu Zhelev, 57, a philosopher whose works were regularly banned and who organized the Club for Glasnost and Perestroyka, the first intellectual coterie for opponents of the regime. Following the palace revolution that ousted Todor Zhivkov in November 1989 and set the country on the road to democracy, Zhelev became a unifying force and leader of the UDF [Union of Democratic Forces], a heterogenous group of the anticommunist opposition. The former dissident, elected president in August 1990, met Francois Mitterand yesterday. And LIBERATION. [Semo] The former Communists are ahead in the opinion polls and, what is even worse, more than one Bulgarian in two turns his back on all political parties. After Poland, is it not now Bulgaria's turn to fall victim to disillusionment and a certain nostalgia for Communism? [Zhelev] There is a real danger of this. These are the negative effects of the move toward a market economy. People are facing enormous difficulties in their day-to-day lives and are having to do without many things. The increase in crime further fuels this nostalgia. It is not surprising. Dictatorships and authoritarian regimes manage to brutally but successfully control lawlessness. Freedom does not mean anything to ordinary people with no guarantee of security. [Semo] With the war worsening in the former Yugoslavia, does the risk of it spreading to neighboring countries like Bulgaria still seem real? [Zhelev] I do not believe the conflict can reach our country, as we are on good terms with our neighbors. But if Macedonia was torn apart by deliberately provoked inter-ethnic tensions, we would be directly affected, if only by the flow of refugees into our country. A policy of active neutrality is the best barrier against this danger of conflagration in the Balkans. This means first of all non-interference. Second, the rigorous respect for the embargo and sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by the international community. But I stress the active nature of this neutrality. We cannot remain indifferent to the human rights situation and the rights of minorities in these neighboring countries. [Semo] In spring 1992, Bulgaria became the first country to recognize the Republic of Macedonia as a state if not a nation, despite criticism from a large part of public opinion which considers the Macedonians to be Bulgarians. On this occasion you affirmed the need to break with the major nationalistic myths? [Zhelev] We have very close ties with Macedonia: We have a common history, culture, religion, and language. But that is the sentimental aspect of the problem. The act of recognition, on the other hand, represented the acceptance of this state with its full sovereignty and its borders. [Semo] Do you believe there is now a need -- in order to exert pressure on Belgrade -- to further tighten the embargo or consider air strikes? [Zhelev] This embargo, which seriously penalizes our economy, is already very severe. The real problem is how to ensure that these sanctions are respected, also by neighboring countries. Any decision to undertake air strikes or any form of military intervention must be taken by the United Nations, NATO, or the WEU [Western European Union]. But if the international community were to choose to use force, it is vitally important that neighboring countries should not be involved in these operations. That would risk sparking off a new Balkan war. [Semo] Bulgaria -- along with other countries in Central and Eastern Europe -- has asked to join NATO, which it sees as a guarantee for its security. How do you judge the offer by President Clinton for a form of "Partnership for Peace" while awaiting possible integration? [Zhelev] It remains the best proposal made to date. But this initiative perhaps remains insufficient in security terms, as what we are being offered is not the same as that which Alliance members are guaranteed. I nevertheless feel it is particularly significant as it offers an equal chance to all Central and Eastern Europe's new democracies, without categorizing or differentiating, which is always a source of tension. [Semo] Since you became president, you have managed to defuse the problem of the Turkish minority -- one-tenth of the population -- which was the most explosive legacy of Communism. Is there a Bulgarian model for the ethnic question? [Zhelev] I based my action on the old tradition of tolerance of the Bulgarian people. Even after five centuries of Ottoman domination, relations between the Bulgarians and the Turks were good. The tensions of recent years had been deliberately created by the former regime which -- seeking a demagogic excuse for its failures -- opted for an absurd policy which violated the fundamental rights of this minority group. We felt bound to immediately restore these rights, and, in addition, we guaranteed active participation in governmental bodies for the Turkish minority. One-tenth of the elected representatives are Turks and their party plays a key role in the Parliament.
