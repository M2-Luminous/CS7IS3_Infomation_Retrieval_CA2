Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says the Kim Yong-sam group is committing another flunkeyist treachery by scheming to fling open the door wider to the corrupt culture of Japan this year and turn society into a dark sphere where Japanese fashion and Japanese way of life will hold sway. The news anlayst says: The decadent American ideologies and culture and the corrupt culture of the Japanese reactionaries have made their way into South Korea to paralyze the consciousness of the people and degenerate society. When more immoral ideologies and culture flood into South Korea where people and society are already corrupt and ailing with the infiltration of Japan's reactionary culture, the aftereffects will be monstrous. If the South Korean puppets massively introduce Japanese culture under the cloak of "internationalisation" and "opening," South Korea will, no doubt, become more dependent on Japan not only in politics and economy but in culture as well. Unpardonable is the treachery of the Kim Yong-sam group which is trying to prolong its remaining days with the support of its masters at the expense of the interests of the nation, fawning upon and submitting to foreign forces.
