The Greek urban guerrilla group `17 November' claimed credit for the attacks against the U.S. firm 'Aleco' and the Dutch 'National Nederlande' both situated on the busy Kifissias Avenue in the suburb of Maroussi. The group used a rocket to hit the building housing `Aleco' and placed a time-bomb in the other nearby building in which National Nederlande was to move in. The explosions caused material damages but nobody was hurt. An anonymous caller told the Greek private radio station `Sky' that `17 November' was taking responsibility for the attacks. He also claimed that the group had placed a bazooka on a British aircraft carrier ten days ago. The carrier `Ark Royal' docked in the port of Piraeus since 28 March is to leave the harbour Monday. The caller did not give any further information and the Greek police have denied any knowledge of the incident. It was the fifteenth rocket attack by `17 November'. The 3.5 inch rockets had been stolen by the group from military depots in the past.
