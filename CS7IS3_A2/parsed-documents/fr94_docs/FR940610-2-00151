FR940610-2-00151 FR940610-2-00076 2. Standards Relating to the Index and Options Thereon A narrow-based index subject to the requirements of this order must be cash-settled. The index value may be calculated only pursuant to a capitalization, price, or equal-dollar weighted methodology. 19 The index value must be disseminated at least once every 15 seconds during the trading hours of the index. The settlement value of expiring index options must be based upon the opening prices of the component securities on the primary exchange on which they are traded (or on the Nasdaq National Market) (otherwise known as ``A.M. settlement'') on the applicable expiration date. 20 19 An index whose value is calculated pursuant to an equal dollar weighted methodology must be rebalanced at least once every calendar quarter. 20 In the event that a component security did not open for trading on the expiration date of a series of index options, the last sale price for that security shall be used in calculating the index value. If a narrow-based index is maintained by a broker-dealer, it shall be calculated by a third party that is not a broker-dealer. Further, appropriate procedures must be established by the Exchange and the broker-dealer to ensure that the broker-dealer will not possess or be able to misuse any informational advantages with respect to changes in the composition or the level of such index. Such procedures must include, for example, the establishment of appropriate informational barriers. The streamlined procedures described herein pertaining to the listing of new narrow-based index options would apply to all narrow-based index options permitted under the rules of the Exchanges, including long-term options and reduced-value long-term options that otherwise satisfy the particular Exchange's rules governing long-term options and reduced-value long-term options. 21 21 The CBOE has represented that, if it proposes to list reduced-value long-term options on a narrow-based index pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) in accordance with this order, it would include as a part of its rule filing an amendment to the list of indexes on which reduced-value long-term options are traded, as set forth in CBOE Rule 24.9(b)(2)(A). In the event that a class of narrow-based index options listed on an Exchange pursuant to the streamlined listing procedures described herein fails to satisfy one or more of the required maintenance criteria, the Exchange responsible for that index option must notify the Commission staff immediately upon discovery of such failure. Further, the Exchange shall not open for trading any additional series of options on that class unless the Exchange determines that such failure is not significant, and the Commission affirmatively concurs in that determination, or unless the Commission specifically approves the continued listing of that class of index options pursuant to a proposal filed in accordance with Section 19(b)(2). B. Review Procedure If a particular narrow-based index (and options thereon) proposed by an Exchange satisfy the foregoing generic listing standards, then such Exchange may vial itself of certain streamlined listing procedures. The procedures proposed in the Exchanges' filings are designed to allow them to list narrow-based index options without undergoing the formal process of review and approval by the Commission pursuant to section 19(b)(2). An Exchange would be required to submit its proposal in draft form to Commission staff at least one week prior to the Exchange's formal filing of the rule change proposal. The Exchange would then submit its formal rule change proposal for effectiveness immediately upon filing, pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A). However, to allow the Commission adequate opportunity to verify the representations made by the Exchange in its proposal and review and address any concerns raised by the proposal or by commenters, the Exchange would be allowed to establish a trade date for the commencement of trading of options on the index no earlier than 30 days from the date of the formal filing of the proposal. If the Commission determines that the Exchange proposal does not satisfy the generic standards, or if the Commission deems it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, the Commission, pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(C) of the Act, has 60 days from the date of the filing of the Exchange's proposal to abrogate the Exchange's rule change and require that the Exchange refile the proposed rule change for formal Commission review pursuant to section 19(b) (1) and (2). III. Commission Findings and Conclusions A. Generic Listing Standards The Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of section 6(b)(5) of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. Specifically, the Commission finds that the Exchange's proposals to establish generic listing standards for narrow-based index options strike a reasonable balance between the Commission's mandates under section 6(b)(5) to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, while protecting investors and the public interest. Thus, the Commission finds that the listing by an Exchange of options on particular narrow-based indexes, in accordance with the requirements stated herein, will constitute a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the administration of an existing Exchange rule, pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A), relieving the Exchange of the former requirement of obtaining specific Commission approval of such narrow-based index options pursuant to section 19(b)(2).
