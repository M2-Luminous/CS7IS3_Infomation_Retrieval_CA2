The Taiwan Feed Industry Association and the Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers Association lodged protests with Washington's unofficial embassy in Taipei over the U.S. ban on wildlife product imports from Taiwan. President Bill Clinton announced the ban, worth up to $25 million a year, last month in response to the island's continued trade in products made from endangered tigers and rhinos. A spokesman for the Taiwan Feed Industry Association said if there is no goodwill response from the United States, his association will give priority to South Africa, Thailand, Central American countries, and Australia when buying corn and soybeans. The two associations of Taiwan's many importers of corn and soybeans buy 5 million and 2 million tons a year. ROC [Republic of China] officials have denounced the U.S. move as unjust after Mainland China eluded sanctions.
