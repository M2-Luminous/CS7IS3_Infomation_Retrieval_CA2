While overall bilateral trade grew by 98.9 percent, India's exports to China expanded by an even larger margin, that is 170 percent, from $181 million in 1992 to $417 million in 1993, the Chinese figures showed. The figures include trade through Hong Kong. China selectively includes or excludes the Hong Kong figures depending on its need to play down its own massive surplus vis-a-vis other countries and highlight an occasional surplus enjoyed by some of them. The United States, west European countries, Japan and others regularly complain of deficits running into tens of billions of dollars annually in their trade with China. India had for more than a decade and a half suffered a wide deficit in its trade with China but the sale of iron ore and steel needed by China's burgeoning construction industry over the past couple of years altered the situation. Indian imports from China last year grew by 63 percent, from $158 million in 1992 to $259 million, the Chinese figures showed. Bilateral trade is keeping to an `encouraging upswing', diplomatic sources here commented, pointing to a 7.28-percent increase in 1991, 28.6 percent in 1992 and 98.9 percent last year, as per Chinese figures. There is good reason to hope that Sino-Indian trade value will cross the $1-billion mark, they said. However, that figure will still remain a fraction of 1 percent in China's total trade. China has bid for launching an Indian satellite and, if it succeeds, that will significantly boost the payments accruing to it. While iron ore has, for many years, been a significant item in India's sales to China, steel emerged as an entirely new item, and the largest one, last year, amounting to $177.5 million. Although China's construction industry is trying to cool its over-heated growth, the demand is expected to continue growing though at a slower rate, the sources said.
