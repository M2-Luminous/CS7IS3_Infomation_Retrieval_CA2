Recalling Klaus's comment that the Czech Republic was becoming a "little non-leftist island in the centre of Europe", the LIDOVE NOVINY interviewer asks the premier to explain why the Hungarian Socialists have what is considered to be a very similar economic policy to the Czech Government. Klaus responds by saying that his statements on the Hungarian election results had been "very balanced", and that the "cheap joke" about the island came at the very end and was taken out of context. He emphasises he did not simplify the election results in Hungary and Poland -- where the left also recently returned to power -- and it would never have occurred to him to regard them as constituting the "return of the communists." He said he never had doubts that the left-wing parties in question could not conduct a "more or less balanced and reasonable economic policy." Klaus adds that his participation in a panel discussion with MSZP chairman Gyula Horn at the World European Forum last year revealed a profound difference in their views. Horn's arguments reminded him, he says, of the debates about economic reform in Czechoslovakia in 1990-91 with opponents of his economic strategy. It would be mistaken to conceal those differences. Nonetheless Hungary remains a "very close partner in all areas." He is convinced the Czech Republic will be able to cooperate just as effectively as with the previous government and says he believes the thorny issue of minorities, which always worried him about the former government, might now recede into the background.
