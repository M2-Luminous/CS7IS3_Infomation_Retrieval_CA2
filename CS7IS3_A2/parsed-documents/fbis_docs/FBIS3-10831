This morning, the president signed the Banking Emergency Law, thereby approving a new legal framework aimed at providing financial assistance to all financial institutions confronting a liquidity crisis like the one plaguing Banco Latino. In signing the new law, President Rafael Caldera said it is a decision of solidarity toward thousands of Venezuelans affected by the Banco Latino crisis. [passage omitted] Delegations representing the banking sector, the National Congress, and members of the intervention board were present at the signing ceremony. Congressional representatives explained some of the benefits the law offers. In addition, the president of the Venezuelan banking association said the law establishes a framework allowing for the renewal of confidence in the country's banking system. [Begin recording] [Democratic Action Deputy Omar Barboza] Starting with 10 million or more bolivares, the intervention board will be able to limit the application of this index or rate in order to repay interest to deposit holders. One thing is the guarantee, which amounts to 4 million bolivares, and another is the possible limit in applying the consumer price index to determine interest. Starting at 10 million bolivares, the intervention board is free to apply the interest rates it believes to be most applicable to the bank's reorganization plans. [National Banking Council President Jose Bouzas] This law establishes a framework that will allow solutions to the crisis the Venezuelan banking sector is going through to be found. As members of the banking sector, we seek to establish guidelines allowing the bank's reorganization and the adoption of adequate solutions to protect deposit holders thereby enabling them to recover all their savings. On the other hand, this law provide a legal reference to support and sustain the entire banking system, which is currently being assisted by FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee Fund]. In other words, if we can ensure joint actions between the public and private sector, basically from national private banks, I then believe we will be able to establish joint programs between the banking superintendency, the Venezuelan Central Bank, FOGADE, and national private banks. In addition, there will also be the possibility of helping Banco Latino's depositors, helping with the bank's reorganization, and in finding a solution to the banking system crisis. [end recording] The Central Bank president, who was also present during the Emergency Banking Law signing ceremony, insisted this institution has carried out its duties according to the law, and she indicated that she has all necessary documents to support her statements. The documents will be given to the courts soon. [Begin recording] [Central Bank President Ruth de Krivoy] Through out the process, the Central Bank of Venezuela has conducted itself strictly in accordance with the law, with absolute objectivity. The bank has also promoted immediate, timely solutions to all difficulties it experienced. The Central Bank has extensively explained its performance to the congressional commissions. We also intend to provide all necessary details requested by the courts relating to this institution's performance. In this respect, I can say that from an ethical as well as a banking and monetary policy point of view, the Central Bank of Venezuela has conducted itself in accordance with the law, and we are willing to prove it to whatever level may be necessary. [end recording] Gustavo Rossen, president of the Banco Latino intervention board said there are some legal loopholes, which Congress will solve soon. At the same time he insisted that Banco Latino depositors can rest assured the bank will be bank rolled within a very short period. [Being recording] [Rossen] The request we plan to make of deposit holders, when the reorganization plan is finally approved, is to have confidence that once Banco Latino has been bank rolled by the government, then it will once again be one of the most solid banks in the country. Deposit holders should not be apprehensive about leaving their deposits in the bank because they will be entirely paid back. In addition, they are essential if Banco Latino is expected to be the type of bank its long time clients want it to be: successful, versatile, and a bank capable of providing good service to its clients. [Pachano] You have already decided on the details of the reorganization plan? It has... [Rossen, interrupting] Yes, we have. [Pachano] Has the plan been presented to President Caldera? [Rossen] No, there is no need to present it to the president because it is not up to him to decide. The reorganization plan will be presented to the Central Bank of Venezuela in accordance with the law, and also to FOGADE. [Pachano] Is it going to be presented this afternoon? [Rossen] This morning we presented it to the Central Bank and this afternoon we will present it to FOGADE. [Pachano] Both institutions must approve the plan? [Rossen] That is correct. [Pachano] If they ... [Rossen, interrupting] Because both institutions will provide the funds to implement the program. [Pachano] If the plan is approved today, how soon will it be implemented? [Rosses] The reopening or reorganization plan, whichever you prefer, will be implemented in approximately 24 days as of [words indistinct]. In his address to the nation, President Caldera spoke of 30 days. If I am not mistaken, six days have gone by since his address to the nation, therefore we still have 24 days to reopen the bank. By reopen, we mean reorganize. [end recording] Once the Banking Emergency Law signing ceremony concluded, Gustavo Rossen headed to the Central Bank of Venezuela to present details on the Banco Latino reorganization. During the afternoon hours, he will also meet with the FOGADE board of directors to explain the reorganization program. If the plan is approved, Banco Latino could resume operations in 24 days.
