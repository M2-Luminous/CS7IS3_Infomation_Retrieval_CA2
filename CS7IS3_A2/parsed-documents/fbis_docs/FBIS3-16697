However, in a "Vesti" television program interview the very same day the Federation Council chairman stated that he was merely referring to the need to take immediate and extremely prompt action within the financial and economic spheres. This alone and nothing more. For the second time in a row in recent days Vladimir Shumeyko has made some stunning statements. On a visit to Kaliningrad last week the speaker of the upper chamber announced that the government is preparing a decision on a 50-percent across-the-board tax cut. "Nothing of the sort is planned," Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko stated in an interview with IZVESTIYA, delicately suggesting that Shumeyko's interpretation of the president's wish to alleviate the tax burden as expressed in his message to parliament seemed somewhat free. And now society is yet again being invited to unravel the remarks of a politician whose public status obliges him to use precise and unambiguous phrases. However, are we simply talking about linguistic sloppiness here, the kind that gives rise to free interpretations? In an interview with INTERFAX, Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin announced that the day before Vladimir Shumeyko did in fact discuss with him the possibility of adopting a law on a state of economic emergency. Moreover, Rybkin claims that Viktor Chernomyrdin also took part in the discussion of this matter, which took place late in the evening of 14 March. "The three of us discussed which was the best of three possible options for approving the second-quarter budget. How should we approve it: By a special law, by suspending various articles of the law in a state of emergency regime, or by continuing to work normally, in which case we would need at least two or three months to approve the budget." Ivan Rybkin declined to say which of the three options he had listed seemed to be the most expedient. Meanwhile nobody has yet officially dismissed the specter of economic state of emergency conjured up by the remarks -- be they careless or cunning -- of two leading politicians. And we can only guess what form it will take. Perhaps, following the Belorussian [Belarusian] example, we will witness the confiscation of enterprises' foreign currency funds, resolute cessation of auctions at the Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange, the imposition of a fixed ruble exchange rate, and the nationalization of a significant proportion of assets belonging to commercial structures? It cannot be permitted for a government, even a government that is as closed to the press as the present one, to keep society in a state of ignorance regarding such intentions. If it harbors no such intentions, then it ought to announce this fact officially and extremely clearly. But yet again we are in a complete fog. Ivan Rybkin has just refuted press reports of his conversation with Shumeyko and Chernomyrdin. "I have never had occasion to hold talks on this topic with anyone," the speaker stated at a plenary session of the Duma in reply to a deputy's question. On the same day Aleksandr Livshits, leader of the group of economic experts affiliated to the Russian president, circulated a statement saying that "at the present time he sees no need for the highest organs of the country's state power to adopt any emergency measures regarding the economy." ...As he left for a vacation in Sochi Boris Yeltsin announced that while he is on leave he intends to get down to formulating a mechanism for implementing his message to parliament. Could it be that the government, supported by the parliamentary speakers and wishing to spare the president this concern of state during his leave, has already set about formulating such a mechanism by introducing a state of economic emergency? Or will the explanation that once again we have misinterpreted somebody be forthcoming tomorrow?
