It will be the first flight of the launcher, a vehicle that is based completely on the domestically developed technologies for the purpose of launching large geostationary satellites. All the Japanese launch vehicles in the past, beginning with the N1, which was developed in 1974, and going to the N2 and H1, which were used for launching communications, broadcasting, weather, and earth-observation satellites were developed on the basis of the Delta rocket technology imported from the United States. The successful second-stage liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen engine, LE5, and the stable platform-type inertial-guidance technology applied in the H1 launch vehicle helped Japanese satellite-launching technology rise to the highest level of the world. As for the H2 launch vehicle, the research and development of the first-stage LOX/LH rocket engine, LE7, has been successfully completed; the inaugural launching this time will be the final confirmation of the development. The H2 is 49 meters high, weighs 260 tons when fully equipped for launching a geostationary satellite, and is capable of launching a two-ton satellite into geostationary orbit. The main features of the H2 launch vehicle are the latest technologies employed in the first-stage engine, LE7, and the inertial-guidance system. The LE7 is a two-stage combustion-cycle high-pressure engine (main combustion chamber pressure: 130 atm). LE7 -- Low-Pressure Design The two most well-known LOX/LH high-pressure high-performance rocket engines based on the same cycle as LE7 are the SSME (200 atm), the main engine of the U.S. Space Shuttle, and the RD-120 (166 atm), the main engine of Energiya, Russia's giant rocket. The ED-170, the engine of Energiya's SL-17/K-1 auxiliary rocket, consumes liquid oxygen and kerosine as fuels, and its combustion pressure is 250 atm. The SL-16, one of the launch vehicles that Russia is planning to use as its entry vehicle into the world commercial-satellite business, is equipped with the RD-170 in the first stage and the RD-120 in the second stage. The SSME of the United States was originally developed to be re-used (the original plan was to use it 50 times), on the same level as aircraft engines; in reality, however, it requires substantial repairs each time. Since it is a high-pressure engine, both the oxygen and hydrogen systems consist of two system, i.e., low-pressure and high-pressure pump systems. Because of the inherent problems of high-pressure oxygen-pump system, the SSME is plagued with low reliability. Since the Japanese LE7 is designed to operate at a much lower combustion pressure, it has not experienced such problems. Laser Gyro Russia's RD-170 uses the highest combustion pressure in the world; consequently, it is attracting the attention of engine builders all over the world. Although hot engine spots of the SSME and LE7 are cooled by hydrogen, such spots in the RD-170 are cooled by oxygen, which may well be the new direction in the future. The strap-down method used in the H2 for the guidance and navigational system is the latest technology. Different from the platform method, in which the local level is maintained in the vehicle irrespective of the motion of the vehicle, the strap-down method uses the onboard computer to calculate the attitude, position, and velocity vector of the vehicle to guide it to the target. Since it does not have any mechanical moving parts, a high reliability is expected to be achieved. The H2 is also equipped with a laser gyro, a Japanese cutting-edge electronics technology. The H2 launch vehicle will gain for Japan the status of a full-fledged player in the world's commercial satellite business when it succeeds in launching Engineering Test Satellite 6 in the summer of 1994. The test launching in February 1994 is the first step toward that goal to bring about a successful launch.
