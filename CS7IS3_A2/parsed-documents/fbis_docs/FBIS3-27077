Although encouraged by the pace of the Serbs' latest pullout of heavy artillery from Sarajevo, Pentagon Spokeswoman Kathleen Delasky said the Serbs still had "a long way to go" to avoid the threatened NATO air strikes. Delasky confirmed that U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili would join defense ministers of Britain, France, Italy and the Netherlands for a NATO briefing on air strikes in Italy on Sunday. "The meeting also provides an opportunity to discuss steps to reinvigorate the peace plan," Delasky said. Earlier today, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said the Serbs had agreed to withdraw heavy weapons from Sarajevo following a proposal that Russian troops would help enforce a ceasefire in the city. "We do think that war in Sarajevo is finally over," Karadzic said. At the White House, Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers gave a measured response to the development. "If this means that the Serbs will comply with NATO's decision then it is a positive step," Myers said. "We'll just have to wait and see."
