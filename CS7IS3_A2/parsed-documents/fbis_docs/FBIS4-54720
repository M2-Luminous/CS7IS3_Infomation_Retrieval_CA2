Speaking after a meeting with his Danish counterpart Niels Petersen, Zieleniec stressed the need to treat the pact most responsibly and cautiously. It is necessary to realize that ill-prepared moves can be "counterproductive" and that they could unleash processes leading to instability instead of stability. The security and stability pact for Europe was submitted by French Premier Edouard Balladur in June 1993. It is designed to secure stability and security in Europe, to protect economic and trade interests of individual countries and to produce agreements on good neighborhood and respect for ethnic minorities's rights. The pact would be signed by European states, the United States and Canada. Petersen said his government considered the pact a good and constructive idea. European countries need to solve some problems with their neighbors and this is a sort of "preventative diplomacy," he said. Admitting that this may not be easy, Petersen added the pact could be a valuable contribution to stability in Europe. He recalled that the conference on the pact is to open in Paris at the end of May and that the pact could be signed in Paris in the spring of 1995.
