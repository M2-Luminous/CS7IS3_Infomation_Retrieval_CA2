FBIS4-62310 "drsov094_n_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Turkmenistan U.S. Firm To be Denied Participation in Oil Project U.S. Firm To be Denied Participation in Oil Project LD1305163294 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1250 GMT 13 May 94 LD1305163294 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Textt] Turkmenistan will most likely deny Occidental Petroleum participation in a project to develop one of the Central Asian republic's oil and gas fields, said a senior official at Turkmenistan's Petroleum and Gas Ministry. The refusal would come very shortly, the official told the Oil Information Agency. He said the American corporation, which had won the right to work the Burun oil and gas field in western Turkmenistan in an international tender last November, was, under the terms of the tender, to form a joint venture with the Turkmen concern Balkanneftekhimprom, but had still not signed an agreement to that effect, "from time to time notifying its Turkmen partner about the dwindling interest in oil in the world market and about the difficulties of transportation of crude oil from Turkmenistan," while not having withdrawn from the project officially. For this reason, Turkmenistan will most likely choose another foreign partner. A source told the Oil Information Agency that after preliminary negotiations, the Turkish national petroleum company had stated its willingness to form a project to develop the Burun and Barsa-Gelmez oil and gas deposits. Turkmenistan is expected to make the final decision before the end of May. The Turkish company would be offered the same terms as Occidental Petroleum, namely it would have to pay a $20-million bonus, invest $50 million in the project within the next five years and receive 25 pct of the profit, the Turkmen partner appropriating the other 75 pct. The reserves of Burun are estimated at 35 million tonnes of oil, those of Barsa-Gelmez at 31 million tonnes. Today the two fields annually yield 207,000 tonnes and 1.2 million tonnes of oil respectively.
