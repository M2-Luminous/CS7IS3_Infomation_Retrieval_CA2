The controversy stemming from Hosokawa's sudden scheme to shake up his six-month-old cabinet sent a chill wind through the government, raising further doubts about his capability as a leader. In the face of unexpectedly fierce opposition from within his seven-party coalition, Hosokawa became cagey about his plan and said merely he had not decided whether to carry out a reshuffle or not. He indicated Wednesday [16 February] he has no intention of reshaping the cabinet, at least until around early March, so as to focus on Diet discussion of the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and on revisions to the political reforms that passed into law in January. But the prime motive behind his perceived desire to reorganize his team is apparently to remove Masayoshi Takemura from the post of chief cabinet secretary. It is now an open secret in Nagatacho, Japan's political heart, that Hosokawa wants to ditch Takemura, regarded until only recently as his most important political associate, because he is disgruntled with the top government spokesman's seeming disobedience. The turning point was apparently reached February 3, when Hosokawa abruptly unveiled a plan to create a 7 percent indirect tax on goods and services in place of the present 3 percent consumption tax to finance a huge income tax cut meant to boost the sluggish economy. The premier was eventually forced to scrap his plan because of strong objections from within the coalition, but Takemura had criticized it at a news conference when he said, "It is never too late to mend one's ways." Traditionally, the chief cabinet secretary is expected to be a loyal assistant to the premier, and Takemura's remarks were seen as tantamount to rebellion. "The chief cabinet secretary should work as one with the premier," an aide to Hosokawa said. "I doubt if he (Takemura) is functioning as chief cabinet secretary." Aside from Hosokawa's personal feelings, the plan to reshuffle the cabinet fueled speculation that the premier has tilted toward Ichiro Ozawa, a senior leader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and the main strategist in the coalition. This means Hosokawa may have opted to team up with Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, another major member of the coalition. While the Ozawa-Ichikawa duo want a drastic reconfiguration of political parties to establish a two-party system, Takemura and Hosokawa have said they prefer a moderate multiparty system. Bickering between Takemura and Ozawa is nothing new. The two men have clashed over some key policy issues since the Hosokawa administration set sail last August as Japan's first coalition government in nearly four decades. It was reported that Ozawa pressed Hosokawa to fire Takemura late last year, when Ozawa and Takemura were at loggerheads over the handling of the premier's cherished political reform bills and the timetable for formulating the fiscal 1994 state budget. At the time, Hosokawa sided with Takemura, saying he is an indispensable member of the cabinet, according to a source close to the premier. Both former prefectural governors, Hosokawa and Takemura have long fostered friendly relations and agreed on the "marriage" of the political parties they respectively head -- the Japan New Party (JNP) and Sakigake (Harbinger) -- in the immediate future. But the love affair is over. The merger of the two parties seems almost impossible as Hosokawa's scheme to reshuffle the cabinet has incurred the distrust of Sakigake legislators. "I feel we can no longer get along with Hosokawa," said a senior Sakigake official, who requested he not be identified. One Sakigake source also said, "We will never again trust Hosokawa, who has driven Mr. Takemura into a corner like this." It remains to be seen whether Hosokawa will reshape his cabinet in March or later. But if the premier goes ahead with a reshuffle including the dismissal of Takemura as chief cabinet secretary, he could face a serious test of his authority as Sakigake may move to distance itself from the coalition. "If he forces a reshuffle, we will have to cooperate with the government from outside the cabinet," another Sakigake source said. "If Mr. Takemura is removed, we will not offer any replacement."
