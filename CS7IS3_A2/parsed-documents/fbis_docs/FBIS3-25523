The RPT is happy about this success, which consecrates its service to the nation and the thorough work of renewal it has accomplished. As the first party of the new National Assembly, it wants to fully play its part in the country's government to support the action taken by the president of the Republic to redress the country. It hopes that after this long transition, the country will settle down to work and regain its due position in the comity of nations. The RPT deplores the fact that certain political party leaders have tried to disrupt the election through defamation, violence and fraud. It calls for the immediate prosecution of the defamers and troublemakers. It notes that in several constituencies, massive fraud was organized by the Action Committee for Renewal. It has confidence that the institutions that will have to handle cases of electoral petitions will punish the cases of fraud and their authors. Concerned about national unity, the RPT wishes to collaborate in renewed fraternity with a broad-based union government consisting of all those who are ready to contribute their capacities and concern to serve to work for national redress under the high authority of the head of state.
