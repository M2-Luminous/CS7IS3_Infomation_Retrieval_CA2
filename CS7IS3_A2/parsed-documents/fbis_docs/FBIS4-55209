Are you still reticent about it? [Iliescu] These are all fabrications. I am not a simple-minded person. I am not an uneducated person. (...) These are fabrications that are exploited for political reasons and can be explained through the internal political struggle, in which such comments are also made: "Iliescu belonged to the nomenclature in the 1960's." However, nobody is talking about the fact that Romania's political opening took place in the 1960's. Romania was the first and only country that succeeded in achieving the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1958. After that, in the 1960's, a general openness followed with Romania's firm opposition to Soviet tendencies to achieve the integration of economies of satellite countries and to submit them to the Soviet economy. Then came Romania's opposition to the intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968. (...) Between 1960 and 1967 I was among those who urged this openness of Romania. (...) I have already mentioned that we have three major adversaries in the exercise of social life. I am talking about those who nurture nostalgic feelings for the recent past. This nostalgia has a reason, namely, there is a certain degree of dissatisfaction because the social explosion of December 1989 took place precisely as a result of the difficulties of people's daily life, and conditions have still not improved. On the contrary: Industrial production has dropped, the international situation has not been favorable for our economy, and that is how inflation and unemployment emerged, which are phenomena that create new problems for people. There is a certain degree of dissatisfaction. All people hailed democracy, however, democracy without the improvement of people's living conditions has no value whatsoever for ordinary people. From this viewpoint, there are people who ask why, why indeed should we not recreate the old system that ensured a minimum of security for us? I say that this is no longer possible, even if there were people who wished to recreate the old structures, mechanisms, and institutions. (...) There is another type of nostalgia: the nostalgia of old people who remember the years before the war and who want to recreate the old structures of Romania that existed before the two world wars. This is even less possible (...). The third group of "adversaries" are those who are in a hurry to get rich. There is much confusion in social and economic life in this period of changes and transition, because the authority of state institutions and the authority of the law are not yet solid and there are many shortfalls from this viewpoint. Thus, one can see various forms of corruption emerging, such as a tendency to avoid taxes, and one can also see people who want to get rich very quickly and people who want to get hold of power and wealth very quickly. This is a phenomenon to which we have to pay greatly increased attention. The society has to find forms of self-defense against such pressure. These are major problems. As far as I am concerned, I am not connected at all to the nostalgic people, however, I realize the difficulty of the process itself. I am a realistic person. I believe that in the current political situation we must get rid of all ideological prejudice and take into consideration the new social, national, and international realities. [LE POINT] What political formula do you regard as possible in Romania, especially if we consider the situation you have just mentioned? [Iliescu] There are a number of concrete problems that have to be solved in this period in which the government is a minority government. We have not had the chance to form a government of national unity, as I said from the very beginning, or a certain coalition that would ensure a stable majority. I even suggested that a political pact should be concluded and it should follow certain generally accepted principles. I am referring to principles that are the basis for organizing any type of government. From this viewpoint, it is all the same to me who will govern. A certain alternation could even be healthy for the future political life, because there is a certain viewpoint when people are in the opposition -- and are constantly criticizing -- and there is another viewpoint when they assume responsibility and try to solve problems. (...) That is why I was very frank when I suggested a national unity government, however, there were forces that claimed that this is undemocratic. In this climate of general suspicion there are people who think: What are Iliescu's goals? He is a dangerous type, a former nomenclatura member, a skillful politician, he wants to cheat us! They even affirmed that my idea was an attempt to stifle the political opposition, but what kind of democracy can we have when there is no opposition in parliament? This was the way that they were thinking. Then I said: If you do not agree with my idea, we must form a coalition. This was not possible either. The only chance was to form a minority government with the party that held the most seats in parliament, that is 34 percent of the seats. There are new discussions now. As you know, we started negotiations in December 1993. I tried to find a new platform for dialogue with all parties, in order to work out a basic platform, a sort of political pact, in which we could include all points of consensus. Obviously, there are differences in regarding political and economic life and economic reform in general. However, there are some points of general agreement. (...) I could even say that as far as the idea of economic reform is concerned, there is a big platform and there are common aspects. However, there are also differences. In this context, I proposed that we should find those points that will create a platform of basic understanding. Now, proceeding from this idea, it is all the same to me which government will take the initiative of implementing this platform or what parties will be included in the respective government. (...) [LE POINT] Mr. President, several neighboring, former communist countries in the East today are loudly voicing their concerns about a new danger of Russian hegemony in Central and Eastern Europe. What do you think about it and what is your stand on this issue? Do you also feel a certain apprehension? [Iliescu] There are obviously some dangers. I believe that the Russian problem will stay topical for quite a while as one of the most difficult problems for Europe and for the world balance. Considering that Russia is still a big country, it will stay a major power, a country with many economic resources, and a country with a serious military potential. On the one hand, there are all these actions to ensure internal balance and economic stability and to strengthen democratic processes and democratic forces and, on the other hand, there are the actions to establish a free and efficient market economy, which is a much more complicated process for Russia than for other countries. (...) Thus, it is more difficult there to find solutions for internal economic, social, and political stability and to strengthen political forces. In these conditions of crisis, there is always the danger of the emergence of extremist tendencies, such as those expressed by Zhirinovskiy and others. Likewise, there is a certain imperial nostalgia, just as in the case of all the other countries that played an important role at a certain time in history. (...) Therefore, from this point of view, these concerns are real, they exist indeed. However, we are neighboring countries and we are interested in promoting good relations. (...)
