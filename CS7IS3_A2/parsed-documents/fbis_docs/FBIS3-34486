An IDF post overlooking the Jabalyah refugee camp was closed yesterday and was replaced with a small lookout. Military sources said the outpost, called "Outpost Oranim," was evacuated in the wake of the IDF's change in deployment in the Gaza Strip, but they did not rule out the possibility that the reduction in forces came in the wake of the agreements with the Palestinians. [passage omitted] The bullet-ridden body of 'Ata Abu-Ahmad, 30, who worked in Gaza's local hospital, was found. 'Ata was abducted four days ago from his place of work on suspicion of aiding Israel. He was murdered and following the murder the hospital workers went on strike.
