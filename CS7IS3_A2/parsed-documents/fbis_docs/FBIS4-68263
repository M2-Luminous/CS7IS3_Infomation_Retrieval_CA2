In turn the state security services consist of the border troops (4 thousand men), the rescue service, and the coastal defense. We Monitor Everyone, Even the Police When creating its own army, the Estonian government put the "Kaytseliyt" in first place. Only now have they acknowledged their error. The "Kaytseliyt" (Defense League) is an organization which appeared in the capacity of people's militia back before the war. It was restored in 1990. In the autumn of the same year it conducted an exercise to restore the prewar border of Estonia, digging in border barriers on foreign territory in the Leningrad oblast. In 1991-1993, the militiamen launched several armed attacks on Russian service members in the Estonian Republic. When the volunteers "implemented" slogans having to do with fighting the occupiers, this was supported in every way by the political elite. But when it became clear that the Russian Army was leaving sooner or later, another solution was found for the military patriotism of the "Defense League." Last summer in Pullapae the volunteer jaeger company, which consisted of soldiers of the Karu "Kaytseliyt" force, barricaded itself in their barracks as a token of protest against the fact that the government was unable to purge the ranks of the army of the "former communists and officers of the Soviet Army." Even though the mutiny itself ended bloodlessly, shots were fired. In November, when the former commander of the Pullapae mutineers Asso Kommer was arrested, there was an exchange of fire between the police and the jaegers, and two policemen were wounded. The scandal has not died down as yet. Even though recently a government commission investigating the jaeger affair disclosed the results of its work, the problems have not been fully eliminated. In the opinion of the commission, the conflict occurred primarily because the status of the jaeger company had not been defined, and for this reason the company constitutes an "alternative military unit attracting both those who are interested in bearing arms, and those who are interested in combat training outside the control of the main staff of the defense forces." Other unsavory facts about the "Kaytseliyt" were also discovered. For example, the commission got hold of a document which indicated that the Parnu militia was conducting "counterintelligence against the municipal prefecture police." It turns out that local "Kaytselliyt" members had received the mission from their Tallinn leaders of "constantly surveilling the activities of the police." Although the "Defense League" has many highly placed patrons, the authorities have begun to take action to eliminate the "partisan subunits." And in a future law on state defense evidently there is no mention of the "Kaytseliyt" as a military formation. Its functions will be rolled back to preparation of draftees and reservists. Aleksander Einzeln, the commander of the defense forces and a former American colonel invited back to the motherland (where he became a Major General), is insisting on this. "The problem is that many of these boys are acting more like members of a street gang than like members of the armed forces," he commented on the situation in the NEW YORK TIMES, "and we need to get rid of the swindlers, thieves and adventurers." What Commander Would Not Love a Fast Career After the "strike" of the jaeger company, the nationalists in parliament blocked a decision on punishing the culprits. But paying no mind to the radicals, Einzeln immediately discharged around 1500 "Kaytseliyt" soldiers. And just as demonstratively, he left in service the former communist and Soviet officer Colonel Ats Laaneots, the chief of the main staff of the defense forces, against whom the volunteers had been acting. Laaneots has retired only now, in April, when his authority officially expired. But he turned over the job to his 49-year-old deputy chief of operations, Colonel Avro Serel, who is also one of the "formers." Why did Einzeln pay no heed then to those who seem to see communists everywhere? It is simply that the defense forces require professionals. You see, now most of the Army officers are quick promotions, as they say here, from the initial period of independence. Only six percent of them have higher education, and most of the commanders have completed only a six-month training course. But life rapidly dispelled the illusions of the first years of independence. And in this context, the interview with the commander of the Kaleva battalion, Captain Alar Laneman, published in the newspaper ESTONSKAYA ZHIZN is quite characteristic. Five officers are envisioned for each company in his battalion, but usually there is only one. And he generally has no experience in service, and cannot cope with the great loads. It is no surprise, Laneman admits, that some of them "got off track and began to push too hard." For this reason, many of the young officers were "simply shoved out" of the battalion. Who is having as meteoric a career in Estonia as the politicians? The 27-year-old journalist Yuri Luyk, becoming Minister of Defense after the Pullapae crisis, this January returned to his former place of work, and was confirmed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. (He began his political career in 1991, taking over a department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). And the military department is headed by a classmate from Tartu University, Indrek Kannik, who also worked earlier at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Like Luyk, he is a deputy of the state council from the rightwing coalition party "Isamaa." But still, one must give the young ambitious politicians their due. The task set two years ago of gradual integration into NATO is being accomplished here most actively, if one compares the efforts of all the Baltic states. And the chief obstacle, the creation of an army on the same principles as in the West, is now starting to be overcome in Estonia. Despite the economic difficulties, Prime Minister Mart Laar last spring with the help of the then Defense Minister Hayn Rebas, concluded a contract with the Israeli state company "Tass" for delivery of NATO-standard small arms and antitank weapons (with spare parts). The parliament easily "swallowed" the astronomical cost of the deal for the Estonian Republic," 50 million U.S. dollars, and in January of this year a ship with the first lot of foreign weapons was unloaded at the port of Tallinn. Yuri Luyk also evidently will go down in history for announcing preparations for production of NATO caliber ammunition in the Republic. The present minister Indrek Kannik and following ones will also have their share of worries. Estonia has undertaken to pay off the sum required by the contract with "Tass" by the start of the year 2000. It is then when plans are to bring the numerical strength of the regular forces to 12 thousand, which is precisely how many can be supplied with the purchased weapons. The Peacekeeping Battalion Is Lucky -- There Is Someone to Attack It is still hard to speak of combat readiness of the defense forces. And joining NATO is not exactly an immediate prospect. A military alliance is now possible only with the nearest neighbors, Latvia and Lithuania. The decision has already been made to form a combined peacekeeping battalion in order to then offer its services to the U.N. And the first test of the forces was on February 20-22, when one company from each country gathered for an exercise at a range not far from Viru. Participating were: One hundred and fifty service members from Latvia, representing a motorized rifle battalion stationed in Aluksne, 129 Estonian soldiers (Company "C" of the Kupriyanov battalion); 96 men from the Lithuanian brigade "Gelezhinas Vilkas" (1st Company of the Panevezys Battalion). Against the background of numerous statements regarding preparation for peacekeeping operations, the plan of action of the future U.N. soldiers appears strange. Here is how the Estonian press describes the exercise: "The first day the combined battalion withdrew under the pressure of enemy forces . . . They (the subunits) cleanly emerged from the encirclement, and by evening the withdrawal had stopped. The next day a counterattack began which ended in a brilliant victory." One could of course cite other details. But this is the main thing. It is thought that the goal of any peacekeeping operation is to stop fire and separate the belligerent parties. Here everything is different. It is no accident that immediately after the Viru maneuvers, the "Kaytseliyt" leadership began to demand an "all-Estonian defensive exercise," again dragging out its slogans about the struggle with the occupiers. It is a good thing that after the results of the work of the "jaeger" commission were publicized, the enthusiasts supporting the "Defense League" decreased both in the state assembly and in the government. The venture has collapsed. They say that after this, one of the "Kaytseliyt" leaders began work on his memoirs--a good sign that his time had passed.
