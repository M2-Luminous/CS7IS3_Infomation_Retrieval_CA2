The largest of the three is the Shenzhen International Commercial Center, a cooperative venture between a Canadian company and the bonded zone. It consists of two 48-story buildings, one 20-story five-star hotel and a host of five-story buildings, with a total floor space of some 180,000 sq km. The other two projects are a Hong Kong-funded storage building and the 30,000-sq-km Changbao Mansion. According to official sources, the improvement in the infrastructure of the bonded zone over the past three years has drawn an increasing number of investors. Statistics show that the 19 projects already started in the zone involve a total of more than 5.5 billion Hong Kong dollars in overseas investment. Over 120 trading companies are ready to start business. The head of the bonded zone said a series of foreign-invested projects are expected to be launched there this year.
