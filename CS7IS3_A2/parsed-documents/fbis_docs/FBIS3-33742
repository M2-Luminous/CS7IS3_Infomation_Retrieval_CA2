Vishwam of DECCAN CHRONICLE] [Text] One cannot recall a stretch of time in India-Pakistan bilateral relations which was not characterized by strain, stresses and tensions. Indeed, during the last four decades the course of India-Pakistan relations has been variably been marked by a pattern which has by now become quite familiar to the students of South Asian politics. A prolonged period of confrontation and hostility leads to expression of the desire for normalization and friendship. This leads to some form of dialogue which arouses expectations in both the countries. The dialogue ends either in failure or in stalemate and relations are back to square one. The recent foreign secretaries level dialogue was yet another attempt to broker peace between the two neighbors. The outcome was disappointing. In diplomatic parlance, it could be described as both sides agreeing to disagree. But instead of being put off by the failure, India has decided to go ahead and make one more attempt to induce Pakistan to try and remove some if not all of the irritants which (?clay) bilateral relations. This attempt was in the form of handing over six nonpapers containing detailed proposals in several key areas of contention in India-Pakistan relations by the foreign secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, to the Pakistan high commissioner in New Delhi. The initial response to the proposals from Islamabad has predictably been lukewarm, but one hopes that a detailed study of the six proposals would persuade Pakistan to be more responsive. These proposals may not been spectacular or sensational, but they address issues which have aggravated tension and which because of that very reason needed to be got out of the way. Indeed, one of the most innovative among the proposals is the Indian offer in the arena of building confidence and removing mistrust of a no first-use of nuclear capability. This is to ensure regardless of whether or not the two countries possess nuclear capabilities that there is no chance of a nuclear confrontation between the two. The proposal is of benefit to both the countries and hence it ought to be acceptable to Pakistan. Again, Islamabad should consider the proposal for creating an institutional mechanism to preserve peace and tranquility along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the porous border has led to numerous instances of violations of the Line of Control, any mechanism which can monitor such violations and prevent them ought to be welcomed by Islamabad. It is worth remembering that agreement between India and China on the creation of an institutionalized mechanism along the border has actually resulted in trans-border tranquility and lessening of tension. There is no reason why a similar mechanism along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir cannot work. The proposal for implementing the agreement on Siachen arrived at three or four years ago by the defense secretaries of the two countries is an earnest of India's sincerity in settling the Siachen issue once and for all. In fact, the suggestion for ensuring peace and tranquility along the Line of Control and the offer to implement the agreement on Siachen taken together constitute a major peace-offering on the part of India. Both countries have admitted that the Siachen agreement could not be implemented two years ago because of the absence of political will. Soon after returning to power after elections, the prime minister of Pakistan, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, had said that an agreement on Siachen would restore Pakistan's confidence in bilateral negotiations. By offering to implement such agreement, India is giving proof of its good faith. Indeed, the spirit in which the Indian proposals have been made are consistent with the spirit of the Simla Agreement of 1972. It is on such a basis that Islamabad must assess the six proposals. Islamabad demanding a plebiscite in Kashmir or raising the Kashmir issue at the UN Conference on Human Rights in Geneva will not take Pakistan too far.
