FBIS4-59305 "drnes092_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-092 Daily Report 10 May 1994 SYRIA `Practical Ideas' Sought `Practical Ideas' Sought JN1005120394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 10 May 94 JN1005120394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] In its editorial, AL-BA'TH discusses the U.S. secretary of state's new tour in the region. It says: It is almost certain that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will return to the region next Saturday [14 May] and that his tour may be limited to shuttle missions between Syria and Israel in an attempt, as he has said, to activate the stagnant peace talks and, hence, crystallize a formula that will push the peace process forward. It is well known that the U.S. secretary was in the region not long ago. In that tour, he tried to bring about some progress on the Israeli-Syrian track. That objective, however, was not achieved because of the Israeli position that remained unchanged, refusing to abide by the resolutions of international legitimacy, on whose basis the peace process was started. Several Western, and even Israeli media organs, have reported the U.S. Administration's dismay over the proposals which Christopher conveyed to Syria. The paper believes the U.S. Administration has felt that the Israeli proposals are unable to push the peace process in the direction of achieving the just and comprehensive peace. Therefore, one can say that the Israeli proposals, as stressed by Syria, aim only to escape blame and do not serve the peace process and the conditions for its success. They only mean a new attempt to circumvent the peace process as a whole. AL-BA'TH adds: If the peace process is to follow its correct path, then Israel should announce its complete and absolute compliance with the implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy as an initial and basic step to achieve progress that would in turn achieve the desired peace. The paper adds: Anything else would mean that Israel is continuing with the policy of maneuvering and procrastination out of its belief that it may be able to achieve other agreements, similar to the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Here, we must stress once again that Syria, which is working very seriously on achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region, will continue to reject the incomplete peace, the peace that would not return rights to their rightful owners. AL-BA'TH concludes: We hope that Christopher's new tour will carry practical ideas to activate the stagnant peace process and place the region on the path of the just and comprehensive peace. On the same subject, TISHRIN says in an editorial entitled "Christopher and the Israeli Obstacle:" : Rabin's government opposes any move toward the genuine peace, even if such a move comes from Washington. Warren Christopher knows this fact and knows for certain that Rabin's government has always sought to undermine the Madrid formula and suspended the Washington talks. He also knows that Israel abhors the principle of just and comprehensive settlement and prefers, instead, to sign separate, secret deals, similar to the one it struck with the PLO, that would give Israel everything, deprive the Arabs of their rights, and maintain the Israeli occupation and hegemony in the region. Therefore, the results of Christopher's forthcoming tour will not be different from those of previous tours if the United States continues to refuse to apply pressure on Israel and continues to supply it with all kinds of advanced weapons. TISHRIN adds: President Clinton's administration has announced its compliance with the principle of comprehensive settlement that is based on the UN resolutions. Syria and the other Arab parties have responded positively to that U.S. trend. Only Israel rejected that principle and undermined all the opportunities that were made available in the region to achieve the just and permanent peace. This is the reality, which Washington is certainly aware of. It also knows that the Israeli obstacle is the one that prevented any success in the U.S. initiative and progress in the peace process. The paper believes that if the U.S. secretary wants his forthcoming tour to succeed, then his efforts must be directed toward removing this obstacle and overcoming the difficulties which the Rabin government is fabricating in the face of the peace process. The paper adds: This will only be achieved when Washington translates its peace intentions into reality and abandons the mailman role and exercises real pressure on Rabin's government to force it to accept the principles for establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region. TISHRIN concludes by saying: If the U.S. secretary manages to remove the Israeli obstacle and the mines which the Rabin government has placed on the path of peace, then the chances for success in his mission will certainly be guaranteed. Only then will the region enter a new era of the comprehensive and just peace that will end all forms of aggression, injustice, and occupation.
