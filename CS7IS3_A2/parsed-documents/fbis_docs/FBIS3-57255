According to press-centre of Defense Ministry (DM) of Azerbaijan, only for the last week all the villages situated in the northern part of Kelbadzhar region were liberated. Simultaneously, Azeri soldiers have taken all strategically important top-hills which ensure the control over motor highway Kelbadzhar-Agdere (Mardakert). Moreover, a section of the high-way Kelbajar-Lachin is controlled by Azeri units as well. For the last week in this section of the front 300 Armenian soldiers and officers have been killed and wounded, 9 tanks, 2 BMP, 5 artillery systems of the enemy have been destroyed. As trophies Azeri soldiers have taken 4 tanks, 2 BMP and a great many of guns, mortars, ammunition depots. 5 Armenian ensigns and officers have been taken in prison at the same section of the front. The aressted said that they were the soldiers of the 127th Russian Motor-Infantry Division located in the city of Gyumri on the territory of Armenian Republic. According to their words, the reserves of ammunitions in Khankendi are very few and the fighting sprit of the soldiers is low. Within this period, Armenians tried to tranport only 20 parcels of ammunitions and 1 barrel of fuel from Yerevan to Karabakh. The arrested said that in Yerevan people are caught at the streets, taken from home at night and sent to the Army. Very often Armenian soldiers are forced to fight under the threat of thier relatives' murder, the arrested said. These data show that not "the forces of Karabakh's self- defense" but regular units of Armenian army including soldiers of Russian units located on the territory of Armenian Republic fight against Azerbaijan.
