I am satisfied with my previous visits to your country and the meetings with Russian leaders I have had here in England." British Prime Minister John Major, who will pay a official visit to Russia on 14-16 February, said this in an interview with ITAR-TASS, Russian TV, and Ostankino. President Yeltsin and I are planning to discuss a wide range of issues that will include the situation in Russia, bilateral relations, and, naturally, a wide range of international problems and economic and political issues, he said. The discussions will be very broad in scope. John Major stressed that he considered the recent changes in the Russian Government's cabinet to be the business of the Russian people. I and all my colleagues in Great Britain am interested in seeing the continuation of the program of reforms in your country and the achievement of success on the path toward economic prosperity, he said. This is in the interests of Russia, and we too are striving for this. Russia is a great and powerful country and we are interested in having equal relations with it. We are happy to help it in any way we can, but Russia too can offer a great deal to the rest of the world, including Great Britain. I intend to discuss this in Moscow with the Russian president and prime minister, John Major said. Concerning the situation in the former Yugoslavia, the head of the British Government pointed out that he was looking forward to the talks in Moscow on this problem. We believe the aims of the Russian Government are similar to those the West is also setting itself. We want a halt to the military actions and to the unnecessary and senseless loss of lives. The main aim, which I think is also shared by Russia, is to achieve a political settlement to the conflict through talks, the prime minister stressed.
