FR940106-1-00055 FR940106-1-00011 _Delta smelt. Delta smelt ( Hypomesus transpacificus ) are found today only in the upper reaches of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary. Early studies by the California DFG of the two most abundant smelts, longfin smelt and Delta smelt, noted that changes in the historical location of the entrapment zone would threaten populations of both species (Broadway 1979). In its initial notice of petition findings for the listing of the Delta smelt as threatened under the ESA, the USFWS found that ``the annual export of 6 million acre-feet of water by Federal, State and private agencies has allowed the intrusion of higher salinity seawater to the marshes. Because of higher salinities, the Delta smelt has lost spawning and nursery areas in Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh.'' 55 FR 52852, 52853 (December 24, 1990). The final rule listing Delta smelt as a threatened species found that embryonic, larval and post-larval mortality rates increase as salinities in the western Delta increase and the entrapment zone moves upstream. Delta smelt larvae survive and grow best when the entrapment zone occupies a broad geographic area with extensive shallow areas. Delta smelt reproduction has probably suffered in recent years because the entrapment zone has been located east of Suisun Bay. 58 FR 12854 (March 5, 1993). In the proposal to list the Delta smelt as a threatened species, the USFWS identified critical habitat for the species as requiring salinities less than 2 ppt in Suisun Bay from January through June. 56 FR 50075, 50079 (October 3, 1991). When listing the Delta smelt as threatened, the USFWS deferred designation of critical habitat until October 1993. In summarizing the factors affecting Delta smelt, the USFWS concluded that the biological characteristics of the species made it very sensitive to perturbations in its reproductive habitat and larval nursery grounds. The final listing notice further determined that Suisun Bay is the primary nursery habitat for this species and that the habitat has been degraded because of higher salinities in the spring due to upstream freshwater diversions. 58 FR 12854, 12860 (March 5, 1993). The USFWS's conclusions were also supported by an interagency Delta smelt working group convened by the USFWS after its proposal to list the species under the ESA. The working group included representatives of USFWS, EPA, USBR, California DFG, and the California DWR. The working group developed several recommendations to increase abundance levels of Delta smelt, including maintaining the 2 ppt zone in Suisun Bay during the Delta smelt's early months of life. The working group's recommendation was that low salinity habitat be kept in Suisun Bay in all years; no attempt was made to adjust the position of the zone to account for dry year conditions (USFWS 1992f, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;15). The USFWS's proposed critical habitat designation has been supported by a recently published paper by biologists of the California DFG and the University of California at Davis. The authors concluded that Delta smelt are most abundant in low salinity water associated with the entrapment zone. During the years preceding their decline, Delta smelt were found most abundantly at sites where low salinity conditions coincided with shallow habitats. Since their decline, low salinity conditions have been found in areas where little shallow habitat is available. The principal conclusion of these authors was that ``[r]estoration of the Delta smelt to a sustainable population size is likely to require maintenance of the [entrapment] zone in Suisun Bay and maintenance of net seaward flows in the lower San Joaquin River during the period when larvae are present'' (Moyle et al. 1992). The State Board's 1991 Bay/Delta Plan also acknowledged that the location of the 2 ppt isohaline is important for Delta smelt, finding that ``existing knowledge suggests that salinities of 2 ppt or less are desired in Suisun Bay from March through June.'' However, rather than adopting protective salinity criteria, the State Board suggested that protection of low-salinity habitat would be dealt with as a ``flow'' issue in the subsequent scoping and water rights phases of its proceedings (1991 Bay/Delta Plan, p. 5&hyph;44). As explained in more detail above, to date the State Board has failed to adopt any additional standards since its 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. _Striped Bass. Striped bass ( Morone saxatilis ) support one of the most economically important sportfisheries in the Bay/Delta estuary. The striped bass population (and consequently the number of anglers) has plummeted since the early 1970's, with populations declining by as much as 70 percent from historical levels (Stevens et al. 1985; White 1986; CDFG 1992b, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;8). Although striped bass populations exist elsewhere in entirely freshwater habitats, the species thrives only in estuarine conditions (Talbot 1966), and in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary low salinity habitat appears to provide important nursery grounds (Wang 1986). Adult striped bass migrate upstream to spawn in fresh water. The planktonic larvae are carried downstream and concentrate in areas of low salinity (Moyle 1976). When this low salinity zone is located in Suisun Bay, survival of young bass is improved (Turner and Chadwick 1972). As a result, several parties have recommended that the entrapment zone be maintained in Suisun Bay to improve striped bass year class survival (Moyle 1992, WRINT&hyph;NHI&hyph;9; USBR 1991, WRINT&hyph;USBR&hyph;2; USFWS 1992d, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;19; USFWS 1992e, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;20; Moyle and Herbold 1989; Moyle, et al. 1989). Other factors, including year-to-year variations in outflow and exports, have also contributed to the decline of the striped bass population. California DFG has developed a model suggesting that export limitations also are necessary to preserve the striped bass fishery. Accordingly, California DFG's recent recommendations to protect striped bass have focused on reducing entrainment of fish, eggs and larvae in water pumps operated by the SWP and the CVP, rather than on maintaining protective salinity conditions (CDFG 1992e, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;3; D&hyph;1630). However, according to a series of papers developed for the SFEP-sponsored workshops, models that are based on the downstream extent of low salinity habitat are at least as accurate in predicting striped bass abundance as the California DFG model based on flows and exports (Jassby, in SFEP 1993b; CDFG 1992e, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;3). The studies cited above suggest that, regardless of the effects of entrainment at the diversion pumps, low salinity nursery habitat in Suisun Bay is important and that this habitat has sharply declined in recent years. Based on these studies, EPA believes that salinity criteria in Suisun Bay are necessary to protect nursery habitat of the striped bass.
