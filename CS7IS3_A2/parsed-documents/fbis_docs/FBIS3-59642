(PNC) will begin producing the interior equipment for a facility where technology for producing fuel for a demonstration advanced thermal reactor (ATR) will be developed. Although the construction of the facility's building within the Tokai Plant's plutonium fuel development facility ended in 1989, production of the equipment to go inside the facility was postponed for about five years because of the Electric Power Development Coordination Council's lack of progress in negotiations on the site for the demonstration ATR (electrical output: 606,000 kW). The plans are to build the demonstration ATR in Oma-machi, Aomori Prefecture. According to the STA Atomic Energy Bureau, the ATR fuel production line is to be completed within about five years, and then will supply uranium-plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for the demonstration ATR after the reactor is put through trial runs and completed. The newly constructed demonstration ATR fuel production technology development facility is adjacent to the FBR fuel production line facility in the Tokai Plant's plutonium fuel third development building. The FBR line facility will produce the fuel for the initial loading of the prototype Monju FBR (electrical output: 280,000 kW; Tsuruga-shi, Fukui Prefecture). The ATR line building has a floor space of 5,000 m<sup> 2</sup> . The new ATR line is to cope with the increase in MOX fuel supply accompanying the development of the demonstration reactor that will follow the prototype Fugen ATR (electrical output: 165,000 kW; Tsuruga-shi, Fukui Prefecture). According to the plan, a 10-ton/year production line will be built. The goal is to increase the capacity by 20 tons/year after completion of the demonstration reactor and to ultimately have a 30-ton/year line. Along with the completion of the new ATR line, the second development building, which up until now has produced the fuel bodies for Fugen exchange, is to change over into a base facility for R&D of fuel production technology. Remote manipulation technology and automatic operation technology will be brought into the new ATR fuel production line to automate nearly everything except maintenance operations. In addition, preparations for the construction of the new demonstration reactor continue to be made, e.g., the basic design for safety inspections is complete. Construction is expected to begin in 1996 and operations to start in 2002.
