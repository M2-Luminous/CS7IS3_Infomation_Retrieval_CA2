The statement branded the "NSL" as an anti-democratic, anti-reunification evil law defining the North and the anti-"government" forces in the South and overseas as "enemies" and totally blocking human rights, democracy and national reunification and as an evil law infringing upon basic rights of the people including conscience and the freedom of ideology and the freedom of speech, the press and association. The attempts to keep the "NSL" only reveal the anti-national nature of the present "regime" which is turning a deaf ear to the demands of the people and scheming to perpetuate the division, the statement said. It repeatedly and strongly urged the Kim Yong-sam puppet authorities to abrogate the law.
