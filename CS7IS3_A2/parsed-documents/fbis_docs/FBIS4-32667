The letter insists that a new category be introduced in the Macedonian population census questionnaires: "Nationality -- Bosniak." In an explanation, the Bosnian Foreign Ministry says that this is in accordance with Article 7 of the Muslim constitutional law, and insists on a representative of the Sarajevo Muslim government -- the Bosniak-Croat Federation -- taking part in the census. In the period preceding the census, the SDA itself demanded the introduction of Bosniaks as a new name for the Muslims of Macedonia, in accordance with a decision by a symposium held in the Muslim part of Sarajevo this spring. According to observers in Skopje, this demand, if fulfilled, would cause a lot of confusion among the Islamic population in Macedonia. This is because, in addition to a certain number of Muslims of Bosnian origin, there is also in Macedonia a certain number of Serb-speaking Muslims who came from Serbia, Montenegro, and Herzegovina, as well as about 100,000 Macedonian-speaking Muslims. According to Macedonian analysts, the introduction of the term Bosniak for all Muslims in the territory of former Yugoslavia represents yet another fundamentalist invention of Alija Izetbegovic and his Islamist aides working on the homogenization of the entire Muslim population in the territory of former Yugoslavia.
