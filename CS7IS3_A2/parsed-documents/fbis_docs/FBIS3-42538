Kalashnikova, under the rubric "Anniversary": "Dreaming About the High Heavens, TsAGI Is Busy Making Its Own Boots"] [Text] Throughout its entire 75-year history, the N. Ye. Zhukovskiy Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) -- the leader and head institute of domestic aircraft building -- has been proud of its contribution to "everything that flies in the skies over our country." Today, it is concerned with its needs on the ground. Things are not easy in the current conditions for the one who for so long was the country's favorite brainchild, to whom nothing was refused, and whose requests were a top priority. In the years of shortages, lines, and product cards, Zhukovskiy's aviation center was in no need "in the field" or at home. Now TsAGI is learning not only to count money, but also to earn it. Before, fundamental scientific advances, high-tech aerospace hardware, and defense products were fully ordered, financed, and used by the state. Now, in crisis conditions, the state accounts for only 40 percent of the TsAGI budget. The actual situation, in the estimation of TsAGI director German Zagaynov, is that, in the near future, society will be unable to support a considerable portion of the intellectual potential and high-tech research that have been accumulated. The problem is not just in the expensiveness of a commodity whose affordability is limited to only the state or, in the extreme, large firms who need the product. TsAGI's misfortune is that it used to be far in the lead in the technical standards of our society, which is still incapable of making skillful and full use of the scientific-technical wealth created in the institute. The institute has to survive on its own: the state hasn't proposed any special conversion programs or any policy stimulating internal or foreign investment to support basic research. With Russian partners, TsAGI has built and is the proprietor of a factory that has already begun series manufacture of ... men's and women's shoes. All the staff members of the institute will, within a year, be shoed in boots of their own making. Other commercial enterprises that have been created at TsAGI and that produce metal tiles, lining panels, mixers, ceramic dishes, lamps, wood-drying chambers, etc., are also operating successfully. A special commercial-conversion service has been created in the institute to coordinate the new types of activity. It organizes investment and holding companies and institute banks and insurance structures; it sets up shareholding; and it is involved in privatization. The funds attracted in connection with contracts with domestic industry represents 27-30 percent of the institute's budget today. TsAGI's commercial activity is not just a means of becoming independent in the absence of the customary trusteeship of the state. It is a means of saving its unique personnel from being sold off as state orders are cut back and wages drop to low levels (they are more than twofold lower than the average in the country). Overall, over 5-6 years, up to 30 percent of the institute's staff members are expected to be hired by contract. The fall of 1993 saw the introduction of a system of grants for young specialists who are developing promising advances, wages increases of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles [R] for those who enter master's programs, and awards of a half a million rubles for who defend their dissertation. In the opinion of German Zagaynov, to survive, the economy today needs "monsters" -- powerful multiprofile, multifunctional corporations capable of combining science and applications, i.e., basic advances, experimentation, and production. That is why, at the initiative of TsAGI, the Association of Aerospace Enterprises and Institutions of the Southeastern region of Moscow Oblast was formed in October of this year. The operating program of that consortium involves not only conversion measures capable of creating and maintaining new markets, but also the solution of a long-existing, painful problem -- how to raise the standards of production rapidly. The initiators of the project feel that it can become a fragment of the scientific-industrial policy of Russia and that it will at the same time make it possible for the institute to "become integrated into the region, work for it, and get results from the region." There is a hope that the regional corporation will help to develop and transform for the internal and external market TsAGI's high-level technologies, which, in return, will give to the institute its former high professional standing and to Russia, an economic dynamism, a high standard of living, and prestige in the world.
