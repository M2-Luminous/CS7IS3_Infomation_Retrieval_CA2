He said that the results of his talks with French President Francois Mitterrand were "excellent." [passge ommitted] He said that the talks at the Elysee and with Defense Minister Leotard covered "the possibility of France training security and police forces of the Kurdish region for the protection of the inhabitants and foreigners living there," most of whom work for relief organizations. He added that "the reply was positive and Paris promised to study the matter, along the same lines as the Palestinian police forces" which will go to the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area and which receive international aid within the framework of the autonomy agreement. [passage omitted] He said that he discussed with the European officials "the possibility of getting defensive weapons" and the exemption of northern Iraq from the military embargo imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait. He added that the training of Kurdish police was one of the topics he discussed in Germany. He stressed that Bonn is "showing special interest in the Kurdish issue" in general and is preparing an initiative for the settlement of the Kurdish problem in Turkey "in the context of a political solution that would safeguard that country's unity." [passage omitted] On the rumors about a Turkish mediation between Baghdad and the Iraqi Kurds, Talabani said: "We have not been officially informed of Ankara's position." He added that he believes that Ankara wishes to normalize relations with Baghdad. Asked about the recent agreement between the two countries for the repair of the oil pipelines extending from Karkuk in northern Iraq to the Turkish coast, he replied: "Resumption of the export of Iraqi oil via Turkey would depend on a UN resolution (lifting the embargo) and also on a decision by the government of the region of Kurdistan." He pointed out that a part of the pipeline passes through the territory under the Kurdistan Front's control "and, therefore, a share of the royalties from that oil should go to the Kurdish people to be spent on administration, development, and payment of salaries" in northern Iraq."
