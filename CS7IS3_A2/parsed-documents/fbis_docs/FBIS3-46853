Howard Dee, former ambassador to the Vatican and chief government peace negotiator with the communist rebels, said the acceptance of Jalandoni's request removed a stumbling block in the talks. Dee, however, did not say when and where the meeting could take place. He said the government's panel position was that the issue be included in the talks in Hanoi the capital of Vietnam. The National Democratic Front (NDF), political arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), has set a number of preconditions before it could sit down for talks in Vietnam. Among these are the release of 300 political prisoners and the government's insistence that the negotiation be conducted under the framework of the Philippine Constitution. The second precondition has proved the most difficult to overcome. However, Dee said that the preliminary meeting could still proceed by taking up issues such as the ground rules for substantive talks, safety and immunity guarantees for peace representatives, and all other technical arrangements. Dee also reminded Jalandoni that when they signed The Hague Declaration in September 1992, they agreed that "no precondition shall be made to negate the inherent character and purpose of the peace negotiations." "With the onset of the New Year, and the hope it brings, we urge Mr. Jalandoni to come to the negotiating table to implement The Hague Declaration so that together we may give peace a chance," Dee said. He said Vietnam has already agreed to host the talks but would not take direct part in it. Hanoi wanted to adopt Jakarta's position in facilitating only peace talks between the Philippine government and dissident factions, like the Muslim secessionist and communist guerrillas. The last time government representatives talked with communist leaders in the Netherlands in September last year when the Ramos government first opened its doors for peaceful resolution of the 25-year-old Maoist rebellion.
