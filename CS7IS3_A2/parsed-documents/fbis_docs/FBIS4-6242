The heroic April popular uprising involving patriotic students and people of various strata of South Korea was a historical event that marked a brilliant victory in the struggle of the South Korean people to overthrow the Syngman Rhee dictatorial "regime" and build a national independent government free from subjugation and fascism, he said. Pointing out that the colonial fascist repressive rule of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges is still in force in South Korea contrary to the desire and aspirations of the valiant participants in the April uprising, he said: "We must kindle fierce flames of struggle once again to bring the second April 19 uprising to the land of South Korea and oust the Kim Yong-sam group from power. "Our Hanminjon will wage a more staunch struggle to drive the U.S. imperialist aggressors out of South Korea and liquidate their colonial rule, holding higher the banner of independence against the United States, in the van of the people of all strata including students. "For the present, we will expand the mass struggles against the rice market opening, the introduction of Patriot missiles and the resumption of the `Team Spirit' joint military exercises and rapidly develop them into anti-war, anti-nuke, anti-American struggles. "We will certainly accomplish the cause of national reunification in the 90s by smashing all the anti-nation and anti-independence moves of the splittists at home and abroad, upholding the banner of the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country' put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song."
