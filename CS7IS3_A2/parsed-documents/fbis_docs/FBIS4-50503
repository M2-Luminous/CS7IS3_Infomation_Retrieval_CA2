A Public Security Ministry spokesman made it clear that investigations into alleged "fresh crimes" committed by Wei had yet to be concluded. "Wei Jingsheng violated Chinese law while he was released on parole and his political rights were withdrawn, and the police are in the process of investigating his case," the spokesman said. Foreign press reports quoting the ministry as saying Wei's case had been handed over to the Chinese courts were "completely false," he said. Wei, 44, was picked up by police April 1 as he tried to return to Beijing from a forced exile in nearby Tianjin. The authorities then announced that he was being investigated for unspecified new crimes. Wei was released on parole in September last year, having served all but six months of a 15-year sentence for counter-revolutionary activities. The Chinese authorities were incensed when Wei met here in February with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck and called on Washington to take a hard line with Beijing over human rights.
