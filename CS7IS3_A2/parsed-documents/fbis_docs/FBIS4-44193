He also said that the EU's new emphasis on transport research is linked to the goal of an internal market. Italy's Antonio Ruberti is the EU commissioner for education and research. He took part recently in the large-scale EUREKA [European Research Coordination Agency] conference in Lillehammer. EUREKA is the name of the research group which now embraces 23 countries in Europe and the EU Commission. Projects are proposed by cooperating companies in different countries, and it is these countries which chiefly finance the research. Consequently this research is closely linked to the needs of business and industry. The research fro which the EU grants money must from the outset have more fundamental implications -- or be ahead of the competition on the market, as the phrase goes. The EU's research programs have existed for 10 years, EUREKA for nine. And, according to Ruberti, the relationship is good: EU research and EUREKA complement each other in many ways. Ruberti said that the EU is involved in 27 EUREKA projects. At the EUREKA conference Ruberti followed up Norway's strong emphasis on environmental issues and more environmentally friendly technology. "In its recently adopted fourth framework program for research the EU has made strong commitments in this field. Environmental research is a separate area of investment, but the environment also comes into fields such as energy, transport, and biological sciences," he said -- and predicted greater cooperation on environmental problems. Several East European countries are now involved in EUREKA. Russia attended the Lillehammer meeting with a large delegation. Asked what Russian companies have to offer, Ruberti reminded me of the country's technological background, particularly in the military-industrial complex. The competence built up here can be adapted to meet civilian needs. "Russia has a very interesting potential. The fact that the country is today experiencing problems does not mean that the level of quality is low," he stressed, adding that the Russians are very interested in EUREKA cooperation. But so far they have not taken part in many projects. The EU gives research support to the countries of East Europe -- both through a foundation and directly in the form of project support. Of a total allocation of ECU540 million (around 4.52 billion Norwegian kroner) to countries outside the EU, nearly one-half go to the countries of East and Central Europe, Ruberti said. The money helps to maintain scientific centers which would otherwise have been in great difficulties because of the economic situation. Through a center set up jointly with Russia, the United States, and Japan, the EU is helping in the conversion from the military to the civilian sector. The EU has also made money available to improve the safety of nuclear reactors in East Europe. Recently the Socialist Left Party voiced criticism of this project, partly with the argument that, in this way, dangerous power stations are being kept in operation. Ruberti's response is that it is not the EU which decides whether the reactors should be in operation. "We cannot afford to allow ourselves not to worry about safety," he added. The EU's fourth framework program for research continues to focus on areas of investment from the third program: information and communications, biological sciences, the environment, industrial technology, energy, and human resources and mobility. Two new areas have been added: Social research and transport. Ruberti said that transport and information research is about creating a better flow of goods and information. These fields are closely linked to the political goal of achieving a single internal market in the EU. The new EU programs for education -- Leonardo and Socrates -- have not yet been formally adopted. But Ruberti is expecting support for them at a forthcoming ministerial meeting. The main problem is finding the money, especially since the way is being prepared for enlargement. Norway is already deeply involved in research cooperation with the EU, in part a as result of the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement. But until we become members of the EU, we will not be involved in the formal decisionmaking process. Ruberti said that Norway can make important contributions in fields like environmental research and fisheries research. He praised Norway's approach to vocational training and further education. Would an EU no-vote have any impact on cooperation? Not to any great extent. But Ruberti cannot rule this out all together and pointed to certain problems with Switzerland, which said no to the EEA. For the time being at least the relationship between Norway and the EU seems to be the very best in the fields of education and research.
