On a political level, things are just as volatile, as the RPF's many international backers (among others, English-speaking African countries and, in Europe, the Belgians) will no doubt charge Paris with "rescuing the perpetrators of the genocide" by saving the supporters of the late [President] Habyarimana's regime from certain defeat. In short, the feeling elicited by France's sudden interventionism or, more to the point, the determination of the occasional Mitterrand-Juppe tandem, however laudable it may seem from a "moral" point of view, is one of bafflement. All the more when one recalls how frantically the staff of the French Embassy in Kigali scrambled to leave two month ago. "A veritable exodus," as put by one observer, who still cannot fathom why our diplomats should have felt the need to burn their files, "as though it were the Germans invading Paris!" What shameful deeds did the French need to bury? And could it be that they are now acting on a desire to make amends? While the very nature of such a hypothesis makes it difficult to ascertain, it cannot be dismissed out of hand. Having supported Habyarimana's dictatorial regime (whose exactions against the Tutsi minority as well as democratic-minded Hutus has been amply confirmed) for years, France was obviously instrumental in bringing about today's tragedy. Whatever the Elysee [office of the president], the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], and the Cooperation Ministry may say about the "pivotal role" of our diplomats in the Arusha reconciliation agreement signed in August 1993, there are facts that will not go away. Until he was assassinated, more than eight months after Arusha, Juvenal Habyarimana consistently attempted to block the implementation of the agreement. A ploy to weaken his rivals, a prime example being the RPF, had been successful: The president and his aides had cunningly favored, in almost every region of the country, the emergence of tiny political parties, all of which had their own demands, thus making any national dialogue a very sensitive matter. According to regional experts, this strategy had obviously been "masterminded by French advisers." Denounced by both national and foreign media for weeks, France is now allegedly trying to improve its standing through humanitarian action. Here, another explanation springs to mind. The U.S. experience in Somalia (that is, before operation "Restore Hope" degenerated into tragic surrealism) shows that humanitarian action works wonders on a country's public opinion. Especially when the latter, as has been the case with Rwanda for several weeks now, has been fed a steady diet of unbearable pictures and mind-boggling casualty figures. The case for such an explanation becomes even stronger in the light of an internal strife which has been going on in France: [former Humanitarian Minister] Bernard Kouchner went to Rwanda several times -- not ineffectively since his indignant calls did shake up many a slumbering conscience in France. On the government side, while Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy did visit border refugee camps once, the government had long kept a low profile (need one mention the nonentity that is Kouchner's successor as humanitarian minister: Lucette Michaux-Blazy?). According to Pierre-Marie Decoudras, a Black Africa Study Center (CEAN) researcher, the "Kouchner syndrome has obviously had a lot to do with" Alain Juppe's gung-ho stance. It also influenced Francois Mitterrand's stance, although an additional motive for the latter is likely to be the close friendship he maintained with Rwanda's assassinated president, with whom Mr. Mitterrand's son Jean-Christophe was close as well. Indeed, it was because of such "loyalty" that Habyarimana's widow and her family were flown away in one of the first Transall transport aircraft used to evacuate French nationals from Kigali after the more fanatical Hutus started the slaughter. "The other, more traditional syndrome to be considered is the `Fachoda syndrome' [location in Upper Volta which was ceded to the British in 1899]," adds Pierre-Marie Decoudras. In this region of Africa, countries such as Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic, and Zaire are on the edge of the Anglo-Saxon sphere of influence, a prominent member of the latter being Uganda, which has traditionally and overtly supported the RPF rebels. And at a time when Zaire is being undermined from within and the political situation in Bangui [Central African Republic] -- the very pivot of French military operations in Africa -- appears shaky, France is bent on salvaging what remains to be salvaged in Rwanda, and therefore also in neighboring Burundi, another country which has always straddled the fence. Furthermore, all this should not be too difficult to achieve after all. "Remember the small number of French soldiers it took to stop the RPF's offensive against Kigali one and a half year ago," Decoudras points out. "Things have not changed all that much since, and I believe that the RPF and the French will necessarily need to compromise. All told, this should indeed be a successful military and humanitarian operation." In other words, not such a bad deal for France, whose latest noteworthy action in Africa was the devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc, and which therefore could use the goodwill its "benevolent" intervention might earn it.
