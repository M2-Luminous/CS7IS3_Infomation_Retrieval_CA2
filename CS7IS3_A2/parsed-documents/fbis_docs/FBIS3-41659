Though the process of replacing them with products (hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's] that cause less damage to the ozone layer is now proceeding extremely rapidly, old refrigerators still contain the much feared gas. The solution to this problem comes from Bologna and is called ICF (Refrigerator Components Company) and ENEA [Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and the Environment]. The joint effort between the Emilia-based company and the research body has led to the development of Cleaner 12 and Cleaner 134: semiautomatic systems for the recovery and recycling of CFC's that are capable of regenerating the R12 and R143a gas. The Cleaner is a filter system. The CFC is separated by evaporating the oil from the system and is filtered a first time. Two other filtering stations are used to neutralize the acidity, absorb humidity, and withhold the solid particles. A third filter completes the purifying operation and finally the cryogenic gas that is regenerated is stored in a dosage container. The Cleaner can also automatically load and unload the purified gas directly into the refrigeration system by simply using different pressure levels. The ENEA-ICF patent is currently the only means of recycling CFC's. Another CFC treatment system is thermal destruction. This operation requires a great deal of energy and is a highly costly one. The technology tested by ICF is suitable not only for the treatment of CFC's but also for the HCFC's and HFC's that are currently used as CFC substitutes.
