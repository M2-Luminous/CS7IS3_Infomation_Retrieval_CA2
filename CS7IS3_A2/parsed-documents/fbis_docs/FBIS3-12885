An informed source said this grouping, which has been called the "Popular Resistance" [al-muqawamah al-sha'biyah], will include hundreds of politicians from all trends, lawyers, doctors, and university professors, in addition to military commanders. The group calls for renouncing violence, rejecting division, and implementing the Amman document signed last month. The source said the group will work among students and men of religion to organize popular resistance to face the possibility of war in the country. Last Thursday, Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid called on Yemenis to wage a peaceful struggle to implement the Amman document.
