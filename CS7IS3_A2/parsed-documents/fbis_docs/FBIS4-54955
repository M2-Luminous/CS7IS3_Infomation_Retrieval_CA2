They informed the president about the problems created by the strike as well as the demands of the strikers, who represent families evicted as a result of the construction of dams and hydropower stations. At the meeting Prime Minister Meksi stressed that the government has been and still is seriously engaged in treating all the problems of evicted families as well as their reasonable demands, despite the fact that in these demands there are some things that are financially absurd and cannot be afforded. Concerning these reasons, he is going to meet the representatives of the evicted families on Sunday. The ministers, who have established contacts with representatives of the strikers, also said that the strikers' claims constitute serious and fair demands in themselves. Minister Halili noted that upon the government's order, the Agriculture Ministry has compiled and continues to compile lists of all evicted families and, according to its decision, will present it to the government for examination by the end of May to enable the government to take concrete measures to resolve the problems of these families. President Berisha said that he has studied the petition and the demands of the evicted families, understands them quite well, and is sensitive to the created problems and the difficulties they have faced as a result of the eviction from their land and houses. Concerning yesterday's events in Kukes, he pointed out that we have to deal with two realities: First, we have to deal with several fair demands and serious difficulties of the evicted families. Thus, in case there exists any absurd and unreasonable demand, this does not mean that this factor should darken, though little, the solution of the other fair demands. Second, if two, five, or 10 elements of Enverist convictions or evil aims managed to get among the strikers and disorient them, the other reality represented by several separate extremist elements should in no way lessen the urgent interest of the government to treat the fair demands of the evicted families with priority, because these manipulators who undertake to usurp state buildings and block national roads have nothing in common with the troubles and sorrows of the evicted population. The government should have shown and must show itself to be more active in resolving their problems. It is necessary to complete the registration of these families, to identify who has received land according to the law and the ones who are left with no land, who are employed and who are not, who have received homes and who have not, and to start a program quickly to solve the problems of these evicted families and compensate them according to possibilities. I am convinced that after seeing that the government is concretely solving their problems, they will themselves understand that several demands are unacceptable and will abandon them. That is why the government and the parliament should consider the problems of the evicted with priority and in their complexity, President Berisha stated.
