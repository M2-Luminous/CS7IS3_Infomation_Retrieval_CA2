The army of the Srpska republic and UN Protection Forces are contributing toward the establishment of peace in this part of former Bosnia-Herzegovina, high military circles of the Srpska republic emphasize. Thanks to Blue Helmet interventions, the Muslims have somewhat reduced their engineering works in Sarajevo. As Serbian military circles emphasize, the 2d Corps of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army offered cooperation to the 111th Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council Tuzla, which has been increasingly escaping the control of Alija's [Izetbegovic] army. The same sources claim that Muslim-Croat clashes continue in central Bosnia and in Herzegovina. The second successive attempt to form a Croatian-Muslim alliance is only producing results in the Sava Basin. Concurrent with the activities of the regular Croatian Army from the region of (Rajevo Selo) in the Serbian Sava Basin, which directly threaten the corridor, the Muslims have been pounding Brcko and its surroundings with artillery. Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the Peoples' Assembly of the Srpska republic, commented on the efforts to open Dubrave airport near Tuzla at all costs as follows: [Begin Krajisnik recording] We have never been opposed to the opening of airports and delivery of humanitarian aid. We would not be opposed to the opening of Tuzla airport either. Of course, we would demand the opening of Banja Luka and other airports as well as various other venues of communication, and therefore, unhindered traffic. However, we suspect, that is to say, we have fairly reliable information on plans to abuse Tuzla airport in the same way Sarajevo airport has been abused, by using the lines and routes for humanitarian aid distribution to arm the Muslims. This is also the objective for Tuzla airport. If we can protect our people from the plan that some Western forces have concocted and prevent the armament of the Muslims, we will have nothing against the opening of Tuzla airport. If the superpowers nevertheless wish to open Tuzla airport we will insist on certain preconditions to eliminate this danger. They can definitely open Tuzla airport by force, which would be nothing unusual at this moment, as neither law nor justice are being observed. However, the Serbs will oppose by all means, the opening of Tuzla airport without our side's consent. [end recording]
