This is your second time to become minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. During your first term under the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] administration, I suppose you took the position that Japan would never import a single grain of rice. This time, after Japan accepted minimum market access under the Uruguay Round, the situation has changed drastically. How do you look at such a change in the situation? [Kato] Under the situation where three Diet resolutions [opposing the liberalization of the rice market] existed, the Hosokawa administration decided to accept minimum access to the rice market. I look back with profound thoughts at events in the past. [Kawabata] Let me ask you questions on specific issues. First, concerning the important issue of reviewing the food control system, different opinions have been expressed on this, and this is supposed to be discussed at the Agricultural Administration Council. The immediate question is whether the system should be revamped radically, including the possibility of abolishing the system altogether, or whether partial revision would be enough. What do you think, Mr. Kato? [Kato] I think there is an emerging national consensus that the food control system should be revamped. As to what to do with the substance of the revisions, as you just said, this is being handled by the Agricultural Administration Council, and the council is in the process of listening to the views of the various sectors. I do not think it is proper for me to say things in advance. The important thing is to think of Japan's future, and take into consideration our bitter experience in the past, while pondering how to strike a balance between the need to secure stable supplies of rice and other grains, and the need to maintain the incentive for farmers. That is how I think of the food control system. [Kawabata] However, what you are saying is very difficult to do. [Kato] Yes. It is extremely difficult, and we do not expect to achieve that easily. [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, among the consumers, many hold the opinion that they should be allowed to choose different varieties of rice freely. How will you deal with the liberalization of the distribution system? [Kato] When you look back at the "Heisei rice upheaval [Heisei kome sodo]" last February and March, there were people who clamored for the freedom of choice when foreign rice was being blended with domestic rice, and there were those who favored selling foreign and Japanese rice separately in a set. Furthermore, the people have come to know very well the taste, cooking methods, and prices of foreign rice. I think we will have to take all this into consideration when handling this problem. [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, are you basically in favor of promoting the liberalization of the distribution system? [Kato] Deregulation will benefit the people greatly. I would like to consider how to implement this in a manner suitable under the existing conditions, and in a direction that will make rice more readily available to consumers and enhance more freedom of choice. [Kawabata] Immediately after you took office, you said that correcting the price gap between foreign and Japanese rice -- the fact that compared to foreign rice, Japanese rice is extremely expensive -- is an important issue. What concrete steps will you take in this regard? [Kato] In the case of the recent emergency rice imports, there was nothing we could do. The measures taken last year to deal with the economic recession also cost a lot of money. As I said earlier, there is the problem of Japanese rice costing 300,000 yen a ton, while imported rice ranges from 40,000 to 60,000 yen a ton. Therefore, the job of the Hata administration is not only to correct the price gap between foreign and Japanese rice, but also work on the price gap for all daily necessities of the people. In this context, vigorous steps should be taken to narrow the price gap between Japan and foreign countries for agricultural, forestry, and fisheries products. I would like to manage agricultural administration in such a manner. [Kawabata] I am sure that is what you think. Do you have anything specific in mind to narrow this price gap? [Kato] Regardless of my own personal intentions, the people have come to realize keenly the price gap through the recent commotion about rice. There are various issues on which we are seeking the views of the Agricultural Administration Council in the near future that it would not be proper for me to say things in advance now. However, we should keep this problem very much in mind when dealing with agricultural administration from now on. Otherwise, a distrust of the agricultural administration may spread among the people, and this will be terrible. I would like to keep the price gap in mind as the central issue and take various measures in this regard. [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, under a minority government, I would think it will be very difficult to resolve various issues. What do you think? [Kato] That is why we will hold up high the banner of reform. The government belongs to the people, and it should serve the people. I believe precisely because we are a minority administration, if we appeal to the people directly in good faith, overcoming the boundary line between ruling and opposition parties, we will be able to open up prospects for the future. If we deal with the price gap issue and all other issues by listening to the voice of the people as the voice of heaven, I think things will turn out right. [Kawabata] Let me go back to the rice issue, along with the acceptance of minimum access in the Uruguay Round, you are supposed to compile emergency measures on agriculture and the rural areas by July. Can this work be completed by July? [Kato] Yes, I believe we will have to accomplish that. By that time, there will also be the problem of the producers' rice price. If we failed to compile the emergency measures, we will not be able to win the rice producers' and the people's understanding. I would certainly like to complete this task. [Kawabata] Thank you.
