[Begin recording] [Cayone] Noris Aguirre made this announcement after being summoned for questioning by the Senate Financial Commission. She added that a decision in this regard will be made in coming days and that Fogade's board of directors is already considering the request on the public credit law so that the Finance Ministry may obtain an approval from the Central Bank of Venezuela. Congressional financial commissions will be able to voice their opinions once an approval is granted, and the corresponding bonds will be issued. Along this line and in light of presumed resistance by certain sectors to accept the bonds, Aguirre has said Fogade has the mechanisms to place them on the market. [Aguirre] What I have heard is a verbal reference to a statement that anyone could have made, but that has not been the Banking Council's position. This view has not resulted from discussions, and whenever bonds are issued and placed on the market, Fogade will be able to place them through either the financial system, the Central Bank of Venezuela, or agents in the open market. We will talk with all sectors involved to implement this measure. [Cayone] Meanwhile, Banks Superintendent Cesareo Cadenas, whom the Senate Financial Commission has also summoned, has said that as long as funds are not made available, depositors will not be paid. [Cadenas] That matter is not for the superintendency or the Board of Interventors [word indistinct] to decide; it depends on several organizations. First, it depends on the Finance Ministry; second, the Central Bank of Venezuela; third, Congress. Interventors will be able to dispose of the funds once this is implemented. I hope that whenever they have the funds to make the payments, the programs will be ready. We will be able to announce them to the public but, rather, with the funds on hand. [Cayone] But when will you begin to pay the accounts of the [word indistinct] banks? [Cadenas] Once the public credit law is approved. [Cayone] Even though Aguirre has said the possibility of increasing the guarantees for depositors is being considered, Gustavo Roosen, commissioner for financial reforms, has insisted payments will not exceed 4 million bolivares. Roosen was also summoned for questioning in Congress regarding the deposits made by the Caracas Mayoralty into Latino Bank. [end recording]
