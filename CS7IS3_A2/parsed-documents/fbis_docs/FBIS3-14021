The steps taken by India, such as the use of closed-circuit televisions, to deal with any possible danger on that day in various cities, particularly in occupied Kashmir, indicate that the Indian authorities were driven by an unknown fear that prompted them to show off their military might and declare their desire for supremacy. The way the Kashmiri mojahedin shattered the Indian troops' tight security steps by firing volleys of missiles and rockets on Srinagar and targeting 30 military camps testifies to the fact that India, despite all its oppressive strength and repressive machinations, could not dampen the morale of the highly-spirited fighters of the independence movement in Kashmir who are fully capable of making their existence felt wherever and whenever they like. The fleeing of Indian security forces and even the adviser to the Kashmir governor in the face of the mojahedin's unrelenting barrage of missiles on Bakhshi Stadium prove that India is maintaining its hold on Kashmir only with the help of its oppressive measures. Every individual, even a child, in Kashmir detests India and aspires to get rid of its clutches. Turning Indian Republic Day into a Black Day in occupied Kashmir is in fact a message to the United Nations and a call to Western countries to ignore their selfish interests and rid the Kashmiris of Indian domination. Otherwise, the people of Kashmir will smash this yoke and chain of slavery themselves. *
