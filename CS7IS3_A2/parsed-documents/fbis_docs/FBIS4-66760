Let your eyes wander where they please (it costs nothing) but don't touch because the high prices will burn you. Prices rise daily in a wild constant climb. There is no better proof of that than a simple comparison between the prices shown here and their level by the time this newspaper reaches you. Iraqis Dislike Baqla' [beans]? As we wandered those markets in search of "Why" and "Who Is Responsible," we attempted to get to know the wholesalers whose stores were bursting with goods. We wanted to determine the reason. We began on the inside of a large store where 50-kilogram sacks were stacked at the entrance. On examining their contents, some of which were scattered on the floor, we found them to be filled with Baqla'--rotten Baqla'. The owner said: "They have spoiled after being held in storage for a long time because they are hard to sell in our markets. Iraqis do not like to eat Baqla' and I'll be forced to sell it as animal fodder." That was news to me! I must have outdated information on the Iraqi's favorite dish, which is famous among the Arabs and the rest of the world (Baqla' dishes with bread and butter, etc.). "Why don't you admit that it is the high price that keeps the citizenry from buying?" The storekeeper vehemently objected: "I sell it for 15 dinars [ID] a kilo, which is a fair price." I interrupted: "But it is sold at retail for ID25 a kilo and maybe even more!" "I did not know that." "Really?" "Maybe I knew but that is the retailer's business. I sell to both wholesalers and retailers and I don't tell what prices to charge for what they buy from me." "Is there great disparity between retail markups and yours?" He responded after a period of silence: "That is why I quit this business of selling basic foodstuffs such as rice and oils, because it costs me too much. The price of the dollar is inconstant, so I am engaged these days in trading red peppers and cereals. I make a reasonable profit from selling peppers to plants which make spices and seasonings!" At that point his partner wondered when the banks would make dollars available and said that he makes daily trips to authorized banks in order to buy dollars. We asked: "What do you want with dollars? You are now trading in cereals, which are locally produced, aren't they?" The answer was: "True, but we need dollars to facilitate our operations a bit." When the Eggs Hatch You cannot see the market floor because of the egg crates stacked on it. You practically trip on them! Most egg peddlers are women. Asked the price of a carton of eggs today, they said: "ID180. Would you like to buy one?" "Maybe when the eggs hatch, God willing!" Al-Mawsil Merchants and Price-Fixing Another fact emphasized by more than one wholesaler is that Mosul is a center of foreign trade and a depository of goods imported from Turkey and Jordan and prices are set by Mosul merchants. Naturally, we must put up with the high prices in hard currencies that Jordanian and Turkish merchants charge for their goods, especially food. The lack of alternatives forces the Iraqi merchant to pay up, and in hard currency! For example, I was told by a store owner that he travels to Mosul daily in order to buy starch and other materials. Fifty kilos of starch goes for ID4,300. That means that he pays ID86 per kilo, but starch is sold here at ID107 for a single kilo, spoilage and shipping costs notwithstanding! But retailers charge ID250 dinars per kilo. What is the big secret? Haj Khalaf Jabbar, a retailer, responds: "Not all retailers realize exorbitant profits at the expense of the citizenry. It is that patriotic feeling for the motherland's stifling economic crisis. It is true that some people seek to exploit these conditions for illicit gain, but they will inevitably fall in their own trap and be outcast by society. I realize only a small profit on what I buy from wholesalers. I have been a merchant since 1980, and I used to own a sweet shop but blockade conditions forced me to close the shop and turn to selling food such as pickles and tomato paste." "What is the price of tomato paste today?" "We buy and sell it wholesale, ID930 for a case of Allen's brand [as published], owned by Abu Jamal, and ID935 for the product of Bayt Binyah. I also sell lentils supplied by al-Haddad, a well-known wholesaler with a capital of ID10 million. A 25-kilogram sack of lentils is priced at ID1,850. I sometimes travel to al-Mawsil to bring pickles, which I sell for ID87." Wishful Thinking: Lentils for 100 Fils!! 'Ali al-Haj Hadi al-Haddad owns wholesale and retail stores. I met him at his large warehouse, which was crammed with sacks of lentils, peas, chickpeas, Baqla', etc. We learned that he has links with overseas wholesalers and that he seeks a small profit in view of the motherland's difficulties. He said: "I wish that prices would return to their natural original levels and that lentils, for example, would sell for 100 fils a kilo as they did in the eighties. I am aware of the hardships that salaried employees and retirees face in providing their families with food and clothing when prices are so exorbitant, and I try to moderate prices to the extent I can. The reason for high prices is that Jordanian and Turkish traders charge in dollars. Tomato paste, for instance, is $17.500 [as published] at a time when the domestic exchange rate of the dollar is high because of its scarcity and because its holders dictate their own price. Today, thanks to intervention by the state and by our astute leadership, we hope for a considerable change in dollar exchange rates that may help bring prices down. A sack of lentils that sold last month for ID1,500 now commands ID1,725 because demand is high in the month of Ramadan. We sell it for ID1,725. I expect a reduction in lentils' prices next month. We always sell at ID10 to ID15 below market." We asked: "But agents, meaning retailers, sell at high prices in the marketplace and the profit primarily goes to them. Do you maintain agents or outlets to sell directly to consumers and give them the benefit of such reductions in food prices?" "No, although I do sell to all--merchants as well as citizens. A retailer is supposed to be governed by his professional conscience and should not realize exorbitant profits at citizens' expense. I do sell to citizens also, and in kilos (i.e., at retail) in order that they may benefit from my reduced prices." "What do you think is the cause of these daily price escalations and fluctuations?" "Some retailers raise their prices daily depending on dollar exchange rates that day, even though the affected merchandize has not moved. They do this in order to gain at the expense of citizens. It makes no sense for prices to change daily, and that is why some merchants hoard certain goods and seek to withdraw them from the marketplace when they see that their prices are stable on foreign markets. They do this in order to realize outrageous profits, which is greed personified. A true merchant is governed primarily by his morals in order to gain a good reputation among people. He must sell existing inventory based on the prices he paid without padding those prices, even if they do go up. Quantities of essential foodstuffs sold to consumers should be limited in order to ward off hoarding for personal gain, and the same goes even for essential animal needs, in order to make them readily available at reasonable prices. A Suggestion To Help Lower Prices Merchant Khalil Hasan al-Sa'ydi owns a distribution bureau. He is the only distributor of dry yeast in Iraq and he distributes other foodstuffs as well. We asked him about the law of supply and demand--the economic theory that seems to work backwards in Iraq. The supply of any one good far exceeds demand, especially since the purchasing power of citizens keeps on diminishing. He answered me, emphasizing that the dollar, not supply and demand, rules the market and controls prices. That is the reason for escalating prices, despite weak demand. "We hope that prices come down next month, now that the state has taken control of sales of dollars and will subject it to certain controls. I suggest that the Ministry of Trade should supervise the distribution of goods imported by merchants to ward off seepage into black markets. I propose that the manifests of imported goods be submitted to the Ministry of Trade for approval, then be presented to a bank that would dispense the purchase amount in dollars. That would likely lower food prices considerably, prevent the importation of nonessential luxury goods, and conserve foreign exchange. The way it is dispensed would serve the interests of citizens and their essential needs. Oversight would ensure the goods reach consumers rather than seep to other outlets." We add our, "We wish!"
