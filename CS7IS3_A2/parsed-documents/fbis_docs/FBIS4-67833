However, until quite recently, the promised aid failed to assume a material quality, having been reduced to advisory services. In the meantime, TACIS envisages not only intellectual, but technical aid by way of equipment and spare parts to be supplied to Ukrainian nukes. As Vladimir Kolesnikov, chief specialist with the State Committee for nuclear power utilization, disclosed in an interview to UKRINFORM, by August this year three Ukrainian NPPs [nuclear power plants] (the South Ukrainian, Rivne and Zaporozhye nukes) will have been supplied German Fishner-made equipment worth $4.5 million. The equipment will improve the nuke's nuclear safety systems. Besides, experts of Spain's Unessa and Belgium's Tractebelle are working at the South Ukrainian NPP. France's Electricite de France sent its experts on a similar mission to the Rivne nuclear power plant. Both teams' aim is to enhance the plants' safety standards. Britain's AEA Technology is to start work aimed at eventual deactivation of the Chernobyl NPP's first, second and third power generating units. The Ukrainian Ministry for Chernobyl is shortly to hold international tenders for a feasibility study, which involves the Shelter project for the Chernobyl NPP's ill-fated fourth reactor. The project's financing will be TACIS-covered to the tune of 3.5 million ECU.
