Nesmeyanov, chairman of the Communists of Maritime Kray electoral bloc coordinating council, by KRASNOYE ZNAMYA correspondent Vitaliy Mogil; place and date not given: "April Is Thesis Time"] [Text] Kray communists were one of the political forces objecting to the kray administration decision to move the duma elections to the fall. Our KRASNOYE ZNAMYA correspondent met with A. Nesmeyanov, chairman of the Communists of Maritime Kray electoral bloc coordinating council. [Mogil] Anatoliy Vladimirovich, it is well known that there is no unity in the national and kray communist movement. Nevertheless, members of different parties of a communist bent are going into the elections to the kray duma and local self-rule bodies as a bloc. What has prompted them to unite? [Nesmeyanov] The stimulus for joining forces was our failure at the elections to the State Duma, when the two largest party organizations: the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and the Russian Communist Workers Party--nominated their candidates independently of one another and did not gather the needed number of votes. Now the Communists of Maritime Kray electoral bloc, in addition to the aforementioned parties, includes the kray organization of the VKPB [All-Russia Communist Party of Bolsheviks] (I do not think the abbreviation needs expansion) and the public movement in defense of V.I. Lenin. [Mogil] Is the combined force being successful? [Nesmeyanov] We think so. The stage of candidate nomination and registration has been completed successfully. Of 39 kray duma electoral districts, our candidates are registered in 21. Registering so many candidates also has served another cause. The communists have been able to break the information blockade the mass media, especially television and radio, had placed on us. Thanks to air time on radio and television set aside for candidates' appearances, we have been able to tell people about ourselves and our program. [Mogil] Tell us then about the substance of your program. [Nesmeyanov] The main goal of the communists has not changed. It is socioeconomic protection of the workers. I think that in the current situation that exists in Maritime Kray we will find voter support. Therefore, the kray administration's decision to move the elections to the fall is not at all to our benefit. [Mogil] Have you reconciled yourselves with it? [Nesmeyanov] There is not much hope that we will be listened to, but the Communists of Maritime Kray bloc sent a protest against this decision to the kray administration, State Duma, and Central Electoral Commission. As the governor's decree states, the postponement of the elections was prompted by "numerous requests from the administrations of kray cities and rayons." This violates the democratic norms of separating the executive and legislative branches of power--something the current democrats were so intent on just recently. Today all the levers of authority are concentrated in the hands of administration heads and their staff, without any effective oversight of them by the people. Such structures have the coloration of dictatorship--and not faded at that--and once again unmask the system of presidential authority, and its inability to ensure free and truly democratic elections in Russia. Overall, we firmly oppose Yeltsin's reforms and, consequently, the kray administration, which is the conduit of these reforms in Maritime Kray. The communists are always open to dialogue, however. [Mogil] Still, if we assume that the elections will be held in the fall... [Nesmeyanov] We will continue our work. At a recent meeting at which our candidates for deputy were present, they were instructed to continue the election campaign and meet with the people more.
