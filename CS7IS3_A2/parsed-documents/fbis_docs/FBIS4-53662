The daily comes out with a by-lined article entitled "Sharing the Same Destiny With the Party Is Noble Traits of Our People" on the lapse of 30 years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il assumed leadership over the party affairs. It quotes Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: "The dignified life and honour of a revolutionary lie in sharing the same destiny with the party and dying at his post of duty while fighting it out for the sake of the revolution." Noting that the imperialists have left no stone unturned in a bid to isolate and stifle the Korean-style socialism, the life and soul of the Korean people, the article says: Under such circumstances our people repose unquestioned trust in Comrade Kim Chong-il and are defending him and firmly resolved to fight with fortitude along the road indicated by the party, entrusting their destinies to the party and the leader, no matter what the others say. The noble ideological and spiritual world of the Korean people determined to share the same destiny with the party finds clear manifestation in the fact that they firmly believe in and follow their illustrious leader as the defender of their destinies, as their mental support and are vigorously struggling with an unshakable determination to defend him politically and ideologically and with their lives. In Korea today all the people firmly believe in and follow Comrade Kim Chong-il as the defender of their destinies. It is because the unshakable will to firmly believe in and follow our general had settled in their hearts that corporal Kim Chol-chin and Private 1st Class Kim Kyong-chol of the Korean People's Security Forces could fight in defence of their honour as revolutionary soldiers under the difficult circumstances in which they happened to be drifted overboard to the enemy-controlled area. The Korean people's unquestioned worship of the dear leader is so strong and invariable as they cherish through their life experience the greatness of his ideas, leadership ability and personality. A countless number of revolutionary soldiers becoming a fort and shield to firmly defend Comrade Kim Chong-il in any storm and stress and unhesitatingly laying down even their youth and lives on this road have been witnessed among the Korean people. Among them are revolutionary soldiers who plunged themselves without hesitation into a raging fire to carry away portraits of their leaders to a safe place, and heroic soldiers who laid down their precious youthful lives by covering handgrenades on the point of explosion with their bodies. The noble ideological and spiritual world of the Korean people determined to share the same destiny with the party also is clearly expressed in that they are doing their utmost to repay the deep benevolence of their leader who has brought their own destinies into full bloom. Noble traits are being displayed highly among our people; they volunteer into grand socialist construction sites, coal and ore mines and rural villages in groups, not seeking any fame or reward, in order to carry the intentions and plans of the party into effect; they faithfully perform their duties at their posts till the last moments of their lives. This clearly shows the noble spiritual world of the Korean people determined to silently devote their whole lives to the struggle for implementing the ideas and policies of their leader with one mind.
