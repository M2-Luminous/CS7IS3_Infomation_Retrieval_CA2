Summing up the results of a two-day conference of Russian consuls in the near abroad, the deputy minister even promised to cancel "far abroad" trips for Foreign Ministry staffers if they failed to work properly at consular level in the former Soviet republics. Cases of illegality in respect of the Russian-speaking population in many countries of the near abroad are common knowledge, and the consular apparatus in some of them is still modest. In Latvia alone, Russian diplomats issued 23,000 visas last year. Consular officials in Estonia processed 18,000 permits to visit Russia. And, although in some places this embassy activity brings in considerable revenue -- the visas issued by the diplomatic mission in Riga cost a total of $380,000 -- numerous restrictions prevent even part of the proceeds from being used for the apparatus' needs. As of 28 April Lithuania has followed the other two Baltic states in introducing visas for Russians. Rules are rules, but even the strictest regulations should not exclude a humane approach in relations between countries in individual, dramatic circumstances. The deputy minister said that the episode of the burial of a Russian inhabitant of Estonia, which relatives from Russia were not allowed to attend, was a situation that demeaned great Russia and Russians wherever they may live. These people did not have foreign passports and, however quickly preparations were made abroad, the Estonian authorities refused to stamp a visa on their internal documents. As a result, the relatives bade farewell to the deceased at the border bridge in Narva, and the coffin was sent back for burial on Estonian soil. Condemning the position of the authorities in a number of CIS countries vis-a-vis the Russian-speaking population, Boris Pastukhov called on consular workers to be tougher, more vigorous, and "fiercer" [zleye] in defending the rights of ethnic Russians in the near abroad.
