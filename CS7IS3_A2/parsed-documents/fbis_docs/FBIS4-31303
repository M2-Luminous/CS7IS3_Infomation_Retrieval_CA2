RUDE PRAVO learned this from well-informed circles participating in the drafting of interstate treaties with the Federal Republic of Germany. According to the RUDE PRAVO source, the planned treaty on state borders between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany contains no names of villages or cities, either. However, it has transpired from the negotiations presently under way that the problems linked to names in other planned treaties have a good chance of being resolved. For instance, in the Czech version of the treaty on limited border traffic or the intergovernmental agreement on establishing tourist routes on the state borders, only Czech names for Czech communities are to be used. This also applies to the German version, but the German equivalent would be given in brackets--for example, Cheb (Eger). According to the RUDE PRAVO source, this might be acceptable to the Czech side. Originally, the Germans pushed for a solution according to which the Czech villages would be given German names established under the influence of the German historical settlement in Czech border regions. They wanted the Czech names of the villages to be given only in brackets. The Czech side has rejected this demand.
