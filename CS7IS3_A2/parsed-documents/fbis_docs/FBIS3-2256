During a joint press conference with visiting Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, Clinton said Washington was inclined to consider sending U.N. peacekeepers to Georgia. He praised the contributions to the "peaceful end to the Cold War" made by Shevardnadze, who had been foreign minister of the now- defunct Soviet Union. "I reaffirmed in very strong terms America's support for the independence, the sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of georgia," Clinton said. He said the United States would be inclined to support a U.N. peacekeeping operation in Georgia's Abkhazia region if the government and the rebels there can achieve success in their talks and maintain an effective cease-fire. A possible U.N. peacekeeping presence in Georgia would need U.S. funding but not U.S. military units. Shevardnadze, arrived here Sunday night [6 March], will be meeting with congressional leaders tomorrow.
