The pact under the Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks, completed December 15, calls for the creation of a more powerful world trade watchdog by July 1, 1995. But its establishment has been quickened at the request of the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The United States and Canada have already accepted the request, while the European Union has indicated its approval. Japan has not lodged any objections to the idea. The sources said the only uncertainty remains over the timing of the body's creation, despite the agreement between the four groups, because each of over 100 participating parties needs to ratify the proposal. Also at the four-way talks, the U.S. urged Japan to reopen negotiations on proposals to scrap or reduce tariffs on four items. The sources said Japan resisted U.S. pressure, citing the tariff problems already resolved at the Uruguay round of talks. But they said the U.S. is likely to restate its point when U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor arrives in Tokyo for trade talks Tuesday. The U.S. has proposed ending tariffs on wood products, copper and white liquor and a tariff cut for leather products.
