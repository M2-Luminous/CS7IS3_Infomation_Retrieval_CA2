FR940921-1-00009 FR940921-1-00003 Maine's Chapter 137 requires the owner or operator of any facility meeting the applicability requirements in section 1 of chapter 137 to submit an emission statement to the Department on an annual basis. The emission statement must be submitted no later than July 1 for the previous calendar year, beginning no later than July 1, 1994 for the calendar year 1993. EPA is proposing to approve this submittal date since the Emission Statement Workgroup is proposing to require States to submit emission statement data to AIRS by November 15 rather than July 1. Maine will have sufficient time to submit data to AIRS by November 15 if sources submit emission statements by July 1. Chapter 137 also includes a list of data elements required by the sources and the demand for certification of the data's accuracy. Rhode Island's section 14.3.1 requires facilities to submit emission statements to the Director within 45 days of the end of the calendar year. Emission statements shall be submitted for the calendar year 1992 and for every year thereafter. Rhode Island requires each facility subject to section 14.3.1 to submit an emission statement in a format approved by the Director which contains all data elements described above and certification that the information contained in the emission statement is accurate. Vermont's rule, section 5&hyph;803, requires sources to submit to the Air Pollution Control Officer source emissions data and other information on or before February 1 of each year. Certification of the data is required. 5. Reporting Forms Although EPA has developed a proposed format for the emission statement reporting process in its guidance document, the Act allows States to develop their own format for emission statement reporting. Connecticut, Maine, and Vermont provide the sources with emission statement forms. Connecticut and Vermont included the forms with their SIP submittals. Rhode Island does not provide sources with an emission statement form; each facility subject to emission statement requirements must submit an emission statement in a format approved by the Director. III. Proposed Action EPA has evaluated the States submittals for consistency with the Clean Air Act, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. EPA has determined that the proposed rules meet the Clean Air Act's requirements and is proposing approval of the following rules under section 110(k)(3): Connecticut's section 22a&hyph;174&hyph;4(c)(1), ``Recordkeeping and Reporting;'' Rhode Island's regulation Number 14 entitled ``Record Keeping and Reporting;'' Vermont's rule entitled ``Registration of Air Contaminant Sources,'' Sections 5&hyph;801 through 5&hyph;806; Maine's Chapter 137, ``Emission Statements'' and amendments to Chapter 100, ``Definitions;'' and the SIP narrative revisions of Connecticut entitled ``Revision to State Implementation Plan for Air Quality Emission Statements,'' and Vermont entitled ``State of Vermont Air Quality Implementation Plan, February 1993.'' Based upon EPA's evaluation of Connecticut's and Rhode Island's January 12, 1993 submittals, Vermont's August 9, 1993 submittal, and Maine's January 3, 1994 submittal, EPA is proposing to approve the emission statement submissions as revisions to the ozone SIP. IV. Request for Public Comments Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revisions and on EPA's proposal to approve. Public comments received by October 21, 1994, will be considered in the development of EPA's final rulemaking action. V. Administrative Requirements A. Executive Order (EO) 12866 This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989. 54 FR 2214&hyph;2225. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions, 54 FR 2222, from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. US EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on US EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. B. Regulatory Flexibility Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2).
