Early in the morning three people died at Sadakhlo Station on the Armenian border when a bomb planted under a Tbilisi-Yerevan passenger train exploded, and a few hours later an explosion rang out at the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA editorial building, which also houses the IZVESTIYA office. This time fortunately there were no casualties, but I would like to go into this in a bit more detail. Toward around 1300 hours, when a procession of excited supporters of ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia was moving down Rustaveli Boulevard, Besik Tskhoroguzli, a colleague of mine from SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA, and I decided to watch the demonstration from his office balcony, which directly overlooked the boulevard. About 10-15 minutes later when the crowd of demonstrators had almost passed our observation post we heard the creak of a door opening and almost immediately a sound like the crack of a starting pistol. We immediately dashed into the room but at that moment we were deafened by a powerful explosion. We were thrown back onto the balcony by the force of the blast and covered with fragments of glass. When we came to our senses some time later and went into the room thick smoke was pouring from a sofa by the entrance to the balcony and plaster was falling from the ceiling. Police and security personnel appeared on the scene in a matter of minutes. The surprise came later. On arrival the officers feverishly inspected the room but, instead of taking any action to seal off the exits from the building, began hysterically cross-examining us while we were still in a state of shock from the explosion. And each of them, moreover, confidently came up with his own version of events without taking any notice of our testimony. It was only at the end a few hours later, when Georgiy Shalutashvili, an investigator from the security service's investigation department, who listened to us fairly attentively, took over the case, that he said. "You were lucky, had the grenade not landed on the sofa you would have been done for."
