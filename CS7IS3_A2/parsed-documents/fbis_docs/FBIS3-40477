With regard to information control, while stating that ``cautious handling is needed'' from the viewpoint of protection of nuclear materials, it advocates ``as much openness as possible,'' and maintains that ``excessive non-disclosure in the name of protecting information that is sensitive for reasons of protection of nuclear materials, nuclear non-proliferation, and protection of property rights should be avoided.'' The immediate reason why the White Paper makes a big issue of information disclosure is because United Socialist Democratic Party representative Satsuki Eda, who was appointed STA director general with the changeover in government, favors openness of information. The working level white paper draft did not cite openness of information in great detail, but on instructions from the director general, phrasing was changed substantially, such as by the addition of an independent paragraph on this issue. A great debate arose over openness of information in the nuclear energy field because the authorities declared that most information relating to the transporting of plutonium from France by the transport vessel Akatsuki-Maru, which took place from November 1992 to January 1993, was secret due to the need to protect nuclear materials. Moreover, in connection with the safety of nuclear fuel recycling facilities, anti-nuclear groups are vociferous about openness of design information. Although Director General Eda says, ``I have instructed working level authorities to study what additional information can be disclosed,'' the propensity to take a wary attitude about openness of information is deep-rooted at the facilities themselves, and there are many uncertainties about what the content of that additional information will be. With progress in the development of nuclear fuel recycling, the need to provide information to other countries also will increase. At the time of the plutonium transport by the Akatsuki-Maru, there was marked increase in international interest about Japan's plutonium use policy as well. The White Paper states that ``Provision of information internationally is extremely important'' in order to gain international understanding and cooperation for Japan's policies. STA leaders stress that ``Basically, the United States is uncomfortable with the idea of commercial use of plutonium, and Japan needs to send messages constantly about its nuclear non-proliferation efforts.'' The idea of creating a new forum for nuclear energy cooperation with Asian countries and to seek their understanding for Japan's policies also is being studied. There is criticism that the work of reviewing the long-term plan for development and use of nuclear energy, which is in full-swing, is being carried out mostly through studies by nuclear experts and is not necessarily an open debate. These are individual arguments about what information should be disclosed, and this white paper may be the beginning of that process.
