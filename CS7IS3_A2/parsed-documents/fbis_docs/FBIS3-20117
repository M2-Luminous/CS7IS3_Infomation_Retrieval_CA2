It would seem that it was the Greek presidency that, in the nocturnal negotiations with Sweden earlier this month, made the mistake by forgetting to consult Denmark before Sweden was allowed to increase its cod quota in the Baltic Sea from 35 to 40 percent. Danish diplomatic circles reject the notion that the error could be on the Danish side. The Danes saw no document that quoted the figure of 40 percent, and they had therefore only approved an offer of 35 percent, the diplomats say. The result of yesterday's discussions in the Council of Ministers was that the Council has committed itself to buying fishing rights in the Baltic from other countries -- the Baltic countries and Russia, for example -- corresponding to what has been lost by Bornholm's fishermen because of the concessions to Sweden. "With this agreement we have protected Bornholm's fishermen's interests, and I view this as an important result," Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal Party) said yesterday evening. "An error had unfortunately occurred, and I do not know precisely how this happened."
