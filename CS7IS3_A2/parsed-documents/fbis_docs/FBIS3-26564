Official sources say the share-holding system's vigorous development in 1993 was prompted by deepening economic reform. Of the total, the share-holding companies limited accounted for 2,968; the liability limited companies made up 6,472; and there were 1,776 other firms who also issued shares to their employees but not officially considered share-holding companies. According to the China Securities Regulatory Commission, at least 13,000 companies have taken up the share-holding system. By the end of 1993, 122 companies had been successfully listed at securities exchanges, with their gross capital stock registered at 208.6 billion yuan ($24.3 billion). Meanwhile, China also saw its six biggest enterprises listed on international securities exchanges. Analysts say central government was initially successful in developing the securities market and strengthening people's investment sense. Official figures show China now has at least 51 securities underwriting institutions. It also has more than 25 million share-holders. The Shanghai Securities Exchange in East China and the Shenzhen Securities Exchange in South China have already become the barometer of the latest developments in the country's share-holding system. More than 123 share issues were traded at the Shanghai Securities Exchange last year. Of which, there were 101 A share issues and 22 B share issues. And the Shenzhen Securities Exchange handled transactions of at least 92 issues, 79 per cent which were A shares. Official figures also show that in 1993 A share transactions totalled 13.27 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion). Meanwhile, the gross market value of the traded B shares amounted to 77.3 billion yuan ($8.89 billion) in foreign exchange. In 1993, computerized Securities Trading Automated Quotations System (Staq) also played a role in developing corporate bonds. There were 17 corporate bonds listed last year. Of which, 58 per cent were traded under the Staq system, while the country's National Electronic Trading System (Net) handled the rest of the corporate bond trade. The total transaction value of the corporate bonds through these computerized systems in China reached more than 7.5 billion yuan ($872 million) in 1993.
