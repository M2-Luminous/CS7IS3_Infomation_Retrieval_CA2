Chernomyrdin told journalists after the meeting that he was pleased with its results and intended to meet Camdessus again Friday and Saturday. "Meanwhile the experts will do their bit," he said. He added that IMF experts wanted to have a better insight into the Russian economy. Valeriy Grishin, first deputy director of the government's press service, told INTERFAX that IMF officials were troubled by the recent remarks made by the Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who doubted the indices mentioned in the budget draft. Zhirinovskiy accused the cabinet of promising unduly high revenues and unduly low spending. Grishin said that Chernomyrdin had asked the IMF delegation directly if the IMF was willing to help Russia and added that the Russian government did not depend on the Fund's support for its success. Grishin recalled that the Russian cabinet had met the conditions made by the IMF earlier by holding monthly inflation below the 16 to 18 percent mark. According to Grishin, the IMF officials had admitted this. Now the IMF wanted to verify the budget indices, thus making a new condition. Grishin said that the Western experts and their Russian colleagues would be given this opportunity. Camdessus will also meet with Russian Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin Friday.
