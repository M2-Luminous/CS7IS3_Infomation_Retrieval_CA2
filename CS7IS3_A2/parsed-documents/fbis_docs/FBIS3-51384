For the first time an administrative mechanism has been created that allows cooperation and coordination between central and regional governments. The value-added tax [VAT] and its application also became a leading topic of discussion at the meeting. [Begin recording] [Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz] We demand what the Constitution stipulates. The Constitution says that all taxes must have a common characteristic; that is, they must be progressive and fair. In other words, people who earn more should pay more taxes; those who earn less should pay less; and those who have nothing should pay nothing. That is fair. The VAT taxes everyone equally. People who earn more pay the same as those who earn nothing. This policy has critical consequences because the Venezuelan Constitution still stresses the role of the state by noting that the state has responsibilities toward the citizens and that the citizens have basic rights. [Maracaibo Mayor Fernando Chumaceiro] The process of administrative decentralization, which basically had been a transfer of power from the central government to the state governments, has been expanded. This is positive progress, but it is insufficient. Full decentralization takes place once decentralization reaches municipal levels, and then from municipal levels to parochial levels.
