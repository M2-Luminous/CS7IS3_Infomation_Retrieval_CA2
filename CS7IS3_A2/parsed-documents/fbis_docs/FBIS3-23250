These included Jamal-al-Din Farghali, commander of the Islamic Group's military wing in Upper Egypt; Muhammad al-'Abbasi; Husayn Mahmud; and 10 other group leaders. AL-AHALI has obtained information proving that among the 12,000 employees of these private security firms, 400 are police officers who receive monthly salaries ranging from 3,000 to 7,000 pounds and 1,500 are Islamic groups' members who were formerly in Afghanistan. The Egyptian Afghans were employed on the recommendation of Gulf princes who are major shareholders in these security firms. According to our information, 87 of these Egyptian Afghans have participated in terrorist operations since 1989. The reports also say that many Arab figures suspected of links to Egypt's terrorist groups own shares in these firms valued at more than $5 million. The list of shareholders includes 'Abd-al-Rahman Ladin's three sons. These are Usamah Bin-Ladin, who founded a "base" as a way station for al-Jihad leaders who formerly traveled to Afghanistan from Saudi Arabia, and his brothers Badr and Tariq. Usamah Bin-Ladin visited Egypt prior to the execution of several major terrorist operations. The three brothers' shares in one private security firm are worth $1.2 million. Other shareholders include Zayd al-Mutawakkil from Yemen who owns shares worth $250,000. Reports link him to training camps for Arab Afghans in Yemen's Sa'dah District. Two United Arab Emirates nationals, Fahd al-Qasim who owns shares worth $350,000 and Sultan Bin-al-Muhyi who has $300,000 worth of shares, have connections with government circles in Tehran. The list of shareholders goes on: Hasan Fanjanri ($500,000), Muhammad Ahmad Hasan ($400,000), Al-Mahdi Bin-Ibrahim Sultan ($350,000), Nimr-al-Ward Zaki ($300,000), al-'Aris Bin-al-Majdawi ($250,000), Fathi al-Fadl ($250,000), Zakariya al-'Urabi ($200,000), Ahmad Bin-'Abd-al-Muta'ali al-Husayni ($200,000), 'Abd-al-Rahim al- Mu'izz ($150,000), Bandar al-Shihabi ($150,000), and Shaykh 'Abd-al- 'Aziz al-Fadl (250,000 Egyptian pounds). These security firms prepared 2,400 dossiers containing important data about Egyptian public figures, including the official's position, address, telephone numbers at home and work, and the names and abilities of his bodyguards. Also included were the routes followed by the motorcades of senior officials and the places they frequently visited, in addition to data on their wives and children. Some private security firms were thus a major link in the chain and supplied information and detailed maps of the movements of senior officials who were the target of terrorist operations in recent years. According to information obtained by a major government department, the terrorist groups sought to penetrate the country's security agencies by offering private security jobs to senior security officials. They aimed to establish a "parallel" Interior Ministry but with objectives different from those of the real ministry. Based on this information, Major General Hasan al-Alfi decided soon after he became interior minister and prior to the unsuccessful attempt on his life, to rescind the private security firms' licenses. He asked security officials employed by them to leave those private jobs.
