Then Pay Up!"] [Text] The Moscow government has issued a decree "On the Taxation of Citizens Coming To Live in Moscow." The authorities have decided to take this step on the basis of the following fact (and, as we know, facts are stubborn things): Thousands of new arrivals who have bought themselves Moscow accommodations in recent years are, one way or another, living in the capital without a permit. The situation clearly cannot be rectified by countermeasures in the old "Stalinist" spirit, and that is obvious to everyone. City Mayor Yu. Luzhkov tilted the balance in favor of a civilized approach by ratifying a procedure for examining questions of the registration of foreign citizens in housing space which belongs to them on the basis of ownership rights. Now, as of 1 June, it is planned to introduce this type of tax for people arriving from regions of the Russian Federation (with the exception of Moscow Oblast) and from foreign countries near and far to live permanently in Moscow. According to the document, the money paid by people coming from other cities will go into compensating expenditure on Muscovites' material and consumer facilities and other items of expenditure. The Moscow government has determined three categories of taxpayer: Russian Federation citizens; citizens of CIS countries; and foreign citizens and people with no citizenship. Correspondingly, there are three rates of taxation: an amount equivalent to 500 times the monthly minimum wage established by the Russian Federation law for Russian Federation citizens; 1,000 times for CIS citizens; and 2,500 times for foreigners and people without citizenship. However, the authorities have not ruled out the right to fix a preferential taxation rate. Only the Moscow government commission for housing questions, permits, and discharges can grant this right -- if there are valid reasons. A "new-fledged Muscovite" will have to pay the taxes on his own initiative, via banking or any other Moscow credit institutions. One small thing is lacking: The Moscow City Duma has yet to give the go-ahead for the imposition of the tax as of 1 June or ratify the Moscow City draft law "On a Targeted Tax for Compensating City Budget Expenditure on the Development of the City's Infrastructure and Provision for Social and Living Conditions of Citizens Coming to Moscow City." What does the draft law deal with? The owner of housing space (individual) and members of his family with whom he (they) has been registered before arriving in Moscow will receive the right of registration in Moscow (permit). At the same time, the housing space acquired as property must be located in buildings which are not subject to evacuation in connection with demolition or reconstruction, and must correspond to the established housing standard of at least 9 square meters of housing space for each member of a family. Incidentally, the payment of the city tax for the right of registration (permit) in Moscow does not entail any commitments on the part of the municipal housing department or other housing organs in terms of the allocation of housing space to people who come from other cities.
