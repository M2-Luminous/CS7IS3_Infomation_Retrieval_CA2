But all signs indicate that the move was only a pretext which the prime minister decided to use after a series of incompetent and demagogic statements by politicians who were not just attacking (out of ignorance or out of hostility) this specific case of privatization and the stock market, but who also tried at the same time to bring into question the legacy of the economic transformations of the last four years. There are signs that we have indeed the case of a pretext here: There was just one sentence contained in a communique issued by the Government's Press Office--namely that Kawalec's dismissal "is not directly linked with Bank Slaski's privatization." It seems that a fundamental goal of dismissing Deputy Finance Minister Kawalec--which was accomplished behind the back of his direct supervisor, that is to say Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance minister--was to weaken the Finance Ministry's leadership which--contrary to earlier predictions--proved resistant to political pressures aiming at basic revisions to the economic policy. A draft of a savings-oriented budget for this year prepared by a team headed by Deputy Prime Minister Borowski was not applauded, even by people outside the Democratic Left Alliance. Those who were most disappointed were Sejm deputies for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], who had demanded significant increases in agricultural expenditures. But the Finance Ministry is not willing to compromise as far as their policies go, so faced with that, the PSL members in the coalition decided to use instruments of political pressure--Deputy Minister Kawalec has so far been the only victim of the scheme, but all signs indicate that the goal was to eliminate someone above him. The dismissal of Deputy Minister Kawalec--who was one of the last remaining associates of Leszek Balcerowicz in government now--most probably will not cause a major crisis inside the governing coalition. But the manner in which it was accomplished--that is to say, ignoring tradition-based procedures--is proof of PSL's strong determination to disintegrate the framework of a modern market economy which has already been established, and that is happening in the name of selfish interests by just one social group. Disadvantageous changes which are happening in the economy--rising inflation, compensatory prices, and a slowdown in privatization, among others--are proof that the disintegration is already taking place. The process can now be speeded up.
