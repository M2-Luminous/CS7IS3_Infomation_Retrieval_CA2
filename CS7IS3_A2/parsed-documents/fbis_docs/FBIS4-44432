FBIS4-44432 "jpcar036___94036" JPRS-CAR-94-036 JPRS China 7 April 1994 SOCIAL More Teachers Owe Back Wages, Leave Profession More Teachers Owe Back Wages, Leave Profession 94CM0296B Shanghai MINZHU YU FAZHI in Chinese No 177, 7 Apr 94 pp 21-24 94CM0296B Shanghai MINZHU YU FAZHI Chinese CSO [Article by Zhou Xiang (5297 5046): "Increasing Numbers of Teachers, Owed Back Wages, Leave Their Profession"] [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] On 23 December 1992 GUANGMING RIBAO gave front-wage headline treatment to an article entitled "Save the Teachers, Save the Children." According to the article, Yilong County in Sichuan, the hometown of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De [2612 1795], was seven months behind in its payment to more than 7,000 teachers who were owed a total of 7 million yuan, forcing them to survive on help from friends and relatives. Japan's ASAHI SHIMBUN picked up the story and spread it around the world in a report entitled "China Would Rather Build Factories than Schools." People overseas were shocked while everybody at home from top to bottom was stunned. Has it occurred to anybody that what is happening in Yilong County is also taking place in more than half of China to varying extents? This hot topic shook up every social quarter. Descriptions of the teachers' plight prove that these belated news stories are absolutely no fabrication. -- According to surveys by Hebei on the province's 130 counties and municipalities, 75 of them have fallen behind in their wage payment to teachers, owing the latter 79.2 million yuan in all. -- As of 19 May 1993, almost 80,000 teachers in 9 municipalities, 24 counties (prefectures), and 465 townships in Liaoning Province were owed 78.51 million yuan in back wages. Many people have not received a single paycheck several months in a row. -- Of the 83 counties in Guangxi Autonomous Region, 70 have not been paying their teachers on time. The amount of unpaid wages exceeded 80 million yuan between last year and the first half of this year and reached almost 100 million yuan if you go back several years. In one province teachers were owed a whopping 44.51 million yuan in unpaid wages. At one point they did not receive a single dime for a record 6 months. Owing to wage adjustments and because they were given more senior-level responsibilities, some teachers were due to receive wage increases retroactively. However, the actual payment has been delayed, in some cases as long as six years. Province-wide, 18,000 public-school teachers have been affected by the late payments, each owed more than 1,800 yuan on average. Also owed back wages are 25,000 private-school teachers, each owed about 472 yuan in subsidies on the average. Nationwide, elementary and high school teachers are owed 1.4 billion yuan in back wages. Never before in the history of the PRC has the nation owed so many teachers so much money for so long with such serious effects. The legitimate rights and interests of teachers have been severely violated and the prestige of the party and the government has eroded. Among the 12 major professions in society, wages in the teaching profession are already the second lowest. The profession cannot even keep its ninth ranking. Meanwhile, according to reports in ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO, administrative units above the county level nationwide had approved the spending of 14.5 billion yuan to purchase small cars by the first half of 1993. In Sichuan, they gave a villa valued at 1 million yuan to a movie actor as a gift but have fallen behind in their payment of teachers' wages, owing the latter almost 100 million yuan. Liaoning has spent as much as 1.3 billion yuan to buy sedans but keeps falling into arrears when it comes to paying its teachers. [passage omitted] Where have the educational funds gone? Where have the teachers' wages gone? Year after year education makes its way to the top of every government's agenda. Year after year people's congresses at all levels boost educational spending in the budget. Year after year education and teachers find themselves in dire financial straits. [passage omitted] LIAOWANG, the weekly magazine, devoted its fourth issue this year to a special report on this topic. Comrade Yang Chunmao [2799 2504 5399], personnel chief of the State Education Commission, expressed deep concern about the loss of teachers nationwide in a piece titled "The Foundation of Basic Education Is Being Undermined." One cause of concern is the rising number of teachers leaving the profession each year, the overwhelming majority of them under 45 years of age. Of the 2,300 teachers in Shanghai who left the profession in 1993, 1,600, or 69 percent, were younger than 35 years old. A high 86.3 percent of the teachers in Tianjin who switched jobs were under 40 years of age. The second concern is that the problem tends to hit some areas and schools particularly hard. For the areas and schools affected, the result is nothing short of catastrophic. The exodus of teachers en masse is only part of the problem. Equally serious are the destabilizing effects their departure has on the ranks of the teaching profession. When the teaching force is demoralized, building up its ranks in the future becomes a daunting task. When teachers' training institutions of all types have trouble recruiting students, the quality of basic education will suffer directly. As they say, "Without the skin, what can the hair cling to?" Nationwide the demand for elementary and high school teachers generally shows an upward trend. In contrast teachers' training institutions, which produce teachers, are in decline in both their strength and their scale of development. In 1992, a banner year for institutions of higher education of all types, recruitments by general teachers' training colleges fell from 296,400 a year ago to 276,100. Recruitments by teachers' training secondary schools also slipped, from 299,300 to 278,900, including the large number of students recruited by teachers' training schools who do not major in education. Under State Education Commission regulations, elementary and high school teachers must possess the appropriate academic qualifications. Specifically, senior high school teachers must be graduates of teachers' training colleges who have majored in education, while teachers at the junior high school and elementary school levels must be college graduates and graduates of special secondary schools, respectively. A teacher who entered the profession having gone through neither of these two routes is considered unqualified. However, he can qualify by passing an examination and earning a certificate. According to knowledgeable individuals in the teachers' training office under the State Education Commission, there were 8.66 million elementary and high school teachers in China as of late 1992. On average 53.7 percent of senior high school teachers were qualified, as were 60.2 percent of junior high school teachers and 90.6 percent of elementary school teachers. The average pass rate among elementary and high school teachers was 68.2 percent. In addition, the fact that knowledge becomes obsolete and teaching methods go out of date, along with other ills, is increasingly affecting the quality of the targets of education and widening the gap between education and practical needs. President Zhang Yiwei [1728 0001 0251] of Petroleum University appealed to society at large to make investment in education a top priority. He said, "Our educational spending to date has not even reached the level of middle-ranking developing nations. These days people say that since we are trying to put together a market economy, inevitably education would take a beating. The fact of the matter is that the more we want a market economy, the greater the need to take education seriously. Certainly education itself needs to be reformed, but that will take time. Everything else can be imported; the only thing that cannot be imported is the quality of the people. We can only work to nurture it on this piece of land. This is such a basic point. If we ignore education, the result will be a poorly educated populace, which in turn will have adverse effects on material construction. Modernization is impossible without a high-caliber people." People have always found this "besieged city" phenomenon most puzzling. Everybody knows that intellectuals have meager financial resources. Yet every parent works his guts out to provide an education for his children, hoping that they would grow up to be intellectuals. The individual householder may be awash in banknotes, but he pledges to his soul he would send his son to college. Don't you feel that this is historical progress of sorts, a road history must travel? Who will be the teachers in 21st-century China? In a certain sense, China's prosperity today and its rise or fall tomorrow ride on the answer. [passage omitted]
