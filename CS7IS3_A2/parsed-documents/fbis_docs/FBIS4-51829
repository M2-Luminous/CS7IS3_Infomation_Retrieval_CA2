Kozo Watanabe, former minister of international trade and industry and a Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] executive, rejected a call from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], however, to disband the 130-legislator parliamentary bloc, Kaishin (Innovation), in the House of Representatives as a prerequisite for its return to the alliance. "I have pushed at every occasion the proposal by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to create a unified parliamentary force from within the governing coalition," Watanabe said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. "The proposal has been accomplished at a faster-than-expected pace thanks to the prodding by (Democratic Socialist Party) Chairman Keigo Ouchi," he said, in an apparent reference to Ouchi's surprise appeal April 25 to speed up the formation of the parliamentary bloc. The appeal -- issued shortly after the nomination of Tsutomu Hata as the new premier -- prompted the DSP, Shinseito, Japan New Party, Liberal Party and the Kaikaku-no-kai [Reform Group] to form the unified Diet bloc Kaishin by the end of the day. The establishment of the grouping enraged the SDP, which subsequently announced its withdrawal from the coalition, rendering the Hata administration to a fragile minority government vulnerable to a possible tabling of a nonconfidence motion from the opposition. Watanabe dismissed the SDP's allegation that the Shinseito-led conservative mainstream "betrayed" the socialists in a bid to force the SDP to compromise its ideological and policy differences with the rest of the coalition. "The allegation that we waged a sneak assault (on the socialists) is unfounded," he said in the interview before his departure for Myanmar [Burma]. Watanabe appealed to the SDP to return to the alliance, saying, "It is crucial for us to soften the Social Democratic Party's emotional antagonism toward us... and lead them to support the current administration." The former Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] member also said the coalition will try to garner support from the LDP for its proposal to raise the consumption tax from the current 3 percent. "Discussion on the tax system should be conducted for the sake of this nation, apart from the interests of each political party, so it is important to seek the endorsement of the LDP," he said. The coalition has asserted that a consumption tax hike is indispensable to enable the national treasury to extend this year's income tax cuts beyond one term.
