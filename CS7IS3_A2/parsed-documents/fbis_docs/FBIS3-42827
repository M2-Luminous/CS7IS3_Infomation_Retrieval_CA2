Nadein-Rayevskiy: "Russia and the Central Asian States: Chances of Integration"] [Text] Tendencies toward integration and separation can be seen in Russia's relations with the new states of Central Asia. The former tendencies were submerged in the atmosphere of euphoria in the sovereign entities after the collapse of the USSR, but common interests have been having an increasingly strong impact since that time. Mutual interests in the spheres of economics, defense, security, and the protection of the external borders of the CIS have the greatest integrating potential. The factors contributing to separation include the view of national statehood as the extreme form of isolation, the search for new partners and "patrons" supposedly capable of solving internal problems in the new independent republics, and detachment from former "union relatives" in an attempt to maintain the authority of the old elite. Enough has already been said about the economy as one of the major spheres of integration, and for this reason I will be discussing other uniting factors. The first of these is the defense sphere. Russia certainly does not want its "soft underbelly" to turn into a zone of confrontations and local wars. The Russians are still not accustomed to seeing the strictly Russian borders as their own boundaries. They are still thinking in terms of the union. Furthermore, they are not the only ones: This is also true of much of the population of Central Asia and Kazakhstan. The presence of external dangers, particularly from Afghanistan and Iran, probably will be acknowledged in the near future. Security issues have also required a reassessment. Russia does not have to guard against attacks by the traditional enemies of the Russian empire and the USSR. Its "central" location in Eurasia separates it from Europe by two buffer zones: the territory of the former republics of the USSR and the territory of the former socialist countries. These zones are a more than adequate guarantee against any potential Western threat to Russia. This double safety zone is also completely adequate for Russia in the event of conventional warfare. The USSR's longtime adversary--the United States--is dangerous only in the event of a global conflict, which seems virtually impossible at this time, particularly in view of the signed nuclear arms reduction treaties. Russia's longest border is with China, and China can certainly be seen as a potential threat in some respects. The Chinese leadership once tried to lay claim to 1.54 million square kilometers of Soviet territory that is now part of Russia and Kazakhstan, but no demands of this kind have been made in recent years. China was given several hundred islands on the Amur River after successful negotiations to settle these disputes. There are no problems on the Russian-Korean and Russian-Mongolian borders, and Norway and Finland have not made any official territorial claims either. The potential threat could come from our former associates in the empire, particularly if extremist, nationalist, or religious-nationalist groups should rise to a position of power there, especially now that some representatives of social movements in the Central Asian states have already made territorial claims on Russia. This is why Russia has an interest in preserving the stability of moderate political regimes that can maintain smooth interstate relations and encourage integration processes within the CIS framework. In view of current objective circumstances, Russia should not be the only one concerned about the security of external borders. The Central Asian states have an equal interest in this matter. Completely obvious sources of potential danger exist on their southern borders. Above all, they include Iran, which has exported revolution in the past, although the people of Iran are no longer inclined to give all of the expansionist ambitions of their leadership unconditional support. They also include Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a civil war that is gradually acquiring the features of an inter-ethnic and inter-religious conflict. Tajiks and Uzbeks live on both sides of the border of the former USSR, and there are several million of them in Afghanistan. Ahmad-shah Masoud, the acknowledged leader of the Afghan Dari (Tajiks), has effectively set up his own state in the north of Afghanistan, while the unified state in Tajikistan is still only in the formative stage. The possibility of expansionist ambitions on the part of some leaders of ethnic communities in Afghanistan cannot be excluded. Although Tajikistan is far away from Russia and does not have any common borders with it, Russian military units were nevertheless drawn into the internal conflict there during the civil war in that republic. Furthermore, the destabilization of Tajikistan could disrupt the balance of power in the whole region and jeopardize Russia's economic and political interests. The situation in Turkmenistan, with its clearly defined populist policy line, is more stable. The republic leadership, headed by "Turkmen-bashi" ("Turkmen leader") Saparmurad Niyazov, has a good chance of maintaining economic and, consequently, social stability because of the republic's large supplies of natural gas. In turn, social stability probably will allow the authoritarian regime to retain strict control over all other spheres of life in the state for a fairly long time. The regime in Uzbekistan is more or less stable. President Islam Karimov has provided hundreds of thousands of families with land and low-income strata with stronger social guarantees, which has allowed him to take a hard line in relations with the opposition without any fear of mass demonstrations in support of the opposition. When I. Karimov says: "Our people are not ready for democracy," he is probably right in many respects, although this position cannot appeal to the Russian leadership. There is a regrettable tendency toward the ideologization of interstate relations in Russian foreign policy. Their development occasionally depends on feelings of sympathy or antipathy for a particular regime, political order, or political figure. I feel that this tendency could endanger Russia's national interests, which consist primarily in the maintenance of stability on its borders and in the region as a whole. Complex problems in Russia's relations with the Central Asian states are connected with the Russian and Russian-speaking population in the region. Kazakhstan has the largest Russian community--6.2 million people. There were 1.6 million Russians living in Uzbekistan in 1989 (now the number is lower), and there were more than 900,000 in Kirghizia, over 300,000 in Turkmenia, and approximately the same number in Tajikistan. This factor could contribute to integration and separation in Russia's relations with the countries of the region. Before the revolution the Russian population lived mainly in the cities serving as administrative centers of the empire and reached a high level of assimilation there. The level of integration was much lower for the new settlers of the Soviet period. In addition to the construction workers and skilled laborers who moved there during the period of industrialization, there were also former convicts, who were forbidden to live in Russia's big cities, and people with no definite social status. The behavior and lifestyle of these last two groups did not contribute to friendly relations between the Russians and the native population and strengthened tendencies toward separation. On the other hand, Russians play the key role in industrial production in the region, and their departure will lead unavoidably to a recession in industry and even to the closure of enterprises. The leaders of the Central Asian republics are trying to stop, or at least stem, the process of emigration, while nationalist movements are doing the opposite--encouraging it in every way possible. Unfortunately, the activities of the latter have been much more effective, because governments operate on the macrolevel while nationalists can influence individuals. Threatening letters and telephone calls, physical assaults, property damage, and other such actions have a greater impact than official assurances of commitment to human rights and liberties. The emigrants from the Central Asian region in Russia are more likely to play a separating role. Millions of refugees could change public opinion in Russia dramatically, directing it into the channels of negative feelings about the CIS. Developments of this type, which are already apparent in several regions, include the anti-Armenian demonstrations in Stavropol and the anti-Caucasus feelings in large Russian cities (although they are of a different nature). More and more people are beginning to feel that Russia should "withdraw" from Central Asia and the Caucasus. Under certain circumstances the "Turkish factor" could become one of the external obstacles to Russia's integration with the Central Asian states. When the new states of Central Asia were choosing a development option, they turned to the Turkish model first. This model, however, has certain distinctive features preventing its use in its entirety and with the same degree of effectiveness as in Turkey. First of all, the Turkish economy was not as centralized and monopolized as the economies of the Central Asian states when the changes started there in the early 1980s. In the second place, the Turks did not go through an era of socialism and were not infected by its mentality. After all, the Soviet people are convinced that someone is obligated to help them: the state, "foreign countries," or their "big Russian brother," and they are less likely to rely on themselves. Of course, new attitudes have emerged in the region recently. The Turkophile euphoria of late 1991 and the first half of 1992, which was based on the anticipation of immediate miracles, is beginning to give way to a more realistic approach, with consideration for historical traditions, established ties, and so forth. The lack of offers of generous financial aid, and the fact that the "language common to all Turks" turned out to be a myth, apparently played a role in this process. The languages of the Turkic peoples are quite different from Turkish. Furthermore, the prospect of integration with Russia and other republics of the former USSR turned out to be much stronger than Turkey expected. Finally, the possibilities of trade between Central Asian republics and Turkey are limited. Turkey does not need agricultural products, and Central Asian energy resources are still inaccessible to Turkey because of the great distances, the absence of a transport infrastructure, and the high cost of establishing one. The high level of Europeanization in the Central Asian republics could also play a role in the future. In comparison with Turkey as a whole, rather than with Ankara, Izmir, or Istanbul, the level of Europeanization is higher in the former Soviet republics. This is likely to discourage the "Turkish" view of the world, based on the supposed superiority of the Turks to other people. The efforts to strengthen the Turkish influence in the Central Asian republics have distinct pan-Turkic features. The mass media were open to propaganda of the pan-Turkic ideas of "Turkic unity" and the creation of "Great Turan" ("Great Turkey," "Great Turkestan," etc.). The traditional anti-Russian aims of the pan-Turkic movement will work against the process of Russia's integration with Central Asia. Some of the internal Russian factors complicating Russia's integration with the Central Asian states within the CIS framework are purely psychological, but they can take the form of actual policy. Above all, these include the nationalist attitudes in Russia itself, which are frequently directed against "foreigners." The collapse of the USSR contributed to the growth of these attitudes. There is also the fear, engendered by these attitudes, that Muslim Turks will eventually constitute the majority in the "integrated" Commonwealth. These fears were present even in the Brezhnev years and are nothing new, but they have not promoted isolationist attitudes until now. Overcoming them in a short time would be difficult, especially when everyday life is more likely to strengthen them. Therefore, we still are not completely cognizant of the importance of the Central Asian region in Russian foreign policy. We still have not completely recognized the economic interests dictating the need for closer cooperation with the countries of Central Asia. The actual intensification of integration processes within the CIS will depend largely on the development of Russia itself, on the success or failure of its reforms.
