Aizpeolea: "PSOE Leadership Insists Solchaga Does Not Have To Resign Yet"] [Excerpt] Madrid - The scandals surrounding Mariano Rubio and Luis Roldan will not at the moment lead to resignations in the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]. At the current state of the investigation, the party leadership does not consider there to be any political liability attached to former ministers Carlos Solchaga and Jose Luis Corcuera, during whose terms the irregularities were committed. This prevailing view in the Socialist executive was revealed at Monday's [25 April] meeting and confirmed in the course of the week. However, Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez has yet to make a statement: Everyone hopes he will do so today at the Federal Committee meeting convened to approve the electoral lists. [passage omitted]
