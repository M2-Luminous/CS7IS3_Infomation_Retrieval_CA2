Shortly upon his arrival he met Chairman of the Assembly of the Republic Antonio Moreira Barbosa de Melo to discuss the question of the Czech Republic's joining the European Union (EU) and other European structures. During the talks Zieleniec presented the Czech Republic as a stable country, which wants through its own strength to become an economically and politically equal partner of European countries. Our foreign policy wants to dissolve the fears of the EU so-called south wing, to which the EU economically less advanced countries belong, that after being accepted to the EU the Czech Republic would pump money out of its funds and would thus restrict the development resources of these countries. Everything indicates that Lisbon understands this fact. Portugal is the third EU country to ratify an agreement on the Czech Republic's associate membership of the EU. By ratifying the document on May 12, the Portugese parliament endorsed the process of the Czech Republic's integration into Europe. The problem of the Czech Republic's succession to agreements signed by Portugal and the former Czechoslovakia is the second important point on Zieleniec's agenda. Besides an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation this problem also concerns the economic field. An agreement on the prevention of double taxation between the two countries is to be signed on Tuesday.
