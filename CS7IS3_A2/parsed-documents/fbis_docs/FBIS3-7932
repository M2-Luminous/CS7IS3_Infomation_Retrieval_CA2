Since then the Serb aggressor has violated this ban several hundreds of times, while the NATO planes did not react. Finally it happened. By shooting down four planes of the Serbian air force, NATO has carried out in full the task it was given if the resolution was violated. One should immediately say that the Serb aggressor again tried to test the readiness of the international community to react decisively to such challenges. In any case, this act will have long-term consequences, and will considerably influence the future developments in the military and political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic's Serbs made a miscalculation. They failed to keep in mind that things can change suddenly in Bosnia after the NATO ultimatum. As a matter of fact, they interpreted their factual defeat around Sarajevo as a victory, but they were forced under threat of air strikes to withdraw their heavy weapons. They were relying on Mummy Russia and several hundred Russian soldiers, who came to Sarajevo as part of the blue helmets. Such a mood of theirs was encouraged by Russia, which has been caught up in euphoria after their [Sarajevo] initiative and the pressure they exerted on Karadzic's criminals. The Russians have, however, now laid their cards on the table, and revealed to all the protagonists in the Bosnia-Herzegovina war that they are not neutral and that they are openly supporting the Serb aggressor side. So the Serbs, busy applauding the Russians, and still smarting from their defeat in Sarajevo, failed to notice the change toward a more active attitude by the United States regarding the war in Bosnia. Not even the ultimatum made them see that. However, by shooting down four of their planes, NATO -- carrying out the UN mandate -- has finally taught them the lesson, which is what President Clinton himself told reporters. The hitherto indecisiveness of the international community only encouraged the destroyers of Bosnia. Through lies, deceptions, and cunning -- after all, on top of Serb mythology, that is what their entire project rests on -- Milosevic and Karadzic (blinded) Europe and the world, while simultaneously carrying out their dirty work. Perhaps they would have succeeded in it again this time, had it not been for the chetnik planes [words indistinct]. As it is, the shooting down of the planes is a clear message to them and to all the protagonists in the Bosnian war. The West has finally understood that only military might can force the Bosnian Serbs and Milosevic to search for political solutions through negotiations. Finally, let us also say that after the sudden cooling of the relations between Washington and Moscow -- true, not only because of the Bosnian issue -- the shooting down of the Serb planes sends a clear message to Moscow as well. Talking of the Russians, let us add that Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said yesterday in front of a crowd of reporters that all the sides in the Bosnian conflict possess an air force. He said that and yet the ground did not open up and swallow him! Only some 10 days ago, Vitaliy Churkin defended himself before reporters in Sarajevo saying that he had never said that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina started with the attack on the former Yugoslav People's Army, even though he had said just that into the microphones of Radio Belgrade. Finally, Moscow is supporting the shooting down of the Bosnian Serb planes, but with reserves, thus leaving itself room to criticize such attacks in the future. Kozyrev announced that the Russians would double their efforts to stop the war in Bosnia and find a solution for peace. Let us hope this will not be like their efforts to date.
