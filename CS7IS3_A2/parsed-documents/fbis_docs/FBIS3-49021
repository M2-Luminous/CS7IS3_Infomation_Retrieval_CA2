[date as published] The Russian Federation has recently appointed Yuriy Petrovich Trushin as its permanent representative to the Republic of Macedonia. He is a professional diplomat, involved in the Balkans for 20 years. His dissertation was on the Balkans, and he has also written a number of scientific works related to this region. He has spent more than 10 years working in the diplomatic service in Bulgaria. This year, he has been engaged in the global problems of that part of Europe. He has been professionally and scientifically linked to the Balkans for more than 20 years. [Adamcevski] Mr. Trushin, how do you view your appointment to the post of permanent representative of the Russian Federation in Macedonia? [Trushin] This appointment to Macedonia is a great honor for me. The Macedonian people are few in number, but have a deep and old culture, and if we look at the history of the Balkans, it cannot be disassociated from Macedonia. Moreover, our two peoples are closely connected through close blood, religious, and historic links. As you know, Russia was christened (it accepted Christianity) and became a Christian country through the great merit of the Ohrid Exarchate. We know that Kiev Russia had strong relations with Ohrid. There are numerous other examples in history when the two countries and peoples had active cooperation. From that aspect, it is a great honor and duty for me to be appointed to Macedonia. I say great duty because, unfortunately, the history of the Macedonian people was carried on in such a way that many in Macedonia know a lot about Russia, but only a few in Russia know about Macedonia. That will be one of my basic goals, to get to know that country better and to bring the truth about that people to the brotherly Russian people. [Adamcevski] You have now touched the next question. What other aims will be basic to your activities? [Trushin] I have already mentioned them: The intensification of the traditional friendship and cooperation between our two peoples. The second goal is to get to know the history and culture of that people, to study the present situation, and to inform my leadership, my government, my people. One of the most important goals of my stay in Macedonia, as a representative of the Russian Federation, will be to make our people, our country, realize the guarantee of stability and independence of the Macedonian people. The policy conducted by Russia in Macedonia should contribute to stability and peace in that country. In brief, these will be the goals during my stay in Macedonia. [Adamcevski] What is your opinion of the present situation in Macedonia within the framework of the Balkans? [Trushin] I think that the policy led by President Kiro Gligorov, who enjoys great respect in our country, and this has been confirmed during the numerous discussions and meetings I have had with my leadership, is the best policy, because his policy is directed toward good neighboring relations with the neighboring countries. That is an example of how the future policy in the Balkans should be, despite the fact that this is the time when Macedonia is surrounded by furious passions, wars, and interethnic disputes. Thanks to its leadership, thanks to the fact that the Macedonians are a very peaceful people, of good intentions, it can be said that Macedonia has succeeded in being the only states of former Yugoslavia to have avoided those events. Here, I think that this policy of peace, good neighboring relations, and cooperation with the neighbors, in my opinion, is the main orientation in the policy of Macedonia. On that plan, Macedonia will always have support from Russia, from our government, and leadership. [Adamcevski] Can you tell us about your views on the future development of the situation in Macedonia? [Trushin] It is ungrateful to forecast policy. However, the way it seems to me, the fact we are now witnessing a broad process of recognition of Macedonia by the European countries, by the world, proves a full recognition of the peaceful policy of Macedonia. My opinion is that the line of international recognition of Macedonia, neglecting the known difficulties, represents a chance for Macedonian perspectives, for overcoming those difficulties, for it becoming a full and equal member of the world's community on its road to civilized development. [Adamcevski] What will be your role and the role of the Russian Federation in that direction? [Trushin] If we reduce all that to Russian-Macedonian relations, I would like to mention that Russia was the first of the superpowers to recognize Macedonia. It recognized its independence on 4 August last year, by the act of our President Boris Yeltsin. Then our Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev paid a visit to Macedonia, followed by his deputy Vitaliy Churkin. In implementing the act of President Yeltsin, official inter-state relations were established between the two countries and respective representatives were appointed. My leadership has entrusted me with the task of going to the spot and learning about the situation in Macedonia, and then I am expected to submit adequate proposals to our leadership and government in compliance with the development of the situation. [Adamcevski] What is your opinion of the presence of the UN forces in Macedonia? [Trushin] Our line in that direction is clear and consistent. If those forces contribute to the development of stability and the reinforcement of peace in Macedonia, to its economic growth and security, we can then welcome such a presence. [Adamcevski] However, some Russian media said that Russia had abandoned the Balkans, asking about the reason for the presence of the Americans there, that is in Macedonia. [Trushin] First of all, we look at the presence of the Americans within the framework of the UN forces. On the other hand, I think that such an aspect appears as a remnant of the ideological concept of the division of the world between the two superpowers. Now, we are developing a Russian policy on the indispensable Partnership for Peace, for which we meet understanding in the Western world. Therefore, any actions, Russian, U.S., or some other countries', must contribute to the reinforcement of stability, of good neighborliness. The ideological remnants must be excluded from these actions, as well as the confrontations and the division of the world between two systems. That is why we consider that our role, I would say, in assisting Macedonia, will mean a continuation in the direction followed hitherto. If the U.S. policy leads to stability and development in Macedonia, we shall welcome it and we shall cooperate with the Americans. [Adamcevski] You know that a great part of the Macedonian foreign trade exchange was linked to the USSR, that is Russia. What will you do, now that the exchange has been lowered, to promote this situation? [Trushin] With the breaking up of the USSR and Yugoslavia, the traditional trade relations have been remarkably weakened. It does not affect only the former republics of the USSR and Yugoslavia, because it is a larger process. Let me note that Macedonia was the only one of the former Yugoslav republics that imported more than it exported to the USSR. This is a very significant detail. Our analyses show that there are possibilities for increasing Macedonian exports to Russia. Our side is pleased to show great interest in textiles and small industry. Our large market is interested in tobacco, in shoes, and in many other products bought in Macedonia. There is a mutual interest with the Macedonians, too. Now that the economy is being restructured, it is very important to start direct links and contacts between the respective companies. In that framework, I view my mission in Macedonia as a possibility for promoting economic cooperation to a higher level. It will be a great contribution if Russia helps Macedonia get back on its feet. That is extremely valuable. For that purpose it was decided, right after my appointment, to also appoint an economic counselor to Macedonia. It demonstrates that we have put the issue of foreign trade relations in the first place. [Adamcevski] Would you like to add something I have failed to ask about? [Trushin] I would like to say that the characteristic of my mission is that, compared to representatives and ambassadors appointed to, so to say, "worked out" countries, I am starting an unusual mission in that aspect. Unfortunately, that was due to history itself, therefore there are no experts on the Macedonian language, on the Macedonian history, and so on. Therefore, in addition to my everyday obligations, I shall be also learning the language, the country.... In that perspective, my contacts with Macedonian historians, linguists, and people of culture, will play a great role for me. On that plan, we must use the links among the scientists of the two countries, as well as the existing potentials. There are such ideas now. When it became clear I was going to Macedonia, I was visited by some representatives of the intelligentsia, the mass media, some scientists, and they came out with the idea of opening a Russian House in Macedonia, which would be the only one in the Balkans. Therefore, it would be a Russian House accumulating the spiritual wealth of the Russian people, which we would generously share with our brothers, the Macedonian people. This idea has already been accepted by Macedonia. I have already had meetings with your eminent writers and artists. The government circles have also accepted it with pleasure and approval. It will be the first step in introducing the two peoples that have traditional and cultural links. There are also other ideas, but this is the first major one, and I, as the first representative of the Russian Federation, would like to realize it. I think it will also be well accepted by the neighboring countries. I think they will have an understanding for that, so that we can expand the cooperation. And finally, I would like to wish the Macedonian brotherly people success in overcoming the present difficulties and in making Macedonia a flourishing state in the family of civilized nations. [Box, p 2] Promptness for Better Mutual Cooperation Yesterday, President of the Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov received a protocol visit of the official representative of the Russian Federation in our country, Yuriy Petrovich Trushin. The Russian representative conveyed to President Gligorov the cordial greetings and new year's wishes of President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin and the Russian leadership, emphasizing their readiness to promote further relations and cooperation with Macedonia in the interest of the two nations and countries, for peace and stability in the region. President Gligorov expressed his gratitude and returned the greetings and wishes, emphasizing that Macedonia is following with great attention and pleasure the efforts of President Yeltsin and the Russian leadership to further democracy in Russian society and peace in the world. Gligorov also talked about the possibilities for, and interest in, an ample cooperation in all fields of mutual interest, based on the historical links between the two countries and on the democratic developments in both countries. President Gligorov welcomed the opening of the Office of the Russian Federation in Macedonia and expressed his hopes that it would soon grow into an embassy. Discussions were also held on the current issues regarding Macedonian-Russian relations, on the situation in both the countries, as well as on the situation in the Balkans. This was stated by the Cabinet of the president of the Republic of Macedonia.
