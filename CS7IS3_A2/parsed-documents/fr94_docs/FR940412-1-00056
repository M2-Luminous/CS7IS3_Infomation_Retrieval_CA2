FR940412-1-00056 FR940412-1-00009 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 80&hyph;9; Notice 9] RIN 2127&hyph;AE86 Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment; Denial of Petitions for Rulemaking AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Denial of petitions for reconsideration and rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice denies a petition for reconsideration of the trailer conspicuity requirements of Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, and a petition for rulemaking to amend these requirements. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patrick Boyd, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;6346). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 10, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule amending Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 to establish a visibility enhancement scheme for large trailers (57 FR 58406). On October 6, 1993, the agency published a response to petitions for reconsideration of that scheme (58 FR 52021). A. Petitions Relating to Mounting Height of Side Conspicuity Treatment In the time between the two Federal Register notices, the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA) wrote NHTSA on August 25, 1993, asking that the mounting height specification for side conspicuity treatment be changed to allow a range of heights from 0.4m to 2.1m. It observed that the agency had proposed a lower mounting height of 0.4m though it had adopted a height of 1.25m. TTMA observed that Standard No. 108 permits reflex reflectors to be mounted within 0.4m of the ground, which is 34 inches below 1.25m, and ``it seems reasonable that the upper location be 34 inches above'' 1.25m, i.e., 2.1m. It also observed that the only vertical surface of some trailers may be at a height even greater than 2.1m. This observation was reiterated in a petition for reconsideration of the 1.525m maximum adopted on October 6, 1993, and submitted by Terminal Service Company (``Terminal''). It asked for a mounting height maximum of 2.28m for cargo tanks, expressing its concern ``that enforcement personnel will not consider a 508mm (20 inches) to 762mm (30 inches) height above the 1525mm (60 inches) requirement practicable.'' At the time that NHTSA received TTMA's letter, it was evaluating petitions for reconsideration of the final rule mounting height of ``as close to 1.25m as practicable''. Ultimately, it granted those petitions and, on October 6, 1993, adopted a revised mounting height of ``as close as practicable to not less than 375mm and not more than 1525mm'' above the road surface. This amendment effectively granted TTMA's petition to allow a lower mounting height than the one originally adopted. It also responded in part to TTMA's request for a higher mounting height, by allowing a maximum height of ``as close as practicable to *␣*␣* not more than'' 1.525m, although not as high as the 2.1m requested. However, TTMA presented no rationale other than symmetry to justify an increase in mounting height from 1.52m to 2.1m. The agency finds this an inadequate basis upon which to grant TTMA's petition for rulemaking. Terminal's rationale is based upon a fear that the mounting height chosen by a manufacturer for application of conspicuity treatment on cargo tanks will be so much higher than 1525mm that the agency will not deem it ``practicable'' and that Federal Highway Administration inspectors will not understand the practicability exception to the height requirement. NHTSA understands this view and wishes to assure Terminal that it regards this concern as unfounded. As the agency has advised many times in the past in its interpretations of the practicability requirements of Standard No. 108, the determination of what is ``practicable'' is initially to be made by the manufacturer, whose certification of compliance covers its determinations of practicability. NHTSA will not question a manufacturer's determination unless it appears clearly erroneous. In this instance, NHTSA interprets the conspicuity mounting height specification as allowing mounting heights higher than 1525mm if the trailer manufacturer does not find it practicable to place the conspicuity treatment at or below 1525mm. Terminal's trailer case provides a good example. Since the conspicuity material cannot provide the required brightness when the trailer is at an angle to traffic unless it is mounted in a nearly vertical plane, practicability dictates that the material be moved to the height where the trailer provides a suitable, vertical mounting surface. Because the agency has determined that no regulatory action is required to give the relief which the petitioner seeks, the petition by Terminal Service Company for reconsideration of the maximum mounting height requirement is denied.
