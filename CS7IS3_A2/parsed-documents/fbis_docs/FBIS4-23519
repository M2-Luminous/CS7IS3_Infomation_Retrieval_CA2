Addressing newsmen in Kampala Monday [6 June], he said RPF has no capacity to capture power and topple the current Rwandan Government quickly. Museveni was addressing the press for the first time after his return Saturday from a 12-day working trip to the Nordic countries. He said that a quick victory for the RPF which lacked equipment, would be long and elusive. "Even if you win totally, you would have to share power" said the Ugandan president, who came to power in January 1986 after a gruelling five-year guerrilla war. He said condemnation of the on-going genocide by the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Commission was a sound basis for the rebels to accept a ceasefire. The latter would even help in having the perpetrators of genocide tried. "If RPF insists on fighting, I think they are making a mistake in my view -- fighting has its own problems," added Museveni, who has been accused by Rwanda of aiding the rebels. Reacting to international suspicions that his government was backing the RPF he said "if we armed them, it would be a different story. Without equipment, RPF would never get a quick victory. My advice was and is -- you don't have equipment and the international community is willing to investigate -- why don't you have a ceasefire instead of wasting our time." Asked why there were numerous international delegations jetting into Uganda in search of a solution to the Rwanda war, the president said they had the wrong address. "The suspicion about Uganda being the RPF's quartermasters, [words indistinct] from the history of the Rwandan diaspora, because most of them had been in Uganda and in the National Resistance Army (NRA). The problem is they (international community) tend to have stereotype perceptions" Museveni added. He said it was ignorance on the part of the accusers to imagine the RPF or any other force could never fight a war without being externally aided with arms. He cited his NRA as an example. "I smuggled arms through Rwanda without the knowledge of (the late Gen. Habyarimana's government). He said fighting forces could secure arms from several states without incumbent government knowing about it. He said he had written to the UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to stop involving Uganda in the crisis.
