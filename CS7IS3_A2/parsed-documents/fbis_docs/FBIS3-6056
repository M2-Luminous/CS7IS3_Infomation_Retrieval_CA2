FBIS3-6056 "dreas049_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 South Korea Source Describes Difficulties IAEA Team Faces SK1303000494 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 2300 GMT 12 Mar 94 SK1303000494 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [By correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] [Text] It has been learned that North Korea had trouble with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team from the beginning of the inspection because it did not comply with the agreement to allow IAEA's full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal] but only allowed limited inspection, including the replacement of surveillance devices. It has been learned that the IAEA will closely review the inspection results as soon as the inspection team returns early this week in order to decide whether or not to call a special Board of Governors meeting. According to information from a well-informed IAEA source obtained today, during the 10-day inspection, which began on 3 March, North Korea did not allow the checking of the points for the full-scope inspection required by the IAEA and only allowed limited inspections, including the replacement of surveillance devices. The source said North Korea only allowed limited inspections, including the replacement of surveillance devices, and that inspections on North Korean facilities did not go smoothly from the beginning. It seemed that the inspection team and the North Korean authorities had considerable disagreement regarding the broken seals in the radioactive chemical laboratory, in particular. The source said the inspection team considered returning earlier than the original two-week schedule because North Korea did not immediately allow follow-up steps for the confirmation of the contents due to the broken seals in the radioactive chemical laboratory. The inspection team finished their preparations to leave on 11 and 12 March and will return early this week. The IAEA established a policy to call an emergency special Board of Governors meeting if it concludes that the inspections required by the IAEA were not conducted after receiving a more accurate inspection report from the inspection team.
