When meeting with Papua New Guinean Defense Minister Paul Tohian in Jayapura, Brigadier-General Rustam Kastor, Commander of the 8th Trikora Regional Command, stressed that Papua New Guinea's news report about ABRI's patrols intruding into the neighboring country was untrue. He said he considered the reports as irresponsible and that they have been brought up by certain groups to destroy the existing good relations of the two governments. He said Indonesia respects the sovereignty of other countries, including Papua New Guinea and ABRI, in carrying out its responsibilities, places its territorial operations as top priority. In carrying out its duties, ABRI has never used military strength. Rather, it chooses to use greater contact with the local community, including separatist groups in efforts to make them realize of their mistakes. Apart from meeting with the 8th Trikora Regional Commander, the Papua New Guinean defense minister also met with the governor of Irian Jaya, Jacob Pantiri. He also observed the ongoing development of a toll road network from Irian Jaya to Mutong in Papua New Guinea.
