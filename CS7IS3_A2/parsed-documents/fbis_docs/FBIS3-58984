The bee-keepers, mainly from France and Spain, presented a petition to Greek Agriculture Minister Georges Moraitis, chairman of the European Community's Council of Agricultural Ministers, ahead of a meeting of the Council later in the day. They were protesting the scheduled phase-out of tariffs on cut-price honey imports, particularly from China, Argentina and Mexico. The bee-keepers also want honey to be reclassified as an agricultural rather than an industrial product so that they can claim a share of EC agricultural subsidies. They carried signs such as "Saving the bees means saving jobs" and "Do not let European agiculture die." There was also a threat. "Today we bring honey (to Brussels). The next time we bring the bees," one poster warned. John Horn, a member of the British Bee-keepers Association, said the decline of the bee-keeping industry meant that the pollination of flowers and hence their cultivation was at risk throughout the European Community. "Honey bees are responsible for 85 percent of all flower pollination," he said, adding that the European honey-bee would perish if bee-keepers were driven out of business and could no longer protect it against parasites. The bee-keepers have rejected a European Commission proposal for anti-dumping tariff protection against imports because this might disqualify them for direct financial aid, an EC official said. Farmers' associations claim there are about 450,000 bee-keepers in the European Community -- including 16,000 full-time professionals. The demonstration was timed to coincide with the first meeting of EC agriculture ministers under Greece's six-month presidency of the Community because Greece is considered sympathetic to the bee-keepers' cause. EC officials predicted that the European Commission would be asked to look at ways to help protect the local apiculture industry.
