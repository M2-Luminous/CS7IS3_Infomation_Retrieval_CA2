Wang Jinshan pointed out in his speech: We should make greater efforts to profoundly launch the activities of studying and propagating the military service law throughout the province. We should spread the ideas that performing military service according to law is the bound duty of citizens and showing concern for and supporting the building of national defense is the duty of the whole society. We should regularize the propaganda of national defense building, with the military service law as the major content, in order to firmly foster throughout the province the sense of national defense, the sense of the legal system, and the idea of preforming military service according to law. In combination with the studying and propaganda of the military service law, we should inspect and summarize the items stipulated by the military service law, and then find out problems in order to enforce the law in a down-to-earth manner. In his speech, Wang Jinshan stressed: Leading cadres at all levels should be fully aware of their exemplary and leading role and should serve as the model in studying, propagating, and implementing the military service law. At the same time, leaders of party committees and governments at all levels should firmly grasp the principle of letting the party manage armed forces, actually list the armed forces work as a major item of their daily agenda, show concern for and support the national defense building, and resolve some major problems and adopt correct policy decisions in a timely manner in order to ensure the successful building of reserve forces and the successful fulfillment of all military tasks.
