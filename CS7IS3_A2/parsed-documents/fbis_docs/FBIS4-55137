This is the second explosion after the first one on March 3 which also resulted only in material damage. The SARANDA newspaper, directed by Mr. Cika and published in Sarande, opposes the policy of Greek chauvinistic circles in regard to the southern part of Albania, which they call North Epirus. An article published recently in the SARANDA dwelt on question of the Albanian population forcibly transferred from Cameria, an Albanian province given to Greece by the 1913 Conference of Ambassadors. The Greek andarts [as received] have committed massacres in Cameria after the First and Second World Wars, which are still alive in the memories of the inhabitants of this region.
