"The words ascribed to the minister were never pronounced. The interview itself, mentioned in the news by the Russian mass media, was nonexistent," emphasizes the statement by the press center of Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry. "Such distortions and the campaign of falsehoods, launched in the Russian mass media around the Odessa incident, have quite an obvious objective: To aggravate the situation around the entire package of the Black Sea Fleet problems, shifting the responsibility onto the Ukrainian side," indicates the statement by the press center of Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry.
