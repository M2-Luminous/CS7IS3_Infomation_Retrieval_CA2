Maso reports that the Urban Buses Enterprise has established a new pilot system on three routes which consists of a profit- sharing scheme among the inspector, mechanic, driver, and electrician of each bus, where a percentage of the profits are divided among them at the end of each shift. Maso interviews a driver and inspector who stress their renewed effort to ensure people pay their fares. One worker reports having made 200 extra pesos in two weeks, and another 70 pesos in four days. Maso interviews several customers who highly praise the renewed quality and timeliness of the service. Maso stresses that since December, when it was first implemented, absenteeism has dropped, the number of trips has increased, breakdowns have been eliminated, costs have been reduced, less fuel is being used, the workers' morale is higher, and the people are receiving better service. Maso concludes: "This is an experience worth imitating."
