After a three-hour talk behind closed doors in Siegen CDU/CSU Defense Policy spokesman Paul Breuer told DPA on Sunday [24 April] evening that the reduction to 340,000 men, which Ruehe has proposed, has been basically approved. The precondition is, however, that the necessary structures are preserved so that in case of emergency the maximum number of 370,000 can be reached quickly again. In the "crisis reaction forces," which are primarily intended for international missions, conscripts are to be given the opportunity to volunteer, Breuer said. Service is to last 12 months in this case. In the " Main Defense Forces, on the other hand, which are to be responsible for national defense, 10 months of service are to be sufficient if service is "shaped compactly." Breuer spoke of a "businesslike climate" of the talks with Ruehe, which have led to a real compromise. The results must now be discussed in the Bundestag groups. This Tuesday the coalition representatives and the Cabinet intend to discuss Ruehe's plans.
