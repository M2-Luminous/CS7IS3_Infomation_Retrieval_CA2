This became clear during the meeting of the party's standing committee, comprised of members of its Executive Committee and regional leaders. It was also decided during the meeting to set up a committee to study the process of implementing autonomy. The People's Party also advocates discontinuing the negotiations on the so-called "democratic impetus" in all the institutions, according to what national party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar told the committee members. Although the state of the negotiations on each of the institutions was not addressed at that meeting, People's Party Secretary General Francisco Alvarez Cascos will set out today the results of the negotiations with the Socialist Party, Information Office Director Miguel Angel Rodriguez announced. Nevertheless, the standing committee devoted much of the time to studying in depth the document on the definition of the model of the state of the autonomous communities. The People's Party members believe that the government's weakness has caused a flood of new autonomy demands. Government's Weakness "The Socialists have opened the window for concessions, and now they do not know how to shut it," Rodriguez stated. According to the People's Party, the government's weakness has caused the transfer of powers to certain autonomous communities with the sole aim of ensuring parliamentary support. The party led by Aznar also deems "problematic" some aspirations attributed to the Generalitat [autonomous government] of Catalonia which "could exceed what is envisaged by the Constitution," and which took shape in an unofficial document which became known several weeks ago. The aim of the People's Party proposal is to determine clearly the kind of state and powers which each administrations should have. The chief opposition force's intention is to debate with other political and social forces the document presented by Aznar in Barcelona last month, although no contact has been made for the present. The People's Party will give priority to the problems of funding the autonomous communities, the communities' participation in European bodies, and the single administration principle in the committee on autonomous communities. The committee will soon be set up and will be chaired by party Deputy Secretary General Mariano Rajoy. The People's Party believes that the "cafe for everybody" formula should not be applied, and will insist on a debate on how the autonomous communities are to be funded and how the single administration principle proposed by Manuel Fraga is to be carried out. In addition, at the standing committee meeting Aznar referred to the European building process, and supported the European Union's enlargement, but not at the cost of harming Spain's interests. The possible harm to Spanish fishing should be taken into account in the negotiations on the entry of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway.
