We have as a rule lived to see elections and witness the triumph of true people's power. Music plays, beer flows from buffets at polling stations, women hastily line up for candy, and the candidates' families say nothing apart from that the time has come for these people to defend the interests of the masses. Today a deputy's career is becoming more and more dangerous. In this respect the Crimea and the events occurring on the peninsula depict, as it were, in miniature the picture of "Ukraine. Parliamentary Elections. March 1994." For two years there have been promises to turn the Crimea into a hot spot, a new Karabakh. It was predicted that the division of the Black Sea Fleet would be a destabilizing factor. Or that Crimean Tatar expansion would disturb the peace. But it was an event sanctified by the republic's legislation that proved the last straw. The Crimea decided to declare its own president. To be more accurate, prominent political forces began dividing up spheres of influence in what is indeed a prime piece of land, strategically important by no means because of some rusty old tubs known as a fleet. Official Kiev tumultuously applauded the start of the campaign. However, this could have been done with the idea of warning "president number one" -- Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, who had dared too often to take a special, Crimean view on a number of state issues. When it became clear that the Crimea under the tricolor of the Republic Movement or the Russian Party was indeed running the risk of steaming toward Russia, Bagrov's victory should have been ensured at any price. Or there should at least been a return to the starting positions and the elections ruled invalid. But a new phenomenon put in an appearance: The Crimea was suddenly swamped by hitherto unheard-of waves of banditry verging on political terrorism. The militia generally either lost the criminals' trail or arrived too late. In a short period the chief medics at the "Sea Surf" and "Russia" sanatoriums died, along with the head of a council of ministers directorate, the director of the Kerch iron ore combine, the leader of the National Movement of Crimean Tatars, and the head of the Black Sea Fleet Press Center. Strangers attacked the parliament's headquarters, fired shots at the office window of Leonid Grach, leader of the Crimean Communists, and, to cap it all, carried out the carnage with no quarter for women or children (I am talking about the murder of Nikolay Bagrov's economic adviser, Crimean Supreme Soviet People's Deputy Iskander Mamedov, two of his guards, and the wounding of 10 people). The tragedies were not consistently linked, but it all finally led a dead-scared Joe Public to yell: "Enough! Enough!" However, the situation has been blocked by another means also. Immediately after it opened, the ninth session of the Ukrainian parliament promptly amended Article 114 of the Constitution. The Ukrainian president now has a basis for rescinding acts adopted by the cabinet of ministers and central organs of power, and similar decisions by Crimea's leadership structures, if he finds them at variance with Ukraine's fundamental or other laws or with his own edicts. Rukh's central leadership was one of the first to issue a statement regarding the inadmissibility of presidential elections in the Crimea. Moreover, the document indicated that the actual course of the campaign is dangerously hotting up the sociopolitical atmosphere on the peninsula. Events soon showed that active participation in the quite legitimate Ukrainian Supreme Council election campaign that has just begun may also lead to symptoms of "Crimean fever" (at least for the opposition). During the night of 15-16 January two strange men tried to break into the Rukh Secretariat after hitting the janitor on the head with a pistol. A little later it emerged that Secretariat leader Mikhail Boychishin had disappeared.... The day before the parliamentary session the president's representatives in the localities and representatives of soviets at all levels met in the Supreme Council conference room. Nomenklatura factions squabbled among themselves, but they were unable to determine which was the more senior in the face of the coming, unpredictable elections, so they tried to reach a compromise by supraconstitutional but peaceful means. They adopted a unique draft law on power and self-government in Ukraine. In the future Ukraine will operate solely as a presidential republic.
