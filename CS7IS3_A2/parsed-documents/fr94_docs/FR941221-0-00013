FR941221-0-00013 FR941221-0-00005 On November 14, 1994, Indicated Companies, 1 Natural Gas Clearinghouse (NGC), and Philadelphia Gas Works (Philadelphia Gas) filed requests for rehearing of Order No. 566&hyph;A 2 as it relates to the requirement under Standard of Conduct H for pipelines to post on their pipeline Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) information concerning discounts provided to pipeline marketing affiliates. 3 Standard H requires pipelines to post information on marketing affiliate discounts within 24 hours after gas flows under the discounted transaction. The rehearing petitions request that the Commission revise Standard H to require posting when the pipeline offers a discount to a marketing affiliate. The Commission denies the requests for rehearing. 1 Conoco, Inc., Amoco Production Company, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Marathon Oil Company, Meridian Oil, Inc., Mobil Natural Gas, Inc., Pennzoil Exploration and Production Company, Pennzoil Petroleum Company, Pennzoil Gas Marketing Company, Phillips Petroleum Company, Shell Gas Trading Company, Vastar Resources, Inc., and Vastar Gas Marketing, Inc. 2 Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions, Order No. 566, 59 FR 32885 (June 27, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs.

Background In Order No. 497, 4 the Commission promulgated Standard of Conduct I (now Standard H) which provided that ``if a pipeline offers a transportation discount to an affiliated marketer, it must make a comparable discount contemporaneously available to all similarly situated non-affiliated shippers.'' At the same time, the Commission promulgated §250.16 which required pipelines to file with the Commission information about discounts requested, offered, or provided to marketing affiliates within 15 days after the close of the billing period and to provide electronic access to such information once the service has begun. 5 In Order No. 497&hyph;D, the Commission eliminated the requirement that pipelines file the marketing affiliate discount information with the Commission, requiring instead that the pipelines provide this information on their EBBs. 6 4 Inquiry Into Alleged Anticompetitive Practices Related to Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, Order No. 497, 53 FR 22139 (June 14, 1988), FERC Stats. & Regs.

The Commission issued two orders addressing the operative posting time for the marketing affiliate information. In Sunrise Energy , 7 the Commission interpreted the prior regulations as not requiring pipelines to provide notice of discount negotiations with marketing affiliates. On the other hand, in Colorado Interstate, 8 the Commission held that to comply with the prior regulations, pipelines had to post offers made during negotiations on their EBBs in addition to posting the final offer. 7 62 FERC ¶61,087 at 61,623 (1993), aff'd , 66 FERC ¶61,170 (1994). 8 65 FERC ¶61,264 at 62,224&hyph;25 (1993). In Order No. 566, the Commission followed Colorado Interstate and required posting of discount information when an offer to a marketing affiliate was made. Many pipelines sought rehearing of Order No. 566, contending that the prior regulations did not require posting when offers were made and that imposing such a requirement would result in disclosure of confidential competitive information which could permit non-affiliated marketers to steal deals being negotiated by marketing affiliates. For example, the pipelines argued that disclosure of information about discount offers to their marketing affiliates could enable competitors to determine the marketing affiliates' customers and interfere with the affiliates' negotiations.
