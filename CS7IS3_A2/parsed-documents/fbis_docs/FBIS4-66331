Deputy director Chintay Shih of the governmental Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) revealed plans to establish a new DRAM-producing company. The Electronics Research and Service Organization (ERSO), one of ITRI's departments, will be the parent body of the new manufacturer. It has completed the development of a new 16-MB DRAM chip using 0.5-micron technology. The process will use 200-mm wafers. The production line created by ERSO for trial production of the chip will be expanded for full-scale production purposes. The manufacturing facility is located in the Hsinchu High-Technology Park. The name of the company, the size of its investment, and the annual output, are still undecided. The possibility of a funding consortium consisting of several manufacturers is now being explored. ERSO is one of 11 subdivisions of ITRI. Its Submicron Project includes 0.5-micron CMOS (16 MB DRAM) development and also 0.35-micron and smaller CMOS development by National Nanodevice Laboratories, established in 1992. The 0.5-micron 16-MB DRAM chip was designed by Etron Technology of Taiwan. Etron's founder, Nicky C. C. Lu, is a former IBM DRAM designer. According to Mr. Lu, the 16-MB DRAM chip is a first-generation chip, with an area of 100 mm[.sup]2[/], in a 400-mil package. A stacked memory cell design will be used. The technology for the more recent trench process is not yet available in Taiwan. The second-generation chip will be a synchronous DRAM for high-speed data transmission. An attempt will be made to use the ``lead-on-chip'' (LOC) technology. The search for an existing manufacturer who can implement this technology is now under way. The TI-Acer company of Taiwan is now producing 4-MB DRAM. In Phase 1 of the Fab 1 stage, 1500 units a month of 0.8-micron technology 150-mm equivalent chips will be produced. Phase 2 is scheduled to get under way in 1995. The total output will be 24,000 units per month. Mosel Vitelic, a DRAM-oriented company that produces for the Taiwan electrical engineering industry, is setting up a clean room to meet 0.5-micron standards. Operation is expected to begin this year. Taiwan's largest LSI producer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC), plans to produce DRAM under the Fab 3 stage, which began in December 1993. Taiwan's Department of Economics is backing this effort to create a DRAM project from existing enterprises and government research organizations. In December 1992, the ministry designated 66 systems and components as key projects for stepped-up effort in order to replace imported products. The 66 designated products are grouped into three ranks. Rank A consists of products for which the Department of Economics has created a technology development project team and is carrying on the R&D. Rank B consists of technologies for which a subdivision of the Industrial Office has created a development plan for joint implementation by two or more enterprises. Rank C consists of projects in which enterprises are investing, with government support in order to facilitate production.
