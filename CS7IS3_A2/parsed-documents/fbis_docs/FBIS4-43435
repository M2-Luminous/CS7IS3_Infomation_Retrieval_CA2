Who cares?" This is how [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi dismissed [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi's demand for a clarification of the League's policy line. And with regard to [Interior Minister] Roberto Maroni's proposal to federate the three allies of the Freedom Alliance into a single party, the League leader said: "That must be some journalist's invention. The League will never be a fragment of Forza Italia. I realize that there are some people who are accustomed to saying, `we are all men on horseback,' but we are not men on horseback; we are ordinary people who go on foot." Yesterday was a tough day for Bossi. The decision, announced Tuesday [14 June], to make the League a workers' party by the end of 1995 prompted a great many responses both inside and outside the movement. Starting yesterday morning thousands of members telephoned their local officials to demand explanations and to protest the feared swing to the Left. Meanwhile, an unofficial poll in the lower house and the Senate showed that some 80 percent of members of the League's parliamentary groups agree with the present government and are in favor of the majority that supports it. These are two bad signs for the leader, who did not try to evade the issue of this minor earthquake, and spoke to journalists at length to explain his thoughts about a single party, the government, and the future of the League. And he altered his stance somewhat on some of the most controversial aspects. The single party -- "So Berlusconi said that there should be a clarification within the League. Who cares? Let him concentrate on clarifying his own party. In any case, a prime minister should not interfere... Why does he not himself become absorbed into his `Forza-thing'? It is the facts that count, and the facts are that he wants to turn the Freedom Alliance -- which we invented -- into the single party. There can never be a single party, for ideological reasons, because of the values and traditions that divide us, and because of the issue of democracy." The government -- "I spent three months in intellectual isolation before the Assago and Bologna congresses that chose the path of joining the government. Now there is no alternative to the Freedom Alliance, and it is bound to govern for at least a few years in order to ensure the country's stability, and to avert very serious confusion. An election in November would create confusion, and would entail a return to intellectual isolation. Instead, we must strengthen our option for differentiation within this alliance and within this government." The League's role -- "Within this alliance and within this government we must represent the working class, on the basis of the values that are part of our tradition. We do not represent the papist and conservative component, and we can never do so. Forza Italia and the National Alliance, on the other hand, represent the conservative movement." Flirtation with the Left -- "There is no flirtation with the Left, as has been said hitherto. If you like, there is a signal that we are issuing to the forces that are now on the other side and that are disintegrating, particularly following [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto's resignation, to let them know that, if there is an acceptance of common liberal democratic and federalist values, there is a force within the alignment that is not conservative. In a few years' time we will see who the real working class is who and the elitist and superficial forces are. Meanwhile, Sunday I am going to Pontida, but I am certainly not going there to appear on television, as Berlusconi does."
