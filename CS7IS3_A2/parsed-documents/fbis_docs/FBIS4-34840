The highways have been blocked since 13 June by Indians protesting the recent approval of an agrarian law. The agrarian law was declared unconstitutional in the past few hours. Legislator Lima reported today that two of the three people were killed last night in the Andean town of Guamote, Chimborazo Province, some 180 km south of Quito, when soldiers were evicting a group of Indians from a church. Guamote is near the city of Riobamba. The cathedral in the city of Riobamba was occupied this morning by 100 Indians who are supported by Victor Corral, bishop of the diocese. A church spokesperson told EFE that Victor Corral will reiterate his support for the Indians upon his return from Rome tomorrow. Luis Macas, Quechua leader and president of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), said the third Indian was killed last night in the Andean province of Tungurahua, some 110 km from Quito, when soldiers were forcing Indians to return to their communities. Last week, the Conaie reported that three other Indians were killed in Canar Province, which is farther south of Tungurahua and Chimborazo. The Conaie said they were "victims of paramilitary landlords." Other reports, however, attributed the deaths to merchants who claim their stores had been looted by demonstrators. The Conaie also reported previously that an Indian was killed in Tungurahua. According to press reports, he was struck by a driver who attempted to evade the barricades. The incidents occurred 48 hours after the state of emergency was declared Tuesday by Conservative President Sixto Duran Ballen, who is 73 years old. Immediately after the deaths were reported, increasing to seven the number of dead since the protests began on Monday of last week, the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal (TGC) suspended the provisions of the agrarian law, declaring it unconstitutional. Carlos Jaramillo, TGC president, said the six tribunal members decided unanimously "to totally suspend the provisions of the law because it was found to have flaws in form and substance." "The law was declared unconstitutional and its provisions were suspended. I have arranged to send the TGC resolution to the Supreme Court immediately so that the law will be definitively suspended," Jaramillo added.
