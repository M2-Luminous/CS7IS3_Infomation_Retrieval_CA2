The Palestinian delegation is led by Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, because Dr. Nabil Sha'th, President 'Arafat's political adviser, is currently in Tunis. The Israeli delegation is led by Amnon Shahaq, the assistant chief of staff, who arrived in Cairo earlier today. Palestinian delegation member Khalid al-Qidrah stated that the two delegations will complete drafting the general agreement. He said: We are about to finish. I think that we will finish everything in time. Sources close to the negotiations said that over the past two days the Palestinian and Israeli delegations have narrowed the differences on all points a great deal. The sources said that the two delegations will draft some paragraphs in the agreement but they are still under discussion. They said that with regard to the entry of the Palestinian police into Gaza and Jericho, the Israeli delegation thinks that an initial group of 25 policemen can enter on the day of the signing. They added that 1,000 to 1,500 policemen will enter the territories within one week of the signing. The remainder will follow. The sources explained that the number of Palestinian policemen agreed upon is 9,000. The sources said that the Palestinian delegation thinks there is no sense in the entry of an initial small group, and that the whole Palestinian police force should enter the autonomous areas during the first week after the signing and after the Israeli withdrawal, which will begin the day after Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin sign the Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement. The source said that on Tuesday 'Arafat and Rabin will discuss two points, namely the size of Jericho's area and the presence of a Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge. One opinion is that the area of Jericho should be 57 square kilometers, the sources said, adding that Israel will also agree to the presence of an Israeli policeman at the crossing point when the Palestinians enter and an inconspicuous Israeli observer to intervene whenever there is suspicion regarding those who cross into the autonomous areas.
