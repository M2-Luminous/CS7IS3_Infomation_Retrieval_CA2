ACTION: Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality Guidelines (40 CFR Part 1500); and the Soil Conservation Service Guidelines (7 CFR Part 650); the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, gives notice that an Environmental Impact Statement is not being prepared for the Bear Butte Water Users Association pipeline project in Meade County, South Dakota. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Rodney D. Baumberger, Acting State Conservationist, USDA, Soil Conservation Service, Federal Building, Room 203, 200 4th Street SW, Huron, South Dakota, 57350&hyph;2475, telephone (605) 353&hyph;1783. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Environmental Assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Mr. Rodney D. Baumberger, Acting State Conservationist, has determined that the preparation and review of an Environmental Impact Statement is not needed for this project. The project concerns a plan for the installation of a rural pipeline to provide water of good quality and suitable quantity to five ranchers along Spring Creek, near Bear Butte in Meade County, South Dakota. The water will be used for livestock and domestic purposes. A Memorandum of Agreement developed by the Soil Conservation Service with the National Advisory Council on Historic Preservation identifies the steps that will be taken to address the concerns identified by Indian Tribes who use Bear Butte for religious and cultural purposes. The Notice of Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency, Indian Tribes, and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single-copy requests at the above address. The total Environmental Assessment is on file and may be reviewed by contacting Rodney D. Baumberger, Acting State Conservationist. No administrative action on implementation of the project will be taken until 30 days after the date of this publication in the Federal Register .
