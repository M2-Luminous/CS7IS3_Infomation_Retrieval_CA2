Would it be easy to substitute some other system? [Fillon] Yes. It is possible to support aeronautical development either by assistance to upstream research or by indirect aid, as the United States is currently doing. Past agreements allow us to finance up to 3 percent of a program's cost through aid to research. Today we are averaging only 0.8 percent, so there is a lot of room to expand. [Piernaz/Langereux] But are we in fact prepared to augment that contribution? [Fillon] Absolutely! And I would remind you that our budget for 1994 is going to augment appropriations for upstream research by 25 percent. [Piernaz/Langereux] Aeronautical manufacturers dispute the importance of that augmentation, because (they say) you're starting from a very low level, so the 25 percent increase will not amount to much. What is your response? [Fillon] My answer is, they are right about the size of the appropriation being modest. But no one should imagine that all the aid is going to be transferred from one day to the next into upstream research credits. Our objective is to augment these appropriations gradually and to do so in such a way that the overall volume of aid utilizable by the enterprises remains comparable. [Piernaz/Langereux] Who is going to receive this new aid to upstream research? [Fillon] This is one of our concerns. In fact, apart from ONERA [National Officer for Aerospace Studies and Research], there are few public-sector research entities specializing in aeronautics. At the moment, many contracts are signed directly with the enterprises. [Piernaz/Langereux] Do you favor a sort of European NASA that would administer and direct a policy of upstream research? [Fillon] No, I don't think such a cumbersome entity would be the best instrument for conducting a voluntarist policy. A European system would require negotiations between 12 parties, each with its own special interests. Speaking generally, I don't think the creation of big public-sector organisms would be responsive to the problem. These questions are the subject of frequent meetings between the enterprises and government offices concerned, and I think we will find flexible and effective solutions. [Piernaz/Langereux] Doesn't the solution lie in support for military programs that would have civilian spin-offs? [Fillon] Certainly. And the proposed European military transport aircraft presents the opportunity for a great deal of cooperation and synergy between military and civilian research. Military research organs are asking for closer cooperation with civilians in dual-use technologies, which are more numerous than I once thought. You must realize that the defense industry consumes 30 percent of the country's research outlays while accounting for only 5 percent of its production. It's clear that our civilian industries must make better use of the 30 percent earmarked for military research. [Piernaz/Langereux] How do you and the minister for industry handle the division of responsibilities for the space domain? [Fillon] In general, Industry Minister Gerard Longuet (Cf. A&C No. 1453) has the lead in space affairs. But the financing for CNES [National Center for Space Studies] of course comes out of the Research Ministry's budget. In addition, I pay special attention to the scientific program and to research and technology activities. In particular, programs for manned space flight should occupy a place compatible with our means and objectives, and consistent with our concept of France's role in space. [Piernaz/Langereux] So you support the idea of French, or rather European, participation in the new manned flight programs? [Fillon] Yes, because it would be a serious mistake to let the Americans and Russians be the only ones to send men into space to do things. In my opinion, absenting ourselves from this activity so essential for the future is unacceptable! France and Europe should be major partners of the United States and Russia in manned systems. [Piernaz/Langereux] Do you think your view is widely shared in Europe? [Fillon] I think so. The subject came up recently at the G-7 meeting... I concluded that the Europeans were on the same wavelength. And I noted they were in agreement in criticizing the Americans for their attitude of deciding without consulting with their partners--presenting Europeans with a fait accompli on Russian participation in the "international" Space Station project. Japan, like Europe, is wondering whether this new version of the project is going to be NASA's last. [Piernaz/Langereux] What's the status of the Franco-German dialogue on the subject? [Fillon] Unlike France, which is one of the few countries in Europe whose research budget is increasing despite the economic recession, Germany is being forced to accept very difficult budget cuts... The Germans are thus confronted with difficult choices. But above all, they're proposing adoption of a concept of the manned flight program that we believe needs revision to take account of developments in the Russo-American discussions. [Piernaz/Langereux] Here in France, what kind of governmental support does the plan have? [Fillon] The prime minister has asked us to prepare an interministerial council sometime in the first half of 1994 to redefine France's position on all these space issues: That's when Gerard Longuet will be able to move things forward. [Piernaz/Langereux] Will there be a national debate on the subject? [Fillon] Yes. A debate in Parliament on the overall directions of France's science policy, including space, is planned for June 1994.
