The rice shortage is due on the one hand to a demographic increase of 60,000 in 1993, and on the other hand to natural calamities that destroyed more than 6,710 of the 174,240 hectares [ha] of crops planted during the previous monsoon. As for dry season crops, the province has transplanted some 39,240 ha of short-term rice. About 20 percent of this rice had been harvested by the end of March, with an average yield of two tonnes per hectare. According to estimates by the same service, total rice production for both seasons will not exceed 293,575 tonnes.
