FR940524-1-00056 FR940524-1-00010 §84.93 Gas flow test; open-circuit apparatus. (a) A static-flow test will be performed on all open-circuit apparatus. (b) The flow from the apparatus shall be greater than 200 liters per minute when the pressure in the facepiece of demand-apparatus is lowered by 51 mm. (2 inches) water-column height when full container pressure is applied. (c) Where pressure demand apparatus are tested, the flow will be measured at zero gage pressure in the facepiece. (d) Where apparatus with compressed-breathing-gas containers are tested, the flow test shall also be made with 3,450 kN/m. 2 (500 p.s.i.g.) container pressure applied. §84.94 Gas flow test; closed-circuit apparatus. (a) Where oxygen is supplied by a constant-flow device only, the rate of flow shall be at least 3 liters per minute for the entire rated service time of the apparatus. (b) Where constant flow is used in conjunction with demand flow, the constant flow shall be greater than 1.5 liters per minute for the entire rated service time. (c) All demand-flow devices shall provide at least 30 liters of oxygen per minute when in the fully open position. §84.95 Service time test; open-circuit apparatus. (a) Service time will be measured with a breathing machine as described in §84.88. (b) The open-circuit apparatus will be classified according to the length of time it supplies air or oxygen to the breathing machine. (c) The service time obtained on this test will be used to classify the open-circuit apparatus in accordance with §84.53. §84.96 Service time test; closed-circuit apparatus. (a) The closed-circuit apparatus will be classified according to the length of time it supplies adequate breathing gas to the wearer during man test No. 4 described in Table 4 of this subpart. (b) The service time obtained on man test No. 4 will be used to classify the closed-circuit apparatus in accordance with §84.53. §84.97 Test for carbon dioxide in inspired gas; open- and closed-circuit apparatus; maximum allowable limits. (a) Open-circuit apparatus: (1) The concentration of carbon dioxide in inspired gas in open-circuit apparatus will be measured at the mouth while the apparatus mounted on a dummy head is operated by a breathing machine. 2 2 Kloos, E. J., and J. Lamonica, A Machine-Test Method for Measuring Carbon Dioxide in the Inspired Air of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus. Bureau of Mines Report of Investigations 6865, 1966, 11 pp. (2) The breathing rate will be 14.5 respirations per minute with a minute-volume of 10.5 liters. (3) A sedentary breathing machine cam will be used. (4) The apparatus will be tested at a temperature of 27 # 2 ○ C. (80 # 5 ○ F.). (5) A concentration of 5 percent carbon dioxide in air will be exhaled into the facepiece.
