During his American visit, Payne, a member of the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS), praised the fact that the right-wing NECENZUROVANE NOVINY published a list of alleged secret police agents and collaborators in 1992. Speaking to local Czech-Americans, Payne said on Tuesday [1 February] that publication of the truth was essential for purifying society and that the only problem with the list was that some people were not on it who should have been. No one was on it who should not have been, he added. The committee's resolution was initiated by Jan Krycer and Josef Jezek, Stiborova said. Payne said that some personal identification numbers appearing in the list may have been mistyped, adding, "but basically, when I need to do screening for my personal use, it is sufficient." "The committee has agreed that Payne makes speeches and remarks unknown to the committee," Stiborova said, adding, "thus what he says are his private views." Payne can only be dismissed by parliament, Jezek said, adding, "I and most of my colleagues, believe that Payne can no longer remain committee chairman." Payne has made a grave mistake, Jezek said, adding that Payne blundered once before in making controversial remarks regarding relations with Czechs abroad. "By behaving as they did, the committee gave Payne a chance for the incident to be forgotten. Just as it was about to be forgotten, a similar thing happened, and something, I would say, much more striking." The committee had no choice but to react so as to "avoid implicating the whole of parliament and the whole of the Foreign Committee," Jezek said, adding that both parliament and the committee must distance themselves from the whole incident as soon as possible.
