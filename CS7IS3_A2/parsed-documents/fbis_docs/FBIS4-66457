In order to maintain the secrecy of a person who responded to the questions, and to eliminate the presupposition, no name was required. In order to collect lively responses, quite a few descriptive responses were included. The survey using a real sample was conducted in 1992 by the U.S. SEMI, and although the real sample was not presented this time, an opinion about whether such a survey in Japan is possible or not was requested from the participants. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Responses were returned from 64 departments (including multiple responses from a single company) such as LSI makers, equipment makers, material makers, and national organizations. As for regions, the numbers are: 44 from Japan; 14 from North America; and 6 from Europe. Sixty-four percent of responses are in regard to wafer measurment which makes up the major response. After studying the survey, wafer measurement became the focus of this discussion leaving the problem of the mask. The majority of responses were distributed as follows: 47% are from LSI related makers; 31% are from concerns in experimental productions; and 11% are from the concerns in mass production. As for the equipment methodology, 56% employ the EB method, and 35% employ the optical method leaving the EB method with a good lead. Eighty percent of EB method use is in development and experimental production. On the other hand, 68% of the optical application is used for research and development. And it is used widely in mass production. For price and ease of use, the optical method is still popular in mass production sites. After collecting data from LSI makers, it became apparent that the present measurement capacity is not satisfactory, although EB will lead over the optical method (see figure 4). It was also clear that for the improvement in high precision and aspect ratio that: (1) resolution including image contrast; (2) rendering measurement; (3) wafer charge up; (4) measurement tolerance between equipment; (5) improved throughput are needed (see table 2).

In addition, it was clear that there is a need to establish standardization including absolute dimension measurement (see figure 8). Figure 5. Distribution Of Measurement Environments Figure 6.

Necessity Of Absolute Dimension Measurement and Importance Of Resolution, Precision And Reliability The problem of the EB method is divided into two problems. The first problem is to secure high resolution and precision measurement since minuteness and aspect ratios will become further advanced. The second problem is to obtain the easiness of measurement and reliability. In the first problem, low image contrast as the pattern aspect ratio becomes high, and unstable image formation are important topics to study. These problems will fall in (1), (2) and (3) mentioned the above. Already the current equipment has a problem of measurement even if the EB method is employed, and a technological breakthrough is expected. Especially in precision, there is a problem of rendering the measurement consistent with resolution. The technology extended to observation SEM is not solving the problem. The importance of developing a unique measurement technology is beginning to be realized by the makers. Therefore, improvement of electromagnetic lens, and for example, technology that was developed for stepper in order to improve the stage of static precision will be necessary. The problem of charge up will become serious after 0.35 �m. Although the problem is at present resolved by the control of voltage acceleration, as pattern increases its minuteness, the problem will become more severe. A technology comparable to the optical method which can manipulate and reduce charge-up will be needed. The second problem will fall in (4) and (5) described the above. Especially the problem of absolute base for measurement is surfacing. Deviation of dimension measurement between equipment is still a problem. However the problem may be solved by each maker employing a certain measurement base. At present, a sample of absolute measurement is conducted at the MITI's industrial technology measurement research center. Also there are quite a few places in the equipment which require maintenance and this will influence throughput. From now on, automatic adjustment will increase the operational efficiency, and improvement on easy to use interface functions for users is essential. In EB Method, Linear Approximation Mainly Employed In the questionnaire, in order to clarify the problem of measurement, the current measurement environment and method were investigated. In terms of measurement environment, it was clear that there are some differences between the method employed by Japan and the method employed by the U.S. and Europe (see figure 5). In order to establish high precision and stable equipment, standardization of environment will become important. Also, in terms of the measurement method, measuring the bottom of the pattern with linear approximation by the EB method is common (see figure 6). First of all in the measurement environment, for set up temperature 60% answered 23�C in Japan, but in the U.S. and Europe the value was 2 to 3�less. Also in Japan, there are quite a few cases where the control is done with +/- 1 to 2�C. In the U.S. and Europe control tends to be more stringent than that. Compared to temperature, humidity has a wide distribution. A range from 50% with a variation of + or - 10% is quite common, but the control range is more or less stringent. Thus, the equipment environment differs greatly geographically, and the auxiliary function to correct equipment will be needed in the system. Also it is necessary to guarantee that with a wide range of temperature and humidity, that auxiliary functions will not be placed in the process line. As the equipment environment is standardized, establishing the guaranteed range, looking at the practical situation, is the way to promote performance improvement and price reduction. Next, status of use looking at the rendering measurement at the site, measurement position, algorithm for determining the measurement, and pattern formation will be discussed. In rendering the measurement, by the experiment in which EB method and optical method are employed and distributed in the center of 15 nm and 30 nm with 3 (sigma), it was clear that EB method is superior to the optical method. In measurement position, the bottom pattern is 58% which is quite high in the case where the EB method is employed. In optical method, the threshold value is 63%. This is because in the EB method, with the second generation electrons from the bottom of the pattern or part of pattern, and also the intensity ratio of reflection electrons, image contrast is determined, it is considered that detection of bottom pattern is easy. On the other hand, in the optical method, dispersion of light intensity at the edge is strong, and from the threshold value at the edge part, it is necessary to measure empirically the bottom dimension. Since the algorithm to determine the measurement point will influence the precision of measurement, the makers as well as users must apply their various know-how. The reason why linear approximation is used, is that the method is simple and it can capture the bottom pattern. Also the threshold value is used with extension of the optical method. Adjustment of equipment is important to maintain the precision measurement for a long time, and 92%, a total of 48 people responded excluding the response of no comments, answered that they are employing some method of adjustment (see figure 7). The frequency of adjustment is once a day or once a week, and most of users are doing it by themselves. For adjustment, a sample base is used, which is frequently made by the users themselves. Base For Absolute Dimension Is Urgently Needed In addition to the current situation of measurement, the questionnaire included questions about the future standardization of dimension measurement. Some 85% excluding no comment, responded that absolute measurement is necessary (see figure 8). The importance of this is because of the need for compatibility of measurement between businesses such as production lines, research centers, and mass production plants, and data compatibility outside of companies such as the data used at academic presentations. The deviation of design rules is reaching the level of influencing characteristics of LSIs. Absolute dimensional measurement is urgently needed after the 0.35 �m LSI to increase the stability and efficiency of production and for the research and development of terminal devices.
