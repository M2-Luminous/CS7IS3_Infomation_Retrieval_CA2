FR940803-2-00026 FR940803-2-00020 The Commission has been moving towards greater reliance on market forces both in its rates and certificate policies. In Order Nos. 436 5 and 636 6 , the Commission required pipelines to provide unbundled, open access transportation in order to promote greater efficiency and increased competition among pipelines and their customers, two goals that can be affected by the pricing policies used for new construction. In order to contribute to achieving these two goals, the Commission also required pipelines to institute capacity release mechanisms and to adopt flexible receipt and delivery point policies. In the competitive world of unbundled transportation, shippers have many more transportation options, and the prices shippers pay for transportation on different pipelines has become a critically important aspect of competition in the market. In the competitive capacity market created by Order Nos. 436 and 636, the development of consistent pricing policies is important both for pipelines and their customers, because they need to know the rates that will be charged in order to make appropriate decisions about the amount of capacity to build and to purchase. 5 Regulation of Natural Gas Pipelines After Partial Wellhead Decontrol, Order No. 436, 50 FR 42408 (Oct. 18, 1985), FERC Stats. & Regs. [Regulations Preambles 1982&hyph;1985] ¶ 30,665 (Oct. 9, 1985). 6 Pipeline Service Obligations and Revisions to Regulations Governing Self-Implementing Transportation; and Regulation of Natural Gas Pipelines After Partial Wellhead Decontrol, 57 Fed. Reg. 13,267 (Apr. 16, 1992), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶ 30,939 (Apr. 8, 1992). The Commission is interested in undertaking a comprehensive evaluation of its current pricing policies to determine whether revisions are needed. One goal of this effort is to develop pricing policies for new construction that will properly reflect cost responsibility and that will further efficiency and competition in the market and promote the development of the industry. Another important goal is to identify how best to provide pipelines and their existing and future customers with as much certainty as possible about whether projects will be approved and the rates customers will be paying for capacity when pipelines expand. Unless pipelines and customers are aware of the rate implications of expansions, they cannot make informed decisions about the amount of capacity to build and to purchase. As part of the inquiry into ways to provide greater certainty about project approvals and rates for new construction, the Commission is interested in reexamining its current certificate and rates policies for new construction. As a result of the increased reliance on market forces brought about by Order Nos. 436 and 636, the Commission has reevaluated its certificate policies to place greater reliance on the market. The Commission has established procedures under which pipelines can obtain construction certificates for projects that are not fully subscribed at the time of application. First, pipelines may apply for optional certificates for undersubscribed projects under which the pipelines are at risk for cost recovery. 7 Second, if pipelines apply for a traditional certificate and have not been able to demonstrate that the project will be fully subscribed under long term contracts, the Commission has permitted the construction to go forward by issuing certificates containing conditions under which the pipeline is placed at risk for unsubscribed capacity. 8 The Commission, however, has declined to issue at-risk certificates where companies have failed to demonstrate support for a significant amount of the projected capacity. 9 7 18 CFR Part 157, Subpart E. 8 See, e.g., Arkla Energy Resources Company, 63 FERC ¶ 61,215 at 62,590 (1993). 9 See, e.g ., Questar Pipeline Company, 67 FERC ¶ 61,145 (1994). But see , Petal Gas Storage Company, 64 FERC ¶ 61,190 (1993), in which the Commission issued a certificate approving operation of existing storage facilities to provide third party storage service at market-based rates, though the applicant, a newly formed company, had no executed contracts or binding precedent agreements. The Commission's policy has been to determine whether to allow a rolled-in pricing methodology for new facilities when pipelines have sought to recover the costs for these facilities in proceedings under §4 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), rather than when the pipelines have sought certificate approval for construction under §7 of NGA. However, when a pipeline seeks incremental pricing treatment, the Commission generally addresses this issue in the §7 certificate proceeding where a new facility or service is first proposed. The Commission has not made rolled-in pricing determinations in certificate applications because, in §7 certificate proceedings, the Commission is considering rates only for new service or customers and cannot change the rates of the pipeline's existing customers. 10 One effect of making rolled-in pricing determinations in §4 rate proceedings is that the decision is made after the facilities are built and after the customers have determined whether to sign contracts for the facilities. 10 See Northern Natural Gas Company v. FERC, 827 F.2d 779 (D.C. Cir. 1987); Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company v. FERC, 613 F.2d 1120 (D.C. Cir. 1979), cert. denied , 449 U.S. 889 (1980). The Commission could change existing customers' rates only by acting under §5 of the NGA and finding that their rates are unjust and unreasonable. In a recent order in Northwest Pipeline Corporation , 11 the Commission sought to provide greater certainty about rate treatment by issuing a declaratory order in Northwest's certificate proceeding providing a preliminary determination of rate design methodology. Based on the information provided by Northwest in its application and in response to Commission data requests, the Commission found that rolled-in rate treatment would be appropriate in a subsequent §4 rate filing to recover the facility costs, provided, however, that Northwest could show in the §4 rate proceeding that the expansion facilities would provide the system-wide benefits it alleged in the certificate application and that the rate impact of rolling-in the facilities would be approximately the same as, and not materially greater than, that projected by Northwest. 11 59 FERC ¶ 61,289 (1992), order on reh'g , 68 FERC ¶ 61,037 (1994).
