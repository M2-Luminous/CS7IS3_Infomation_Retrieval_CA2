Russians in the Near Abroad"] [Text] Much has already been said about the fate of Russians living in the near abroad. At the same time a certain one-sidedness has been characteristic of the reasoning on this subject: the overseas Russians themselves and the peoples surrounding them are not usually seen as the characters of history on whose behavior this solution of the "Russian question" or the other will depend. There is not, accordingly, all that much interest in the capacity of either for independent action, and their mutual relations and aspirations are touched on only in passing. Weakness of the Strong In 1989 Central Asia had a population of 49 million persons. Russians accounted for almost 20 percent, or 9.5 million of them. In terms of absolute numbers, Russians were spread within the region as follows: 6.2 million of them in Kazakhstan, over 1.6 million in Uzbekistan, 900,000 in Kyrgyzstan, 380,000 in Tajikistan, and 330,000 in Turkmenistan. In terms of the proportion of Russians in the population, the order is somewhat different: Kazakhstan 38 percent, Kyrgyzstan, 21 percent, Turkmenistan, over 9, and Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, approximately 8 percent. Proceeding from these figures, Russians represent quite a sizable force. Especially since they are employed mainly in industry, construction, and transport. There are among them many first-class specialists, and their labor creates a proportion of the national income notably in excess of their proportion of the population. But the Russians' political importance far from corresponds to their numbers, educational level, and economic role. It is possible to speak confidently even about their political weakness. To understand the point at issue here, it is necessary to once again resort to figures. In 1989 from 52 to 57 percent of Russians in the republics of the region, or approximately 5 million persons, were first-generation immigrants. Of these, only 1.5 million had lived in Central Asia for over 10 years. The proportion of persons fluent in the language of the titular nation was among Russians negligible: from 1 percent in Kazakhstan to 4.5 percent in Uzbekistan. Central Asia's Russians are weak for the added reason that they do not form communities which are really cohesive on the inside. All too often were they shaken up and shuffled about by the Soviet authorities. They are socially disconnected, they have not generated their own traditions, and they have no experience of joint struggle for their rights and interests. Russians' adaptation to the new situation is complicated by their milieu also. It is oppressing the Russians and pushing them out. There is much in this pressure that is unpremeditatedly transient. But people usually judge the future by what the present is like. And it is not inspiring. It is not even a question of economic difficulties and the slump in the industries in which Russians are employed or the everyday manifestations of nationalism. Russians are prepared to put up with all this. When they leave the region, it is other factors that are of decisive significance. First factor. A new role appeared for Russians with the proclamation of independence. Inasmuch as a whole number of support structures of the new statehood may be supported only by them as yet (the energy complex, defense industry, the borders, technological continuity), the viability of the states of the region and, with it, the stability of national power, essentially depend on the Russians. The politicized groups of the indigenous population understand this full well. But they see the stabilizing role of the Russians both as a good thing and as an evil--a threat to their plans for the building of strong states of the titular nations. And they calculate: Lest we in time come up against the Russians' organized resistance to state nationalism, it is not enough preventing them from creating their own parties. It is necessary in addition by way of preemption to close all potential schools of solidarity. Consequently, no "Russian communities," "Russian universities," and so forth. Second factor. Actual policy in the region is not European, and not even Russian. Underlying it is the struggle between local-cultural communities (journalists have christened them "clans") for power and resources. It is not aimed especially against Russians; nonetheless, it excludes them from unofficial policy simply automatically, on account of their being "nontitular." And at this time the power structures are quietly being "purged" of Russians within the framework of official policy. There is just one outcome: In the face of rivals, Russians are left without connections, allies, or sponsors, in the face of the authorities, without the means to block unacceptable decisions. This is engendering in the Russians a sense of a lack of political protection and discrimination, and it cannot be dispelled either by formal legislative guarantees of equality or by reassuring statements of presidents. Third factor. Each new state of the region and the region as whole have not achieved genuine political stability. A modern political culture is far from developed here. Titular nations have not been formed completely, and they have long-standing claims on one another. Despite the ostensible splendor, not all is operating smoothly in interstate relations, either. Together with the growth of the political nationalism of the titular nations, an increase in the attraction of the indigenous population to Islam--a religion disposed toward active interference in policy--has also emerged in recent years. The influx into the cities of rural youth with a low educational level has increased. It is seeking for itself a place in the sun--but the place has been taken by Russians! As the experience of the Third World has shown, it is among the socially unsuccessful young migrants that xenophobia rapidly develops and the propaganda of "simple" solutions to complex problems finds a response. All this is making Central Asia a place of the dangerous concentration of possible conflicts. And recollections of what these conflicts might be like are still fresh: the conflagrations in Fergana, the Osh beatings, the blood, plunder, and devastation in Tajikistan.... When stability is real, representatives of the minority, thinking of the future, may be guided by sober calculation. When it is only apparent, rational considerations frequently give way in the face of a fit of emotion and an endeavor to save oneself, not counting personal cost, from the oppressive threat of violence. Security Is Not Guaranteed It is obvious from what has been said that Russians are making their continued stay in the region dependent on how the problem of their security is resolved. Three aspects of security are for them most important of all here: cultural security, political security, and physical security. If they are guaranteed, the majority of Russians will remain where they are. Russians are united as yet mainly by objective similarity of situation, and they are seeking not so much joint (group) security as personal (individual) security. The best evidence of this is their behavior: they are acting like people deprived of collective support, and each is relying on himself. And the Russians are primarily walking away from conflict situations. This, incidentally, is one of the main reasons why there have as yet been no bloody clashes between Russians and representatives of the titular nations in Central Asia. But the Russians are leaving. And no difficulties are stopping them. Even though the prices of Russians' apartments have fallen and hosts of bribe-takers are swarming all over the emigrants, even though things are difficult in Russia with regard to accommodations and jobs, Russians keep on coming. It has to be acknowledged that the masses of Russians have decided that they have no way of achieving personal security other than by making their way to Russia. Is the assertion of a mass departure justified, however? Here are figures for Tajikistan: Since the start of 1989 through the end of 1993, the Russian population declined fourfold. Some 85,000-100,000, the majority of whom are simply not in a position to leave--they have no money--have remained. Of course, the flight of Russians from Tajikistan was provoked to a large extent by the civil war. But let us take neighboring Kyrgyzstan, where political stability has been maintained thus far and where, incidentally, the sole Slav university throughout the region has been inaugurated. In 1989 the net migration exodus of Russians was 2,200 persons, in 1990, 16,300, in 1991, 17,400, in 1992, 48,500, and in nine months of 1993, almost 60,000. In five years the Russian minority has "thinned" by 20 percent, and the average annual growth of the migration wave in 1990-1993 (after it had suddenly soared, that is) was 170 percent! If this trend continues even in a modified form, there will by the end of the century be no Russians left in Kyrgyzstan at all. So, according to the most guarded calculations, there are no longer 9.5 million Russians in Central Asia but 8-8.5 million. The rate of their departure is accelerating. Russians can still adapt, their exodus may yet be halted. But support from outside and a policy of protection on the part of Russia are needed for this. Will such a policy be pursued? High officials declared recently that Russia would henceforward take advantage of its position of donor for the protection of Russians in Central Asia. The question of dual citizenship was raised also (and has with Turkmenistan already been settled). In short, Russia has openly proclaimed a policy of the protection of "compatriots" and indicated that it will pursue it economically and by legal means. The adoption of this policy signifies a partial identification of Russia's national interests with the ethnic interests of the minority which lives outside it and which, in accordance with all international rules of law, comes under the all-embracing (albeit not unconditional) jurisdiction of other states. A real danger of Russia's infringement of its neighbors' sovereignty arises. And the main grounds for this is the archaic "common blood" principle, which is rejected by civilized policy. Such an approach will hardly win the support of the international community. It is risky from the viewpoint of regional security also. The Moscow-Kiev-Almaty triangle contains the main potential for stability or instability for the entire former USSR and the geopolitical space adjoining the CIS. Relations with Ukraine have long left much to be desired. But the Kazakhstan leg has not, it would seem, been cause for concern. But Russia's insertion on the political agenda of "compatriots" as a central problem has already shown that this is fraught with complications in relations with Kazakhstan. Nonetheless, the policy of the protection of Russians cannot be rejected out of hand merely on the grounds that it is not defended by legal precedent or that it threatens to harm Russia's relations with its southern neighbors. The problems bequeathed Russia by the unique state of the USSR are frequently without precedent also. So they need to be resolved by us conforming to their essence, to the Soviet historical legacy embodied in them, not merely to fine world standards. Further, since the millions of citizens of Russia who voted for Zhirinovskiy are making of paramount importance the security of "their," Russian, community (rather the security of national prestige, even), it is impossible to continue to pursue as though nothing has happened a policy with the emphasis only on the security of the individual. The main thing is that the problem of the Central Asian Russians really does confront Russia and that the latter must resolve it. The Fourth Path Four paths are theoretically open to the Central Asian Russians: dissolution in the majority (assimilation), return to Russia (repatriation), separation or the acquisition of territorial autonomy (sovereignization), and organic inclusion in the local society with preservation of their ethno-cultural distinctiveness (incorporation). With assimilation, the need for protection evaporates. With repatriation, protection is necessary, but only for the period of immigration. It is far more important to create for the immigrants human conditions in Russia. But it is in this sphere that concern for the "compatriots" is being displayed most niggardly. An emphasis on sovereignization could lead to open and acute conflicts. Considering what has already been said about the Russian minority, it is doubtful that it would anywhere achieve sovereignization with the purely political support of Russia. The sovereignization of the Russians is entirely unacceptable to the local political elites, and for the majority of the indigenous population also, evidently. Resistance to such attempts would be bitter. But then the main role in the protection of Russians would revert to military means, and there would no longer be either personal or group or regional security. There remains only the fourth path, whereby economic and legal means of protection are expedient and paramount--the path of incorporation. Judging by everything, Russia intends on the one hand to push onto it those being protected and, on the other, to constrain its CIS partners to clear this path of various obstacles. But here is the problem: economic and legal protection are painfully different in terms of anticipated effect. The positive effect of economic protection could be considerable. In the event of Russia's skillful use of this lever, the governments of the countries of the region would agree to grant Russians real guarantees of cultural autonomy. There would be a great probability also of an easing of the hidden discrimination against Russians. It would all depend here on whether the Russians themselves could forgo the habits of a client and the ways of an "elder brother," and whether there would be the disappearance in the titular nations of the suspicions that the Russians want not so much incorporation as isolation and that they are pining for their former, exclusive status and could for this reason be a fifth column, the conduits of imperial designs, and so forth. A few words about legal protection. Dual-citizenship agreements would make it a legitimate component of interstate relations, which is very important for Russia. But they are, strictly speaking, important for Russians only inasmuch as they facilitate departure for Russia. Legal protection would do little to help consolidate the Russian minority and its cohesion, however, and could even hinder it. As a whole, whatever accents Russian policy adopts, its results will depend, all the same, on the behavioral responses of Russians and the indigenous population, which is relatively impervious to its influence. This does not mean that a policy of protection is not needed at all. It is simply that it is not possible to expect much. It would most likely stimulate not incorporation, but a gradual exodus to Russia. It would at best postpone the leave-taking of Central Asia of the majority of Russians who live there (this would be its dubious, albeit modest, success), but would under no circumstances put it off far into the 21st century.
