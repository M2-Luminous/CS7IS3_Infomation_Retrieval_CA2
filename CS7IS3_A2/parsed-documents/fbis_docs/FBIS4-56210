He also referred to studies on charging for services which have been designated as nonessential gratuities. He acknowledged that the most controversial point of discussion has been the tax system. [Begin Rodriguez recording] Nevertheless, other taxes are placed on the income of specified citizens who, because of their job or other reasons, obtain incomes that have another level of interpretation. Such is the case, to give an example, of the taxes on self-employed workers who are charged a fixed fee. This measure has been applied nationwide. There are other types of taxes that people pay, which have been discussed. Today, it was reported that the population has paid those taxes and does not question them as much. We could mention the tax on vehicle registration, known as the tax on tags; the tax on documents, which is paid with stamps; the tax to transfer properties, as in the case of inheritances. In other words, there is a series of taxes that the population has been paying and that does not cause so much perplexity among the people. I would say that the highest level of concern has been on income taxes, which have not been supported massively even though some workers have expressed themselves in favor of this tax. [end recording] Jose Luis Rodriguez concluded his intervention today at the ANPP session by stating that these measures would be incomplete without the repression of money hoarders. During a recess of this session, Jose Luis Rodriguez said that the proposals presented by the Ministry of Finances would be implemented gradually, depending on ANPP decisions. [Begin Rodriguez recording] I believe it will be up to the government to examine, in this group of measures which will presumably be recommended by the assembly, their appropriateness according to the timing and the degree to which each one of the measures is introduced. [end recording] But according to the criteria of Cuban economists, the restructuring of domestic finances is not enough to change the current economic situation. Such was the opinion of Manuel Millar, vice minister of finances and prices. [Begin Millar recording] As the workers explained during the workers parliaments, it is about creating the conditions to achieve an increase in production, a higher value of the national currency in order to stimulate more interest and greater productivity and efficiency by the workers. It is not only important to produce, but to produce efficiently, at the lowest cost, trying to do the most with the scant resources we have, to be able to increase our exportable goods and increase the supply of goods and services to the population. Our future success is based on this and the final consequences of all the plans and measures that are being proposed to the ANPP. [end recording] According to specialists, public debate will be vital in achieving political effectiveness in the application of these adjustment measures. Those were the words of Dario Machado of the center of social-political studies. [Begin Machado recording] It is not only vital, but inevitable. Because among the traits of our populations's political culture is the participation in general and national issues. It has been a practice of many years' standing. I can mention the debate of the call to the congress, or the debate for the draft of the Constitution prior to being submitted for referendum, and many other occasions on which the people have had the opportunity to participate. [end recording] Even before the conclusion of the debates, Hortensia Chong, a base-level deputy, commented on the transcendental importance of ANPP decisions. [Begin Chong recording] Our people expect us to reach the decisions that will allow us to establish the conditions so that our country can take off, and we can offer the people better living conditions within the next few months and years. That is why I say that this moment is historic. [end recording] It is significant and distinctive that this parliament began with the intervention of the secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], who explained the results of the public debates, an order that seems logical to observers and essential to the Cuban people.
