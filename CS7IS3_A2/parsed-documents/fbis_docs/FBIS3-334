Nassir claimed that two-thirds of the IPK youth had left the country for Britain as self-made refugees. Addressing a news conference in Mombasa today, Nassir, an assistant minister for information and broadcasting, noted that yesterday's stone-throwing incident in Mombasa was the work of remnants of IPK youth who wanted to create a crisis, which they would use as an excuse to flee the country. Nassir asked the government to investigate cases in which businessmen in the old town of Mombasa were assisting Muslim youths to flee to Britain. When contacted, the British High Commission declined to comment.
