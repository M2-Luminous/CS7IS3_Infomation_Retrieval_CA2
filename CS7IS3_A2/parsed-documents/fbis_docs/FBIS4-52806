FBIS4-52806 "dreas093_j_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 12 May 1994 Indonesia `Attack' on East Timorese Visitors Regretted `Attack' on East Timorese Visitors Regretted BK1305110794 Jakarta ANTARA in English 1822 GMT 12 May 94 BK1305110794 Jakarta ANTARA English BFN [Text] Jakarta, May 12 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Thursday an incident experienced by 41 indonesians on a pilgrimage to a Catholic shrine in Portugal recently was "a matter of great regret." "I am just surprised why the local security authorities had not foreseen the possibility and taken steps to prevent such an incident," the minister said after arrival at Sukarno-Hatta airport from a tour of Eastern Europe, Geneva, and South Africa. "If this is the way Portugal welcomes Indonesians visiting Portugal under the mutually agreed `confidence-building measures' (CBM), we would not have so readily agreed to taking them (the CBM)," he said . Indonesia and Portugal agreed in New York three years ago that they would work towards a comprehensive settlement of their dispute over East Timor by first engaging in so-called "confidence-building measures" which included promotion of informal community-to-community contacts between East Timorese in East Timor and those living in Portugal. Indonesian ambassador for special tasks Lopez Da Cruz who led 41 Indonesian pilgrims from East Timor upon arriving at Lisbon Airport on Tuesday (9/6), had been "attacked" by some irresponsible Portuguese. The delegation is in Portugal to make a religious visit to the holy shrine of Fatimah. Alatas said that Indonesia had always been supporting conducive dialogs that would lead to the settlement of the East Timor issue, among others, by implementing the CBM through "people-to-people contacts". He said the Indonesian people and government had warmly welcomed the visit of 25 East Timorese living in Portugal. On the result of the tripartite meeting among Indonesia, Portugal and United Nations [UN] on the East Timor issue held in Geneva on May 6, Alatas said that the meeting had agreed on taking "progressive steps". "We mentioned some programs that we have implemented in line with the CBM," he said adding that Indonesia also agreed to additional CBM. Alatas said that the U.N secretary general welcomed the London meeting that involved East Timorese figures living abroad with their counterparts living in Indonesia. The UN secretary general would like to see Indonesia and Portugal expand their dialogs by involving more groups that had so far not yet joined the reconciliation dialogs. Both foreign ministers agreed to "take note" of the UN secretary general's wish which means that they "neither support nor reject the proposal", Alatas said. He said that Indonesia, in principle, does not reject a meeting that will involve groups of East Timorese, as long as the meeting is based on the spirit of reconciliation, non-political in nature, and formally dialogic between two communities that have been separated for a much prolonged time. Alatas said that Indonesia would only use the tripartite meeting to achieve a political settlement of the East Timor issue. A settlement process mediated by the U.N would be the only formal dialog, he said, adding that the crux of a solution to the East Timor issue remained to be "in the UN's pocket". "The U.N still terms East Timor as a non-self governing territory and Portugal is termed as the administering power, and therefore we are still being the accused," he added. People-to-people contact may still continue as the channel, he said, while rejecting the idea to make it as the first channel for the two countries to settle the issue. He said that it was not necessary for both foreign ministers as well as the secretary general to take part in such a second channel, adding that any involvement of the three camps will make the channel become formal. "Let the process go on naturally, the three camps should refrain from taking part in it," he added. He said that the recent tripartite meeting also resulted in the Portugal foreign minister's readiness to hold talks with East Timorese that support the integration. On the other hand, Alatas will also be ready to hold talks with groups of people that are against the integration. "Ways and forms of dialogs will be up to both of the foreign ministers," he said. Alatas said that he is ready to talk with anti-integration groups provided that they do not represent any organization or institution. The next tripartite meeting will be held sometime in January next year. Alatas said that the next tripartite meeting will discuss the core of the issue and step up to the exchange of views on the settlement of the issue.
