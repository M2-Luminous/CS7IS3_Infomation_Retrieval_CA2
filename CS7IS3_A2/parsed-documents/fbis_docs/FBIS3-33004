Immediately afterward, his main contender, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, said he regretted the president's anticipated defeat. The first vote will be held on 27 March. Gaviria must garner at least 18 votes. Otherwise, there will have to be a runoff election. [Gaviria] "I will work to make a reality of the Bolivian dream of integration, reflected initially in the creation of a great free zone, which will link the vast territories from Alaska to the Patagonia and which will show the world the grandeur of America." With that as his principal goal, President Gaviria announced his candidacy for the post of OAS secretary general. The consultation phase to present his name for consideration by the countries of the hemisphere began early this year. After requests by countries such as Mexico, Canada, and the United States, Gaviria sent Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin to Central America and the Caribbean to explore his possibilities. Today, he is certain of the support that he has and is therefore running in the race. [Gaviria] "If by the decision of the countries who are part of the OAS the Colombian president is elected secretary general, I would like to see my fellow citizens regard it also as a triumph which undoubtedly belongs to all of us." Gaviria invited his contenders to engage in a calm debate, devoid of rhetoric and without divisions between large and small, or poor and rich countries. [Gaviria] "I have great respect for my contenders. I invite them to express our respective views in such a manner that rather than reflect a race, which would be futile, it will demonstrate our desire to contribute to a prosperous and peaceful future which we want for our peoples." Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus told CMI this evening that he has 20 votes for sure, as opposed to 12 for the president. The foreign minister had this to say: [Niehaus] "The fact that the name of a president, a president as respected as President Gaviria, the president of such a dear and beloved country as Colombia, is naturally.... [pauses] it makes one think about how this process is evolving. How will it continue? Well it will continue with respect for the president, with love for Colombia, but with support for Costa Rica. I have no reason to object to the Colombian president's decisions. What I must do is respect them. I don't think he will do so. If he does, with all due respect, I don't give him any chance." Tonight in Mexico City Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus reacted to the official announcement of the candidacy of President Gaviria. [Niehaus] "I believe that President Gaviria may have 10 or 12 votes. I think that reality has probably been kept from him, otherwise he would not have announced his candidacy officially. We will see the end result five weeks from now." [Unidentified Reporter] "How many votes do you have Mr. Foreign Minister?" [Niehaus] "I have 23 votes at the present time." According to Colombian Foreign Ministry estimates, President Gaviria has 20 votes for sure. That is two more than are needed to be elected on the first vote. Foreign Minister Niehaus today has only 14 votes. Colombian estimates indicate that the Colombian foreign minister's mission in Latin America was successful. President Gaviria has the certain votes of countries such as Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, the United States, Mexico, Peru, and Brazil -- the majority of influential countries in the international context. Meanwhile, Niehaus has the support of Central American and Caribbean countries. Chile has also announced its intention to vote for the Costa Rican foreign minister, but President Frei's inauguration on 11 March could tilt the balance in Colombia's favor. These countries have signed a document of support. Countries that have announced they will change their vote have done so only privately. Publicly, Niehaus, who is on a Caribbean tour, appears to have the majority. There is certainty, however, that when voting time comes around, the name of a president will have more relevance. Today's official announcement was made based on the certainty of triumph. Miguel Angel Burelli, Venezuelan foreign minister, has only the vote of his country and its neighbor, Suriname. With the launching of President Gaviria in the race, the Narino Government Palace believes that the numbers will lean toward Colombia. The results will be seen on 27 March.
