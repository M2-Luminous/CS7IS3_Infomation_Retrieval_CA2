Tariff Agreement for This Year Signed"] [Text] The State Committee for Defense Industries, the Trade Union Association, and the Labor Ministry have signed a tariff agreement for 1994. The Defense Industries Committee expects that industrial policy regarding defense industries will be propped up by due government support and budget financing. The committee is presently trying to identify all the key areas so as to ensure the most efficient workload for scientific and research institutes and design bureaus, and also to utilize the defense industries' scientific-technical potential in a rational fashion. In 1993 the sector experienced a 19.6-percent slump in production against 36.7 percent in 1990; the production of weapons and military hardware fell 34.3 percent against 1992 and 72.4 percent against 1990. The share of weapons and military hardware slipped from 50 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in 1993. The main reasons for the downturn are: a break in economic relations, the unrestrained growth in raw material prices, oppressive taxation policy, and, as a consequence, a huge amount of enterprises' mutual debts. The negative processes under way in the defense sector have been caused by conversion (nearly 70 percent in 1992) and the extremely inadequate financing by the state. Conversion that affects over 5-7 percent of military production is considered destructive in international practice. Corporate profits have been the main source of financing defense industries, accounting for nearly one-half of the cost financing. The Finance Ministry has released only 67 percent of the money appropriated for conversion programs and 23.7 percent of funds to maintain mobilization capacities, but even that was done after long delays. The enterprises have been forced to take bank credits at high interest rates. As a result of this policy of defense sector financing virtually all budget appropriations for government defense orders (99.9 percent) have been transferred to commercial banks and the Russian Federation Central Bank toward repaying the credits. It turned out that the government budget financed commercial banks and the Central Bank, not the military-industrial sector. In fact, the money was simply pumped from the government budget right into the banking system, and the defense sector enterprises worked to boost the banks' profits, not to satisfy the country's defense needs. In the end, defense enterprises ended 1993 with the accounts payable of 3 trillion rubles and the accounts receivable of around 2 trillion rubles. At the same time, while the Russian Federation Defense Ministry technically remains their main customer, it has effectively been replaced as such by the Finance Ministry.
