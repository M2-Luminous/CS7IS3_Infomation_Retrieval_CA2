SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Pub. L. 94&hyph;163, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Pub. L. 95&hyph;619, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) of 1987, Pub. L. 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA 1988), Pub. L. 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), Pub. L. 102&hyph;486, created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products other than Automobiles (Program). 1 The consumer and commercial products currently subject to this Program (often referred to hereafter as ``covered products'') include general service fluorescent lamps and general service incandescent lamps, the subject of today's notice. 1 Part B of Title III of EPCA, as amended, is referred to in this Interim Final Rule as the ``Act.'' Part B of Title III is codified at 42 U.S.C. 6291&hyph;6309. Under the Act, the Program consists essentially of three parts: testing, labeling, and Federal energy conservation standards. The Department, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is required to amend or establish new test procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products. Section 323. Test procedures shall be reasonably designed to produce test results which measure energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual operating cost of a covered product during a representative average use cycle or period of use and shall not be unduly burdensome to conduct. Section 323(b)(3). A test procedure is not required if the Department of Energy determines by rule that one cannot be developed. Section 323(d)(1). One hundred and eighty days after a test procedure for a product is adopted, no manufacturer may represent the energy consumption or cost of energy consumed by the product except as reflected in tests conducted according to the Department of Energy procedure. Section 323(c)(2). However, the 180-day period referred to in section 323(c)(2) may be extended for an additional 180 days if the Secretary determines that the requirements of section 323(c)(2) would impose undue burden. Section 323(c)(3). Test procedures appear at 10 CFR Part 430, subpart B. Labeling rules for household appliances and certain commercial products are administered by the Federal Trade Commission.
