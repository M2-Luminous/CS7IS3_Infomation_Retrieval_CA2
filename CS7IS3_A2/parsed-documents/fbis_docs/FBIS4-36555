Jerusalem believes that despite the fact that King Hassan is still hesitant to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, in his meeting with Foreign Minister Peres last week he agreed to take energetic steps to improve economic relations between the two countries. The Foreign Ministry delegation left for Morocco to prepare for Israel's participation in the talks of the working group on Middle East economic development in the framework of the bilateral talks. The deliberations of this committee will open in the Moroccan capital of Rabat next Thursday and will last three days. This will be the fifth round of talks for this committee, and it will be attended by 30 delegations, 14 of which will come from Arab countries. The talks will mainly focus on the development of regional transportation in the Middle East, and cooperation between the countries on issues of tourism and agriculture. An effort will be made for the first time to informally discuss the institutionalization of cooperation. The Israeli delegation will be headed by Prof. Ya'aqov Frenkel, Bank of Israel governor, and Uri Savir, Foreign Ministry deputy director general. It will also include representatives of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the Foreign and Finance Ministries, and the Bank of Israel. The delegation will also be accompanied by a group of Israeli reporters.
