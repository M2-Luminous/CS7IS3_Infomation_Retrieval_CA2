FBIS4-37678 "drnes121_c_94005" FBIS-NES-94-121 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 Egypt Rift Between `Extremists' Reported Rift Between `Extremists' Reported NC2206181394 Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic 20 Jun 94 p 5 NC2206181394 Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF Arabic BFN [Report by 'Isam 'Abd-al-Jawad] [Text] Divisions that almost led to an armed clash broke out within the extremist groups' ranks in al-Minya last week. The reason was the declaration by over 40 extremists to the security authorities that they have repented and renounced extremist thought. Thus the number of repenters in al-Minya has exceeded 70, most of whom represent the basic figures of the extremist groups in al-Minya's cities, especially in (al-'Adwah) District, where the majority of extremist leaders declared their repentance. This is regarded as the first rift of its kind among the extremists in al-Minya. Reactions by leaders of the extremist groups over the last week have varied. A number of extremists announced in their mosques in al-Minya Governorate their intention to take revenge against the repenters, whom they described as "hypocrites and cowards," and demanded that they be banned from entering the mosques they control. The extremist leaders urged a firm stand against the repenters. Other extremists asked for there to be no battle with the repenters or clashes with them because this would lead to further intervention by the security agencies. For their part, the repenters asked the governorate's officials and security agencies to back them and to protect them against the terrorists' threats. An informed source stated that the repenters continue to flock to the security authorities as a result of the firm, decisive stand on extremism and terrorism and because of the people's awareness in al-Minya Governorate, which differs from other governorates in Upper Egypt. He said last week saw the arrest of 30 extremists and outlaws in the largest ever campaign of arrests in al-Minya Governorate, designed to avert more incidents. ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the Asyut security agencies' Operation "Spencer" against the northern area--which includes the cities of al-Badari, Sidfa, and Abu Tij--managed to exterminate the terrorist elements in that area in cooperation with the Suhaj security agencies. In the last few days the authorities have been able to arrest 80 extremists and to foil a plot to carry out terrorist attacks in the area.
