Goods from Russia constitute over 28 percent of total imports, while the proportion of goods being dispatched from the Baltic state is close to 30 percent. Latvia imports mainly energy and fuel resources from its neighbor -- they form approximately one-half of the import volume. Economists analyzing not only the absolute figures but also their dynamic processes noted long ago that Latvia is moving away from the eastern market and turning sharply toward the West. What is the reason for this strategy? It was with that question that we began our conversation with Valdis Birkavs, head of the Latvian Government. In the premier's opinion, the "attempt to preserve old relations, however tempting that may seem, is doomed to total failure in the future." The Russian market, in his words, is already full of high-quality goods from many countries. Latvian goods, which are inferior to Japanese machinery and German radio equipment, may be in demand in Russia for a couple of years more only because of its market's capacity to absorb them. That would keep local enterprises "afloat" for a while. But then the inevitable collapse would follow. So is there any sense in continuing to create products today with a limited level of competitiveness? Is it not better to embark right away on the socially painful path of reforming the structure of production and seeking to meet the demands of the European and U.S. markets? Valdis Birkavs is convinced that the republic's traditional sectors -- radioelectronics, textiles, and timber processing -- will recover and survive. What about the "RAF" minibus plant in Jelgava? As the head of the government said, the plant has designed a new test model, the "RAF-style," and Russian enterprises will take part in its production. But this program is not going to be implemented until the beginning of the next century. For the moment the plant is living off its accumulated assets and the improvement of existing models. Is politics not proving a hindrance to economic relations between Latvia and Russia? Yes, that is true, Valdis Birkavs agreed, and he recalled the story of the "capture" of two Russian generals. When that incident was over -- as far as the Latvian side and the Russian side were concerned -- there followed what the premier called the demarche of Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces. The colonel general issued an order on the use of weapons in the event of an attempt to seize Russian military installations. Then when it seemed that passions had subsided and the differences of opinion had been sorted out, the "situation was immediately reversed," Birkavs said. The outline of the forthcoming troop withdrawal treaty immediately became less clear and instability crept into the negotiating process. "The disturbance of the foreign economic balance could lead to internal political imbalance and an opposition onslaught after which the resignation of the government cannot be ruled out," the premier said. He added: "The limit of our concessions to Russia has been reached. But the talks must go on even in the present situation, impossible though that may be. There is no other way, the countries will not achieve rapprochement by military methods." During the conversation the question of the situation of people who do not have Latvian citizenship was raised. This affects about one-third of the population. As is well known, officials in Riga have repeatedly asserted that the distinction between citizens and those without citizenship will amount solely to the right to vote or be elected. At the same time the number of laws limiting noncitizens' opportunities in the economic and social spheres is increasing. A second reading has been given to the law on state service, which envisages that only a Latvian citizen may be a state official. Article 35 of the law "On Aviation" says that only citizens may form part of an aircrew. Noncitizens cannot be judges, lawyers, or private detectives, they receive fewer passes, and they get a social pension amounting to 90 percent of the social pensions of citizens. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What is the head of government's view of the opinion of Max van der Stoel, CSCE high commissioner for the affairs of national minorities, that the problem of citizenship in Latvia has not so much a political aspect as an economic one? [Birkavs] I think someone is trying to artificially aggravate this problem. After all, people go where things are best for them. The fact that there is no mass exodus from Latvia demonstrates that various categories of residents are not suffering a marked economic disadvantage. On the contrary, people want to live and work normally here. It takes time and some patience for the solution of the citizenship problem and the adoption of a law. Previously we did not even pay attention to citizenship. Now, however, when this question is constantly being raised, when there is talk about mass deportations, even though no one has any intention of doing such a thing, now people want an anchor in the form of citizenship. Admittedly, there is a certain number of people who want to leave. There are around 150,000 of them according to the statistics of the "Roots" association, which is engaged on the resettlement of people to Russia. Around 30,000 Belarusians and Ukrainians also want to return to their ethnic homeland. They need assistance. If the financial problem is resolved, the voluntary departure of 150,000 people would immediately ease the situation. Of course, the West too could help in that. We have always said that we have three ways of normalizing relations. The first is a very cautious naturalization. The second is absolutely voluntary repatriation to the ethnic homeland with financial support for that process. There is one more way -- emigration to third countries, but that of course will not be large scale. Incidentally, Riga has always been a transit zone from where, by virtue of its liberal conditions, people have after their arrival then gone on to third countries. In meetings with representatives of many states I have always said: Those who want to leave must be helped. I have discussed this with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and at other levels. But there has been no real movement. The process will probably become more active when the army has withdrawn. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What is the attitude in Latvia to Bill Clinton's initiative on the new reconstruction of NATO? [Birkavs] We take a positive view of the "Partnership for Peace" program, it has long-term prospects. It requires resources, admittedly, but nevertheless we will take part in it. Had we already been participants in this program at the start of the incident involving the Russian generals, we could have turned to NATO for consultation because that is envisaged by Article 14 of the "Partnership for Peace" declaration. The proposed mechanism for the peaceful settlement of conflicts is also valuable for us because the problem of security for Latvia will be a very topical one in the next two to three years. Indeed, the time has come to look at the military systems of other countries. We were part of the old, Soviet, system for quite a long time. We did not emerge from it with the fondest memories. Of course, we will look closely at what is happening in the Russian Armed Forces because there are plenty of interesting reforms there. But this is not the right time for military cooperation and joint maneuvers with Russia. First of all we must settle mutual grievances. [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] So that is why you see even Israel and the Czech Republic as suppliers of weapons? [Birkavs] I don't particularly like spending money on weapons. Nevertheless, we need to equip our military forces in a sufficiently organized way and for the fairly long term. We are not preparing to attack anyone. We simply need to have mobile, well-trained defense forces. Compared with European countries our budget has the lowest spending on the needs of the armed forces -- just 1.8 percent. That is clearly inadequate and we, the government, are often criticized for that. Even so, I am confident that Latvia will enter the 21st century not as a country with big military muscles but with the highest level of education in Europe. After all, before World War II we had the highest number of people with higher education (per thousand inhabitants) in Europe. While looking back at the past, we see the future and we see it by no means in a gloomy light.
