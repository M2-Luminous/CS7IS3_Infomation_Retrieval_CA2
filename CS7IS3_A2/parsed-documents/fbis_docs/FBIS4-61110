He told a briefing at the commission today the negotiations with Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin aimed to sign the long-awaited agreement on partnership and cooperation between the European Union and Russia. Although the sides have not finalized all the problems, the commission is optimistic about the agreement conclusion and contacts with the Russian vice-premier will be continued on telefax and over the telephone. In the words of the press secretary, the sides reached good progress in the sphere of nuclear material trade, which is the main of the three problems in the agreement. The rest two -- on sea transport and activities of European banks in Russia -- will be settled as soon as the first problem is eliminated, he noted. It is the matter of a compromise between some members of the European Union, including France, which fear the inflow into the European market of a large amount of cheap nuclear materials, and Russia, who wants to include nuclear material trade in the agreement alongside the trade of other goods, that is without discrimination. The Russian proposal to specify this problem with letters is being discussed. After specific aspects of the draft document are finalized with Russia, the commission will pass it over to governments of the European Union member-states for consultations.
