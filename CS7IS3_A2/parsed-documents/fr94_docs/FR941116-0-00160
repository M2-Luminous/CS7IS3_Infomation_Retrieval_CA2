FR941116-0-00160 FR941116-0-00022 Subpart J_Payment Provisions §1413.100 Determination of farm program acreage. (a) As a condition of eligibility for loans, purchases and payments in accordance with the provisions of this part, the operator must timely submit a report of acreage in accordance with part 718 of this title that lists all crops and land uses which are subject to the ARP agreement for all cropland on the farm for the crop year. Except as otherwise provided in this part, all acreage determinations shall be made in accordance with part 718 of this title. (b) The operator shall designate, on the report of acreage filed in accordance with part 718 of this title, the priority order used to credit the acreage of crops designated for planted and considered planted credit and CU on the farm when there is one or more of the crops of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice. If the operator fails to so designate such acreages to such crops by the final reporting date established for the farm, the county committee shall allocate the acreage of crops designated for planted and considered planted credit and CU to such crops. (c) On a farm, the sum of the acreage of crops designated for planted and considered planted credit and CU credited to the crop shall not exceed the difference between the CAB for the crop for the crop year and the sum of: (1) The acreage of the crop planted for harvest; (2) The acreage which the county committee determines, in accordance with §1413.121, the producer was prevented from planting to the crop due to a natural disaster or similar condition beyond the producer's control; and (3) The acreage which is designated as ACR for the crop. (d) Separate corn and grain sorghum CAB's shall be calculated for the purpose of making deficiency payments in accordance with §1413.105, and for planted and considered planted credit. Producers may plant any combination of corn and grain sorghum on the total of the combined permitted acreages for such crops. (e) The sum of the corn and grain sorghum payment acres for each year, as determined in accordance with §1413.104, shall be prorated to corn and grain sorghum based on the ratio of the maximum payment acreage for the individual crop of corn and grain sorghum, as applicable, to the sum of the maximum payment acreage for corn and grain sorghum established for each crop year. §1413.101 General payment provisions. (a) The payment of any amount which is due the operator or other producers on a farm shall be made only after the producers are determined to be in full compliance with the CCC&hyph;477 and applicable regulations. (b) Except as otherwise provided in this part and in part 791 of this title, no payment shall be made for a farm or to a producer when there is failure to comply fully with the regulations set forth in this part. (c) Subject to the provisions of the maximum payment limitation in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and the payment limitation regulations found at parts 1497 and 1498 of this chapter, the total earned payment due each eligible producer shall be determined by multiplying the payment acreage times the program crop payment yield, times the payment rate, times the producer's share of the crop. (d)(1) In accordance with section 1001 of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, the total amount of certain payments that a ``person'' may receive, in accordance with the programs set forth in this part, may not exceed the limitation of: (i) $50,000 for deficiency and diversion payments; and (ii) Except with respect to honey, $75,000 for marketing loan gains, loan deficiency payments, and emergency compensation payments (increased deficiency payments). (2) The manner in which a ``person'' is determined for these purposes is set forth at parts 1497 and 1498 of this chapter. (e) If a producer declines to accept, or is determined to be ineligible for all or any part of the producer's share of the payment computed for the farm in accordance with the provisions of this section: (1) Such payment or portions thereof shall not become available for any other producer; and (2) The producer who declined payment, or the producer's successor in interest, may request payment no later than December 1 of the year payment is earned.
