He talked to the Commission's Deputy Chairman Henning Christophersen and the Commissary for External Economic Relation Leon Brittan. He told both of them about the economic situation in the Czech Republic, giving them the latest information from the statistical office of a 3.5 per cent growth in the gross national product, and gave them details of the progress of privatization. Pavel Telicka from the Czech EU delegation said Christophersen had told Dlouhy the Czech Republic's approach of firs privatizing state companies and leaving their restructuralization until later was the right one. Christopher added that in countries which had proceeded in the opposite way, privatization had not brought the results expected. Dlouhy discussed specific questions concerning preparations for EU membership, both from the point of view of the Czech Republic and that of the EU. Christophersen assured him that the EU was interested in Czech membership and that it was now analyzing questions connected with the further expansion of the Union. With Brittan, Dlouhy discussed problems hindering trade between the Czech Republic and the EU, and the rules of fair economic competition. He pointed out to Brittan that the latest anti-dumping investigations to be started by EU bodies with regard to the export of Czech cement and foundry iron were entirely ungrounded. He also said that although the Czech Republic could not be shown to be carrying out a policy of dumping, the very fact that investigations had been started would do Czech companies economic damage. He therefore turned to Brittan with a request for the reviewing of the EU Commission's anti-dumping practice. Brittan replied that he was already looking into the question of anti-dumping proceedings against countries of Central and Eastern Europe. He pointed to the necessity of compatibility between the Czech Republic's policy of economic competition and the rules of economic competition in the EU, saying that these policies had to be transparent. In the rest of the discussion Brittan expressed interest in how the Czech Republic dealt with the question of bankruptcies.
