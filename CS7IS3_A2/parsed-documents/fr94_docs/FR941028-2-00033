FR941028-2-00033 FR941028-2-00023 Program Changes (July 1993 to April 1994) After the publication of the original IP in February 1992, additional major reductions in the nuclear weapons stockpile resulted in significant program changes. As a result of these changes, a revised NOI for the PEIS was published in the Federal Register on July 23, 1993 (58 FR 39528). Changes in the scope of the Reconfiguration PEIS reflected the fact that the future Complex could be smaller and more integrated than previously envisioned, and placed increased importance on stewardship of existing special nuclear materials. During the public scoping period from July&hyph;October 1993, many members of the public questioned why the Department planned to analyze new nuclear weapon facilities in general, and new nuclear weapon component fabrication facilities in particular, given the lack of requirements for new nuclear weapons and an otherwise limited workload. There was a perception among many members of the public that evaluation of new facilities in the PEIS indicated an intention to construct those facilities in a predetermined time frame. Based upon this feedback, and a resulting reevaluation of known and projected requirements for weapons complex work for the next decade, the Department believes that the lack of any foreseeable need for new nuclear weapons, together with higher priority budget needs (both for the Department and the Nation), make it unnecessary and inappropriate to consider most types of new weapons production facilities, except for tritium facilities, at this time. Moreover, the Department has been directed, both by the President and the Congress, to establish a program for maintaining the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing. This new program, entitled Stockpile Stewardship, is expected to require new diagnostic facilities and capabilities. As described above, efforts to formulate a new proposal for Stockpile Stewardship and Management will be initiated in 1995. In addition, a new, separate project has been initiated by the Secretary of Energy to consider alternatives for: (1) long-term storage of separated fissile nuclear materials (primarily plutonium and highly enriched uranium), whether stored for defense purposes or surplus to defense needs; and (2) disposition of surplus fissile nuclear materials. The environmental impacts associated with these options are being analyzed in the Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable Fissile Nuclear Materials PEIS, currently in preparation. The establishment of that project has further reduced the scope of the previously-envisioned Reconfiguration PEIS. Current Proposal for Tritium Supply and Recycling The proposal for tritium supply and recycling includes the evaluation of technology and siting alternatives. The Department intends to identify a preferred technology and siting alternative in the Draft Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS. Four different technologies to supply tritium in a new facility will be assessed in the PEIS: Heavy Water Reactor (HWR); Modular High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (MHTGR); Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) [both a large reactor design and a smaller reactor design]; and Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT). Currently, five candidate sites are being considered for new tritium facilities: the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL); the Nevada Test Site (NTS); the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) in Tennessee; the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas; and the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina. The tritium recycling mission includes removing, separating, and purifying tritium gas contained in tritium reservoirs from returned weapons, receiving new tritium from the tritium supply plant, blending the recycled tritium and the new tritium, and loading the tritium mixture into new or used reservoirs for shipment to the Pantex Plant for weapons assembly operations. Currently, tritium recycling is conducted at SRS. If a new tritium supply facility were to be located at SRS, tritium recycling would stay at SRS and be upgraded. If a tritium supply facility were constructed elsewhere, either a new tritium recycling facility would be collocated with it and the facilities at SRS phased out (thus terminating the defense mission at SRS), or the tritium recycling facilities at SRS would be upgraded. No-action alternatives for each of the sites where tritium facilities may be located will provide a baseline for comparison of the environmental impacts. Additionally, the Department intends to include, in the Tritium Supply and Recycling PEIS, an assessment of the environmental and institutional impacts associated with using one or more commercial light water reactors for tritium production as a contingency in the event of a national emergency.
