However, because no agreement was reached, the sides decided to meet again on 16 March. Therefore, it seems certain that the third round of DPRK-U.S. high-level talks slated for 21 March will be postponed. A high-ranking government official said on 12 March: "Even if complete agreement were reached on 16 March on the exchange of special envoys, it really quite difficult for the exchange of special envoys to take place before 21 March. Because it was decided to hold the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks after the exchange of special envoys, it is certain that the DPRK-U.S. talks slated for 21 March will be postponed." The official added: "Regarding the content of the 12 March South-North contact, even if the 16 March contact was successful, the exchange of special envoys could not be possible before 26 March, which our side is calling for; or 31 March, which the North Korean side is calling for. It is believed that the United States will hold another New York contact with North Korea to adjust the date for the third round of DPRK-U.S. high-level talks to after the exchange of South-North special envoys takes place." During the 12 March South-North contact, the North Korean side proposed to announce a "joint communique" saying that an agreement has been reached on the willingness to exchange special envoys between the two sides. Our side, however, rejected such a proposal. In a news conference after the contact, our side's senior delegate, Song Yong-tae, said: "Because reaching an agreement on matters of different opinions is not a simple task, we cannot be optimistic about the exchange of the special envoys issue."
