In general terms we are a clean country and that is why we reject such slander, Colombian Ambassador in Washington Gabriel Silva said. We will not remain indifferent nor will we allow these charges to prosper. Many innocent persons have died and we are not going to trample on their memories, he said. The government expressed its concern and disagreement with the accusation that the entire country is corrupt and that the presidential candidates receive support from the mafia. According to the U.S. Congress, this accusation is based on confessions by former Medellin Cartel member Gabriel Taboada. The ambassador described those hearings and the statements by the drug trafficker -- who is a witness for Senator Kerry -- as inadmissible. He also lamented that all of this has weakened the war on drugs. Ambassador Silva said the accusations by this convict are an affront to the families of thousands of brave Colombians who have lost their lives in this war on the mafias. He said the mere use of Taboada is a clear sign of how Congress' watchdog function has been sidetracked, something that will affect our capacity to learn about the reality of the war on drugs. Apparently the only firsthand information this drug trafficker has goes back to the mid-1980's, but he was nevertheless allowed to question the integrity of an entire country, which is known in the whole world as a leader in the struggle against drugs, Ambassador Gabriel Silva said.
