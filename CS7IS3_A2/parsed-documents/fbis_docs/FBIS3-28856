With their headstart and good relationship with the Vietnamese, the companies here believe they can only benefit from the greater influx of U.S. technology, funds, and resulting business activities. One such company is Asia Pacific Breweries [APB], which has a U.S.$22-million (Singapore $34.76-million) brewery investment in the country. Said its spokesman: "We welcome the competition as this will encourage the beer market to grow even faster. We will certainly be working harder, but at the end of the day, APB can only benefit from such accelerated growth". Sembawang Engineering's executive chairman, Mr. Cheong Quee Wah, said that there will now be additional sources of technology and funds for infrastructure projects in Vietnam. He added that there is enough business for everyone there. He said that Sembawang Engineering, which is developing an $80 million [Singapore dollars] power plant there, has established close relationships with the Vietnamese, and could even co-operate with American companies in infrastructure projects in the future. The Koh Brothers Group, which has just completed a hotel project in Ho Chi Minh City and is planning to work on road and canal projects there, also sees only greater opportunities. Its business manager, Mr. Joseph Koh, said: "The lifting of the U.S. embargo will help to increase all business activities in Vietnam, and we believe that as one of the early birds, we have developed a knowledge of business practises there." Mr. Jen Shek Voon, a director of Ernst & Young Consultants, believes that Singapore can now capitalise on its reputation as an honest broker and effective deal maker in Vietnam better than anyone else. "Finally, all Singapore-based companies will be able to utilise the excellent government-to-government relationship that we have with Vietnam," he said. Agreeing, Mr. David Howell of international law firm Baker Mckenzie said: "Singapore is well placed to take advantage of its partnering strategy with multinationals to penetrate Vietnam". And Ms. Cheah Swee Gim, a partner with local law firm Chor Pee & Co. said her firm was confident that it would hold its own against U.S. law firms going into Vietnam. "Some potential foreign clients have told us that they think a Singapore law firm understands the social and bureaucratic culture of Vietnam better than others," she noted. Chor Pee opened licensed representative offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City last May, and is looking to employ more lawyers to work there, she said. But of course the outlook for Singapore companies in Vietnam is not all rosy. Cycle & Carriage Ltd [CCL], while bullish on its 50-percent stake in a joint venture to operate a car rental fleet and build a modern vehicle workshop in Ho Chi Minh City, sounded a cautionary note on broader business prospects there. CCL director Philip Eng cautioned that "progress in a socialist environment will be slow and real progress will only be seen at the turn of the century".
