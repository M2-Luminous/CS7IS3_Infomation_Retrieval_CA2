The shelling was part of the defiant response by Bosnian Serb fighters to the NATO action in Gorazde. The Bosnian Serbs have since also held UN blue helmets hostage, shelled Tuzla airport, which is under UN control, and launched attacks on Gorazde, officially designated by the United Nations as a "safe" Muslim enclave. Opponents of any form of military support for peace diplomacy can take the Serbian response as proof that they were right and claim that military action leads to more and not less violence. Such reasoning takes little account of two years of war misery in Bosnia. For almost two years the European Union [EU], the United Nations, the countries which have sent blue helmets to Bosnia, have limited themselves to talk and negotiation. The EU and UN resolutions were not backed up by any credible threat, the blue helmets provided no deterrent. The success of "peace diplomacy" has been far from impressive. The single ultimatum regarding Sarajevo produced more results than the endless rounds of talks in Geneva. A mistake has certainly been made with respect to Gorazde. Not by launching air strikes against the Serbian troops who were in the process of overrunning this Muslim town, but by doing so too late, when the possibility of producing a "Sarajevo" effect was lost. The bungling over Gorazde once again shows how necessary it is to achieve the right mix of diplomacy and deterrence, in order to use the latter in the interest of the former. By allowing doubts to exist regarding the commitment of the UN and NATO, the peace process has again been thrown out the window. In the meantime, the taking of blue helmets as hostages in Bosnia by the Serbs, and their shelling of safe havens, once again places a large question mark over UN peace missions in areas of conflict. The unclear nature of the mandate under which peacekeeping troops are sent into areas where there is no peace to keep, the slow UN decisionmaking process, the abiding by rules which have nothing to do with the situation in the field -- all these elements threaten to seriously undermine the credibility of UN operations. Bosnia, Rwanda, Somalia are the most flagrant examples. In Bosnia it had long been clear that sending in blue helmets was more of an excuse for failing to get seriously involved with the problem than a remedy. The blue helmets had to look on powerless at the misery of war, and became targets themselves. But their very presence was used as an argument for not taking stronger action against the aggressors, for fear of reprisals against the blue helmets. If the UN peacekeeping troops thus become part of the problem in an area of conflict rather than part of the solution, then peacekeeping is clearly due for new rules and a more decisive and preventive approach. In the meantime, the United States and Russia, which have played the leading roles in the peace process in Bosnia, must ensure that the Bosnian Serbs respect UN troops and resolutions, and thus restore interest in a peaceful solution.
