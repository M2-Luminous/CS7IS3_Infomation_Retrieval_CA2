The regulation states: The old-age insurance system should be applied to all the staff members and workers of the urban collective enterprises below the county level, those of private enterprises, and self-employed laborers. These staff members and workers and self-employed laborers, aged 60 or over in the case of males and aged 50 or over in the case of females, who have paid the basic old-age insurance premiums for five years or more will be able to enjoy the basic old-age pension, subsidies for medical expenses and funerals, and pension or relief funds for supporting dependents. The basic old-age pension is made up of two parts. One is a fixed percentage of the average monthly wage of the province in the year before the staff members and workers are retired. Those who have paid the insurance premiums for 15 years or more will be paid 25 percent of the average monthly wage; those who have paid the insurance premiums for 10 to 14 years will be paid 20 percent; and those who have paid the insurance premium for 5 to 9 years will be paid 15 percent. The other is 1.4 percent of the average monthly wage based on which the premium is paid for every year of the period when the insurance premiums are paid. The basic retirement pension will be appropriately adjusted according to the average wage increase of society in the preceding year so that the staff members and workers can share the social development achievements. Regarding the collection and management of the old-age insurance funds, the regulation demands: The basic insurance premiums paid by units should be no less than 18 percent of the total payroll, and individuals should pay 2 percent of their actual monthly income every month. The old-age insurance funds should be deposited in the special bank accounts and used as insurance funds only. No tax, fee, or funds should be charged from them. The basic old-age insurance premiums paid by units and individuals are recorded in the unified "workers' old-age insurance booklets" of the country, which will be transferred when staff members and workers are transferred, and the length of payment before and after the transfer will be calculated together.
