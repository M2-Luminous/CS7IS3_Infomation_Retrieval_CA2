The new proposal calls on Serbs to withdraw their heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo, while Russia dispatches 400 soldiers, now serving in the UN Protection Force in Croatia, to Sarajevo to guarantee the peace. Karadzic made the announcement after meeting outside Sarajevo with Russian presidential envoy and Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. During the meeting Churkin gave Karadzic a letter from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. According to Serbian sources, Yeltsin asked the Serbs to withdraw their heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo immediately in order to avoid bloodshed and establish peace in Sarajevo and all of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic described the Russian proposal as "helpful and constructive" for the peace process. Churkin said that Russia's proposal will end the possibility that any side in the Bosnian conflict will gain the upper hand. He also expressed the hope that the Bosnian Muslims would also accept the Russian proposal. He pointed out that the UN Protection Force in Bosnia should fulfill its peacekeeping duties and supervise all sides in the conflict. The overwhelming opinion here is that NATO will not carry out air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions since all the conditions required by NATO have been met.
