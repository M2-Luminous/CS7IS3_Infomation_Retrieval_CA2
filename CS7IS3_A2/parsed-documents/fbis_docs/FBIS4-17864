A NATO parliamentary delegation headed by Bouvard was received by Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko Wednesday. According to Bouvard, Russian deputies' controversial attitude to Russia's joining the NATO Partnership for Peace program was mainly explained by the internal situation in the country rather than foreign policy matters. At the same time, Shumeyko said that Russian politicians' speculation about and attitude to the subject were mainly caused by insufficient and incorrect information. "In addition, this issue is psychologically difficult for citizens of Russia as until very recently the NATO alliance was enemy No.1 for many," Shumeyko was quoted as saying. Nevertheless, "the issue is on the way to resolution," Shumeyko said.
