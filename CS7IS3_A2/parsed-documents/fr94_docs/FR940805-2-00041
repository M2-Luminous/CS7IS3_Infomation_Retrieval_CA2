FR940805-2-00041 FR940805-2-00030 The complaint alleges that the Acquisition, by combining Illustrator and FreeHand, may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in the development and sale of professional illustration software. Under the terms of the proposed Order, the Respondents must divest FreeHand to Altsys Corporation, along with Aldus source code incorporated in FreeHand; the name ``FreeHand;'' the FreeHand customer names and addresses together with FreeHand specific information in the Aldus database; and marketing, advertising, training and technical support information and materials for FreeHand. The Order requires the Respondents to effect the divestiture of FreeHand within six (6) months after the Acquisition is consummated. The Order requires that prior to divesting FreeHand the Respondents shall take all necessary actions to maintain the viability and marketability of FreeHand. The proposed Order would also prohibit the Respondents, for a period of ten (10) years from the date the proposed Order becomes final, from acquiring, without the prior approval of the Commission, any stock, share capital, equity or other interest in any concern engaged in the development or sale of professional illustration software native to the Macintosh or Power Macintosh; or any such professional illustration software or any exclusive license to such professional illustration software, the purchase price of which is $2 million or more. It is anticipated that the proposed Order would resolve the competitive problems alleged in the Complaint. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.
