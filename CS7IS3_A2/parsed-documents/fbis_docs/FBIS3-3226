RCCK Central Committee Chairman Li Peiyao proposed a toast, and said: Promoting the motherland's peaceful reunification is a major task of the RCCK. In recent years, the RCCK has been widely supported for its work in this respect. Within this century, China will resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, and the Taiwan issue will also be placed more urgently in front of the people. The RCCK is willing to join hands with various sectors and jointly contribute toward the great cause in the reversion of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland as well as the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. At the party, people from Hong Kong and Macao held cordial conversations as well as renewed their friendships with leading comrades of the RCCK Central Committee. In addition, they exchanged views on many issues. In an enthusiastic atmosphere, the hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to toast for the motherland's prosperity and the people's progress.
