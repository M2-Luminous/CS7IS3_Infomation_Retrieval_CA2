Cavallo, who yesterday concluded a two-day visit to Santiago, said: "The impressive pace of investment in Argentina has meant a significant increase in machinery imports." He added that the trade balance deficit "does not worry us at all" because imports are financed, and the deficit is being compensated with the capital account surplus of the balance of payments. Cavallo explained that the government of President Carlos Menem is working on the regulations for labor negotiations, which he labeled as "a more flexible operation of the labor market." Cavallo added: "We are addressing health, social welfare, and economic reforms in the provinces. The provincial governments have a great responsibility in the areas of security, justice, health, and education." He asserted that the reforms are greatly supported by the Argentine people, and will continue no matter who heads the next government. He added, however, that if the Constitution is reformed President Menem will probably be reelected. Asked about the fact that Argentina is becoming an example for Brazil, Cavallo said: "The future of the Latin American countries is closely linked, and therefore it is important for everyone that Brazil do well." Cavallo noted: "I believe that being able to contribute our experience to the future of such an important country as Brazil is for me very pleasing."
