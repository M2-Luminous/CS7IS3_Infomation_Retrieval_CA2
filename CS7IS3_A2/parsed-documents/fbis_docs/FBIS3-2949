The latest tour of Israel and Tunisia made by Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev made it crystal clear that Russia has been back to the Middle East peace drive. Since peace negotiations were first set in motion in Madrid in October 1991, Russia's role has not been particularly significant as Russia's participation has only been in accordance with formalities. Now, Russia is not anymore hesitant to take attitudes which are inconsistent with those taken by the United States. It also stressed that it could take advantage of its traditional influence with Palestinians and some Arab countries to help revive the PLO-Israeli peace negotiations, suspended since the Hebron massacre of at least 30 Palestinian worshippers in Ibrahimi Mosque on February 25. Russia has declared that it supports the Palestinian demands of providing protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied lands and has proposed that another international conference, along the lines of the Madrid Conference, be held to break the stalemate of the peace talks, though the U.S. and Israel have rejected this proposal. Kozyrev toured Israel and Tunisia Friday [11 March] for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on ways of continuing PLO-Israeli negotiations, with emphasis on the draft resolution put to the U.N. Security Council on the Hebron massacre. After his talks with 'Arafat, Kozyrev said the PLO chairman has signaled willingness to continue negotiating with Israel, while 'Arafat said that the Palestinian leadership expects obvious and explicit guarantees from the co-sponsors of the U.S. and Russia for safeguarding the Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories as well as Islamic and Christian shrines. As Kozyrev was having talks with 'Arafat in Tunis, Russia's representative to the U.N. put forward a draft resolution on the Hebron massacre to the Security Council. Official Palestinian sources said that the U.S. and Israel said they are not satisfied with the provisions of the draft resolution on the Hebron massacre now discussed by the Security Council, but they are ready to accept it should the PLO be committed to continuing PLO-Israeli negotiations. The sources said that the draft resolution condemns the Hebron massacre, calls for international presence in the occupied Arab territories and urges the Israeli Government to take further measures to disarm Jewish settlers in the occupied lands. The resolution also asks the U.S. and Russia to monitor the implementation of the resolution, which is expected to be voted Monday. Tunis-based Arab diplomatic sources said that Russia's flurry of diplomatic activity in the Middle East can further strengthen the Palestinians' attitude and exert pressure on Israel and the U.S. to help speed up the Middle East peace process.
