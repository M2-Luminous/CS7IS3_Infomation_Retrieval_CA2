Shenin is accused of state treason. Together with Valentin Varennikov and Oleg Baklanov he visited on August 18 the then Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev at his summer cottage in Foros (the Crimea). Shenin said Gorbachev warmly welcomed their arrival and their talk lasted 45-50 minutes in a friendly atmosphere. Shenin emphasized that Gorbachev was aware of the difficulty the country was in and the fact that the signing of the Union treaty would cause the country's disintegration. Shenin said that after the conversation the president approved the introduction of the state of emergency in the country, though he said that the decision should be taken by parliament or the Congress of People's Deputies. Shenin said that in the presence of other plotters, Gorbachev began to write the message to parliament. However, he gave up the idea because he did not want to leave written evidence that he shared the idea of imposing a state of emergency. Answering the questions put by the prosecution, Shenin said that no ultimatums were issued to Gorbachev and that the plotters treated him as the president. According to Shenin, on August 18, 1991, Gorbachev declined Baklanov's proposal to return to Moscow together with the plotters saying he was not well. He claims Gorbachev had done this deliberately wait and see how the situation would develop. Answering the prosecution's questions on the alleged blockade at Gorbachev's dacha, Shenin said that the president was free to do what he pleased. Shenin's interrogation will be continued Wednesday, February 16, at 10 A.M.
