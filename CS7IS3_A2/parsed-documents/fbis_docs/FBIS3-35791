In his opinion, this will not hamper the talks between the interested sides. This is supposedly being done exclusively for self-defense purposes to support the 36,000-strong U.S. military contingent and the South Korean Army. But, as commentators point out, the Patriots clearly will not contribute to the slight progress that had become apparent in the "Korean nuclear problem."
