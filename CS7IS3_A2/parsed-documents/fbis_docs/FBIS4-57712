The dollar is still low and exports have not taken off. In discussing this difficult issue and other related matters, the president of ADEX [Exporters Association], Eduardo McBride, calls for a change--going from a monetary peg to an exchange peg; says there will be an initial cost--a rise in inflation; and calls for economic consensus, the basis for political consensus. His controversial statements follow. [Castillo Ochoa] Unlike the flight of capital from Latin America in past years, we have recently seen an influx of capital from abroad--much of it short term, or "rolling stone" capital, including in our case the repatriation of Peruvian capital. This has kept the dollar low and prolonged the exchange arrears. This tends to favor imports at the expense of exports. What should be done to turn these trends around? [McBride] One consequence of a structural adjustment, anywhere in the world, is that in the first phase there is a combination of exchange arrears and high interest rates. These two elements are very directly related. So we need to attack the exchange rate directly or attack the interest rate indirectly. Obviously, that cannot be done in the short term. But since this process began in August 1990 and so far has had no positive consequences, we believe that both phenomena--the rise in interest rates and the exchange rate arrears--have had too high a cost for the adjustment process. We think this could have been done very early--during the program's first phase, and even up to December 1993. Now we have reached the conclusion that if we continue to maintain the same economic policy we are not going to achieve greater progress with either the interest rate or the exchange rate. We know there are factors affecting the exchange rate, like "rolling stone" capital. Much of that capital, about $250 million a month, comes from Peruvian businessmen who started to return in 1990, either to strengthen their companies, improve their technology, or simply to maintain some level of activity and avert bankruptcy. I personally believe a third of that capital is coming in for speculative purposes. We have heard of Peruvian promoters and bankers who have encouraged the influx of all this capital from abroad, most of which--I believe, though I can not give you a percentage--is Peruvian capital. [Castillo Ochoa] We can understand the reasons for this influx of foreign capital and repatriation of Peruvian capital: economic liberalization, reduction in the price of the dollar, interest rates higher than international averages, etc. But it is detrimental to exports. How do you exporters see the solution? [McBride] We know the economic program has helped us with the readjustment. Inflation has been reduced, and we even had some growth in 1993, though more for temporary than structural reasons, I believe. So it has had some good points. But if our primary goal is the nation's development, and secondly, for exports to be the fundamental factor driving this development, then we need another economic program. [Castillo Ochoa] And what might that be? [McBride] That economic program has two key elements. The first is to change the monetary peg which we have had until now, which affects the Central Reserve Bank's monetary policy. By reducing the money supply and applying strict fiscal discipline, expressed in a national government budget, satisfactory results have been achieved in fighting inflation. But that is not an essential factor now. We need a peg linked to the dollar. [Castillo Ochoa] Going from a monetary to an exchange peg? [McBride] Right. But it cannot be done overnight. And here is the second aspect. As nobody has a magic wand and can say exactly what is going to be done, we have to sit down to talk during the first six months of 1994. People from professional associations, from the universities, from technical economic institutions, associations involved in exports, people in the government. Sit down to think about how the exchange policy can be modified, since there are certain commitments from which we cannot be released--with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund--and they will affect our decisions. We have to talk about how far we can change specific elements, in a gradual way, so the export sector will really provide the basis for economic development. Not because I say so, but because that is what the government itself is proposing now. What bothers me most is that the people running the government, the government leaders, talk a lot about exports as the nation's factor for development, while in practice they work against the companies involved in exports. [Castillo Ochoa] But will going from a monetary peg to an exchange peg cause inflation to heat up once again?? [McBride] Yes, in the first phase it would have a cost. I will not deny that. There was an initial cost in 1990 when the monetary peg was created, when we moved from 300 percent peak inflation in one month. But then the great opportunity for an exchange peg was lost. Well, there is no point in bemoaning that. Doing so now would have an initial cost, of course: a rise in inflation. But I think that can be absorbed. What we propose is to bring everybody together so that cost, which is going to come about in any event, will ultimately produce collective benefits. I believe that factor, that search for dialogue, the appeal to all the technical people, might be a starting point for an economic consensus that can later be transformed into a political consensus. There is no political consensus unless there is first an economic consensus. That is essential. [Castillo Ochoa] That sounds very good. But specifically, now that we have touched on that issue, one thing concerns me. You are talking about a national political consensus, an economic consensus. But some sectors have the impression that Peruvian businessmen are not investing because they do not want to. A little while ago the historian Pablo Macera said that. And President Fujimori repeated it. Is it true that they are not investing? There is great uncertainty about business behavior, which would make any consensus difficult. [McBride] I am going to quote something said by Juan Antonio Aguirre of CONFIEP [National Confederation of Private Business]: "The business community today is in a state of ferment." He said that in the sense of innovative dynamism. It is not only investing what it has, but what it does not have. As a consequence of the structural adjustment, the business community has lost a great deal of its assets. The export sector, at least, has lost its credit capacity. We are no longer very profitable for banks. The export business is not very profitable. The Office of the Superintendent of Banks now demands very strict loan guarantees. We constantly have fewer loan guarantees to offer to the banking system to be able to recover our credit. But even with that deterioration, we are making use of the opportunities and the knowhow we have. I could give you many examples, like the investments in asparagus, the interest of foreign investors in the quality of our skills and the qualifications of our labor, unlike other regions such as Africa, which are suitable for growing asparagus, but where they lack the technical skills and labor capacity that we have in Peru. The conditions are right in Peru, and we Peruvians are investing. I myself am investing in land in San Lorenzo for mango exports. In the past we bought all our mangos from farmers and processed them. Now we are entering a new phase and I think that just as we are investing in agricultural exports, a great deal is also being invested in other fields (textiles, metal, and mechanical products). [Castillo Ochoa] President Fujimori spoke of both foreign and Peruvian investors and compared them, calling upon national investors to follow the lead of foreign investors. [McBride] Foreign investors have a great public image. They are talked about a lot, but we Peruvians invest every day to keep business going. We put our money where our mouth is, as the saying goes. A large part of the capital influx from abroad is from Peruvians who are investing, reconverting, keeping their businesses going, and that is also investment. Let us not disparage ourselves. Nobody talks about us in the newspapers. But we invest every day. When we buy Peruvian products, we are investing. When we process products, we are investing. When we sign a contract for a new unit, we are investing, not just in machinery but also in new jobs. That is not reported in the newspapers, it is not added in, no records are kept, nor is there an economic unit or office in Peru that keeps track of this activity. When we train our employees and send them to take courses at ESAN [School of Business Administration], at IPAE [Peruvian Institute of Business Administration], or at CEADEX [expansion not given], who knows about that? Nobody. Foreign companies have an image, they make more noise; then they sell. They invest 200 million in five years. We invest 200 million in a single year. That is the truth. [Castillo Ochoa] There is an idea that businessmen have been receiving the benefits of a number of different economic incentives. You had been receiving the Certex [Export Certificates]. Now you want a "draw back." [McBride] We are trying to get a tax rebate now. That is clear and specific. Why? For a principle that is generally accepted all over the world: that taxes are not exported. That prevails in Chile, Colombia, the United States, Europe, and Japan. As we pay a single direct tax, we are at a disadvantage in relation to this general principle of market competition. [Castillo Ochoa] The government says that its model treats all economic agents the same, that no agent should have prerogatives over another. They should compete efficiently and let the market decide. [McBride] That is not entirely true. [Castillo Ochoa] Why? [McBride] Because, for example, in tax legislation people who invest in tourism are exempt from the minimum income tax. However, at this time it would cost us exporters 2 percent, unless we are buying new machinery. In that case, we could deduct something. [Castillo Ochoa] There is not equal treatment for all economic agents? [McBride] Until 31 December there seemed to be equal treatment. But now we have learned that until that date reinvestments in the mining sector were completely tax-free. The industrial sector did not have those incentives, nor did the fishing or service sectors. And now they have been eliminated for mining. I think that in terms of promotion, incentives, leadership, orientation, there is instability and total confusion. We know this. We, as industrialists and service exporters, are not interested in hurting mining reinvestments. I am not going to say: listen, why give that to him and not to me? But on 31 December the mining industry was also stripped of its incentives. That seems ridiculous to me. Now they are not giving incentives to mining, to industry, to fishing, to services, or to anyone. There is really no organization. Still, tax legislation to stimulate tourism has come out. That seems welcome and excellent to me. And the tax on unimproved land was removed, and some other advantages were devised for the construction sector. That seems good to me. It seems good that there is movement in the direction of saying: this year we are going to develop our economy, starting with construction and tourism. But why did they not do this with the export sector two years ago? Now it would be leading the nation's development. [Castillo Ochoa] You say that as a national development goal proposal. [McBride] It is. We need a real and integral development plan, which is being denied for totally dogmatic reasons. [Castillo Ochoa] But would not this call for a change or modification in the economic program mean tossing overboard what has been done on exports since 1990? [McBride] I would never support sacrificing economic stability, the adjustment, and the reduction of inflation for some vague benefit. But we should start to think--as Dornbush said in his speech at Catholic University--that continuing to insist on reducing inflation is absurd at this time. I believe that what we need to do is reactivate the economy through exports by resolving the exchange arrears problem.
