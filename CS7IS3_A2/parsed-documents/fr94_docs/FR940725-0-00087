FR940725-0-00087 FR940725-0-00013 •Vocational rehabilitation services that are otherwise available to the individual through a program funded under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 730). Section 9502(j)(1) of COBRA provides that section 9502(a) is effective for services furnished on or after April 7, 1986. Section 4118(j) of OBRA '87 amended section 9502(j)(1) of COBRA to provide that eligibility of previously institutionalized individuals for the expanded habilitation services under a section 1915(c) waiver is determined without regard to whether the individuals were receiving institutional services before their eligibility under the waiver. Section 1915(c)(5) as added by section 9502(a) of COBRA refers to habilitation services, ``*␣*␣* with respect to individuals who receive such services after discharge from a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded *␣*␣*''. In our proposed rule, we interpreted ``after discharge'' as meaning that an individual is discharged directly into a home and community-based services waiver. (Individuals who have never been institutionalized, however, are not eligible for the expanded habilitation services.) This provision was effective as if it were included in the enactment of section 9502(j)(1) of COBRA. As indicated in the Report of the Committee on the Budget to accompany H.R. 3545 (OBRA '87) (H. Rept. No. 391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 537 (1987)), the Congress included this amendment to section 9502(j) because it believed HCFA had misread COBRA in the proposed rule by stating that expanded habilitation services would be provided only to recipients discharged directly from a NF or ICF/MR into a home and community-based services waiver program. In the proposed rule, we included in regulations the provisions of section 9502(a) by_ •Revising §440.180 to provide for the expanded definition of habilitation services under paragraphs (b)(6) and (c); •Adding §§440.180(c)(2) and (3) to provide for the inclusion of prevocational, educational, and supported employment services under a home and community-based waiver and for the exclusion of certain services; and adding §441.302(i) and §441.303(h) to require documentation to support State health and welfare assurances for the provision of these expanded services. •Revising §441.310(a)(3) to provide for limits on FFP for prevocational, educational, and supported employment services. We received the following comments on this proposal: Comment: Five commenters raised issues concerning the expanded definition of habilitation to include educational, prevocational, and supported employment services. Some commenters suggested that HCFA was imposing an age minimum of 22 for the expanded habilitation services. Others stated that our definition of prevocational services was too strict and should be more consistent with section 4442.3(B)(3)(a) of the State Medicaid Manual, which distinguishes prevocational services from noncovered vocational services. (This definition was added in HCFA Transmittal No. 37, issued in September 1988.) Response: We are not imposing a minimum age for the expanded habilitation services. Our discussion of this subject in the preamble of the proposed rule pertained only to the fact that most educational and prevocational services for individuals under 22 years of age ordinarily would be provided under State and Federal programs other than Medicaid. We agree with the commenters concerning the need for more consistency between the regulations defining prevocational services and the related HCFA instructions, and have revised §440.180(c)(2)(i) of the proposed regulations to make the policy consistent. 2. Provisions of the Final Rule We are adopting the proposed regulations as final rules, with the following changes: •We have revised §440.180(c)(1) to provide that a State may provide expanded habilitation services under a new or amended waiver to recipients who have been discharged from a Medicaid-certified NF or ICF/MR, regardless of when the discharge occurred. We have made a conforming change to §441.302(i)(2). •We have revised §440.180(c)(2)(i) to incorporate a provision to distinguish covered prevocational services from noncovered vocational services. •We have revised §441.310(a)(3)(iii) to clarify that FFP is not available for prevocational, educational, or supported employment services, or any combination of these services, as part of habilitation services provided to recipients who were never institutionalized in Medicaid-certified NFs or ICFs/MR. B. Services to Patients with Chronic Mental Illness 1. Background Section 9411(d) of OBRA '86 amended section 1915(c)(4)(B) of the Act by adding day treatment or other partial hospitalization services, psychosocial rehabilitation services, and clinic services (whether or not furnished in a facility) for individuals with chronic mental illness to the list of services specifically enumerated as home and community-based services. Therefore, effective October 21, 1986 (the date OBRA '86 was enacted), States may request that any of the above services be provided under a waiver or renewal of a waiver for persons diagnosed as chronically mentally ill. In the proposed rule, we_
