FR941116-2-00062 FR941116-2-00049 National Park Service Notice of Intent to Repatriate a Cultural Item in the Possession of the Arizona State Capitol Museum, Phoenix, AZ AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior ACTION: Notice Notice is hereby given under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 of the intent to repatriate a cultural item presently in the possession of the Arizona State Capitol Museum, Phoenix, AZ, that meets the definition of ``sacred object'' under section 2 of the act. The coiled basket has a flared shape, plaited rim, and dark brown design of connected diamonds on a light brown background. Four sets of 12 carved and painted sticks are sewn equidistant around the interior of the basket. The basket was purchased by the State of Arizona in 1938 from photographer Edward Curtis. The basket was transferred from the Research Library, Department of Library, Archives & Public Records in 1982 to the Museum Division. Museum records identify the basket with accession number 1982.035.035. Representatives of the Navajo Nation have identified the basket as one needed by Navajo religious leaders for the practice of the Yeibichai ceremony by present day adherents. Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Arizona State Capitol Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between the basket and the Navajo Nation. Officials of the Arizona State Capitol Museum have also determined that the basket meets the definition of sacred object pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(C). This notice has been sent to officials of the Navajo Nation, Ramah Navajo Chapter, and the Colorado River Indian Tribes. Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this cultural item should contact Michael Carman, Museum Director, Arizona State Capitol Museum, 1700 W. Washington, Phoenix Arizona 85007 (602)542&hyph;4675 before December 16, 1994. Repatriation of the cultural item to the Navajo Nation may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. Dated: November 10, 1994 Francis P.
