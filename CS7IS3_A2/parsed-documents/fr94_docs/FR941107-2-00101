N-Bromosuc- cinimide 128&hyph;08&hyph;5 -No testing 6. 5-Nitroindazole 5401&hyph;94&hyph;5 -No testing The ICCEC also recommended that two chemicals, ecdysterone and 2,3-dichloropropylene, be removed from consideration for testing at this time based on lack of evidence of human exposure with the understanding that these chemicals may be reconsidered at a later date if actual human exposure is demonstrated. Interested parties are requested to submit pertinent information on all of the nominated chemicals. The following types of data are of particular relevance: (1) Modes of production, present production levels, and occupational exposure potential; (2) Uses and resulting exposure levels, where known; (3) Completed, ongoing and/or planned toxicological testing in the public or private sector including detailed experimental protocols and results; and (4) Results of toxicological studies of structurally related compounds. Please submit all information in writing (by 30 days after date of publication) to Dr. Zeigler by mail or by FAX, (919) 541&hyph;4704. Any submissions received after the above date will be accepted and utilized if possible. Dated: October 31, 1994. Richard A. Griesemer, Deputy Director, NIEHS.
