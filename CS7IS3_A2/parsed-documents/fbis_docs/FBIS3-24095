At the center of the analysis turns out to be only the fortunate outcome brought about by Russian diplomats, while the prologue, the beginning, the development of the operation and even the culmination (i.e., bringing the NATO bombers into combat readiness) prove to be, as it were, outside the topic. In other words (in an especially striking manner, this distinctive feature is manifested in the analysis given by USSR President [as published] Mikhail Gorbachev on February 22), the Western ultimatum and the Russian shuttle diplomacy are regarded not as interconditional details of one design, but as the opposition of completely autonomous models of conduct. On the one hand, the Serbs are handed by the West an ultimatum insulting to their national honor, on the other--"again in the foggy north one could hear the thunder prophesy: Then, with the cross as his martial armor, the older brother of the Slavonic peoples, stood up." It is possible that the unwillingness to examine the events that have taken place in interdependence is explained by the general principle of the approach to international conflicts, according to which turning to the prehistory is unproductive and only confuses everything and aggravates the problem. Psychologically it is understandable that the desire to get away from a one-sided (or seemingly one-sided) etizatsiya [perhaps etnizatsiya for ethnization] of the conflict: First, in the concepts of guilt and responsibility, then--even completely extra-moral cause and effect categories. As a result, the analysis begins to acquire visible characteristics of an anecdote. In making an expert assessment of the crisis, the deputy editor-in-chief of MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, Aleksey Pushkov (one of the most restrained and conscientious analysts) pointed out, on the one hand, that "the most reasonable and constructive forces" in NATO itself were opposed to a solution by force, on the other--that, without a doubt, the reasonable and constructive Russian mediation could not have succeeded, had it not been supported by the real threat of force in the form of the NATO ultimatum. If the two statements are reduced to one, it is easy to understand that, had the "reasonable and constructive forces" in NATO prevailed, nothing would have come from the no less "reasonable and constructive" mediation of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and this means that the whole Russian "reasonableness and constructiveness" would not have been worth a nickel had it not been supported by the "unreasonable and non-constructive" ultimatum. The paradoxical character of the analysis can be explained if we make a transition from international to criminal law. Russia conducted itself as a juridical subject, bailing out the juvenile hooligan Radovan Karadzic. The reeducation of young hooligans by means of bailing them out in certain cases is quite appropriate. Only it must be remembered that in the absence of the police (i. e., the NATO bombers), which in the beginning was able to stop the hooligan, and inn the future may also interfere if the person bailed out does not justify the trust put in him, the institution of bail loses all meaning. Criminal punishment exists only to the extent to which it has a potential for completely unconditional sanction; if the latter is absent, the former also disappears. Probably, the desire to pretend that this bail was assumed, as it were, per se, and not as the result of the sanction being expected is explained by the deep patriotism of the analysts. In a situation where the threat of force is a decisive factor, the role of a mediator who cannot or does not want to oppose anything serious to this threat usually does not bring great honor, and that is why the desire to suppress for clarity the decisive significance which the threat of military sanctions in reality had, is entirely understandable. Mutatis mutandis, the great successes of Yeltsin--Kozyrev--Churkin are reminiscent of the Peace of Tilsit, when Alexander I also also engaged in the forceful defense of his traditional and very loyal ally, the Prussian King Frederick William. "An ignoble king, an ignoble nation, and an ignoble army, a power, which has deceived all and does not deserve to exist," this is what Napoleon told Alexander about his friend, to whom the Russian czar in his time so touchingly swore eternal alliance and love on the grave of Frederick II. In response, Alexander smiled affectionately and only asked the French emperor "to leave nevertheless something of Prussia, in spite of all of these reprehensible qualities." The monarchical historians, because of the complete uselessness, did not even make special efforts to embellish the sour position in which Alexander I had found himself in Tilsit. The newest historians, in praising the mission of Churkin, are clearly guided by the revisionist poem of Pushkin: "Tilsit! When this arrogant sound is heard, a Russian does not grow pale now." The difficulty of the position of the newest historians lies in the fact that the true significance of the effectively utilized NATO threat of force can be concealed once, while the given method of the pacification of the warring Slavs was very much to the liking of the West, and a repetition is by no means out of the question. To declare that every new Tilsit is a new and still more glorious success of Russian diplomacy will be difficult for the keenest political scientists.
