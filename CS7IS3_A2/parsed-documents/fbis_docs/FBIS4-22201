It is the positive development of this factor in conditions of military service that is the goal of the organs of Educational and Sociopsychological Work [VSPR]. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to improve the performance by the Armed Forces of their set tasks. The part played by the VSPR organs in attaining this end consists of applying measures of educational and sociopsychological influence to affect such a specific indicator as the moral-psychological state of personnel. This indicator is characterized primarily by the fact that it is very sensitive to a large number of factors to which a member of the military is subject. Thus, it is an integrating factor in which numerous components are concentrated. These components involve satisfying various human needs, ranging from the biologically programmed need for security and the need to satisfy physiological needs to the highest spiritual needs. Ultimately, it is this highest level that is decisive in evaluating an individual's moral-psychological state, but this can only be built if there exists a more earthly foundation for it. Thus, considering the complexity of an individual's needs and that the degree to which each is satisfied in turn affects an individual's moral-psychological state, we need to speak of a very broad spectrum of directions in our work, all of them aimed in one way or another at ensuring a satisfactory moral-psychological state of our troops. We need to recognize that some of these directions lie beyond the scope of the jurisdiction of the VSPR organs. But there exists a law that is of fundamental importance to us: Just as certain factors affect the moral-psychological state of the troops, this state itself affects the attitude of personnel to all sorts of factors -- living conditions, the level of danger to life, restrictions in the sphere of social intercourse, etc. The degree to which spiritual needs are developed and an adequate system for satisfying these needs can compensate even for very significant deprivations that are part and parcel of military-professional activity as a whole and engaging in combat [vedennya boyovykh diy] in particular. In other words, a military collective, whose moral-psychological state is at a sufficiently high level, is capable of maintaining it at the proper level on its own. We need only professionally ensure this basic level of development. Once it is reached, universal laws of self-regulation of complex systems begin to operate. Obviously, everything has its limits, and we should know what these limits are and take them into account in our work. The above reflections may seem theoretical, but only at first glance. We are discussing a very concrete issue -- defining the sphere of our practical work and the fundamental methods we must use to accomplish this job. In the most general sense, let us begin with the premise that the sphere of our work is to influence the moral-psychological state, and that the method by which we exert this influence is by directing sociopsychological processes. The moral-psychological state is measured by many individual factors, which in their aggregate create a complex system. One such sociopsychological indicator is the state of discipline of personnel [dystsyplinovanist osobovoho skladu], by which we mean the readiness of each individual soldier and the military community as a whole to abide by the accepted standards of military service: Military regulations, orders of commanders and superiors, directions, instructions, etc. Such readiness needs to be formed on both the conscious and unconscious levels of each individual. This is achieved by combining educational, including ideological, work with sociopsychological influence into an interactive system. Why do we need to speak of such a system? Because the state of discipline is founded on a very wide range of psychophysiological, psychological, and sociopsychological factors. Directly included in the sociopsychological factors are the specific qualities and characteristics of each individual -- his patriotism, convictions, devotion to his Fatherland, etc. The system of educational work is specifically designed to form these traits; this is the goal of professional sociologists [narodoznavtsi], the system of the humanitarian training of personnel, and the like. In other words, those who regard the sphere of sociopsychological factors to be the exclusive sphere of psychologists are very much mistaken. Unfortunately, at this stage, our educational work is mostly confined to simple imparting of information, whereas it should carry some emotional content, draw the soldier into the deepest strata of his nation's historical memory and the worldview of his ancestors, base itself on subconscious national archetypes. Educational work will then produce significantly better results in increasing the state of discipline of military personnel. When working to increase the state of discipline of military personnel, it is necessary to keep in mind that this feature is dynamic -- depending on various conditions, the level of discipline of each individual soldier can change significantly over a short period of time. In particular, the level of discipline can be easily affected by excessive organizational measures conducted by superiors, as well as many other things that can produce a sense of inner dissatisfaction with the situation in which a person finds himself in military service. This dissatisfaction can activate the corresponding psychological mechanisms, but it will require purely organizational rather than sociopsychological measures. There is a direct link between the state of discipline of personnel as a sociopsychological indicator and the general level of military discipline. Increasing military discipline is the common goal of virtually all structures of military leadership; every official bears his own measure of responsibility for this discipline. But the foundation of military discipline in the Armed Forces is the state of discipline of personnel. Can military discipline be maintained at a more or less satisfactory level if the state of discipline of personnel remains low? I should note that that was exactly what we always tried to do by directing all our efforts at increasing military discipline not by forming a sociopsychological characteristic like a state of discipline in personnel, but by creating conditions in which an undisciplined soldier -- that is, one psychologically prepared to violate discipline -- would be compelled to abide by accepted standards because of increased supervision, increased exactingness, etc. Let us be frank -- we are not satisfied with the quality of our contingent of conscripts. Every professional activity is based on the possession of certain individual psychological characteristics by the person performing the activity, and military service is no exception. There exists a so-called professional profile [profesiohrama] of a soldier, which defines the necessary individual psychological characteristics required for normal service. Those individual psychological characteristics that are associated with the state of discipline of a soldier are an essential component of the professional profile and must be studied by experts in the military commissariats in the process of conscription. Thus, the sociopsychological study of a conscript's personality plays an important role in preventing violations of military discipline. This study anticipates an assessment of the candidate's moral qualities, the motives underlying his conduct and activity, his military professional orientation, the way he interacts and behaves in a group, and other individual psychological qualities. The sociopsychological study of individual traits cannot rely solely on information obtained from tests; it must be based on an analysis of the formation and development of an individual. By analyzing an individual's biography, the conditions in which he was reared and his personality developed, it is possible to obtain information about his professional interests, moral principles, character traits, distinguishing features of his emotional makeup, organizational skills, etc. We take into account that the development of personality is affected by the composition of the family, the way in which family members interact, the family's social and living conditions, and the interests and paramount requirements of the family as a whole. Viewing moral qualities as stable features of an individual's conscious mind, which are reflected to a certain degree in his character, during the process of professional selection, the social psychologist makes use of the entire arsenal of psychological methods and methodologies. Based on the results of this analysis, a conclusion is reached regarding the probability of the subject's success or failure to perform under the conditions involved in military service and steps to prevent possible deviations in conduct are recommended. But what can we do in today's circumstances in the event that this prognosis is negative? After all, this individual will still end up in the Armed Forces. The present situation does not allow us to create a professional army, in which recruitment into the military would be conducted on a competitive basis. At present, we take everyone. As a result, we frequently encounter a situation in which we are forced -- metaphorically speaking -- to make a musician out of a deaf man. To continue the same metaphor, all that we can do under the circumstances is not entrust the "deaf man" with a "violin" but with something closer to a "drum." If we attain our goal of increasing the state of discipline of personnel, will this mean an automatic increase in the level of military discipline in general? It should be clearly understood that although there is a direct link between the state of discipline of personnel and overall military discipline, the state of discipline of subordinates is not always enough to compensate for miscalculations in general organizational matters, problems in creating the necessary conditions, etc. Another thing that educators must recognize is that although the state of discipline of personnel is a sociopsychological indicator, this indicator, like the level of military discipline in general, is also affected by factors other than sociopsychological ones. Therefore, the deputy commander in charge of educational and sociopsychological work cannot ignore the wide range of issues that in one way or another involve the interests and needs of the individual. This approach is also reflected in the Temporary Regulations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The practical methods used by the VSPR organs in the sphere that involves the needs and underlying motives of conduct of personnel can vary widely, depending on specific conditions and practical possibilities. The temporary failure to satisfy one need can be compensated by satisfying another need, which a military psychologist and educator can ensure in a timely fashion. The fact that there are certain restrictions in military life can be accepted more readily by personnel if the system of motives is influenced in a proper professional manner. In certain conditions, the professional responsibility of a VSPR official may require candidly telling a superior about the range of possibilities in educational work and sociopsychological measures. It is, after all, possible to create a situation in which a person will basically refuse to execute every single order unless hypnotized to do so. The VSPR organs must anticipate the dynamics of the moral-psychological state of personnel under the influence of the system of dominant factors and respond in timely manner to potential problems. Work that is oriented on a conceptual approach to increasing military discipline by VSPR organs through influencing the state of discipline of personnel must be based on a scientifically founded sociopsychological system as an adjunct of military service. Allow me to list the main requirements of such a system. It should provide for unified algorithms of activity on the part of VSPR professionals, taking into account the specific features of the sociopsychological characteristics of soldiers at various stages in their service, the psychological laws of group dynamics in military subunits, the laws underlying the impact of factors characteristic of military service on the individual at various stages of military service, and the like. The system of the sociopsychological adjunct of military service must resemble a production flow chart [tekhnichna karta] of the work of VSPR professionals, which takes into account the actual level of training of military specialists by providing several alternative methods of work. There should be a base variant, which could be introduced immediately at the level that we have today, as well as alternatives involving a higher level, which, in addition to the basic measures that use the popular methodologies "Prohnoz," KOS-KOR, sociometrics, and some others, would also provide for the use of a higher degree of psychological manipulation. An understanding of all these elements focuses our attention on our scientific base. What kind of base do we have today? We do not have a single up-to-date textbook on psychology for the military that would meet world standards in this field. In fact, we have no Ukrainian handbooks at all. Almost nothing is being done to train our own scientific cadres for the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the fields of educational work and meeting the sociopsychological needs of personnel in the districts and branches of the Armed Forces. Another problem that we encounter in introducing modern scientific approaches in the work of the VSPR organs is the need that they be based on what I would call an adequate level of civilization in both society at large and the military environment. Our sociopsychological measures must be based on a certain level of understanding on the part of all officials of the specific features of our professional activity and on a proper attitude towards this work, on a readiness to introduce modern social techniques and "sophisticated" methods of influencing the moral-psychological state of our troops. This requires that we provide proper training not only for our specialists, but also for our entire officer corps, starting from the time they are attending military educational institutions. All this lies in the future. But it requires that we take certain practical steps immediately. We need to encourage the directors of the Scientific-Research and Methodological Center of the Main Directorate of Educational and Sociopsychological Work of the Ministry of Defense to devote very serious attention to this matter. I expect them to provide teaching manuals for the forces that have been prepared on a modern scientific level and a detailed sociopsychological system of support in military service, which we need to begin introducing in stages in the Armed Forces starting now. In addition, we are waiting for a prospective program [perspektyvna prohrama] developed jointly with the Defense Ministry's Main Directorate for Military Education for providing officers in command cadres with basic sociopsychological training. Any assessment of the contribution of the VSPR organs to increasing military discipline must be based on an assessment of their actual contribution to raising the level of the state of personnel discipline -- i.e., what concrete steps were taken towards this end. But this general assessment needs to be made more specific. It is not enough to simply add up the number of measures that were applied in evaluating the activity of VSPR organs. We have something different in mind. First, all measures used in educational work and sociopsychological support must be combined into an integrated system, in which everything is interconnected. In other words, in order to assess the work of the VSPR organs, it is necessary to establish the degree of conceptual uniformity in the measures applied. Second, it is necessary to assess the justification for every measure and its specific objective. The specialist must understand clearly why at any given moment he applies a specific measure and to a specific extent. Third, each measure applied by the VSPR organs must be assessed in terms of how well it meets professional standards, as well as how effective it is in accomplishing its designated purpose. Fourth, it is necessary to take into consideration to what degree the measures applied by the VSPR organs reflect all the directions of our work, beginning with the methodological and experimental spheres and ending with that of individual education. Fifth, VSPR professionals must posssess thorough and comprehensive information about the real state of affairs in their sphere. This set of indicators of the activity of the organs of the VSPR makes it possible to give an objective and integral assessment of the quality of this work. Simplifying the system of assessment, reducing it to merely quantitative indicators, cannot be allowed, because this will inevitably lead to a surrogate level in practice. Another vitally important question concerns the ways in which the VSPR organs make a practical contribution to the overall assessment of the state of military discipline as a basis for planning further work in this field. Only those categories that belong to the sociopsychological field can be subject to sociopsychological analysis. With respect to military discipline, this category is the state of discipline of personnel. Thus the role of the VSPR organs in the overall assessment of the state of military discipline is to conduct a thoroughgoing professional assessment of the state of discipline of personnel, which must be based on: -- a general statistical record of violations of military discipline, which are kept by the military staffs; -- a legal analysis of the situation, which is conducted by the legal specialists in the VSPR organs; -- an understanding of the social processes in the Armed Forces arrived at with the help of sociological studies; -- a deep understanding of the psychological and psychophysiological factors that operate in military subunits and affect the level of discipline; -- the results of a study specifically designed to analyze the level of the state of discipline of personnel in units and subunits using the methods of sociopsychological research. We have already discussed how this can be done. Thus, only a scientific approach, based on an analysis of the daily activity of the VSPR organs, can bring positive results in the activity of professional educators and promote a high level of discipline among personnel.
