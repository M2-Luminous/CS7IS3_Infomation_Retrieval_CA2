Ruben Pineda, president of the Salvadoran Coffee Council, has told ACAN-EFE the coffee-exporting countries, headed by Brazil and Colombia, have decided to end the retention, because the pound of the bean has exceeded the minimum price of 80 cents on the world market. "We received the notification at our offices this morning from the retention plan coordinating office, located in New York, stating there would be 0-percent retention as of today," Pineda has said. The retention plan of the approximately 30-member APC countries started on 1 October 1993, negatively affecting 20 percent of the coffee production in each country, but due to the success of the measure, producers decided to reduce retention to 10 percent only four weeks ago. Pineda has said the lifting of the retention plan "is good for our country, because we have reached a good level of prices on the world market," and he added El Salvador has only approximately 500,000 quintals (22,727 tons) currently retained.
