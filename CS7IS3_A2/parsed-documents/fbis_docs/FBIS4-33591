However, the highest-ranking military commanders and Defense Ministry officials went ahead with the tour on Wasmosy's agenda. With the president missing, the attention fell on General Lino Oviedo, who briefed the other generals on work to improve conditions in Chaco barracks. The delegation included Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia; Anibal Pangrazio, director of the National Commission for the Development of the Chaco Region; Vice Admiral Eduardo Gonzalez Petit, military forces commander; Division General Pedro C. Ocampos, chief of the General Staff; Division General Jose Cespedes Zarza, Air Force commander; and Vice Admiral Flavio Abadie, national Navy commander. During a meeting with reporters, Gen. Oviedo, who was accused in the past few days by his own fellow political party members of acting in partisan politics and of supporting the candidacy of Atilio R. Fernandez for the presidency of the ANR [National Republican Association--Colorado Party], said those who accuse him must present proof of his alleged participation in politics. Oviedo said he has nothing to do with Colorado Party presidential hopefuls and reiterated that those who accuse him must present proof of what they allege. He said in a well-prepared conciliatory tone that he had nothing against officialist Deputy Luis Becker, who last weekend accused him of protecting criminals and corrupt individuals. Oviedo also said he did not have anything against Juan Carlos Galaverna, the other presidential hopeful, who accused him of participating in a political meeting at Paul Sarubbi's private residence on 1 June that also was attended by Atilio R. Fernandez and urban transportation entrepreneurs who allegedly committed their buses to transport Atilio R. Fernandez supporters.
