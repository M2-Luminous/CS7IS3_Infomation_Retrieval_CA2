Russian Special Service Leaders Go Public"] [Text] Boris Yeltsin signed the "Statute on the Russian Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service" on 5 January. The new special service did not keep journalists in an agony of suspense but held a press conference straight after the Orthodox Christmas holiday. It was stated at the press conference that Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] is the legal successor to the Security Ministry but is in no way "a clone of the disbanded ministry since it is a...special service" (and what was it, then, we had before?). The FCS' main mission is to detect, prevent, or stop intelligence and subversive activity directed against Russia by foreign special services and organizations; to combat terrorism, the illegal trade in drugs and weapons, and illegal armed formations; and to ensure the day-to-day protection of Russia's state border. Twenty foreign spies were caught red-handed in Russia last year. Several state officials recruited by foreign special services have been dismissed from their posts on the submission of the former Security Ministry's counterintelligence service. The reorganization of the Security Ministry and the creation of the FCS is in full swing: Among other things, the former Security Ministry's investigation administration has been transferred to the General Prosecutor's Office and the Lefortovo detention center transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs; certain special operations subunits have moved to the Federal Government Communications and Information Agency; and the fight against organized crime and racketeering (apart from corruption in the top echelons of power) has been handed over completely to the militia. On the other hand the Alfa and Vympel special antiterrorist subunits remain part of the president's Main Protection Administration. As FCS First Deputy Director Sergey Stepashin stated, "the preconditions for political investigation to arise have been completely eliminated." However, he did advocate the creation of an internal intelligence service (and is that not the same thing?). The FCS' strength will, compared with the Security Ministry, decrease by 46 percent and amount to no more than 75,000 staffers countrywide. However, there will be no cuts in counterintelligence operational subunits, which are under strength. All the special service reforms will be completed within one month of the statute being signed. According to Sergey Stepashin, the special assessment commission now operating in the FCS will carry out the reassessment of cadres within one month. The central apparatus will be slimmed down from 3,500 to 1,500 persons. As Sergey Stepashin observed, President Yeltsin in a conversation with him, drew attention to the fact that there have been no purges whatsoever in the process of reorganization and cadre selection has been carried out on the basis of qualities such as professionalism and loyal service to the fatherland and the state. As far as staffers who fail the assessment are concerned, they will not, as Sergey Stepashin stated, find themselves without a job but will be able to transfer to the Internal Affairs Ministry, the tax police, or the General Prosecutor's Office.
