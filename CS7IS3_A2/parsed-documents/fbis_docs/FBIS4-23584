Speaking at a press briefing at the Executive Mansion, Chairman Kpomakpor wondered why people could be advancing the idea of the formation of a transitional army at a time when Liberians are talking about disarmament. According to LINA [LIBERIAN NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY], the State Council chairman said the council did not at any time consider the idea of a transitional army debatable as it is counterproductive and contrary to the Cotonou Accord. He dispelled speculation that the council was discussing the idea of a transitional army. He termed such proposals on the part of warring factions as a lack of good will, noting that instead of talking about the formation of a transitional army, they should be submitting themselves to the disarmament process. Chairman Kpomakpor said what is necessary now is for this nation to be rid of arms and other warlike materials and hoped that warring factions will see wisdom in the need to disarm. On ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] neutrality, Chairman Kpomakpor said that it is unfortunate that the warring factions are looking for scapegoats as all of the armed groups are accusing ECOMOG of being partial. On the suggestion of changes in the transitional government, the State Council chairman said this could not be ruled out and disclosed that the council will shortly appoint managing directors and heads of autonomous agencies after constituting the various public corporation boards. He, however, said the council will only appoint managing directors and heads of autonomous agencies based on their qualification and not on the basis of factional connection.
