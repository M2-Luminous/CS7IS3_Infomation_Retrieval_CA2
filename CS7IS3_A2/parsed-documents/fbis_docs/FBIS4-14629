They will be replaced with operational groups consisting of a small number of officers and specialists whose task will be to help the local troops responsible for protecting the border, Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian border troops, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent last night on his return from Bishkek. He said the accords signed in Bishkek have created a legal foundation for Commonwealth citizens serving in Russia's border troops. Over the next few years they will account for 30 to 50 percent of the personnel. A. Nikolayev said that during his conversation with Kirgiz President Askar Akayev questions of training national cadres were discussed, along with additional measures for strengthening the border between Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] and Afghanistan. They also worked out a unified border policy. The border troops commander stressed that, as before, his views on ensuring security on the Commonwealth borders coincided with those of President Akayev and other heads of state. A. Nikolayev said that additional measures aimed at stabilizing the situation on the Tajik-Afghan section of the border would be discussed at a conference of the Commonwealth heads of state scheduled for the middle of April. He expressed his satisfaction at the fact that a government delegation from Tajikistan is to have a meeting in Moscow with opposition leaders. However, in the opinion of the border troops chief commander, a disruption of the dialogue or reluctance on the part of one of the sides to continue it may result in a fresh escalation of tension in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border.
