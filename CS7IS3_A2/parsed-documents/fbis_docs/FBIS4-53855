At 1400 on 25 April, Chairman Keigo Ouchi of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] was facing Masayoshi Takemura, representative of Sakigake [Harbinger], whom he had invited by phone to meet at "an inconspicuous place." Ouchi Is Becoming a Different Man Ouchi said: "I want to cut off the Ichi-Ichi [Ichiro Ozawa, coleader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito] line at any cost. To do that we must form a powerful parliamentary group that excludes Komeito. Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the DSP, is definitely leaning toward Shinseito. The only way the party can reunite is through cooperation with Shinseito." Takemura retorted: "Have you not cooperated with us so far in the struggle against Shinseito? Despite this..." To all appearances, the key mover behind the united group called "Kaishin" [Innovation] is Ouchi. However Ouchi, together with Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Takemura, had been resolutely opposed to the "Kaikakunokai" [Reform Group], proposed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa immediately following the announcement that he intended to resign. What was behind Ouchi's change of mind? Those close to the DSP testify that it was a result of the struggle he had with Yonezawa for leadership of the party. It was said Yonezawa, who had a pivotal role in the "Ichi-Ichi line," was more influential within the party than Ouchi, who leaned toward the SDPJ and Sakigake. Furthermore, Ouchi's strategy went very wrong because Sakigake decided "to cooperate from outside the cabinet." The DSP has a sentiment similar to hatred for the closely related SDPJ because both were born of the same original party. As a result, the DSP cannot work with the SDPJ. On the evening of 22 April, Ouchi assembled Yonezawa, Kansei Nakano, chairman of party's policy board; Hiroshi Nakai, deputy secretary general; and Atsushi Kanda, DSP floor leader, and revealed his idea for the formation of a "united parliamentary group." Immediately before the meeting and again the following day, Ouchi had talks with Ozawa. And on 23 April, former Prime Minister Hosokawa had a strictly confidential meeting with Ouchi. Resourceful Strategy of Hosokawa It seems that Hosokawa was the star player behind the scenes, not the "Ichi-Ichi line." The action was taken, without doubt, in line with what Ozawa had in mind. He wanted to form a another new political party capable of defeating the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. He seemed to recover the resourceful wisdom traditionally inherited by members of the Hosokawa family after he decided to step down from the premiership. Those close to the Japan New Party [JNP] explain that the capital "H" at the beginning of Hosokawa's name can be formed by writing in Arabic numerals the figure 1's from "Ichi-Ichi" and then joining them in the middle. If the "Kaishin" concept were Ozawa's strategy, it would be unlikely that neither Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata nor leaders of Shinseito were unaware of it. Furthermore, Komeito, with the exception of Ichikawa, was not told of the "Ouchi idea," from which it was excluded. After stepping down Hosokawa was reduced to no more than leader of a small and shrinking political party which is struggling to survive. Now that Hata has become prime minister, it is no wonder Hosokawa thinks he should be at the head when a big new group was formed. Men who know Hosokawa well say that he is thinking of reentering the political scene in much the same way as his maternal grandfather, former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Hosokawa once described Hata as a man without the faintest idea of what a state is and should be, and he is assumed to believe that Hata cannot remain in government for very long. Just as in the old saying, "even a worm will turn," the SDPJ was furious. Even former SDPJ Secretary General Hirotaka Akamatsu, reputed to be comparatively close to Ozawa, did not conceal his anger when he said: "This is a matter of faith and I cannot associate with him any more in ordinary war." At any rate, a clear impression has been left that things were pushed through too hastily. Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who now watches transitional politics from the opposition side, expressed his view: "After his illness, Mr. Ozawa's personality has changed." As expected, though, the politicking that took place was guided by the hand of Ozawa. Judging from various events, the basis of Ozawa's strategy seems to be 1) to induce the LDP and the SDPJ each to split to bring about political realignment and 2) to organize a large political party with future amendments to the Constitution in mind. To achieve this scenario he first planned to "win over Michio Watanabe by promising him the post of minister of finance with the rank of deputy prime minister, to push through budget deliberations in the Diet, and to let the Hosokawa cabinet step down to be succeeded by a Watanabe cabinet after the budget bill was passed." Ozawa conveyed this idea directly to Watanabe at several of their meetings. This scenario went wrong because Hosokawa threw his cabinet away. Despite this, Watanabe believed that the exit of the Hosokawa cabinet would accelerate the scenario -- in other words -- would lead to the birth of the "Watanabe cabinet." However, Watanabe only became confused by the turn of events, first announcing he was "seceding from the LDP" and then "retracting his intention to leave the LDP." Yamaguchi's Role as Director It was Toshio Yamaguchi who, from the wings, directed the ad lib performance of the whole cast of leading and supporting actors. "Kaikaku" and "Kaishin" are the names of groups mentioned in a proposal drawn up by Yamaguchi to form a unified group. The leading actors, however, had never considered the possibility of the SDPJ dropping out of the coalition government. They must have held the SDPJ in very low regard to think it would have no choice but to follow the other partners. People close to the SDPJ say the party finds the thought of being ranked "below" the DSP as unbearable. Akamatsu points out that the erstwhile partners failed because "they had too little knowledge of the SDPJ." It was said that Ouchi, in the course of launching the idea of a unified group, succeeded in getting commitments from Ozawa and his colleagues that "the DSP will get two ministerial posts, one major and one minor." It was presumed he wanted to regain power by accomplishing what Yonezawa had been unable to do. It was a mixture of strategy and Machiavellianism aimed at achieving survival. Nobody knows who to blame, the deceivers or the deceived. The confused political scene is becoming more complicated as rainbow-colored expectations are woven into the space between the warp of ideals and the woof of party lines.
