In a memorandum to the Yemeni government on the current crisis, France said that it considers Yemeni unity a factor of stability in the region and therefore expressed reservations over the secessionist declaration. It noted that it is paradoxical for the international community to recognize a secession resulting from an armed action, given that the Republic of Yemen realized its unity through a democratic process, a referendum held in May 1991, and legislative elections held on 27 April 1993. The memorandum explained the international organization's [as heard] position on this issue by saying that if the United Nations approves such recognition, France fears that the UN's credibility will be affected and it will stand bewildered and confused when dealing with certain regional crises that are similar to the Yemeni crisis; that is, when certain parties declare their own establishment such as the Serb Republic in Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia for instance. Moreover, France does not harbor any hostility. [sentence as heard] In conclusion, the memorandum affirmed support for UN secretary general and his special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. It stressed the urgency of calling on all parties to implement the cease-fire as stipulated in UN Resolution 924 and convincing these parties to continue the dialogue to find a peaceful solution.
