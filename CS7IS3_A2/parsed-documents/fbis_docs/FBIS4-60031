He added that no good will come of the military action, either in the near or distant future. He noted that the situation of Yemen is still on the agenda of the Arab League, adding that the Arab League Council's emergency session is still in session. Everybody, he said, is following the developments and events there. Regarding the Syrian-Israeli peace track, the foreign minister said that diplomatic action will continue in the coming days to narrow the differences between Syria and Israel. He pointed out that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's talks in Cairo showed that differences do exist between the two sides. The talks also showed the feasibility of continuing efforts to bridge the gap as much as possible, he added. Answering a question on Egypt's stand on the situation in Somalia, Musa said that Egypt is ready to intervene once again to reconcile the parties in Somalia in view of Egypt's status, role, and connections in consolidating unity in Somalia. [Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1445 GMT on 19 May carries a further report on Musa's statement, which adds: ["Asked about the disagreement between the Palestinians and Israelis over Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's remarks in Johannesburg in which he called for a jihad for the sake of Jerusalem, Musa said: There are many statements from both sides. The important thing, he added, is for these statements to serve what has been achieved and prepare the ground for the coming stages of negotiations between the two sides. He stressed that the Palestinian efforts, which we are all behind, must be directed toward giving momentum to a fruitful negotiation process to restore full Palestinian rights as part of the land for peace principle."]
