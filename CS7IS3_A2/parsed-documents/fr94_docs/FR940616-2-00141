FR940616-2-00141 FR940616-2-00094 Twenty-five percent (25%) of the available funds will be reserved for organizations that have not received Samantha Smith grants in the past year. Grants are awarded to expand or enhance existing exchange programs or to encourage the development of new exchanges. Programs may involve the U.S. organization in a partnership with organizations in one or more countries. The minimum length of stay in country for a project should be three weeks. Two categories of grants are being offered. Category A_School-to-School Exchanges A school-to-school exchange is one that involves a direct linkage between a U.S. and a Central and Eastern European or NIS elementary, middle, or high school, or a two-year college. (4-year colleges and universities are not eligible under this competition). An applicant must be a school, school district, or two-year college. The maximum grant for this category is $15,000. The exchange program activity should be reciprocal and permit students to live in each other's countries during the academic year when schools are in session. (This would include officially-sponsored summer school sessions). The proposal should provide detailed information on the classroom and other activities in both the U.S. and the partner country. The duration of the projects may be one academic year, one semester, or short-term (generally understood to mean three to eight weeks). Organizations which are receiving funding under other USIA grants for youth exchanges must insure that proposals submitted under this solicitation do not duplicate or overlap with programs already being funded by USIA. Category B_General Youth Exchange This category includes all other projects, which will be eligible for grants of up to $75,000. Semester and year-long high school or two-year college study programs conducted by exchange organizations may fall within this category, as may projects involving the annual exchange of groups of students and teachers among several linked schools for short-term stays during the academic year. (4-year colleges and universities are not eligible under this competition). For short-term (3&hyph;8 weeks) exchanges, preference is given to projects with a thematic focus. Eligible foci may include, but are not limited to: The arts (theater, dance, music, fine arts, literature, folklore, and film/video); language and culture; science, technology, and mathematics; conservation and the environment; historic preservation; museum training; social, political, and economic issues; agriculture; business and administration/management (including enterprise promotion). While a thematic focus is not an absolute requirement, care should be taken to avoid proposing a program which is too heavily weighted toward ``touristic'' activities and lacking in substance. Projects requesting support for tours of performing arts groups or sports teams are eligible if the primary purpose of the program is interaction among international participants and their hosts. Tours of performing arts groups or sports groups where the primary activity is performance or competition are not eligible. Reciprocity is not a requirement for this category, but in general, USIA gives preference to proposals for reciprocal exchanges. The proposal should provide detailed information on the activities in both the U.S. and the partner country. The number of U.S. and foreign participants should be roughly equal. Such proposals must provide written evidence of the commitment of a counterpart organization in the partner country willing and able to engage in the proposed activities. In most cases the counterpart organization should assume a significant portion of the cost of hosting the American participants in the reciprocal portion of the program. Guidelines All categories of proposals must include: Participant selection criteria and a description of the selection process. All participants must be under the age of 21 at the time they begin the program. In all cases, selection should be merit-based. Selection criteria should include actual or potential leadership qualities, and may also include some or all of the following: maturity, academic achievement, interest in the program, motivation, recommendations of teachers, and language ability, although no participant should be chosen solely on the basis of language ability. As far as possible, participants should reflect the diversity of the communities from which they come. Ability to pay should not be a determining factor for either American or foreign participants. Description of Orientation Programs There should be ample introduction to the program theme, administrative procedures, basic historical, cultural, and social information, and substantive issues likely to be raised by their U.S. or foreign counterparts. The orientation program should help minimize the ``culture shock'' of the participants when they are in the partner country. Information Concerning Stays in the Host Country Preference is generally given to longer stays in-country. The proposal should describe in detail the selection and orientation processes for both U.S. and host families and institutions. Consideration will be given to those projects which for reasons or requirements of the partner country(ies) are of short duration, but the length of stay in country should be a minimum of three weeks. Information Concerning Language Qualifications Speaking ability in the language of the host country for both American and foreign participants is preferred, but not required. It is recognized that relatively few American young people will speak the languages of the host countries, given the fact that relatively few American schools teach these languages. Ideally, some participants in each incoming delegation should be conversant in English, and some participants in each outgoing delegation should be conversant in the host country language. However, no participant should be selected solely on the basis of his or her language ability.
