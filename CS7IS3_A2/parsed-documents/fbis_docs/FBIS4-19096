Foa also said that close to 10,000 other people, fleeing the violence in Rwanda, were seeking refuge in the region. Some 8,100 refugees had just arrived in Zaire, Foa said, adding that the information was still incomplete. Among these, she said, there were 5,000 Burundians who feared an explosion of violence in their country, 2,000 Rwandans and 1,100 Burundian refugees from Rwanda. Foa said the UNHCR had not seen the kind of exodus from Rwanda it feared might occur, perhaps because people were afraid to move. The Burundian prime minister had given the UNHCR permission to cross the border between Burundi and Rwanda to take supplies to the Burundian refugees, Foa added.
