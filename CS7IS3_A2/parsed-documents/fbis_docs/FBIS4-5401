The leaders also decided to make efforts to initiate deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget in the week that will start on April 17, the officials said. The accords were struck at a meeting of the leaders of coalition partners who banded together to decide on the course of the government following Hosokawa's bombshell announcement Friday that he would step down as premier. Budget debate has been paralyzed due to a four-week opposition boycott over the premier's refusal to summon his aide over Hosokawa's financial deals.
