Stange's lawyer has stated that the high-ranking officer has not requested leave, yet the defense minister has said he has already approved it. Gen. Stange began his vacations on 8 April. His vacations end on 16 May. Stange's lawyer, Pablo Rodriguez, has said that Stange has not requested an extension. He added that the acting Carabineros director has submitted a written communication to the defense minister which states that Stange was to have taken two months leave if a military judge was appointed to investigate charges on military negligence. He said: [Begin Rodriguez recording] As this is not the case, Gen. Stange will not submit any leave request. A request is uncalled for in compliance with Gen. Stange's original position. If a civilian judge is appointed to investigate the case, there is no legal, constitutional, moral, or ethical obstacles to prevent him from resuming his post. [end recording] Defense Minister Patricio Rojas, however, said that Gen. Stange will not resume his post before July. [Begin recording] [Rojas in progress]... This is the situation right now. His vacation expires on 17 May and from then on, he will start a 60-day leave permit that can be reduced or extended. [Unidentified reporter] You have to authorize it. [Rojas] I have already authorized it. He has requested leave and I have already authorized it. [end recording]
