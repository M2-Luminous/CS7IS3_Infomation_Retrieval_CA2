Announcing the last deadline after a one-hour meeting with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, the EU commissioner in charge of external affairs said if the blockade was still in place the Commission would "draw its own conclusions." Van den Broek has been designated by the European Union to seek a solution to the dispute. EU sources have suggested the blockade, imposed on February 16, may be illegal under European law. The Commission was aware Greece "has some good arguments" on its side, van den Broek said. But he added that the Commission must both "assure itself that Community law is respected" and on the other hand use its political influence to find a "permanent and satisfactory solution" to the Greek-Macedonian dispute. He is to liaise with UN envoy Cyrus Vance and U.S. special envoy Matthew Nimetz, who is expected in Athens overnight before meeting Papandreou and Papoulias on Tuesday. Papoulias said "efforts" for a solution were on-going and he would meet Vance "very soon in New York". Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos denounced criticisms levied against Greece by its European partners on Sunday, saying they "are encouraging the intransigence of Skopje and don't help Mr. Vance's efforts." EU foreign ministers meeting at Ioannina rejected Greece's arguments in favour of the six-week-old trade embargo and called on Greece to find a solution to the deadlock. Greece claims the name of Macedonia for its own republic bordering the former Yugoslav republic, and insists the latter call itself by a different name and abandon symbols associated with ancient Greece.
