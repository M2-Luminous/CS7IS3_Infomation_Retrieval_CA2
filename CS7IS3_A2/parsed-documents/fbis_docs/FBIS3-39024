On the same date, there were 4,077 French blue helmets in Bosnia out of a total of 10,760. The French blue helmets make up several battalions: -- The 1st Infantry Battalion, stationed in Glina, some 150 kilometers south of Zagreb; it comprises 890 men equipped with front-line armored vehicles (VAB) and light armored vehicles (VBL). Their weapons include about 12 antitank Milan missiles and as many 80-mm mortars. This battalion consists of units of the 27th Mountain Division (Grenoble): Annecy's 27th BCA [mountain light infantry battalion], Grenoble's 27th RCS [expansion unknown], Grenoble's 7th BCA, La Valbonne's 7th BGDA [expansion unknown], Chambery's 13th BCA, and Briancon's 159th RIA [mountain infantry regiment]. -- The 2d and 4th Infantry Battalions are stationed in Sarajevo. The 2d Battalion has 769 men equipped with VAB's, Milan missiles, and 80-mm mortars. The VAB's are fitted with 12.5-mm machine guns. The battalion was formed with units belonging to the 9th Marine Infantry Division (Nantes): Angouleme's 1st RIMA [marine regiment], Auvours' 2d RIMA (near Le Mans), Angers' 6th RG [engineer regiment] and Vannes' RICM [expansion unknown]. The 4th Battalion is comprised of 812 men also belonging to the 9th DIMA [marine division]. In addition to weapons similar to those of the 2d Battalion, they have 12 wheeled armored Sagaie ERC's [reconnaissance vehicles] equipped with a 90-mm cannon. They come from the 3d RIMA and the RICM (Vannes) as well as Angers' 6th RG. -- The Zagreb-based logistical support battalion is comprised of 1,140 men mostly belonging to Chalon-sur-Marne's 10th command and support regiment. -- The Bihac-based 3d Infantry Battalion comprises 1,275 men. It is equipped with VAB's, VBL's, Milan missiles, and 80-mm missiles as well as very-short-range SATCP's [very short-range surface-to-air missile], and 12 Sagaie armored vehicles. This battalion was formed with units from the 15th Infantry Division (Limoges): Clermont-Ferrand's 92nd RI, Brives' 126th RI, Castel Sarrasin's 31st RG, and Sathonay's 99th RI. Also present are elements from Valence's 1st Spahi corps. -- The Kakanj-based Battalion of Engineers has 400 men from Besancon's 19th RG, Mourmelon's 72nd RG, and Angers' 7th RG. In addition to its own specialized vehicles, it is equipped with VAB's. Apart from the 24 Sagaies, these units have no heavy weaponry (neither armored vehicles nor artillery). Each battalion has a relatively small number of Milan missiles and 80-mm mortars. Not all VAB's are equipped with 12.5-mm machine guns. Personal weapons are FAMAS [Saint Etienne assault rifles] and a small number of FRF1 precision rifles. This choice of weapons was not made by France but by the United Nations. Initially, when the blue helmets have begun their mission in the former Yugoslavia, the United Nations had resisted the presence of the VAB's, which it deemed "too offensive." These wheeled vehicles offer good protection from bullets as well as mines. Without them, there would have been more casualties than currently recorded: 18 dead and 281 wounded. In addition to these 5,793 blue helmets, France has 1,200 and 3,000 men stationed nearby the war zones: The crews of the ships patrolling the Adriatic, European observers, air surveillance units monitoring the embargo and helicopter detachments based in Split.
