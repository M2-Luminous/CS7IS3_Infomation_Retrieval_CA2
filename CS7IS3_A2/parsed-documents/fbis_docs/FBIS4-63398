Rutskoy had been a ringleader of the abortive state coup in Moscow last October and had been put into prison along with other conspirators, following the collapse of the coup. He was amnestied by the Russian parliament together with other leaders of the coup in a move to reach civic accord in the country. However, he claimed in an interview with the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper on Friday that he was not guilty of anything, and there was no need to amnesty him. He said that the amnesty (incidentally, railroaded through parliament by his supporters and opposed by President Yeltsin) was issued by those who were eager to cover facts behind the October tragedy. Speaking of party affairs, Vassiliy Lipitskiy, chairman of the FRPP Board, claimed in an interview with journalists on Friday on the eve of the opening of the second FRPP congress that it is too early to speak about the creation of the movement and that it will not compete the FRPP in any way. The congress will adopt several documents, including a statement formulating the FRPP's tasks for the nearest future, which is, in actual fact, tantamount to a party programme. According to the Board chairman who now is the actual leader of the party, the FRPP should also decide whether to sign the social accord treaty. "It is more likely, the results will be negative. But in any case, the party will examine unilateral obligations to preserve civil peace," Lipitskiy stressed. Asked by ITAR-TASS about the party's relations with Rutskoy, the Board chairman replied that the former vice-president "was always somewhat independent of the party, and its members got accustomed to this". He expressed doubt that there would be a serious discussion at the congress concerning Rutskoy's leadership, although, he admitted, "there is critical attitude to some of his pronouncements" among party members. In Lipitskiy's opinion, the former vice-president "has his basis of support which is expanding". The Board chairman pointed to the Russian Agrarian Party and some small parties of social democratic orientation as his party's closest allies. Lipitskiy said that the FRPP occupies the centrist position, which means social democratic orientation under the present conditions in Russia. The Board chairman noted that the Civic Union bloc, of which the FRPP was a member, can be recreated only on a new basis. Its former idea of partnership between industrial managers and hired labour turned to be out of date under the present conditions, which predetermined the union's defeat at the elections.
