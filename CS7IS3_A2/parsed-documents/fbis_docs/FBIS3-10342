I do not think it depends on results of the San Cristobal policy. A problem will arise if civil society wears down, wearies, or becomes discouraged. In that case, everything would come undone, and then they would come down on us with military means. What I am trying to explain is we are no longer the problem, the country is. Our time is over, even if the flashes and photos continue." Subcommander Marcos held a uninhibited and informal conversation following the last interviews he granted in San Cristobal de las Casas. Visibly tired but with the lively talk that distinguishes him, he reviewed the military experience of the Zapatist uprising, talked of his first impressions following the dialogue, and reflected on the consultation period the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] must now hold in its villages. This is the end of an unexpected and surprising phase they had not counted on. The insurgent subcommander assessed the negotiation's deficiencies for the EZLN as well as the government negotiators. He seemed skeptical about the commitments and sketched events for the immediate future. Peace or war? Increased repression and authoritarianism or effective transition toward democracy? The man of a thousand words bade farewell to the forum, but before returning to the mountain got comfortable in a chair to hold one more talk on the way out. [LA JORNADA] Do you feel more confident now that you are returning to the jungle? [Marcos] We were in our element there. When we enter the city, that is when we begin to make mistakes. But as long as we are in the mountains and villages, it is very unlikely someone will pick a fight with us, even the regular forces of the federal Army. [LA JORNADA] Are you inviting newsmen to go with you to the jungle? What does the invitation consist of? Does this mean your camps will no longer be hidden? [Marcos] The idea is not to take you to where the situation is delicate. Today, the consultations will be held in the civilian sector. We can arrange for some visits, which will entail some risk, and these visits, like the previous ones, will be made with great security precautions, blindfolding the reporters who decide to go. Everyone knows now which zones are Zapatist zones. [LA JORNADA] Are you planning to continue the war or do you think the negotiations were conducted well? [Marcos] We thought war would follow. On 12 January, we prevented the Army from entering and razing the villages by drawing them into the jungle or mountains. That is what was prevented. We were ready for that kind of combat. We had prepared for it for 10 years, not the attacks on San Cristobal or the capital cities of the municipalities. During the previous nine years we prepared defensively, just defensively. Our plans did not and do not call for defining everything through armed means. What we thought and planned for was that it was more costly to annihilate us in political terms that to tell us they would meet all our demands. Only now are they telling us what they will give us. This may be a strong investment meant more to deprive the EZLN of its social support and justification for the war than to solve the problem. The government will have to fight its past to convince the villages it will now keep its commitments. Why are people going to believe their promises now? Our expectation is that war will be avoided because of the pressure civil society from all over the country will exert to force compliance with the agreements. I do not think it depends on results from the San Cristobal policy. A problem will arise if civil society wears down, wearies, or becomes discouraged. In that case, everything would come undone, and then they would come down on us with military means. What I am trying to explain is we are no longer the problem, the country is. Our time is over, even if the flashes and photos continue. [LA JORNADA] But you were counting on a war, a long war. Did you think there would be strong military clashes? Didn't you count on that? [Marcos] We did count on strong military clashes. We thought the strongest military clash would take place in San Cristobal. We thought military reaction would be immediate to prevent further revolts. We knew they would not hesitate. That is why we concentrated our strongest forces here with the idea of holding back the Army. Our largest military concentration was near Rancho Nuevo, on the road to Tuxtla. We knew there would be strong clashes when we saw that municipal capitals were not falling simultaneously. We occupied San Cristobal and we realized that we were alone; we realized that the other municipal capitals had not fallen. The attacks on Altamirano and Ocosingo did not take place until 0700, and the situation was not militarily resolved until 1600. In Las Margaritas we began at 0300 and it fell in an hour. Here we begin at 0100 and by 0200 we already had the city occupied. We, therefore, decided to take our time in San Cristobal in order to stop and bog down the Army. We wanted enough time for an orderly retreat while we found out what was going on and carried out actions of armed propaganda [accion de propaganda armada]. We later carried out the attack on Rancho Nuevo to recover weapons and the park. That is where we failed unfortunately. We lost men and we had to flee in disarray. That disorganized an entire column, the one between San Cristobal and Rancho Nuevo, and it also disorganized the one between Altamirano and San Cristobal. I repeat that we did not know very well what was going on. The quick manner in which we went from the armed confrontation to the table in San Cristobal took us by surprise. We had already said that our delay in organizing ourselves to reach the peace table was precisely because we did not expect it to be so soon. [LA JORNADA] If the way the events developed took you by surprise and you had to improvise or discuss the change of course along the way, are you now prepared to discuss the terms for an agreement in the jungle in such a short period of time? [Marcos] There is not and there will not be any improvisation in the discussion of the agreements because that is something we know how to do. That is how we decided to wage the war. I am going to tell you something. We first started to listen to some voices who said they could not take it any longer. The groups that announced they would go to war alone appeared later. The General Command begin to detect this situation and analyze it and they decide to consult. The analysis of the pros and cons of initiating an uprising is then organized bearing in mind circumstances such as NAFTA, the collapse of the socialist bloc, and events in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. On the other hand we took at look at the deaths and the poverty, the increase in the infant mortality rate, the suspension of the distribution of agricultural lands by the reforms to Article 27, and the delegations that went to seek resources and only returned with a bunch of papers. The General Command explained it to the ethnic committees; the ethnic committees explained it in turn to the regional committees; the regional committees explained it to the local committees -- which are located in each village -- and they in turn explained it to the community. They discussed the pros and cons until the community itself decided it was time to take a vote. The number of yes and no votes were counted without regard for age or sex. The reverse process then started: The locals submitted their resolutions to the regional committees; the regional committees submitted them to the zones; the zones submitted them to the ethnic committees; and the ethnic committees submitted them to the General Command. That was when it appeared to us we were watching another television channel. While we thought they would say no, just when we thought everything at the international level was against us, just when we thought the military action would be annulled as a result, it turned out that the immense majority voted yes. Just a handful of our fellow companeros said the time was not right. [LA JORNADA] You said before that in order to reach agreements at the table in San Cristobal something more than willingness from the parties was needed. You stated that it would only be possible to obtain the Zapatist demands with the support -- or the contribution -- of civil society. Can you explain this idea better? [Marcos] The government will only fulfill its promises if it is forced to do so, and this will be achieved through the force of rifles or the pressure of society. Betting on that pressure taking place is the appropriate path. The only possibility to attain peace we see now is for other forces to commit themselves to forcing the government to comply. The result of that bet is this consultation process. It does not depend on what the government does but what the rest of the country does. We have received many letters recommending a process of change. First we received some surprising letters from some people who said everything looked pretty but they were going to beat us up. Then came the letters saying that we should seek the path of peace, the path of negotiation, so that we do not let ourselves be killed. The third stage was when they told us -- and they are still telling us -- that we should not surrender our weapons, sell out, or yield to their demands. Solidarity committees are being formed to support not only the Chiapas people, but the EZLN. We receive support from many sectors, particularly Indian groups. You must recall the letter sent to us by the demonstrators in Guerrero State, but we have also received letters from the Yaquis, Mayos, Tarahuamaras, the Mayas of Yucatan and Campeche, from Colima, Puebla... We did not place ourselves at the head of this movement, rather, we placed ourselves at the back. Now any other movement has more chances than we do, because they can say: They are the radicals; I want the same that they have and if you do not comply, I am going to go radical. Now the field for that is opening up and we said: Go ahead, yes; go for it! But we do not see ourselves as victims, because we are going to get something for our dead -- not more deaths but benefits for Indians in general and the state in particular. Now the danger is that the movement may become satisfied with what it will get at the local level and not aspire to contribute to a national movement. [LA JORNADA] In the document that resulted from the conversations between you and the peace commissioner in San Cristobal, some of the demands made by the EZLN at the federal level did not receive a satisfactory response, such as the reforms to Article 27 or the constitutional quarter [cuarto constitucional]. But from reading the document the first time, it appears that you obtained some things that, although they have not been formally accepted, may exert pressure to reform significant portions of the Constitution or, if the comparison is allowed, you got things too big for the current legal and institutional framework. [Marcos] There are answers that do not respond formally to some of those national demands, but that opens the door for the development of a national movement that could break or modify the current constitutional framework. They did not answer, for instance, the demand for the reform of Article 27, but the concessions made make its reform possible with the support of other sectors and movements with similar demands and using other means. These groups may ultimately reform said article before this six-year term expires or beginning with the new government. According to what we have analyzed and the consultations we have had with lawyers, San Cristobal begins to necessarily establish the need for a national negotiating table, a national dialogue, where forces other than us also take part. In any case, if they are unable to meet our demands promptly and clearly it is because they must maintain the principle of authority, under the premise they have no reason to make concessions. The neoliberal project can no longer be defended. [LA JORNADA] Your group was very lucky because you were not discovered. How was that possible? [Marcos] The government initially thought we were not a guerrilla group. It said we would have attacked if we were guerrillas because no guerrilla group gets ready first, grows, and only attacks much later. It later thought we were Guatemalans, URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] support groups, or other things, such as a group attempting to seize land. The information that they had at the time did not correspond to that in Sedena's [National Defense Secretariat] computer or at the Interior Secretariat, if the latter still kept this information secret. [sentence as published] Since 1985 we thought we were going to be discovered. We maintained a defensive military program at the time because we expected to be discovered. We had grown too much. Entire communities knew about us, helped us carry the responsibility, and fed us. [LA JORNADA] What question would you like to hear? What has nobody asked and you would like to hear? [Marcos] I would ask: What are the Zapatists going to do if one or the other alternative is chosen? What will they do if people say no to peace and yes to war? What will they do if people say yes to peace and no to war? What are they going to do with their military units and their fighting experts in one case or the other? If the option were to be peace, we would not fight because our army is made up of peasants. Entry to civilian life would be almost natural. We, however, would not surrender our weapons; we need to be able to defend ourselves if we are threatened. In any case, if peace wins we would have to remain as an army for a long time to make sure the agreements are kept. The problem is: How will we relate to power during this period? This is the power we confronted and, in one way or another, its objective was to annihilate us, that is, to take away our social base, invalidate our prestige, and annihilate us at the lowest political cost. [LA JORNADA] What will happen with the cattlemen if the peace proposal advances and the Zapatists' demands are met? [Marcos] I believe they will have to be sacrificed. If the government wants to reach an agreement, it will have to sacrifice them. Maybe the cattlemen will decide to placate the situation and sacrifice a few of their own, those in other territories, so that others are not touched. This is what is going to happen in Altamirano, Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas, where the conflict took place. The situation there is similar to the one in San Juan Chamula. The San Juan Chamula political machine is promoted by the state in exchange for votes. To secure votes they started giving them more power and this has led to the situation we know now. It has reached a point where the government cannot touch the bosses now. Governors come and go at a very high social cost and the government cannot touch them. Perhaps they are not aware of the monster they have created. The case is similar to the one of the cattlemen. They gave them weapons and training in exchange for money and protected them when they committed outrages. The government knew this. Just as it discovered our training camps in 1993, it knew about them at least since 1990. They knew the cattlemen were armed and training. The government's officers were the ones who gave them the training at the white guard training camps, at the Castellanos ranches, and at the Altamirano Municipal Auditorium. Our military hypothesis is the following: A bullring called Lancandona Jungle is established. The federal government and the Army stay at the bullring's refuge section, civil society is up on the tiers, we are the bullfighter, and the cattlemen are the bull. The government says: Let them tear each other up and I will pick up the remains. The Army, which is a human rights transgressor, then becomes a pacifying army and implements order. This is a likely situation which, in military terms, depicts the blocking of the Ricardo Pozas caravan, the present lynch mood, and the Army that did nothing. The cattlemen are already out of control. We threatened several times to break off the talks because of the events at Altamirano and the government was unable to control them. The cattlemen were attempting to break up the talks. [LA JORNADA] What will happen in Altamirano? Will things break off? What will happen if this confrontation scheme spreads to other parts of the country? [Marcos] It seems this will also an issue for the cattle ranchers [ganaderas]. We will see what kind of support the cattlemen have. If these guys have the cattle ranchers' support, then it will all be worthless because they will go from being murderers to martyrs of the small properties cause. If other cattle ranchers start to make noise about this, they will create opposition. It is the state's responsibility, however. The state is also responsible for what happened on 1 January because they were warned this would happen. There were demands for reform. Now, they are being told this will happen, that doors should be left open. [LA JORNADA] If this was the government's response, what do you think of Camacho's response or attitude? [Marcos] Camacho discovered that the leadership of this movement is actually Indian. It was a big surprise for them to have to deal with the interlocutors and not the forces that were supposedly behind it. That is when the world opened up to them, when Camacho said there is a solution to this, even if they are wearing ski caps, and foreign forces are not involved. [LA JORNADA] One of your achievements at the San Cristobal table is the creation of conditions for clean and democratic elections in Chiapas. If this becomes a reality, would the EZLN participate in any way, as a force with its own candidates in the electoral process? [Marcos] We will not do that. We lack the necessary organizational structure. We would frown on any of our members who did that. For example, all chiefs are banned from occupying public office under the threat of expulsion. They must not own property either. Moreover, the EZLN seeks to have its demands met strictly through military means [militar reivindicativa]. We would also need experienced cadres in the open struggle, in the struggle of the masses. We have the ability to organize into communities to survive, to maintain ourselves, but not in the public spotlight because we lack experience. This is where they can confuse and mess us up. [LA JORNADA] But the EZLN, with the sympathy you generated, could the EZLN not influence the nomination of municipal presidents? Is it not part of your goals, to influence the appointment of democratic authorities? [Marcos] That is undoubtedly one of our goals. That is definitely close to the reality of the rural areas because all the state's rural territory is ours. I, however, see this more as supporting someone else's nomination or candidacy rather than launching one of our own because otherwise we would loose prestige, moral authority, and social base.
