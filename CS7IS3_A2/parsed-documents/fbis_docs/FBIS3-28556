The Seoul High Public Prosecutor's Office sentenced former Navy Chief of the General Staff Kim Chol-u to three years' imprisonment, four years' stay of execution and a 300-million won fine. Kim was sentenced to six years in prison at the first trial. He was charged with receiving money from an arms dealer in connection with the Navy's destroyer purchase project. The former commander of the Marine Corps, Cho Ki-yop, was sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment, three years' stay of execution and a 60-million won fine. He was sentenced to three years in jail at the first trial. Another former Navy Chief of the General Staff, Kim Chong-ho, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and a 373-million won fine. He received a six-year prison term at the first trial. The judges said, "the defendants admit they received money, though denying the money had some connection with the promotion of military officers. But we feel the money has some connection with the promotions. We are reducing their terms of imprisonment because they appeared before the prosecution voluntarily before the prosecutor's summons." Meanwhile, the head of Haksan Co., Chong Ui-sung, who was charged with giving bribes to Kim Chol-u, was sentenced to one year and six months' imprisonment and three years' stay of execution.
