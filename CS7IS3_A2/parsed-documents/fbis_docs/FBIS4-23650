Weeks ago the men told SUNDAY TIMES that among the ANC agents supplying information to them during the past decade were Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the National, MK; ANC military wing] officers earmarked for top positions in the integrated defence force. The agents, Mr Gerhard Jansen van Rensburg and Mr Clive Brink, both former members of the disbanded Directorate of Covert Collection [DCC], are now barred by a Transvaal Supreme Court order from revealing the names. Mr Modise's application was backed by a lengthy affidavit from defence force head General Georg Meiring, who said the disclosures of names of spies could lead to them being seen as traitors. In the interview conducted in a Sandton hotel in April as part of a SUNDAY TIMES investigation, one agent said an ANC informant supplied them with details of a secret meeting between National Party and ANC negotiators in September 1992 on a farm in Ellisras. Mr Jansen van Rensburg and Mr Brink were among 62 members of the DCC sacked after a Goldstone commission raid on their offices in November 1992. Amid allegations that this was the nerve centre of the "Third Force", 23 officers, including a general, were placed on compulsory early retirement by former State President F.W. De Klerk on December 19,1992. Mr Jansen van Rensburg and Mr Brink said they feared for their lives. "We are terrified, not just for ourselves, but for our families. The problem is that all the DCC agents who were shafted know too much about top people." In an affidavit supporting Mr Modise's urgent application, General Meiring said it was imperative that the agents be prevented from revealing "a great deal of top secret information...including the names of many informants" who could be severely compromised if their identities were revealed. According to General Meiring's affidavit: "An interdict against them could save the state from severe embarrassment and avoid international repercussions." Edyth Bulbring and Ray Hartley report that a besieged Mr Modise spent the anniversary of his first month in office yesterday with senior members of the ANC discussing his gaggling of the two agents and a bid to muzzle the WEEKLY MAIL newspaper over reports on the two agents. A spokesman for President Mandela said Mr Modise would have to explain to the president why he acted in the way he did. He said he had been unable to discover who in the ANC had put out the statement condemning Mr Modise's actions. "There was absolute confusion as to who put it out," spokesman Parks Mankahlana said.
