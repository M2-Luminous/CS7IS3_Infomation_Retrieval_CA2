Anhui is expected to reap another bumper wheat harvest this year, following that of last year. Though hit by many natural disasters, the province is still expected to reap a good rapeseed harvest, thanks to the expanded acreage for rapeseed. The midseason harvest will lay a solid foundation for the healthy and steady development of this year's rural economy and even for the entire national economy. According to statistics, the province is expected to reap summer grain this year from 2,121,300 hectares out of the sown 2,148,700 hectares, registering a reduction compared to the previous year. Despite this, gross summer grain output is expected to post a slight increase over the previous year and to become the second-highest record year in history, thanks to the joint efforts of all in the province. This year's summer grain bumper harvest did not come easily. The major reasons behind the bumper summer grain harvest are as follows: First, Anhui conscientiously implemented the economic policies for rural areas worked out by the central government; mobilized farmers' enthusiasm for farming; increased investment for midseason production; and enhanced field work management. Second, weather conditions during the summer grain growing period were generally favorable. The warm winter was favorable as it allowed summer grain to survive; it enabled it to grow smoothly and quickened the turning green of wheat after spring. Summer grain seedlings grew well after spring. In addition, high temperatures in the mid and late growing period, and favorable sunlight, temperatures, and water conditions were favorable for the ripening of wheat, increasing the weight of summer grain, and for raising unit output. Third, plant diseases and insect pests were not serious. As a solid job was done in the prevention of plant diseases and insect pests, the harm to summer grain was reduced considerably. Fourth, the campaign to promote high output resulted in enlarged acreage and a balanced increase in the output of summer grain. The province set up various types of high-output demonstration farms whose acreage totals 133,000 hectares. Fifth, all levels of government and agricultural departments enhanced leadership and guidance over midseason production. Of the 891,200 hectares of sown rapeseed acreage, nearly 130,000 hectares were hit by frost earlier this year and had to be abandoned. Because localities made timely replanting, it is estimated that at present the harvested acres for rapeseed total 786,700 hectares, 33,000 hectares more than the previous year. Having been hit by storms and high temperatures, the province's rapeseed harvest is down slightly, judging from localities' reports; but this year is still a good year for rapeseed output. At present, harvesting and thrashing of rapeseed have been completed. Harvesting and thrashing of summer grain is in the final stages. While stepping up harvesting, localities are striving to store all harvested grain in warehouses and to reap a bumper summer grain harvest.
