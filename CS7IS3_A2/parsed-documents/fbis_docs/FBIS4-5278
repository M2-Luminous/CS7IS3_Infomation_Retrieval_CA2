FBIS4-5278 "dreas069__a94013" FBIS-EAS-94-069-A Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan SDPJ Secretary General Comments SDPJ Secretary General Comments OW0904040394 Naha OKINAWA TIMES in Japanese 8 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0904040394 Naha OKINAWA TIMES Japanese BFN [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], who is in Okinawa to campaign for local election candidates, gave a news conference at the prefectural government building on 7 April at which he commented on the two recent U.S. military aircraft crashes. He said: "I will report the facts of the accidents and the Okinawan people's sentiments to the prime minister, the foreign minister, and the director general of the Defense Agency. The government will take appropriate measures." He indicated the government and the ruling parties might discuss suitable responses, including the suspension of flights by F-15 fighters and CH-46 helicopters until the causes behind the two accidents were determined. During the news conference, Kubo talked about issues affecting Okinawa, such as the proposed bill on the utilization of returned military land, and the plan to combine the Okinawa Development Agency, the Hokkaido Development Agency, and the National Land Agency. He also gave his views on national political developments and the realignment of political parties. The fact he chose to mention the accidents involving U.S. military aircraft is interpreted as an indication that the government and the ruling parties may take action. Commenting on the accidents at the news conference, Kubo expressed his shock, saying: "It has been reconfirmed to me that the overwhelming concentration of bases here in Okinawa 50 years after the end of the war forces residents to endure anxiety and fear." He said: "We have to deal with this problem as a major issue for Japan as a whole." He also said, though, that the chances were slim of the proposed bill on the utilization of returned military land, a key issue on Okinawa, being passed in the current Diet session. He said: "There is very little time left in the current session and legislation will be difficult." However, he also said: "I think the (military land use system) is an important issue because it concerns land use after military land has been returned, and the revitalization of local communities." He pledged to work for the submission of the bill by Diet members [most Japanese bills are submitted by the government] during the current Diet. Commenting further on the planned integration of three government agencies, including the Okinawa Development Agency, Kubo said: "Its role in assisting the national and local governments will remain important for some time to come." This was taken as an indication that he believes it would be premature to integrate the three agencies. Talking about the mayoral elections in the cities of Okinawa and Gushikawa, the purpose of his visit, Kubo said: "These are important elections which will affect the forthcoming simultaneous local elections, and the upper house elections and general elections next year." He stressed that the SDPJ would do its utmost to retain reformist control of the prefectural government at the gubernatorial election in November.
