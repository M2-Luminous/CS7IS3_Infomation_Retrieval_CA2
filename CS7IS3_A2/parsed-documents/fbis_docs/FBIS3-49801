The Presidency supported the initiative as well as all efforts aimed at achieving a lasting peace, friendship and life together of the Croatian and Bosniak-Muslim people. The Presidency is also of the opinion that the life together of and the friendship among all the three peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina is of historic interest and that the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a multinational community, is interested in cooperation with the neighboring countries. As regards the relations between the Croatian and Bosniak-Muslim people--they have historic foundations and are based on territorial links, economic, cultural closeness, and joint strategic interests, also bearing in mind the fact that these two peoples and states are under threat from the same aggressor. This is why the Presidency is determined to continue with the efforts as soon as possible to halt the tragic conflict between the Croats and Bosniak-Muslims, which is primarily a consequence of the greater Serbian aggression and to find such political and system solutions which would, instead of allowing the conflict, stimulate friendship, cooperation and even integration processes which would benefit our peoples and states. Some parts of the [proposed] agreement set such objectives and the Presidency supports them. Unfortunately, the agreement as a whole, in its proposed form, cannot be accepted for several principled reasons. First, an agreement cannot be signed by peoples, but by internationally recognized subjects. In this case the subjects of the international public law are the states of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, as the internationally recognized states and UN members. Since these two states have recognized each other, signing the agreement on behalf of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is not legally valid or possible, nor is it politically acceptable. It implies derecognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Republic of Croatia, with all negative consequences stemming from it. Second, the agreement's preamble does not mention the third nation, that is the Serbian nation, without which there is no overall and just solution and whose position must also be taken into consideration. Third, the preamble says that the parties to the agreement will give personal guarantees for the implementation of the agreement, which is legally invalid in a case of an international agreement between two sovereign, internationally recognized states. A shortcoming of the [proposed] agreement is also that it does not state which international legal subject will guarantee its implementation. Four, the [proposed] agreement uses the terminological names : the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Muslim-Bosniak republic, which define in advance the names and solutions which are not in accordance with the terminology of the so-called Geneva package -- for example: the republic with the majority Croatian population. Five, as regards a possible secession and the end of the existence of the Union of the Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina the formulations differ significantly from those which were agreed on and accepted in principle at the Geneva talks. The constitutional agreement on the formation of a union of the republics does not envisage the possibility of a union of two republics. The proposed agreement does not respect the agreed conditions nor the procedure in case of a possible secession from or disintegration of the union, nor the consequences envisaged in these situations. In such a situation it is particularly important that the republic with the majority Bosniak-Muslim people takes over the Neum municipality, the area of Brcko, and the international-legal status and continuity of the internationally recognized Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Six, the solutions which the agreement proposes for Mostar and Neum are not in accordance with what was agreed onboard Invincible, nor with the solutions which were agreed in principle during the Geneva peace process. Seven, many articles of the agreement contain legal shortcomings, political inconsistence and terminological imprecision, and some articles contradict some other ones--[for example] the definition of the status of Mostar, Neum and the free zones in the [Croatian Adriatic] ports of Ploce and Rijeka, the imprecision in defining the envisaged borders between the two future republics, and the leaving out of the third, Serbian side, and the problem of the occupied territory etc. For all these reasons, and with the objective of using constructively the [Croatian] initiative to find solutions which would bring about peace and friendly cooperation between the two peoples and states the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina has decided: First, to relaunch the initiative to establish confederal relations between the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia, as two sovereign and internationally recognized states. The presidency also reiterates its proposal that in the parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina controlled by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO [Croat Defense Council] a united constitutional and legal system be promptly established. It would be based on the principles of full national equality and parliamentary democracy. Local authorities would be based on proportional representation, according to the population census of 1991. Domination by the majority population would be eliminated by the use of parity and consensus when deciding on most important issues. Other areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina would be treated as occupied territories and solutions for them would be sought within a peace process and a process of a democratic transformation within the Serbian national corps. Decentralization of the state authorities and the internal regionalization of the republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina would not be resolved through the confederal agreement. To implement this initiative the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina proposes that a joint interstate commission be formed promptly to examine all elements of the future confederation. Some foundations for it have already been defined in article 15, part two of the agreement [proposed by the Croats]. Until the entire confederal agreement between the two states is finalized the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina expresses willingness to examine all proposals related to the halting of the war confrontations, establishing peace and promoting life together both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republic of Croatia, the reply of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency to the agreement proposed by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman says in its conclusion.
