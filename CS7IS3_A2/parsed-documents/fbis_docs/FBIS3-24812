The head of state later received the International Monitoring Committee on the Ouagadougou Accords led by its chairman, Herman Yameogo. He spoke to newsmen after the meeting. [Begin Yameogo recording] Some time ago, the opposition issued a number of demands, and the one that kept coming up again and again was the election problem. We were able to settle quite a number of these issues thanks to the goodwill shown by both the presidential group and the opposition. The only issue left was the election problem. The International Monitoring Committee held a meeting with the head of state today, and the solution we came up with was to initiate preliminary reconciliation at the National Electoral Commission level to try and solve the differences that might arise after the election. If no solution is found after that, the matter will then be transferred to the Supreme Court, in line with established laws. We also wish to stress that these measures are valid only for the parliamentary elections, they do not affect past or future elections. That is essentially what we decided upon. We have noticed that both sides have shown goodwill. The International Monitoring Committee is always at their disposal to assist them in finding solutions any time there are problems. We would like to call on everyone to help in making things go smoothly so that there will be peace and we can move toward a suitable solution for Togo. Thank you. [end recording]
