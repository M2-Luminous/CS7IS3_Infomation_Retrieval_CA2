He said the move came in an effort to counter the inflationary effects of the 50-percent devaluation this week of the CFA franc. The goods whose prices are frozen include bread, flour, rice, cooking oil, soap, sugar, milk, meat and fish, he said. "Price controls are being strengthened for existing stocks of goods to avoid improper price increases," he said.
