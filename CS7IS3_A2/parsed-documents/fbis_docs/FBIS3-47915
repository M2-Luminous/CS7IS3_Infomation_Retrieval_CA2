In a statement released today, the Central Committee of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon highly estimates and fully supports a proposal and call of the overseas Koreans' headquarters of Pomminnyon for setting this as a "year of great national unity" for national reunification. Noting that the proposal and call are very just and timely both in view of the nature of the national reunification question and the desire of the fellow countrymen for great national unity and they will help convincingly promote the reunification in the `90s, the statement says: "The North side headquarters, in hearty response to the proposal of the overseas Koreans' headquarters, will vigorously struggle shoulder to shoulder with Koreans overseas to achieve great unity of the nation this year. "Regarding the Kim Yong-sam group as the foe of great national unity, it will staunchly struggle against it and, in this way, actively promote great national unity with Koreans in the South and overseas. "We hold that anybody must refrain from rejecting Pomminnyon, a pan-national umbrella organization for great national unity and the reunification of the country, and join in the patriotic movement for reunification."
