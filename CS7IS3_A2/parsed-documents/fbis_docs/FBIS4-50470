The city's 5,644 such companies registered a sales value of 8.7 billion yuan last year, compared with 900 million yuan earned by 2,000 firms in 1992. Local officials estimated that this year there will be over 6,000 non-state-owned technological firms with a turnover of 10 billion yuan. In 1997, the figure is expected to reach 20 million yuan. Wang Huayu, a top official at the Municipal Science and Technology Commission, said that the city is to speed up the implementation of the share-holding system and absorb more foreign money to solve the problem of fund shortages. Shanghai, China's biggest metropolis with a population of 13 million, boasts 400,000 scientific and technological professionals. Taking advantage of the abundant talent resources, the city has drawn up a series of preferential policies to encourage the development of non-governmental enterprises. So far, these companies have employed more than 140,000 people, and engage in the fields of computers, telecommunications, aviation and new materials. Ten of them claim an annual output value of over 100 million yuan each, and another 150 make 10 million yuan annually. This year the number of 100-million-yuan companies is expected to reach 20. And the city's 700 private enterprises in the industry are also doing brisk business. For example, the 34-member-strong Yangtian Group registered 62.44 million yuan in turnover last year, ranking third among the city's nearly 6,000 firms. The company's manager attributed its success to the sound work force as 90 percent of the workers are technicians and engineers. In 1993 China had a total of 45,000 non-state-run technological firms, employing 400,000 people and creating annual profits of 50 billion yuan.
