He described his talks with Hwang Chang-yop, secretary in charge of international affairs of the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] and other North Korean leaders to ASAHI SHIMBUN reporters in the following manner: My visit to Pyongyang with Mr. Yoichi Tani [another LDP member of the House of Representatives] coincided with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang. A photograph of Mr. Carter and President Kim Il-song talking on a boat took up considerable space on the front page of newspapers. Newspaper reports only listed our and Carter's itineraries without mentioning the substance of the meetings held. However, for North Korea, which has consistently maintained a "hostile attitude toward the United States," the publication of the photograph with the North Korean president itself was extremely unusual. I felt that this was a sign that North Korea is starting to take a more flexible line on its negotiations with the United States. Secretary Hwang and Secretary Kim Yong-sun, with whom we held talks, were reportedly also present at the luncheon meeting between President Kim and Mr. Carter. Mr. Hwang told us, "I have a good impression of Mr. Carter. We have expectations on the role he will play. We are on the right track toward holding the third round of high level talks between North Korea and the United States." During our consecutive talks on several days, each lasting from three to four hours, when we told them, "We seek to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council and if a UN resolution on sanctions is passed, we have to cooperate," Secretary Hwang responded, "It is better for Japan to repent its past mistakes straightforwardly if it wants the world's respect. We are lenient toward those who repent their faults, and are stern toward those who do not. If Japan conspires with the United States and participates in the sanctions, we will not just let that pass." While we failed to reach agreement in all the meetings, although the three leaders [the third one not named] all declared that "sanctions will be met by retaliation," they never failed to add in the end that "the only solution is dialogue," indicating North Korea will not opt for retaliation. Secretary Kim Yong-sun also said, "Misunderstanding arises if North Korea and Japan do not meet and talk. There is a need to deepen bilateral relations on the basis of the joint communique issued by the WPK, the LDP, and the Social Democratic Party of Japan in 1990." North Korea also invited the LDP to send a delegation to visit the DPRK, indicating a strong desire to normalize relations between Japan and North Korea. We told them that the U.S.-North Korea talks and a solution to the nuclear issue should come first. At the end of each session, we always reconfirmed our common position that "denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula is indispensable for stability in Northeast Asia." I remember in particular that Secretary Kim Yong-sun touched on the political situation in Japan, saying, "We are also concerned by the unstable political situation in Japan. North Korea is united under President Kim Il-song. Secretary Kim Chong-il goes to the people and shares their joy and sorrows. The people believe that if they execute Secretary Kim Chong-il's orders, they can have happiness."
