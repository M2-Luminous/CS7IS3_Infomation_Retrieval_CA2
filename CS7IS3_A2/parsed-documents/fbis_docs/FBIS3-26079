Grachev arrived in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, this morning, a day before Russian President Boris Yeltsin flies in for a one-day summit meeting with its leader Eduard Shevardnadze. During the summit, both sides are expected to sign a package of accord which will include a treaty of friendship and cooperation. Addressing members of the 405th Russian Regiment deployed in Georgia, Grachev said: "The future of our military and political cooperation with Georgia depends upon the stability of the republic's socio-political life and on settling the problem of the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia." Abkhazia, an autonomous republic of Georgia, declared its independence in July 1992, while South Ossetia, an autonomous region of the former Soviet republic, proclaimed its independence in November 1991. The two rebel regions have been involved in a long-term and bloody conflict with Georgia. Grachev also revealed that the coming Georgian-Russian summit will decide the future establishment of Russian military bases on Georgian territory in view of the expiry in 1995 of the interim agreement on Russian troops status in Georgia. He said that Russia wants to keep its troops in Georgia and set up military bases but on the condition that it is done with respect for the treaty on collective security of the Commonwealth of Independent States. "If the question of bases is solved during Yeltsin and Shevardnadze's summit, detailed arrangements will be worked out by the two countries' military experts," he added. According to the minister, who will have a confidential meeting with Shevardnadze tonight, Russia plans to set up five military bases in the Caucasian region -- three in Georgia, one in Azerbaijan and the other in Armenia. The minister also disclosed that Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had agreed with the Defense Ministry the principles of expanding the Russian Army. He suggested that up to 2.1 million men should be enlisted into the army by 1995 because its current strength of 1.5 million, set by the country's defense legislation, is not enough to ensure the state's security. Meanwhile, Georgian parliament deputy speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili said today that his country expects much from Yeltsin's visit. However, in the Abkhazian capital of Sochi Government leader Sokrat Dzhindzholia said on Tuesday [2 February] that his country was opposed to the signing of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between Russia and Georgia. "Only when the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia is completely settled should such an agreement be signed," he declared. Leaders of South Ossetia today also accused Moscow of inconsistency in its approach to the signing of such a treaty complaining that Georgia still refuses to hold talks with South Ossetia on its status.
