C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 3 (CNA) -- The Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Tuesday [3 May] signed a memorandum of understanding [MOU] to forge closer trade ties. Under the memorandum, both sides pledge to join hands to help promote trade exchanges among Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland China and push for the opening of the mainland's service markets. Meanwhile, Taiwan asks Hong Kong to give a helping hand to Taiwan's efforts to become an Asia-Pacific business operations center, to grant seven-day visa-free stay to Taiwan visitors who will proceed to other countries, and to simplify visa application procedures for Taiwan visitors. On the other hand, the Hong Kong side suggests that Taiwan accelerate opening of its financial market to Hong Kong investors, further relax restrictions on merchandise trade among Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Taiwan, and open the flight route between Taipei's Sungshan Airport and Hong Kong. Federation Chairman Kao Ching-yuan and Chairman Paul Cheng of the General Chamber of Commerce inked the document during the fourth Taiwan-Hong Kong trade cooperation conference at the Howard Plaza Hotel. More than 100 representatives from the two organizations took part in the one-day meeting, during which panel discussions on manufacturing, banking, and service industries were held. Vice Chairman Hsueh Chi of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, Vice Chairman Su Chi of the Mainland Affairs Council, and Director-General Ricky Y. S. Kao of the industrial development and investment center were invited to deliver speeches at the meeting. Taiwan has maintained close economic ties with Hong Kong, which has been the entrepot of cross-strait indirect trade. Two-way trade totaled US$20.4 billion last year, in which Taiwan enjoyed a surplus of US$16.9 billion. In 1993, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade accounted for 12 percent of Taiwan's total foreign trade.
