In a press release supporting the initiative of the business sector to halt all activities for a two-week period, the president of the new office of the chamber has called on the international community to lift the embargo. Frantz Robert Monde considers that by this measure the international community is killing, impoverishing, and destabilizing the basic institutions of democracy and is marginalizing the Haitian people. Through the resolution of the Chamber of Commerce, the president of the Chamber of Deputies thinks that the Haitian private sector has denounced the embargo and has sounded an alarm.
