Although the statements are still in the process of being collected, as of the most recent tally, 90 percent of the individuals submitting public statements are in favor of the rate hikes. At a press conference on the same day, Shigemichi Sonoyama, chairman of the Telecommunications Operations Committee of the Telecommunications Council that is sponsoring the study and chairman of the Mobile Wireless Center expressed skepticism, saying, "There is the risk that those opposed to a rate hike have misconstrued the government's announcement of a rate hike freeze for the year as meaning that there is no fear of a hike even after next year." The public hearings will be held in the middle of June in Tokyo, Osaka, Kumamoto, and Sendai and will involve the discussion of items such as the 18-percent average basic fee increase requested by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). Public statements will be accepted until 30 May, but, as of 26 May, 203 statements had been received and 182 of them expressed approval of the rate hikes or stated that they were unavoidable. When public hearings were held on public telephone rate hikes in October 1993, 98 individuals approved of the hikes and 73 opposed.
