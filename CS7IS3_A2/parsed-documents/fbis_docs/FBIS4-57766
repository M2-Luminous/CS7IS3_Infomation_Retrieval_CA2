"It was neither aggressive commentary nor political sociology," said Ricupero, who avoided repeating the criticism he made of the party. On 20 May in Porto Alegre, Ricupero said he was not campaigning for the PSDB because he is a critic of the PSDB, which he compared to "a gay who has not dared come out of the closet." "I made a commentary in the hallway, but it was friendly," Ricupero said. This time he praised the PSDB cadres. According to him, Senator Mario Covas (PSDB-Sao Paulo) was the one who best interpreted his words. "I can only say that I made them in a friendly tone," he added. Ricupero recalled his comments often get out of proportion because he is a professor. "Professors tend to be dramatic."
