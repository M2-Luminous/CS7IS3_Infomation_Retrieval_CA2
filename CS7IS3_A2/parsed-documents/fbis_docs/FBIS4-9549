Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said Tuesday in Barbados. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has threatened to bomb Serb positions if the equipment is not withdrawn from around the Moslem enclave by 0001 GMT Wednesday. "If they don't withdraw, then we will use air strikes against them without any hesitation," he said in a press conference in Barbados broadcast at the United Nations. NATO and the United Nations have several times threatened air raids to protect Bosnian Moslems in UN-declared safe areas but never actually carried them out except for two strikes two weeks ago to protect UN peacekeepers. "I am hoping that the Serbs will comply with the different resolutions which have been adopted by the UN and that they will leave Gorazde and that we will not be compelled to use air strikes," he said. UN forces in the former Yugoslavia have said that the heavy weapons are being withdrawn as the deadline approaches. The secretary general has been in the Caribbean island of Barbados since the weekend to open a world conference for sustainable development for small states.
