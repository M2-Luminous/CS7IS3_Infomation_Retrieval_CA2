Ever since U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Japanese guest Morihiro Hosokawa stepped in front of the White House microphones, jointly announcing that they do not agree, one of those disputes is looming that are hardly too dramatic to describe by the term "trade war." The fact is that history has seen cold and hot wars being waged for much lesser conflicts of interests. Apart from the Pacific Ocean, the two world economic powers are separated by a gigantic imbalance. It is adding up to an annual $50 billion in the United States' balance of trade. Both sides declare that the deficit has to be cut. In the Japanese view, Clinton chose the wrong means at the wrong time. Japan is in the middle of the worst recession in recent history and it fears that terrible things might happen if it agrees to opening up its markets to an extent exactly defined by yens and dollars. It is, therefore, unlikely that Hosokawa, who does not tend to be subservient anyhow, will give way. A showdown can be expected. The question is whether the Europeans will be able to watch an escalating conflict across the Pacific as a joyful third party. It might seem this way. They do not have any serious trade imbalances with the United States. And if the Americans manage to clear away the barriers with which Japan blocks off unwelcome imports, they might also be clearing the way for the Europeans. Until then, and in the foreseeable future, there can only be losers in the Pacific economic powers' conflict. For, among the things that are at stake are the laboriously achieved results of the latest world trade round. Goodbye, lovely profits from prosperity!
