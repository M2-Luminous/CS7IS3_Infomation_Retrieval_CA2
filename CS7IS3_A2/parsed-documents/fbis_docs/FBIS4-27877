A trader, who has received North Korea's written inquiry about the import, told YONHAP News Agency Saturday that North Korean businesses had placed with many Hong Kong traders orders for rice, corn, sugar and some 100 other consumer items, hurrying to strike deals by the early part of June. The trader, who has long business relations with North Korea, said North Korea had informed him that it would send a three-member government buying mission, headed by the vice chairman of the Light Industry Commission, to China's special economic district of Zhuhai in southern Guangdong Province in early June. The North Korean mission will stay in a dormitory for members of the five North Korean firms operating in Zhuhai, not in a hotel for security reasons, for seven days, making deals with Hong Kong traders in the dormitory, he added. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said he could not disclose a full list of the items, including the quantities and values, North Korea ordered because of the business interest involved. In addition to making deals with Hong Kong traders, the North Korean mission will meet a Hong Kong lawyer in Zhuhai to discuss ways of recovering the 4 million U.S. dollars still remaining in North Korea's deposits in the bankrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International in Hong kong, the trader said. North Korea has withdrawn 6 million dollars out of the 10 million dollars it deposited in the Hong Kong bank since its declaration of bankruptcy in 1991.
