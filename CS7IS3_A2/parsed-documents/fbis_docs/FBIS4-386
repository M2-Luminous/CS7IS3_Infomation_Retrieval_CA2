The RPF not only refuse to recognize the government set up by close aides of assassinated President Juvenal Habyarimana but they are currently marching on Kigali to, according to them, stop the carnage by government forces. As I said earlier, it was initially thought that a cease-fire was possible between the two parties but in reality that is not so. The RPF's movement toward Kigali continues. This was confirmed this morning by Augustin Mukama, an RPF officer in Kampala, Uganda, in an interview with Raphael Mbadinga. [Begin Mukama recording] We formally and categorically deny that there have been any negotiations on a cease-fire between the RPF and the puppet government set up in Kigali. There have been no cease-fire negotiations. There have never even been any negotiations on a truce. It is strange that Europeans and foreigners are being given the right to come to the rescue of their citizens while the RPF is being asked to stop doing the same for Rwandans who are in a much more critical situation than the foreigners in Kigali. It is therefore our responsibility, our sacred duty, to march on Kigali and to save the people. Yesterday afternoon, at 1500, our troops were 8 km from the capital. Now, we are in the outskirts of the city and even within Kigali commune. [end recording] We now bring you the reaction of the Republican Democratic Movement, the assassinated Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana's party. Its West Africa representative, Mr. Kaberuka, refutes the RPF's statements. He was interviewed this morning by Raphael Mbadinga. [Begin Kaberuka recording] The truth is that the RPF is looking for a dual cease-fire. It wants a cease-fire in Kigali alone but rejects a nationwide cease-fire as proposed by the government. You will understand that there can be no question of a cease-fire in Kigali while fighting continues in the rest of the country [words indistinct]. Either we cease fire and drop the war option or we leave out the question of a cease-fire and choose war. It seems the RPF has chosen the warpath which is exactly what the interim government does not want. This is what the interim government and the Rwandan people have never wanted. [end recording]
