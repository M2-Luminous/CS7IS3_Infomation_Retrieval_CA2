FR940412-0-00010 FR940412-0-00003 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 55 [FRL&hyph;4862&hyph;1] Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations; Consistency Update for California AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The EPA is finalizing the updates of the Outer Continental Shelf (``OCS'') Air Regulations proposed in the Federal Register on January 7, 1994 and February 8, 1994. Requirements applying to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (``COA''), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''), as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The portion of the OCS Air Regulations that is being updated pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which the San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District (San Luis Obispo County APCD), the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (Santa Barbara APCD), the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD), and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD) are the designated COAs. The intended effect of approving the requirements contained in ``San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'' (March 11, 1994), ``Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'' (March 11, 1994), ``South Coast Air Quality Management District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'' (March 11, 1994), and ``Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'' (March 11, 1994) is to regulate emissions from OCS sources in accordance with the requirements onshore. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective May 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christine Vineyard, Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, Telephone: (415) 744&hyph;1197. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On January 7, 1994 at 59 FR 994 and February 8, 1994 at 59 FR 5745, EPA proposed to approve the following requirements into the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations: ``San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District Requirements applicable to OCS Sources'', ``Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'', ``South Coast Air Quality Management District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'', and ``Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources''. These requirements represent the third update of part 55 and are being promulgated in response to the submittal of rules from local air pollution control agencies. EPA has evaluated the above requirements to ensure that they are rationally related to the attainment or maintenance of Federal or state ambient air quality standards or part C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1. EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure that they are not arbitrary or capricious. 40 CFR 55.12(e). In addition, EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules. A 30-day public comment period was provided at 59 FR 994 and 59 FR 5745 and no comments were received. EPA Action In this document, EPA takes final action to incorporate the proposed changes into 40 CFR part 55. One minor change was made to the proposal set forth in the January 7, 1994 and February 8, 1994 notices of proposed rulemaking. This change includes the addition of a document date for the requirements to be incorporated into part 55. EPA is approving the submittal as modified under section 328(a)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7627. Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. Administrative Requirements A. Executive Order 12291 (Regulatory Impact Analysis) The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291. This exemption continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities include small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. As was stated in the final OCS regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and the structure of the rule averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328 of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule. The EPA certifies that this final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements contained in the final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. , and has assigned OMB control number 2060&hyph;0249. This consistency update does not add any further requirements.
