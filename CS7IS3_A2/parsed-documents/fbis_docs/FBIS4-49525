This was stated by Premier Li Peng at a meeting with Kenyan President Daniel T. arap Moi here today. Reform can be deepened and economic and social development promoted only under the conditions of stability, Li said. In the process of the reform, Li noted, the government encourages the spirit of making bold explorations and summing up experience constantly, and all reform measures should be tested in practice. A measure will be persisted in and perfected so long as it is beneficial to developing productivity, to strengthening the comprehensive national power and to raising the people's living standards, the premier added. Since reform policies were carried out under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Li said, great changes have taken place in China. But there is a long way to go before China becomes a strong and prosperous country and dozens of years of more efforts are still needed, he added. During the meeting, Li told Arap Moi that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to its relations with Kenya. Thanks to the joint efforts, the relations have been developing smoothly and will be consolidated and developed in the future. Li described Kenya as a country of important influence in Africa, praising the Kenyan Government for its achievements in safeguarding state sovereignty, maintaining national unity and developing the national economy. China also appreciates Kenya's foreign policy of non-alignment and keeping friendly relations with its neighboring countries. The policy has contributed to the stability in East Africa, Li said. Arap Moi said that his visit to China has served to further strengthen and develop bilateral relations, trade and economic links in particular. The president also expressed agreement with what Li Peng said that all countries should choose their own roads of development in line with their own conditions. Present at the meeting were Chen Changben, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice-minister of culture, Wang Changyi, assistant to the foreign minister, and Chen Pingchu, Chinese ambassador to Kenya. On the Kenyan side were S.K. Musyoka, minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, J.J. Kamotho, minister of education, K. Kones, minister of state in the president's office, and P.L. Lotodo, minister of home affairs and national heritage. President arap Moi is to leave here this evening for India.
