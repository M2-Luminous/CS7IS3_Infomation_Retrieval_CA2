ACTION: Proposed rule; public comment period and opportunity for public hearing on proposed amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Colorado permanent regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Colorado program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment consists of changes to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Division of Minerals and Geology (DMG) of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and the Water Quality Control Division (WQCD) of the Colorado Department of Health that addresses water quality management at coal mines. The revised MOU provides for the collection of water quality samples by DMG for analysis when DMG suspects an unpermitted discharge, clarifies that WQCD is solely responsible for enforcement of the Colorado Discharge Permit System (CDPS) program, and provides for the issuance of a cessation order by DMG in those instances of imminent danger to health or safety or significant environmental harm. The amendment is intended to revise the Colorado program to be consistent with the Federal regulations and SMCRA. DATES: Written comments must be received by 4 p.m., m.d.t. May 9, 1994. If requested, a public hearing on the proposed amendment will be held on May 2, 1994. Requests to present oral testimony at the hearing must be received by 4 p.m., m.d.t. on April 22, 1994.
