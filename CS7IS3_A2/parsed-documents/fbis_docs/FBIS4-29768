[Han Sung-chu] The situation is no more dangerous that it was before. Of course, considerable forces on both sides -- North and South Korea -- are still facing each other. However, since the day the nuclear crisis began, we have not observed any extraordinary movements by the North Korean Army. Thus, we have no reason to expect any provocation on their part right now. Therefore, on the 15th day of this month, just as in any month, routine civil defense exercises were organized, the only difference being that this time they were held nationwide. [Kolodziejczyk] How do you think the situation will develop? [Han Sung-chu] The development of the situation will now depend on what steps are taken by the UN Security Council over the next two or three months. During this time, a decision will be made as to whether the Security Council will pass resolutions concerning North Korea, and if so, when. There is a certain hope that the North will nonetheless continue its cooperation with international organizations and other states. Even though it left the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it did not expel the UN inspectors, who were sent to control its nuclear program there. [Kolodziejczyk] In such a situation, is the South Korean Government going to focus its efforts on strengthening its own defense capabilities, that is, military capabilities, or will it focus on possibilities for resolving the crisis through peaceful means? [Han Sung-chu] I consider it vital and indispensable to act in both directions. Of course, our primary intention is to maintain the peace; however, we can see the poor results of our talks, including those initiated by the Security Council. [Kolodziejczyk] If the North had so desired, it could have seriously threatened South Korea much earlier, with its short-and medium-range missiles, by destroying your nuclear power plants and some of your military equipment. However, this is not what happened. What are the reasons, then, that the North's holding of these weapons is seen as so dangerous? [Han Sung-chu] There are at least three reasons why nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea constitute a real threat. First, because we are dealing with a regime that is very reckless and determined, if not unpredictable. For this reason alone we cannot rule out the possibility of the North's employing nuclear weapons -- if it had such weapons at its disposal. Second, even if they do not actually use the weapons, they may use them for blackmailing purposes -- not only us, but neighboring states as well; they would also be fully aware of the fact that this would entail destroying their entire system and themselves as well. At the same time, the possibility of a provocation through the use of conventional means has increased, which is a very important issue. Third, if nuclear weapons were manufactured in the North, there would arise the very important problem of nuclear proliferation. Not only in our region, but across the world. In other words, we would witness a threat not only in the region, but also in the world; I must admit, though, that for us this threat is more acute than for the rest of the world. [Kolodziejczyk] Do you not think that direct talks between the North and the South in the first phase of the crisis would be a much quicker and more effective method of resolving this problem, as opposed to third countries getting involved? [Han Sung-chu] We have always advocated dialogue with North Korea. As is known, we even reached some kind of an agreement with them in the talks in the autumn of 1992; those talks concerned, among other issues, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. We also established a joint committee. Unfortunately, North Korea has so far not wanted to hold any further negotiations with us. It does insist, however, on direct dialogue with the United States. Now that it has withdrawn from the IAEA, it does not want to talk with them either. I would like to offer assurances that as far as we are concerned, we have done as much as possible, and will do as much as possible in the future to find a resolution to this problem through dialogue. [Kolodziejczyk] Why do you think the North has been avoiding direct talks with the South? [Han Sung-chu] I think they are afraid of the Berlin Wall syndrome. That is, they are afraid that talks with us, or any contacts, including exchanges, might encroach considerably on their system. This, in turn, might cause consequences similar to those triggered by the collapse of the Berlin Wall. In such a situation, both North Korea's system and representatives would lose the justification for their continued political existence. [Kolodziejczyk] Some oppositional parties in your country claim that the position of the United States on the issue of controlling the North's nuclear program was considerably exaggerated. These circles suppose that in the context of the current nuclear crisis, the interests of South Korea may not be identical with those of the United States. [Han Sung-chu] This supposition is totally contrary to reality. The patient and systematic policy of the United States, the policy of constantly persuading North Korea to agree to hold talks, refutes this opinion. Two rounds of talks have already been held. If the North wanted, it could certainly, and easily, meet the conditions, which, in turn, would be the foundation of serious political dialogue. In the meantime, this country ruined the foundations of such a dialogue by withdrawing from the IAEA. Now, the criticism of the U.S. stand has its origins, first of all, in the United States itself. The opposition in the United States is not unanimous on this issue, not to mention that some of Bill Clinton's policy statements concerning the Korean crisis are far less critical than some people would like them to be. For the sake of clarity, I would like to add that the policy of our government concerning this issue is the same as the policy of the United States. [Kolodziejczyk] Some political observers have suggested that the goal of the mission by former President Carter was to persuade the North to give up its nuclear program in exchange for diplomatic recognition by the United States, in particular. Would your government be willing to reach a compromise on this issue? [Han Sung-chu] Jimmy Carter did not go to Pyongyang to negotiate anything, and certainly not the issue of North Korea's return to the international political scene. However, we will very seriously consider every suggestion that Carter brings back with him. I would like to stress, however, that any suggestion on the part of North Korea should be of a more formal nature. We must be certain of what is going on; we must also be sure of the intentions of any possible proposals. [Kolodziejczyk] What is your evaluation of the stand taken by China? This country has clearly stated that it does not accept any sanctions directed against the North. [Han Sung-chu] China has played a very serious role in this crisis. So far the role has been rather constructive. China has stated quite unequivocally that it is against the nuclear program of the North; it tried its own methods to persuade the North to conduct a dialogue and, first of all, maintain the clarity of the nuclear program. I think that at the forum of the UN Security Council -- the issue of the resolution is still open -- China's stand will depend on how North Korea responds to the international actions. If the North is inclined to cooperate, then I believe there will be no reason for the Security Council to pass any resolutions. However, if the North rejects such a possibility, then I believe China will not be able to continue supporting North Korea at such an important forum. [Kolodziejczyk] Would your government accept the concept of an international conference addressing the situation on the Korean Peninsula, as was once proposed by Russia? [Han Sung-chu] On principle we are not against multilateral talks; however, we doubt the usefulness of such talks if North Korea does not agree to satisfy the fundamental conditions of the dialogue. This is why we are skeptical about the idea of holding such a conference. [Kolodziejczyk] What is your evaluation of Japan's position on the Korean crisis? As is known, many Korean workers in Japan have family in North Korea. [Han Sung-chu] It must be admitted that Japan was very upset by the present situation. We have close relations with this country which make it possible for us to hold constant consultations among the three states: our country, the United States, and Japan. This country has so far consistently supported the idea of the Security Council's passing a resolution if North Korea continues to refuse to cooperate with the international body. [Kolodziejczyk] In the situation that has developed now, has the idea of uniting both Koreas become far more remote, or is it the other way around? [Han Sung-chu] It is difficult to say anything about it. A similar situation was observed after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. At that time, no one was able to predict that the unification of Germany would come almost automatically after the first breaches of the Berlin Wall were made. Thus, we cannot say anything specific on this issue as well. Some people think that the unification of both Koreas will occur next year, others -- in two years' time... [Kolodziejczyk] North Korea is to a considerable degree isolated from the rest of the world. Do the government and people of South Korea know how their countrymen on the other side of the 38th parallel are living? Do they know, for instance, whether -- just as in South -- they want to unite, and, if it came to an open conflict, whether they would shoot at their countrymen from the South? [Han Sung-chu] Well, they have already done this. The Korean war in 1950 cost both sides a lot of blood. However, almost 40 years have passed since that time and the situation in the world has changed dramatically. For example, there is no longer any Soviet Union. Today the North -- unlike the South -- is experiencing a difficult economic situation. Apart from that, our defense capabilities in the South are so great today that they would have to act irrationally and be totally desperate to attempt any provocation against us. However, it is true that we simply do not know many details of the lives of our countrymen in the North. Generally, we know as much as the world does -- that the people complain about living standards -- and we know the methods by which the authorities manage the economy. I believe, however, that the North Koreans know something; they secretly listen to our radio broadcasts... Even the most closed society is not totally hermetic, not to say watertight. I think that the Koreans from the North realize the differences between themselves and the rest of the world.
