Greece wants to improve Greek-Albanian relations, but that improvement depends on respect for the human rights of the Greek minority in Albania. Venizelos stressed that if there is any evidence, it should have been presented either at the Zurich meeting between Foreign Ministers Karolos Papoulias and Alfred Serreqi or at the meeting of the Ministries of Public Order delegations in Ioannina. The government appeared satisfied with the explanations made by the U.S. State Department, following the demarche lodge by Greek Ambassador in Washington Loukas Tsilas, regarding a statement by U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry. According to McCurry's statement, the U.S. Government has no credible evidence that it is the policy of the Albanian Government to suppress the Greek minority. The government spokesman said the Greek Government asked the State Department to make the explanation given to the Greek ambassador in the form of a public statement.
