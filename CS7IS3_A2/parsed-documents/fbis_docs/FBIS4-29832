Speaking upon the opposition's return to Parliament after a two-day boycott, Mr. Reddy said they ended their boycott in the interest of Fiji's economy and the planned review of Fiji's racially biased Constitution. The leader of the opposition Labor Party, Mahendra Chowdury, earlier said that it was more important to concentrate on changing the Constitution, which currently guarantees ethnic Fijians political dominance over Indo-Fijians. The opposition boycott was fueled by a statement by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka that he could not guarantee against a third and more violent coup than the two which brought him to power in 1987.
