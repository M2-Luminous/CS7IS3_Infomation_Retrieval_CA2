The delegation consisted of Minister R.F. Botha (Minister of Foreign Affairs), General George Meiring (Chief of the South African Defence Force), and Messrs Mac Maharaj and Fanie van der Merwe of the Management Committee of the TEC. Minister Botha informed President Mangope that the South African Government, acting in conjunction with the Management Committee of the TEC had noted that: 1. The Government of President Mangope is no longer in control events in Bophuthatswana; 2. All effective administration has seized [as received] to exist; 3. The civil service, including the police and army refuse to recognise the authority of the government of President Mangope. Accordingly, the SA Government in conjunction with the Management Committee of the TEC had come to the conclusion that President Mangope was no longer in charge of the administration of Bophuthatswana. In the circumstances the current South African Ambassador, Professor Tjaard van der Walt has, as an interim measure, been placed in charge of Bophuthatswana until such time as the South African Government and the TEC agree upon the appointment of stable administrative structures and the elections have been held in terms of the 1993 constitution. Professor van der Walt will meet the secretaries of all departments and other public servants to ensure the immediate restoration of effective administration. The South African Defence Force (SADF) has been entrusted with the task of maintaining law and order under the direction of the South African Government acting in conjunction with the TEC. President Mangope, for his own safety and protection, will be secured by the SADF. Citizens of South Africa, and all those resident in Bophuthatswana, can now engage in free political activity and participate without let or hinderance in the forthcoming elections. We urge all to exercise the right in a peaceful and orderly manner and with due regard to the urgent need for proper administration to be established. All public servants, the police and the army, including those dismissed by the government of President Mangope in the recent weeks, are guaranteed their jobs, salaries and pensions and are urged to co-operate with the interim administrator, return to their duties and participate in the process of establishing effective administration for the benefit of all citizens and residents in the area. We urge all to enable a speedy return to normality in all spheres of life. We have taken these steps in the interest of good governance, sound and effective administration, protection of life and property and in order to ensure that all are able to engage in free and fair elections in an atmosphere of peace without any intimidation in whatever form.
