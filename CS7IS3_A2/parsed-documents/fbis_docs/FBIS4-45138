Missile Regiment on Combat Alert."] [Text] After saying farewell to Belorussia [Belarus], the RS-12M mobile intercontinental nuclear missiles, customarily called simply "Topols" [poplar trees], along with their support systems, have arrived home in Russia--in a division in Yoshkar-Ola. Col Vladimir Kashkin's missile regiment, having gotten off combat alert duty, was not part of our military forces which were serving with the 43d Missile Army in Ukraine and which were moved out of there by the sensitive local leadership, taking nothing with them: All military property now belongs to Ukraine. The system of barriers at the "missile corner" where the Topols are located is very inhospitable to those not authorized to be there. For example, the so-called electrified zone looks like a sort of spiney network, through which at regular intervals an approximately 1500-volt current flows. Officers and noncommissioned officers service the Topols. This gives them the modest right to call themselves Strategic Missile Forces professionals. For good service, an officer with the rank of major can earn 300 thousand rubles a month--they get money for food, for keeping up appearances, for shift duty, and for other good things in life. In view of the fact that most men in military service do not have apartments and do not expect to have them any time soon, but do have plenty of unemployed wives and hungry children, one can say happily that our great Motherland's nuclear shield is in the hands of enthusiasts! But fortunately the country is poor and the Defense Ministry poorer, while an officer is a sort of father in a subsistence economy. He must not only service the missiles, but in his "free time"--as if he had any--he must build a barracks, mess hall, and so on. Their desperate wives stubbornly work as communications officers, dispatchers, and so on, and proudly contribute their 150 thousand rubles to the family budget. There are 108 of them in Vladimir Kashkin's regiment--almost the entire communications and medical staff. Vladislav Zotin, president of the Republic of Mariy El, after he attended the above-mentioned ceremony, felt so sincerely about "his" military men that he thought that the best way to prevent bad consequences in the missile forces was to visit personally the General Staff in Moscow. He asked for more generous financing so that the forces could be at normal strength. As to whether the presidential travels will help the missile troops--who knows, but his travels have made them feel more friendly towards their commanders.
