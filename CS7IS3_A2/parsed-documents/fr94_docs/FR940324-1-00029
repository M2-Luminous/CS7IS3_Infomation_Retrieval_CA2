FR940324-1-00029 FR940324-1-00008 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven Rosenthal, Regulation Development Branch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886&hyph;6052. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under 40 CFR 52.741 (u) and (x) in the Chicago FIP, sources located in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will Counties with total Maximum Theoretical Emissions 1 (MTE) of more than 100 tons per calendar year of VOC 2 and which are not covered by a Control Techniques Guideline document, must comply with certain requirements. The rule provides an exemption, however, for sources which are limited to 100 tons or less of VOC emissions per calendar year, before the application of capture systems and control devices, through production or capacity limitations contained in a federally enforceable construction permit or a State Implementation Plan (SIP) or FIP revision. 1 Maximum theoretical emissions (MTE) is defined in 40 CFR 52.741(a)(3) as the quantity of volatile organic material emissions that theoretically could be emitted by a stationary source before add-on controls based on the design capacity or maximum production capacity of the source and 8760 hours per year. The design capacity or maximum production capacity includes use of coating(s) or ink(s) with the highest volatile organic material content actually used in practice by the source. 2 The term ``volatile organic material'' (VOM) is used in the Chicago FIP, in which it has the identical definition as VOC. On February 7, 1992, Service Plastics, Inc. requested a FIP revision that would impose the identical limitations on its plant operations as those specified in a February 13, 1992, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) operating permit. If granted, this FIP revision would restrict its use of lacquers, thinners, and other VOC containing materials with the intent of keeping its VOC emissions below 100 tons per year. IEPA's operating permit contains the following limitations on the VOC content and the amount of VOC containing materials that can be used at its ELK Grove Village facility: Emissions and operation of the 27 paint spray booths shall not exceed the following limits: ␣ 1Source 1VOC content (lb/gal) 1VOC ``as applied'' (lb/gal) 1Throughput (gal/yr) 1VOC emissions (TPY) Lacquer 5.55 6.2 16,000 49.6 Thinner 6.77 6.2 16,000 49.6 Other* 1,000 lb 0.5 n,n,n,n,s Total 99.7 *Other VOC containing materials, including mask wash and cleaning solvent IEPA's Operating Permit requires that the following records be kept: •Name of each coating used with VOC content (lb/gal); •Usage of each coating (gal/mo); •VOC content of each coating as ``as applied'' (lb/gal). An April 1, 1992, discussion with a Service Plastics, Inc. representative revealed that the 6.2 pounds VOC per gallon of coating limitation is merely an average, based upon the extent to which a specific lacquer is thinned with solvent.
