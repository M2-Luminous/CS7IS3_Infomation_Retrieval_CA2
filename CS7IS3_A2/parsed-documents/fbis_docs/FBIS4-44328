The decision emerges from a bill to which EXPRESSO has had access and that [Defense Minister] Fernando Nogueira sent to the Assembly of the Republic yesterday afternoon. According to the document, the new department will come directly under the prime minister, through the minister with the relevant portfolio. The government seeks through this initiative to improve the efficiency of the external security services -- whether of a military, strategic, or economic nature -- adjusting that aim to the material and human resources with which they are provided. To this end, it proposes not only the existence of a smaller number of officials but also the setting up of a single department, having in mind improving the conditions of work and of performing tasks. The new body, which will be called the Strategic Defense and Military Intelligence Services (SIEDM), will result from the merger of the current SIM and the SIED, which, despite being enshrined in the current law, was never set up. According to Framework Law on the Intelligence Service of the Republic (SIR), there are currently three departments taking part in the areas of the country's internal and external security -- the Intelligence and Security Service (coming under the minister of internal administration, it is devoted to internal security), the SIM (which includes the Dinfo and comes under the defense minister through the Armed Forces chief of staff -- CEMGFA), and the CIED, which exists only in law. New Rules for Military Intelligence Agents With Fernando Nogueira's new proposed change, the Dinfo (which is still responsible for the defense of the country against an external threat) and the CEMGFA disappear from this structure. Despite the Armed Forces chief's removal from the tip of the SIM's leadership pyramid, military personnel will continue to make up the new body's cadres, except that they will not be able to exceed 50 percent of the SIEDM's personnel or be placed in a position other than that of a mere service commission. Moreover, this will be the case with the civilians to be recruited from the public administration, the ranks of the judges and the state attorney's office, and the diplomatic corps. In addition, military personnel who serve their service commissions in the SIEDM will be subject not to Armed Forces regulations but to those of the body itself. Through this measure, Fernando Nogueira allays certain concerns expressed by the opposition parties during the contacts that he had with them last year. At those meetings, some party representatives expressed misgivings about the excessive presence of military personnel in the SIEDM and their activity. However, as is common in other countries, the Armed Forces will have just one military intelligence division (DIMIL), intended to gather any specific operational intelligence -- not any intelligence of a strategic nature. Even so, and in order to reassure the opposition parties, Fernando Nogueira inserts in the bill an article providing, within this vast restructuring, that the Intelligence Services Oversight Council will assess the DIMIL's reports. So this is a kind of guarantee assuring politicians that the military personnel will not exceed their duties within the strict operational framework that will be assigned to them.
