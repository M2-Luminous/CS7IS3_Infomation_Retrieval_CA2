In his opinion, numbers for the Armed Forces as set out in the defense law--1.5 million by 1995--are insufficient to carry out the tasks of guaranteeing the state's security. Pavel Grachev confirmed the military department's policy of recruitment on contract. Contract soldiers, the minister said, will be recruited mainly for the fighting units and not for the administrative or quartermasters' services. In 1993, 93,000 contract soldiers were recruited in 1993. The plan is to recruit 150,000-160,000 contract soldiers in 1994. The defense minister also spoke of the proposed reorganization of educational work in the Army. Its focus will move from the center to the level of companies, battalions, and regiments. There are specific proposals for regiments to have a deputy commander responsible for educational work, a lawyer, psychologist, and a sociologist.
