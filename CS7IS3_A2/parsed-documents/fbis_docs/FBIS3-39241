Schrempp, who arrived in Jerusalem on Monday [14 February] for a brief talk with Israeli head of government Yitzhaq Rabin, told the press afterwards that both sides could benefit from such cooperation. The Dasa chief had visited, among other things, the Israeli aviation corporation Israel Air Force Industries (IAI) and the armament company Rafael. He noted that the high-tech companies have excellent quality, which need not shy away from international comparison. Both sides would benefit from an exchange in the field of technology. As fields of cooperation he cited defense technology, satellite technology, and aircraft construction. Schrempp spoke of efforts by Airbus to sell planes to the Israeli El Al airline. Smaller planes could be of interest for El Al, if regional aviation becomes more important as a result of a stable peace in the Middle East. In his talk with Schrempp, Rabin explained his government's interest in balancing the high deficit in his country's trade balance with Europe. However, politics can provide industry only with a framework, which then has to be fleshed out by the companies themselves, Rabin noted.
