During the additional inquiry, this measure was contested by the main industrial user of isobutanol (which is essentially used as a solvent in the paint and varnish industry), saying that: - Community producers of isobutanol have introduced a new production technique for oxo alcohols that use less isobutanol; the decline of Community production would be due to this technological change. The Commission replied that the isobutanol market contracted by 20 percent whereas the decline in Community production was nearly twice that (39.8 percent) and the use of capacities (after the reduction of installations) fell from 73.8 percent to 57.3 percent. The result is that, without denying the effects of the technological change, there remains a considerable negative effect caused by dumped imports; - Isobutanol represents a major proportion of its production costs for certain intermediate products made only in Italy and for the Italian market. For these products, the industrial user in question must face competition from producers in Austria, Poland and Hungary, which can continue to buy Russian isobutanol if no measure is taken against dumping. The Council agreed with the Commission's conclusions and approved the definitive anti-dumping duty at the same provisional duty of ECU102 a tonne. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom voted against it.
