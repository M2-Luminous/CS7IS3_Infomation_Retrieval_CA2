Mr Zimbiri, who identified himself to SAPA using a pre- arranged code, said regional and sectional commanders as well as ground forces of the Pan Africanist Congress' [PAC] armed wing had met in Bloemfontein for five hours on Monday. "We want it to be known that we are not uncontrollable," he said. Asked if the three men killed in an attack on a police station in central Durban early on Monday were APLA members, he said he did not want to make any claims and would "leave this to the media's imagination". While he respected PAC President Clarence Makwetu's decision to end the armed struggle, it was premature of him to announce this before the conclusion of APLA's negotiations with the South African Defence Force. "We will strike tomorrow and today...We are always on the offensive." Mr Zimbiri said the ball was in the SADF's court. APLA would not surrender its arms to the "minority (President F W) de Klerk settler regime" until its demands had been met. These included a United Nations peace-keeping force, he said.
