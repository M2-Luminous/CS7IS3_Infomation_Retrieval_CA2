The French official also said he was "convinced that once Mexico concludes the process of joining" the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE), "it will become an active member." Shortly before beginning a three-day official visit to Mexico, Jupp affirmed that France "is happy" the OCDE decided, in June, "to take into consideration Mexico's candidacy given Mexico's significant economic progress in past years." The European minister denied the crisis in the southern Chiapas state would hinder Mexico's integration into the OCDE. Jupp said: "Mexico will know how to resolve the State of Chiapas conflict through dialogue; this is not an obstacle to it becoming an OCDE member." Alain Jupp denied the Chiapas conflict could adversely affect investments in Mexico while he expressed assurance that France wants these to increase thereby contributing to the nation's development. "It is through development that events like those that occurred are avoided," he noted. Jupp said his visit, "30 years after General Charles De Gaulle's historic visit," is an expression of "the continuation of France's policy toward Mexico, and our willingness to develop a privileged relationship" with that Latin American nation. "One of the main reasons for my trip is to stress France's wish to become the bridge between the EU and Mexico," he assured. Jupp indicated that NAFTA will favor international trade and will contribute to Mexico's modernization, nevertheless, he warned against the increase of discriminatory measures against third nations. "France is pleased with the benefits NAFTA may contribute to Mexico and with everything else that could stimulate the economy's vitality. This strengthens the possibilities between both nations as long as the agreement does not adopt discriminatory measures against third nations," he noted. Jupp denied that the trilateral agreement, which was implemented on 1 January, is "a trade block; rather, it is a free trade zone" and "its creation should contribute to the development of international trade," he added. "French companies are aware of all the benefits they can obtain from an agreement that will continue fostering Mexico's modernization in all sectors, including that of environmental protection," the foreign minister remarked. "I am certain Mexico will gladly accept France's technological capabilities in favor of the ongoing liberalization, to which the trade agreement should contribute," Jupp indicated. "Mexico's economic vitality, together with its rich cultural tradition, justify Mexico to be France's privileged associate in Latin America, and we intend to continue developing this relationship," assured the high-ranking French official. "We seek to give a new thrust to the relationship between both nations through the development of economic ties. The reforms adopted by President Salinas de Gortari have allowed France's presence to be stepped up in Mexico," Jupp assured. For France, Mexico is "an important political and economic associate," the head of French diplomacy indicated. Regarding the possibility of Mexico becoming a UN Security Council member, Jupp said that "in France's opinion, the evolution of the international situation makes it necessary to enlarge the UN Security Council." Other nations besides France and Mexico have expressed interest in enlarging the UN Security council. To analyze this possibility, a work group at the UN General Assembly was appointed, the foreign minister indicated. "We believe that the aspirations of the nations willing to assume greater responsibilities in the international field should be taken into account," the foreign minister noted. "It is necessary to guard the Security Council's efficiency and assure the developing nations a just representation in this essential body of the UN system," Jupp commented. The foreign minister also said his government will initiated new policies of rapprochement with Latin America in an effort to support social and political development in the region's nations. "Latin America has reaffirmed political pluralism and its economic vitality has turned it into a region of constant development, leaving behind the crisis of the 80's," he assured. Alain Jupp added that "France wants a new type of relationship in association with Latin America, adopted to the new realities." The governments that respect the state of law will be favored "in the strategies taken into consideration to strengthen the Franco-Latin American ties." Likewise, he added those nations that "combat terrorism and drug trafficking to assure their institutions' stability," will be given priority. The French Government will promote "the establishment of French companies in Latin America" while scientific and technical cooperation will be jointly implemented so the economic projects benefit the region and France. Jupp indicated that "France must adapt its cooperation to the different nations on the continent and maintain its aid to the less developed regions while modernizing its cooperation with others." France represents 20 percent of the EU's cooperation in Latin America. "It is the French Government's duty to motivate its associates in this cooperation and to spell out new, concrete, and lasting actions," he indicated. The French foreign minister encouraged the Cuban Government to democratize. He commented that the economic reforms "are interesting but will not serve to replace the political liberty the Cuban people expect."
