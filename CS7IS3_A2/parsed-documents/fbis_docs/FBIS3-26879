It is not so, said the U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. "This is an extremely important issue that goes to the heart of this administration," he told a packed press conference this afternoon. After the failed summit last Friday [11 February], when President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to agree on a trade framework, cellular phones, for the U.S., show how difficult it is to enter the Japanese market. Accusing Tokyo of violating a 1989 agreement to buy more U.S.-made cellular phones, Washington hinted today at trade sanctions against Japan, whose trade surplus with the U.S. surpassed 60 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. "The Japanese Government created a situation favoring existing Japanese suppliers over any potential U.S. competitor," Christopher Galvin, Motorola's president, told a press conference following Kantor's announcement. For President Clinton, the issue of cellular phone was "illustrative of our general problems" with Japan. Motorola, with leading edge in cellular phone technologies, sells 40 percent of such phones in the world. In 1989, Japan agreed to let U.S.-made cellular phones enter its domestic markets, and the share in Japan's market by the Schaumberg, Illinois-based Motorola is supposed to reach one third to 50 percent by February 15, 1994. "Despite an accord with Japan that was designed to open the cellular telephone markets, we still find ourselves struggling to gain access to Japanese market," Galvin said. The issue of cellular phones has nothing to do with the trade framework talks between U.S. and Japan, although it coincided with the summit, whose failure is the first of its kind since the end of the second world war. During the eight-month old trade talks, U.S. asked to set numerical standards to evaluate the open nature of the Japanese market. Naming it managed trade, Tokyo said no and withdrew from the talks. The Americans are especially angry at the difficulty to enter Japan's markets of telecommunications, medical equipment, auto and auto parts, and insurance services, the four priority areas in the framework talks. Noting that some Japanese officials blamed the lack of competitiveness as a reason for limited success of foreign producers in Japan, Kantor called the excuse "false and disingenuous." Administration officials refused to anticipate if a full scale trade war with Japan is in breed, given the fact that such a conflict will impact not only Japanese companies but also American firms since the two countries are inextricably tied together in economies. "We are doing a thorough evaluation. We are moving with our deliberate speeds on this issue," said Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. He said recent comments by the administration are "very serious" and are not threatening words. "We're going to be consistent and insistent that American products, goods and services have an opportunity to compete fairly in Japanese markets." Observers, meanwhile, listed many options facing the Clinton administration, including the revival of the Super 301 Trade Law, which asks the government to review unfair trade practices by foreign countries on an annual basis and impose sanctions in designated time. President Clinton is reportedly going to issue an executive order this week to revive the trade law, which, in the late 1980's, was used to pry open Japan's markets of super computer, satellite and timber products. The U.S. also intends to target the American affiliates of Japanese firms, some of which are accused of violating the anti-trust laws in the country, and to eye the European Union for multilateral approach in pressing Japan for move concessions in trade. "We have a number of options in order to make sure we open markets in Japan. That's our goal," Kantor said. "All we are asking is for two-way street."
