Answering an emergency question, Mr Goodlad said the Government awaited the assessment of military commanders on the spot. But he said ministers were "fully prepared to see air power used if it will improve the situation." Mr Goodlad spoke out after the weekend massacre of 68 people in Sarajevo market place. Echoing the Prime Minister's call this morning for immediate, effective and "more muscular" action to halt the bombardment of civilians in Sarajevo, he said: "We're looking for effective action, if necessary muscular action, to protect the civilian population of Sarajevo." Shadow foreign secretary Dr Jack Cunningham said if the Serbs and Croats did not immediately accept and implement decisions of the international community then NATO's "vastly superior air power" should be used. The Commons exchanges, on an emergency question from Dr Cunningham, came as European Union foreign ministers met to consider the implications of military intervention in the bloody conflict. Mr Goodlad expressed "horror and outrage" over the weekend massacre, adding: "The Government condemns this brutal and senseless act." He underlined the need for a negotiated peace but added that action over the plight of those living in Sarajevo could not await an overall settlement. "It is essential that the UN and NATO should consider immediately practical means for halting the bombardment of civilians there." Supporting the use of airpower, he said: "The Government remains determined that everything possible is done to ensure that this appalling conflict is brought to an end as soon as possible." Dr Cunningham joined in condemning the market place atrocity. "But doesn't recent history in the former Yugoslavia show that Western policy is in disarray over these problems," he said. "The record is one of failure to prevent atrocities resulting in wanton slaughter." Dr Cunningham said UN Security Council resolutions and NATO decisions had consistently not been implemented. They were seen as "empty threats" by the Serbs and Croats "and so their aggression and carnage continues." He said: "Indecision over Britain's proposed troop withdrawal has further encouraged Serbs and Croatians to believe their aggression would not only be ignored but rewarded with territorial gain. "And, tragically for all of us, the EU bears the principle responsibility for this catastrophe." He asked if the Government would immediately press for the reopening of Tuzla airport and the lifting of the seige at Sarajevo. "Do you agree that if the Serbs and Croatians do not immediately accept and allow the implementation of these decision of the international community, then they should be enforced by use of the vastly superior airpower of NATO?" Mr Goodlad said UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command with NATO support must apply the pressure necessary to halt the attacks. "If the military commanders advise this requires technical air support, we shall back their judgment." It was essential that Tuzla airport should be reopened and NATO airpower was available if needed. He said military commanders at NATO, the UN and in the UK had consistently advised that a "generalised policy of air strikes would not end the war" and could hamper humanitarian relief. "But in specific situations, the technical use of airpower can help to achieve defined objectives. "NATO will consider on Wednesday how that airpower might be used. "We await the assessment of military commanders but are fully prepared to see airpower used if it will improve the situation."
