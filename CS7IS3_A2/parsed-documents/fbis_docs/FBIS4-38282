Al-Khatib attributed this to the accord's nature, which is characterized in placing numerous restrictions on the work of the Palestinian authority. He explained that the most prominent example of that is implementation of the clause relating to the prisoners whose problem has now blown up in the face of everyone. This has created a serious test for the new arrangements and for the accord itself. Al-Khatib referred to the danger of the continued separation of the Gaza Strip from the West Bank. He said that this separation, which stems from the accord's division, will create contrasting realities and harm the unity of the land and people if it were to continue. Al-Khatib criticized the Palestinian performance in implementing the accord. He said that this performance actually adds other restrictions to the accord. He noted that the performance is still marked by chaos and lack of planning, which in practice has affected the speed in decisionmaking and the ability of the Palestinian Authority council to start its work. Al-Khatib said that the meeting held yesterday by the national authority lacked a quorum because less than half the members were present.
