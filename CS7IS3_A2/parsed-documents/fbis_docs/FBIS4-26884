Workers will remain "the masters of State-owned enterprises" when they are converted into limited-liability companies, said Yang Xingfu, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACTFU). Their rights to participate in the firms' management should not be deprived, Yang added. "It is a misunderstanding that the system of employees' congress--a proven effective way for workers to be involved in management supervision--belongs only to the planned economy and is not suitable to the modern enterprise system," Yang said. Employee enthusiasm and creativity are necessary components of the switch from state-owned firms to corporations. This ensures greater profits and leads to top value of State assets. Congress The employees' congress, therefore, has an even more important role to play, he said. "The employees' congress should not be replaced by the board of directors," Yang said. "The two should coexist in corporations." Congresses are the governing body of enterprises, elected by its workers. All important decisions, including managerial appointments and enterprise plans, should be submitted to employees' congresses for approval, Yang said. Labour relations within state firms will undergo great changes when the corporate system is introduced. Workers now need to sign labour contracts with their enterprises. The contracts should guarantee that workers enjoy rational pay, work hours, safety, insurance and welfare, he said. In contract-signing, negotiations should be carried out between the trade unions on behalf of workers and the board of directors. Disputes which cannot be resolved through negotiations should be settled according to relevant laws, Yang said. Wei Jianxing, chairman of ACFTU, also stressed workers' rights in decisionmaking must be guaranteed when the firm's management mechanism is transformed. At the ACTFU four-day conference, which ended yesterday, representatives from more than 20 state enterprises also exchanged their experiences in promoting trade unions and individual workers in carrying out reforms.
