The indictment capped a one-year investigation by prosecutors into a string of payoff allegations involving the nation's top construction companies and politicians. Nakamura became the first Diet member indicted in connection with the general contractor scandals. A total of 32 people, including two governors, two mayors, executives of eight contractors and a paper manufacturer, were indicted. According to the indictment, in 1992 Nakamura, 44, repeatedly urged Setsuo Umezawa, then chairman of the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), not to file a criminal accusation with prosecutors against a group headed by Kajima. Kajima was then leader of Saitama Doyo-kai (Saturday Association), comprised of 66 contractors in Saitama Prefecture which allegedly consulted over bid-rigging. Umezawa announced May 15, 1992, that the FTC decided not to file the criminal accusation against the group. The indictment said Nakamura received 10 million yen in a bribe from then Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama, 68, on January 13, 1992, at the parliamentarian's office in Tokyo's Nagatacho. Nakamura was then acting head of the Liberal Democratic Party's lobby of legislators concerned with a revision of the antimonopoly law. Nakamura quit the LDP prior to the arrest. The day's indictment followed a rare request by prosecutors on March 8 that the Diet lift Nakamura's constitutional immunity from arrest as a legislator while the Diet is in session. The Diet voted to grant the request on March 10. The granting of the request and the request itself was the first such case in 27 years. Nakamura was not in any governmental or Diet committee position to lawfully influence the action of the FTC when he allegedly pressured Umezawa not to file the criminal accusation against Kajima. Nakamura has been under arrest since March 11. Since his arrest, the former minister has refused to answer questions from prosecutors seeking to corroborate the bribery charges. In spite of his refusal to testify, the testimonies of other witnesses and other circumstantial evidence are convincing enough to prove his guilt, prosecution sources said. However, defense attorneys for Kiyoyama forwarded to prosecutors a legal statement in which Kiyoyama said his testimonies written in prosecutors' papers to be examined in court "contradict my memories." The defense attorneys also plan to argue that the FTC had already given up a plan to file the accusation by the time Nakamura tried to persuade Umezawa not to file it, saying prosecutors were then opposed to filing any accusation due to lack of specific evidence, sources close to the attorneys said. The attorneys are also expected to argue that Nakamura was merely acting on instructions from then LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru, Nakamura's mentor, who reportedly advised Kiyoyama to seek Nakamura's cooperation to block the FTC's planned move, the sources said. Nakamura said in a press statement issued through his defense counsel, "I am determined to reveal the truth regarding the allegations at open court hearings." "After I am released from detention, I will return to my parliamentary residence and participate in Diet deliberations from the day after my release," Nakamura said. However, prosecutors said they will oppose any move by his lawyers to seek Nakamura's release, saying he may try to destroy evidence, and three of Nakamura's political secretaries have vanished and not complied with prosecutors' court-authorized summons designed to obtain their testimonies. Meanwhile, the special investigating squad of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office will continue to investigate other reported payoffs to politicians other than Nakamura on suspicion of contravening the political funds control law, the investigative sources said. In the course of the one-year investigation, prosecutors seized hundreds of documents, including financial records, from the offices of the major contractors prosecutors raided. The law places a requirement to report acceptance of political funds while placing a ceiling on the annual amount of political funds that a lawmaker can lawfully accept from a single source. In a related development, the prosecutors decided not to indict two LDP executives other than Nakamura earlier named by the media as the alleged recipients of bribes from the construction industry, investigative sources said. It is impossible to indict former LDP Secretary General Seiroku Kajiyama on bribery charges in connection with the alleged acceptance of 10 million yen from Mitsui Construction Co. As the firm's ex-managing director told prosecutors he "embezzled" the money before delivering it to Kajiyama, the sources said. The prosecutors also decided not to indict former Post and Telecommunications Minister Hideo Watanabe on bribery charges, the sources said. Watanabe was reported to have accepted 40 million yen from Kajima in exchange for using his influence in a bid to have the Tokyo Metropolitan Government ease a regulation regarding construction of a high-rise building in a restricted area in Tokyo.
