By attaching a transparent layer, which acts as a window, to the laser's end surface, Sharp was able to achieve the world's highest output (295 milliwatts) by preventing heat generation, which occurs when the end surface of the crystal absorbs light and deteriorates. This achievement will raise the reliability during the recording and reading of data on optical discs. Sharp will continue to prevent the deterioration of interior elements and such and also plans to apply this technology to short wavelength lasers, which are suitable for high density recording. The most distinguishing feature of the newly developed laser is the window which was grown by the MOCVD [metal organic chemical vapor deposition] method on a laser element composed of aluminum, gallium, indium, and phosphorus. The window has a composition similar to that of the laser element. Because it is possible to control the light absorption at the end surface, it is possible for the laser to have a long life span. When 50 milliwatt lasers were compared, the one with the window was able to extend its lifetime by more than 10 times that of the one without the window. When a semiconductor laser's output is increased, the laser element's end surface absorbs light, heat is generated, and the crystal structure breaks down. Up until now, the optical output for a red laser came to a halt at 200 milliwatts. The red semiconductor laser is used for compact disc [CD] reading and for minidisc [MD] reading and writing. A 700 nanometer type with an output from 30-50 milliwatts has been put to practical use. The volume of information, which includes imagery and voice and such, increases the need for the commercialization of shortwave lasers that can record with higher speed and more density. The company intends to apply this element design to short wavelength lasers with high output.
