During a series of talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, the Japanese foreign minister, taking advantage of the good state of Japan-China relations, sought a candid exchange of views with the Chinese leaders on China's growing military spending. In response, on many occasions during the series of talks, the Chinese leaders simply reiterated the country's basic stance, giving the impression anew that although Japan-China relations are said to be in a "mature stage," relations may be "stepping on thin ice." Commenting on Foreign Minister Hata's visit to China, the Foreign Ministry said: "The foreign minister had a broad-ranging exchange of views with the Chinese leaders on building a future-oriented relationship between the two countries looking toward the 21st century." The Foreign Ministry has said that Japan intends to help enhance security in the Asia-Pacific region through an exchange of military information between the two countries. The Foreign Ministry also has said that the foreign minister's visit to China was to lay the groundwork for Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to China, scheduled for this spring. For the Chinese Government, meanwhile, Japan's cooperation with China in the areas of technology and economy is indispensable for China to continue its policy of reform and opening up. China intends to strengthen relations with Japan at a time when Sino-U.S. relations remain unstable with the aim of keeping the United States in check. Maintaining good relations between Japan and China is in the interests of the two countries. During the series of talks with the Chinese leaders, Foreign Minister Hata candidly pointed out that China's neighbors are concerned about its moves for military buildup and that China needs to disclose military information. In response, President Jiang Zemin devoted a substantial amount of time to explaining the current state of China's armed forces, but his explanations did not add anything to previous explanations and lacked specifics. There is little possibility that China will go along with the Japanese foreign minister's request for disclosure of military information, and a security dialogue between the two countries that Japan has sought is not likely to proceed smoothly in the future. The Taiwan issue drew attention during Mr. Hata's stay in Beijing. Taiwan's economy has grown dramatically, and China has become deeply concerned about Japan's rapid response to this development. Commenting on the Taiwan issue at a news conference in a Beijing hotel on 9 January, Foreign Minister Hata said: "Taiwan has grown remarkably, and it has become a nation that Japan cannot ignore. Both China and Taiwan, however, reject the concept of `two Chinas,' and Japan supports their positions. Japan intends to honor the Japan-China Joint Communique." In this way, the foreign minister reiterated that Japan will confine its contacts with Taiwan to economic exchanges. Foreign Minister Hata also ruled out the possibility of cabinet members visiting Taiwan, which China has vehemently opposed. Since Japan-China relations are entering a stage where they can candidly discuss a variety of issues, a "rift" between the two countries is surfacing in visible form. A senior Foreign Ministry official says: "Japan-China relations remain very good. But the attitude of China is such that it may unexpectedly initiate changes in these ties. Postwar issues between the two countries remain unresolved, and we do not know when those issues might explode."
