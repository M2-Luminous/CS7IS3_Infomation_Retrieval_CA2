[passage omitted] Juppe, responding on France-Inter radio, said the issue was "a major point of disagreement" with the government, which wants to keep its options open. [passage omitted] As for computer-generated tests, "most experts think further nuclear tests are needed" before this was possible," he added. A conservative member of parliament's defence committee used stronger language, saying Friday that Mitterrand was making a "vain testament, a farewell to arms" rather than showing a "vision of the future." The president "remains strangely faithful to an outmoded vision of the bipolar world of the Cold War, without taking account of the new unpredictable dangers which we should defend ourselves against," said Jacques Baumel, from the ruling coalition party Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR). Juppe said he agreed with the broad thrust of the president's arguments. This was that it was vital to French interests to maintain an independent nuclear deterrent and keep out of NATO's military command, to allocate more money to computer research and strengthen overall disarmament, he said. "There is no question today of rejoining the military organisation" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said Juppe, who said development of computer simulation "will allow us to move on from nuclear tests one day." [passage omitted] Mitterrand also gave the first-ever official details of his country's nuclear arsenal, saying France had some 500 nuclear warheads. The deterrent relied mainly on five nuclear-powered submarines which each carried 16 missiles with six independently targeted warheads. The number in service at any one time was 64 missiles, carrying a total of 384 warheads, each of 150 kilotonnes yield, Mitterrand said.
