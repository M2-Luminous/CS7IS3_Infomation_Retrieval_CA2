This was released today by officials attending an on-going national desertification meeting in this capital city of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. During the past few years, China has made progress in bringing some desert areas under control. However, deserts still keeps expanding, Zhu Guangyao, vice-minister of forestry, said at the meeting. Zhu attributed the problem to the fact that the state has not gotten hold of the overall situation of the country's desertification conditions and on-going treatment of desert lands. As a result, the state cannot make corresponding decisions immediately and correctly, the vice-minister said. He said that this will be the first time for China to conduct such a comprehensive and detailed survey and supervision on the desert areas across the country. Using scientific analysis, experts will first ascertain the shrinking and expanding situations of deserts comprehensively, correctly and immediately. The campaign will be carried out in all the mainland's 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, including 680 counties and 7,630 townships in total. Charts and data will be made at the levels of townships, counties and provinces to illustrate the contemporary desertification conditions. The central government has put much emphasis on the survey and supervision of desert lands ever since 1990 when China began preparatory and pilot work in desert treatment, the vice-minister said.
