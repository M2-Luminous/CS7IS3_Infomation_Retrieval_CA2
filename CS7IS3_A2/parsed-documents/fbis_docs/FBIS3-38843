These air strikes are also at the center of debate in Belgium. Defense Minister Leo Delcroix expressed reservations yesterday evening despite the fact that Foreign Minister Willy Claes was clearly in favor. Jean-Pierre Jacquemin interviewed the foreign minister: [Begin recording] [Claes] I had several phone conversations during the weekend with the prime minister as well as with my colleague the defense minister. [Jacquemin] Leo Delcroix has in fact expressed reservations regarding these air strikes. He justified his position by the presence in Bosnia of Belgian troops, who would be threatened if air strikes were launched. [Claes] I understand that the defense minister is worried about the security of the peacekeeping troops. He is only doing his duty. But I am a bit puzzled by the warning given by some military experts. These air strikes were agreed upon by the UN Security Council more than a year ago. I suppose the military experts were asked to give their opinion at that time. [Jacquemin] Are there any differences between you and Leo Delcroix within the government? [Claes] No, I don't think so. The politician should sometimes make risky decisions. [end recording]
