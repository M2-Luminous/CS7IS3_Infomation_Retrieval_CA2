FBIS4-12727 "drnes071__a94012" FBIS-NES-94-071-A Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 ANNEX Israel MA'ARIV Chastises Likud for Response to 'Afula Attack MA'ARIV Chastises Likud for Response to 'Afula Attack TA0704110894 Tel Aviv MA'ARIV (HAYOM supplement) in Hebrew 7 Apr 94 p 3 TA0704110894 Tel Aviv MA'ARIV (HAYOM supplement) Hebrew BFN [Editorial: "Lessons of the Attack"] [Text] The murderous attack in 'Afula will be remembered, first, and foremost, as an act of revenge for the Hebron massacre. The people killed in 'Afula are as much the victims of Dr. Baruch Goldstein as the Muslims praying at the Cave of the Patriarchs. The attack is also a signal from Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad that the Oslo agreement has not solved the problem of terror. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was right in saying that this was a deed committed by people who want to murder the peace. It is a pity that at such sad times, Likud leaders cannot rise above narrow political considerations. Bibi Netanyahu, who called for terminating the peace talks with the PLO in the wake of the attack in 'Afula, would probably be at a loss to explain why an attack designed to remonstrate against the talks with the PLO is a reason to stop the talks. Yitzhaq Shamir said it has once again been proven that security exists only where the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is. Should one infer from this statement that along with Jericho and Gaza, the IDF is also pulling out of 'Afula? Moreover, were there no terror attacks during the Likud's term in office? And if the peace process were to stop, would the attacks also cease? That is utter nonsense. We mourn the death of innocent Jews, we share the pain of the wounded, and we are committed to tread the path we set out for ourselves and not the one that loathsome terrorists are trying to dictate to us.
