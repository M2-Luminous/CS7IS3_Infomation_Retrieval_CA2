The legendary leader talked at length about this, about the progress and outlook of Latin America's integration, and the so-called Summit of the Americas called by the United States for late 1994, at a meeting with Colombian solidarity with Cuba organizations and during a meeting with Cuban reporters. Castro stressed that just being present at the Ibero-American summit is very important for Cuba because for the first time, it was not excluded. Castro added that Mexico, host of the first summit, and other friendly nations, had much to do with this. One of the fruits of these summits is that they have created an awareness for integration, he said, adding that the success should not be measured by specific achievements, as the expectations are not always met. He said that those meetings have contributed to countering Cuba's isolation, creating greater awareness of the blockade it faces, teaching the United States a lesson, intensifying Cuban relations with many countries, and building closer relations with Latin America. We are not working for the present, but for the future, he noted, adding that his country has participated in four summits and has made contributions on all the subjects discussed, giving special importance to education, health, and social development in general. We have made great efforts to lift the spirit of the summits, to give them more meaning, Castro stressed. With regard to Latin American integration, Castro said that there is still no real integration awareness in the region, but these summits contribute to that purpose. He said that the United States is the main obstacle, because it wants to disintegrate Latin America, and prevent it from becoming more independent. He said that is why Washington is promoting bilateral agreements because, as it did with the foreign debt, which was negotiated on a one-to-one basis, it does not want to negotiate with a united Latin America. Fidel Castro indicated that the Ibero-American summits are so important that our northern enemies became envious and invented another summit, precisely in Miami, which he said, they want to turn into Latin America's capital. He reiterated, however, as he said during his speech at the Ibero-American summit, which ended here yesterday, that Cuba is not opposed to that meeting even though it considers its exclusion a cowardly act because the U.S. leaders are afraid of words, ideas, and truths and that shows political weakness. He said that if invited he would go, even though it is held in Miami, but the organizers have already said it will not happen, and he explained that he is not opposed to the summit because he expects the Latin American countries to firmly defend the interests of the region. I am pleased to see that the free summits, in which we have met without anyone's permission, have forced the United States to convene the one in Miami, and the selection of this site denotes a political objective, the top leader of the Cuban Revolution said. Questioned on the assessment of the final declaration of this summit which is permeated by neoliberalism, he said that this philosophy is currently part of America's reality and that some have made it their religion; however, others have begun to see its other side. These countries no longer talk enthusiastically about neoliberal policies, whose implementation has reduced inflation and has attained other achievements by slashing social expenditures. He added that even the United States is realizing it is digging its own grave; therefore, it is seeking to make some changes with regard to this issue.
