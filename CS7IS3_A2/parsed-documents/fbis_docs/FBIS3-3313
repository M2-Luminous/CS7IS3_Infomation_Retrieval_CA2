The decision came after top national security aides conferred to the President for three hours at the White House on how best to push the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) toward "a resolution that doesn't end in conflict," the official told reporters. The U.S. agreed early this month to suspend the joint military exercise with South Korea known as "Team Spirit" and to resume formal talks with the DPRK in Geneva on March 21 after an international inspections began at the DPRK nuclear sites and the DPRK and South Korea resumed their dialogue. But with the collapse of Saturday's [19 March] talks between the DPRK and South Korea over the issue of nuclear inspections and the exchange of envoys, the official said, the exercise "will be rescheduled" and the meeting in Geneva "won't happen" unless circumstances change over the weekend. The United States also threatened to proceed with plans to send Patriot air-defense missiles to South Korea. The United States will consult with South Korea on timing for deploying the weapons, the official said.
