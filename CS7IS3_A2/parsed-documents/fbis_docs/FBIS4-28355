Administrative Vice-Minister Hatekayama stated: "For Japan, which strictly adheres to defense only, it is important to improve our information-gathering capability. I do not know whether that means reconnaissance satellites or not. But we are interested in strengthening and expanding our information-gathering capability and must study various possibilities." Regarding utilization and development of reconnaissance satellites, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata showed a positive stance at the House of Representatives Budget Committee on 26 May, saying that "the most important thing to the national security is to possess accurate information." The DA is examining the possibility of acquiring on a commercial basis from American companies photographs from high-performance satellites developed for military reconnaissance use. For the future, the DA is also studying the possibility of owning reconnaissance satellites or meteorological satellites equipped with reconnaissance capability for joint military and civilian use. Moreover, positive opinions, which support the idea of owning reconnaissance satellites from a viewpoint of boosting information- gathering capability, were expressed at a meeting of the "Panel for Studying Defense Issues," a private advisory organ to Prime Minister Hata. The panel is chaired by Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of Asahi Breweries, Ltd. However, it seems that the idea of owning reconnaissance satellites will trigger a debate. There exists a Diet resolution for limiting the use of space to peaceful ends. Reconnaissance satellites are also expected to require a great deal of money.
