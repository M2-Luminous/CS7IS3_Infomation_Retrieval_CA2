Chairman Chon Yong-taek (57) is a minister-level high-ranking figure serving as a full-time member of the National Security Council, which is a constitutional institution advising the president, and as chairman of the Emergency Planning Committee assisting the prime minister. Regardless of his position, he is an unfamiliar figure to the people. Nevertheless, since the North Korean nuclear crisis has been thrown into taking sanctions against the North by the ROK, the United States, and Japan, thus heightening a tense situation on the Korean peninsula, the people are under a situation in which they must familiarize themselves with the Chungmu Program of which Chairman Chon is in charge. At the crossroads of peacetime and wartime, the following is an interview with Chairman Chon on diagnosing the current situation and taking a posture of preparedness. [Kim Tang] The holding of the National Security Council meeting, the first one since the new government set sail, attracted an extraordinarily amount of attention. Is the current situation such as to convene a national security meeting? [Chon Yong-taek] The government had held security related ministerial meetings, high-ranking strategic meetings, and reunification and security policy coordination meetings in the past to take measures regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. However, since the National Security Council meeting--a constitutional institution--was held officially for the first time, people are apt to feel that there is a serious critical situation. Before the Fifth Republic set sail, the National Security Council meeting was held regularly every quarter. However, it was held once or twice annually after the Sixth Republic was launched. This must have given a sense of tension to the people. The meeting was not convened because there was a critical emergency situation. [Kim] In the operational regulations of the National Security Council it is stipulated that except for an "emergency matter," the agenda to be discussed must be presented seven days in advance and distributed five days before. If it is not an emergency matter, why was this normal operational regulation avoided? [Chon] The president decided to hold such a meeting when he was in Uzbekistan. An atmosphere was created to fully discuss the issue of taking sanctions against the North by the United Nations when the president was on a visit to Russia. Also, the National Security Council meeting convened because the president judged, after holding a telephone conversation with President Clinton, that it was necessary to give North Korea a firm message. Formally it was regarded as an emergency matter because of the pressing time, but it was not carried out urgently because the content of an emergency agenda had to be discussed. It only seemed an emergency matter because of the limitations in time and venue. [Kim] How was the atmosphere of the meeting? [Chon] On the one hand, participants of the meeting were disappointed because the North Korean nuclear issue has led to taking sanctions against the North, and on the other hand, it was an atmosphere of communion of minds in that the government must deal with this matter resolutely and with confidence. The president revealed that he will convey his firm will and message to the people and the North Korean regime. It was an opportunity for the officials who attended the meeting, who are to draft and execute the state's policy, to examine that they will deal with the situation, even it turns to the worst, with resolute confidence. [Kim] Were there any matters for resolution? [Chon] It is not a time to make it public at this time and also it is not a matter to make it public. [Kim] My question is not what matters were resolved but whether matters were discussed. [Chon] That is also a secret. There are two functions in the National Security Council meeting. The first function is a resolution function, to establish a policy guideline through discussions by the members to establish foreign, military, and domestic policies related to securing national security. The second function is a reporting function, to analyze and assess a situation. The recently held meeting had a stronger reporting function. [Kim] What was the content of your report? [Chon] I cannot give you any details. I just gave a report on "the state's mobilization preparedness if UN sanctions are taken against the North," which the Emergency Planning Committee is in charge of. What I would like to emphasize is that going into a phase of sanctions does not mean that we are going to have a war. What I mean is that we must persuade the North Korean authorities even through forcible means. I made a report on the government's posture for preparedness if we go into an emergency situation and on taking measures for a possible provocation from North Korea which may be expected during the period of sanctions, if things do not go well. [Kim] You are the chairman of the government's Emergency Planning Committee and a full-member of the National Security Council. What is the function of the Emergency Planning Committee? [Chon] The three main roles of the Emergency Planning Committee are maintaining the government's function; assisting military operations; and stability of the people's livelihood. In other words, first the government organization must be changed into a war structure so that the government's functions can be carried out as in normal time; second, the government must mobilize all the resources for carrying out war to assist the military; and third is stabilization of the people's livelihood. This is to assist and manage work so that the people can maintain a stable life even during war. For example, it will supply necessities of life and when there are acts of buying up and hoarding goods, it will control circulation and price as the time demands. Also, it may carry out ration systems to stabilize the people's livelihood. These functions will be carried out through the Chungmu Program, the state's emergency plan in case of wartime, which the Emergency Planning Committee is in charge of. [Kim] This state structure, which carries out an important role, is not stipulated in the National Government Organization Act. [Chon] The basis for establishing the Emergency Planning Committee is clearly stated in the law on managing resources for emergency set up in 1984. [Kim] It seems that most of the people do not know the content of that law or that there is even that kind of law. For example, most of the adults are targets of the law on managing resources (human resources), and is the press not also a target to be managed? [Chon] Yes. Since South-North confrontation was a confrontation of ideology and system, cooperation from the press is absolute in all-out national efforts. Therefore, we have sent an emergency plan to press the organs and designated the organs to be mobilized during peacetime in preparation for an emergency. [Kim] Under the law of managing resources, what was presented in detail as an emergency situation? [Chon] It differs according to the signs or magnitude of a war or a crisis that can threaten the nation's security. [Kim] Does it mean that it is carried out step by step just like the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command's operational plan, the OPLAN 5027? [Chon] Yes. Regarding an emergency situation, the government judges that it is inevitable to have a close connection with the military's preparedness. If the military enhances the posture of preparedness, the Chungmu Program will be geared gradually. However, when the final proclamation on order of mobilization in wartime is made or when an emergency situation occurs, the military will explain the situation, but the government will make decisions through a cabinet meeting on a step-by-step basis. [Kim] If the Chungmu program had been a preparation for North Korea's southward invasion in the past, should the current program have not included measures for a sudden collapse in North Korea, for instance, a refugee plan? [Chon] A war always comes with refugees. Plans for sheltering and relieving refugees are one of the functions of stabilizing the people's livelihood. The Chungmu program is a wartime plan and does not include plans for such a sudden and special situation. [Kim] Then, do you mean that the Chungmu program is only related with the OPLAN? [Chon] They are certainly related. One of the three major functions of the Emergency Planning Committee is to support military operations. However, the core of the Chungmu program is to maintain government functions. If the government stops functioning, there will be no military operations or stabilization of the people's livelihood. Therefore, the Chungmu program is not for military operations alone. [Kim] The Emergency Planning Committee would need actual or map exercises. What kinds of exercises are conducted by the Emergency Planning Committee? [Chon] The Ulchi exercise is the typical one. It is basically a map exercise of the three major functions that I just have mentioned in a simulated war situation. Sometimes, actual exercises are conducted for those fields that require special evaluation and checking of the plan's actual efficiency. [Kim] Ulchi and Focus Lens exercises will be combined beginning this August. [Chon] Yes. However, it is a methodological decision aimed at maximizing the effect of the exercise. It has no other objectives or messages. The Focus Lens is purely a military exercise. Because the military exercise cannot be separated from the Chungmu program, only the inter-government training part of the Ulchi-Focus Lens exercise is controlled by the Emergency Planning Committee and the military part of the exercise is controlled by the commander of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command. In principle, the prime minister takes overall responsibility but the military exercise is commissioned to the commander of the Combined Forces Command and the inter-government training is controlled by the prime minister through me, the umpire. The prime minister is the general supervisor [chonggam] and I am the chief of the central control group [chungang tongje tanjang]. [Kim] At the National Assembly Defense Committee on 9 June, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae expressed his confidence in the preparedness for an all-out war. Do you think it is possible that North Korea would start a war? [Chon] I believe there is little possibility that North Korea would start a war judging from the objective conditions after the collapse of the Cold War system. However, as everyone knows, North Korea adopted four major military lines from 1964 and has invested 20 to 24 percent of the gross national product in defense to prepare for a war. In addition, North Korea has repeated irrational acts, including the Panmunjom ax incident, terror at Aung San Memorial Hall in Burma, and the bombing of a Korean Air plane. Thus, we cannot say that there is no possibility that North Korea would start a war by objective conditions or classical strategic theories. I would like to emphasize that it is not important whether or not a war would breaks out, what is important is that we are fully prepared so that the enemy cannot attack us. [Kim] If UN sanctions are implemented and are to reap fruits to some extent, we have no choice but to employ semi-military means, such as a naval blockade. But by driving North Korea to a dead end in such a way, does it not give North Korea a justification to evoke a provocation, such as violating the Armistice Agreement? Would this not happen if North Korea is pushed to a dead end? [Chon] The media have been reporting on various scenarios, however, they are only scenarios and have no credibility at all. The present stage is a stage of mapping out international sanctions and I do not even know in what form and order sanctions would be taken. No decisive methods and procedures have been chosen. And even if the situation enters a phase of sanctions, the government cannot spell out the worst-case scenario beforehand and disclose to the media its measures against such a scenario. This is because the government would impose sanctions with an upbeat view that North Korea would change its stance during the period in which sanctions are imposed against it. Of course, the government is fully prepared with various measures since North Korea is expected to resist in any way in case sanctions are invoked. This is also an assumption. [Kim] The media recently quoted the TIME's report on pessimistic and optimistic views over the result of a war game. Do such scenarios have credibility? [Chon] A game is only a game. I do not know whether the war game coincides with reality or not, however, there can be some assumptions in this. The first assumption is that North Korea would succeed in a surprise attack. There is no strong man who can counter a surprise attack. No matter how formidable the Army may be, it can fall victim of a surprise attack. With such an assumption, defense difficulties follow in the war game. Such being the case, it is very important to know whether such an assumption is rational. Another tragic scenario is that the North Korean Army's vehicles, cannons, and tanks invade the ROK through underground tunnels. No one can absolutely deny such a possibility. It is even more impracticable to assert the real possibility of an underground invasion like that. In fact, underground tunnels are very fragile. When an exit is uncovered, everyone inside the tunnel is doomed to die. This kind of an imprudent war cannot be unleashed. Accordingly, it is important to know whether the assumption is rational and realistic. Defeat in a war game takes place because a computer was set up to be defeated. For example, the enemy's large-scale mechanized unit is inputted into a computer on the assumption that the enemy makes a surprise attack into Munsan and Chorwon as an axis. [Kim] However, a vague psychological fear prevails in our society. [Chon] Our basic strategy is the ROK-U.S. joint deterrence strategy. In other words, it is a strategy aimed at deterring a war on the Korean peninsula. We are heightening military preparedness not for victory but for the deterrence of a war. The strategic concept of the ROK Force is "the metropolitan area equals the ROK." Fifty percent of our country's national assets and 45 percent of the population are concentrated on the metropolitan area. Our strategy on defending the metropolitan area is firm and the Chungmu program has also been supplemented and developed over a long time. Moreover, the defense capability of ROK-U.S. Joint Forces is formidable. Even if the enemy evokes a provocation, there is no need to worry about the combat capability in the front line. When the rear is well prepared against the intrusion of the enemy's special unit, a worrisome situation will never arise. [Kim] What kind of determination or preparedness should our people have at the present stage? [Chon] As you are well aware of, a country such as Switzerland is perfectly prepared against contingencies even though it has no threat from outside. In Switzerland, every work place is equipped with a protection facility and every household has an underground protection facility prepared against chemical, biological, and radiological warfare and is also equipped with enough emergency food and medicines to last for over six months. Its reserve forces, whose houses are armed with individual firearms, have preparedness in which they can be mobilized within 48 hours in more than 48 divisions. Maybe that might be the reason Switzerland is enjoying the best quality of life in the world. What is important for us is not whether a war arises or not but having a determination and preparedness in times of peace.
