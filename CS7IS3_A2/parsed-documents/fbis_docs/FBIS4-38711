Russian President Boris Yeltsin said this in a message to President Rafael Caldera of Venezuela, which was conveyed to him on 31 May by Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council, who is on a visit here. Shumeyko is leading a delegation from the Russian parliament on an official tour of a number of Latin American countries. The delegation has already been to Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. The head of the delegation told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that he had given R. Caldera a draft treaty on the bases of relations between the two countries. According to V. Shumeyko, a similar document was given to Venezuela last year, but consideration of it was put off because of political problems being experienced at that time by both countries. "The time has now come to go back to it, and the president of Venezuela and the foreign minister fully agree with me on this," the head of delegation said. On the same day the chairman of the Federation Council addressed the Senate of the National Congress of Venezuela. "We are firmly convinced that the Latin American states, including Venezuela, are potentially important partners for us in the realm of political, commercial, and economic relations," V. Shumeyko said. "Our task is to maintain and increase as far as we are able our presence in the region and continue mutually advantageous relations with the countries of Latin America, on the basis of a realistic vision of our common interests and capacities and rejecting ideology-based approaches and stereotypes." The head of the Russian delegation expressed an interest in setting up contacts with leading regional organizations like the OAS and the Rio de Janeiro Group. Speaking about ties with individual countries in Latin America, V. Shumeyko stated the Russian leadership's intention to continue cooperation on many levels with Cuba. He said this cooperation "after certain difficulties is once again becoming active and is founded on a fundamentally new, mutually beneficial basis." V. Shumeyko stressed the importance of developing interparliamentary ties with the countries of Latin America. Having pointed out that the Russian parliament has a colossal job of work to do to bring outdated legislation into line with the stipulations of the new Constitution, the head of the Federation Council stressed that Russia's parliament is very much in need of foreign experience, including that of the Latin American countries. During meetings with representatives of the government, members of parliament, and journalists, V. Shumeyko several times mentioned economic cooperation between Russia and Venezuela. According to him, there are now favorable conditions for the development of these ties. He said that the extraction, processing, and distribution of oil is one of the main areas. The chairman of the Federation Council stated the desire of Russia's leadership to resume the practice current up to 1991 of supplying Russian oil to Venezuela's partners in Western Europe in exchange for equivalent supplies of oil from Venezuela to Russia's partners in the Western hemisphere. Another important aspect is the construction of assembly lines producing Russian VAZ and KamAZ motor vehicles, which have a good reputation on Venezuela's roads. V. Shumeyko also noted highly promising prospects for cooperation in mining and advanced technology.
