In Table V.3, Fuel 1 is the candidate fuel, Fuel 3 is the candidate-baseline fuel, and Fuel 2 is a dilution fuel that is tested to determine whether emissions respond linearly to levels of the candidate fuel parameter. Testing on addition fuels 1, 2, and 3 will provide the data needed to assess the emission effects of the parameter being tested in isolation. Three separate levels of the parameter are specified in order to provide data to estimate both linear and squared terms involving the parameter, while other fuel parameters have been set at levels expected to be typical of in-use reformulated gasolines. Fuels 4 and 5 are low-emitting fuels with candidate and baseline levels of the parameter in question. Fuels 6 and 7 are the corresponding high-emitting fuels. Testing on these four fuels will provide the data needed to assess the existence and size of interactive effects between the parameter being tested and other fuel parameters already included in the complex model. Estimating these effects for very high emitting fuels (addition fuels 6 and 7) and very low emitting fuels (addition fuels 4 and 5) maximizes the sensitivity of the test program to such effects. If the parameter being tested is not specified for CAA baseline gasoline, its baseline level must be comparable to its level in gasoline representative of commercial reformulated gasolines. Petitioners are required to obtain approval for the baseline level of this parameter from the Agency prior to beginning their vehicle test programs. Such approval would depend in part on the use of an appropriate basis for determining the properties of ``representative'' commercial reformulated gasolines. The basis for this specification and for the specifications described in Table V.3 are discussed more fully in section IV.G of the RIA. c. Other fuels requirements. To produce fuels with the parameter values listed above for the extension and addition fuels, the amount and type of paraffins present in each fuel may require adjustments. These adjustments must reflect the distribution of paraffin types in representative refinery streams. Two other issues must also be addressed regarding the composition and properties of extension and addition fuels. First, non-compositional fuel properties such as RVP, E200, and E300 may differ from the values specified in Tables V.2 and V.3 as a natural result of compositional differences among fuels or as a result of the inherent variability in blending processes. In such cases, the complex model is to be used to compensate for such differences when evaluating vehicle testing results, as described in section 80.48 of today's regulations. Second, EPA also is concerned that variations due to blending may cause fuel parameters not included in the model to vary among fuels, and such parameters may have significant emission effects not predicted by the model. To minimize this risk, the properties of the various fuels must match those specified in Tables V.1 through V.3 to within the tolerances defined in Table V.4. In addition, the extension and addition fuels must be blended from identical refinery streams to the extent possible. Failure to meet this requirement would reduce the certainty that emission effects found in vehicle testing are due solely to the parameter being tested. However, if a petitioner can show that it is not feasible to meet all such tolerances for the petitioner's fuels due either to: (1) Naturally-resulting changes in fuel parameters arising from changes in the parameter(s) in question or (2) blending technology limitations, EPA will consider modifying the relevant tolerances. Any such request must come prior to the start of the test program. In such cases, EPA reserves the right to use the model and relevant data from prior augmentation petitions to adjust for whatever differences remain among the fuels. Table V. 4._ Fuel Parameter Blending Tolerances 1Fuel parameter 1Blending tolerance Sulfur content # 25 ppm. Benzene content # 0.2 vol %. RVP # 0.2 psi. E200 level # 2 %. E300 level # 4 %. Oxygenate content # 1.0 vol %. Aromatics content # 2.7 vol %. Olefins content # 2.5 vol %. Saturates content # 2.0 vol %. Octane # 0.5. Candidate parameter To be determined as part of the augmentation process. An octane requirement of 87.5 (measured by the (R+M)/2 method) must be met for all fuels used in vehicle testing to within the tolerance specified in Table V.4, unless octane itself is the fuel property being evaluated for its effect on emissions. All test fuels must also contain detergent additives in concentrations adequate to meet the requirements of section 211(l) of the Act, and the concentration must be within ten percent of the average detergent concentration for all fuels included in the test program.
