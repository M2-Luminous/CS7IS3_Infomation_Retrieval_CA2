Under the decree, those who want to enter or leave the Chechen Republic will have to register with the republican security department five days in advance. The president explained that the move has been prompted by the need to "thwart attempts of subversive activity against the Chechen Republic and block routes of escape for dangerous criminals." There are over 20 such criminals in the republic, according to the Chechen public prosecutor's office. Their names have been published by the local press.
