As is known, negotiations were held on 1-3 June between representatives of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The main controversial point between the two delegations is the formula "to eliminate the consequences of the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact" proposed by the Romanian side and rejected by the Russian side. "We have not reached any formula of compromise. We are still far from solutions," as Dumitru Ceausu, head of the Romanian delegation and director of the directorate in charge of judicial issues and treaties, told us. We remind our readers that the normalization of relations with Russia and the conclusion of a basic treaty were the issues raised by Ambassador Richard Schifler and General George A. Joulwan during their recent talks with Romanian authorities in Bucharest. The next round of talks will take place in Bucharest in September.
