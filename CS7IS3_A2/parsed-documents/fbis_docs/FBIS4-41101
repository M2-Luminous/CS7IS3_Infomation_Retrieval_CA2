The oil and gas union sets some fairly ambitions goals. They include the upholding of sectoral interests within the country and moving towards OPEC on the foreign market. Although there were original fears that the creation of the Association for Economic Interaction of Russian Oil and Gas Producing Regions could be hindered by the contradictions which exist between the regions, a decision to form it was made after all. The new association's weight is enhanced by the fact that Fuel and Energy Ministry Yuriy Shafranik has been elected its president for a year. Therefore the association has ensured itself direct access to the prime minister and the president, which is a direct prerequisite for successful lobbying activity. According to the association's initiators -- deputies from oil producing regions and directors of fuel and energy enterprises -- the organization will make it possible to actively stand up to the budget favorites of the legislative bodies and the government: the agrarian sector and the social sphere. Although it is an open secret that the fuel and energy complex is the milk cow for both these sectors of the national economy as well as for the state sector, ensuring 60 percent of Russian exports and 40 percent of hard currency budget revenues: With needs of 7.1 trillion rubles, it has received 1.1 trillion in state investments. However, apart from the functions traditional for such associations (getting money from the budget), the association is laying claim to something more. Under its charter, in addition to direct influence on state economic policy in the energy sphere, its tasks include coordination of the regions' activity in producing, processing, pricing, and marketing oil and gas products. The possibilities for performing these functions are ensured by the association's composition, which includes representatives of Russia's major oil and gas producing regions: Tyumen, Tomsk, Orenburg, and Sakha Oblasts, Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrugs, and the republics of Bashkiria, Komi, and Tatarstan. Therefore in the event that agreement is reached between the regions, the association will be able to set monopoly prices for oil and gas products both on the domestic and the CIS market. The essence of its lobbying activity in the Federal Assembly and the government will be to make sure that in the absence of requisite budgetary support, no antimonopoly sanctions are applied against the sector's enterprises. The rationale behind the pricing activity can be very simple: The oil and gas complex has to resolve its financial problems with available market methods, and price control is a forced measure. Besides, the association will have a chance to join the well-known OPEC cartel, which establishes world oil prices, as a nongovernment organization. The association's charter says directly that at the first stage the task is to ensure participation in OPEC as an observer. In the event that OPEC membership is secured, Russian regions will have guaranteed access to the world market and will therefore not need to maintain the volume of export deliveries at the expense of price concessions. So, the Association for Economic Interaction of Russian Oil and Gas Producing Regions presumably can become the first Russian oil cartel with all the inherent functions.
