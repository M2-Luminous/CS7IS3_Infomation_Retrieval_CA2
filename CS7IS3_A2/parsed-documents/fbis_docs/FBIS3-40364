Its planned capacity is 400,000 TV sets a year, and it will employ 160 persons, then 350 persons in 1995. Initially, the cathode ray tubes will be supplied by European manufacturers. Beginning in 1995, they will be produced by the future plant for which Daewoo recently laid the first stone at Longwy. These two units will enable the Korean firm to strengthen its position in the European markets, while shedding their label as "assembly plants."
