In a meeting with the leadership of the Prva Petoljetka holding company in the central Serbian town of Trstenik, Marjanovic said that the hard currency reserves stood at 336 million dinars (one dinar trades for one deutsche mark), that budget deficits were no longer covered by primary issue and that economic loans had been substantially increased. Speaking about the results of the programme, Marjanovic said that from January 24 (when the programme was launched) until the first week of May, the prices had been completely stabilized and inflation slashed to zero. The prices of industrial products dropped by 14.6 percent and average salaries increased from 25 dinars in January to 116 dinars in April, Marjanovic said. Average prices are still high, but this is due to inflation before the programme was launched, he said and added he hoped that the prices would continue to drop, especially as the production was growing. The economic recovery programme was architected by Dragoslav Avramovic, a world-renowned economic expert and the current governor of the Yugoslav Central Bank.
