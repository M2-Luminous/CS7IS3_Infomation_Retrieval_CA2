Commenting today on NATO's decision to give the Serbs 10 days to withdraw or face an air strike and on Russia's request for an urgent Security Council meeting to discuss the demilitarization of Sarajevo, Musa said Egypt and the Islamic countries will oppose any attempt to hinder the end of the Serbian aggression. He explained that if the attempts to delay things continue, then the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims must be lifted. He stressed that UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali has a Security Council mandate to use force to protect UN forces and populated areas and that this mandate is sufficient, especially so in light of NATO's offer to use its resources in this regard. Foreign Ministry sources said 'Amr Musa has asked Dr. Nabil al- 'Arabi, Egypt's permanent delegate at the United Nations, to convey to the UN secretary general and Security Council president Egypt's viewpoint on attempts to delay the NATO decision. The sources added that Musa asked Egypt's permanent delegate at the United Nations to hold consultations with the Islamic countries' Liaison Group to adopt a clear stance on the issue.
