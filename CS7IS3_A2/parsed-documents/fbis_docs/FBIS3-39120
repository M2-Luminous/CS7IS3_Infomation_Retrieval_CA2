How can the Christian Social Union [CSU] counteract this? [Waigel] What we have brought about politically in Bonn is not at all bad --in particular, fiscal and monetary policy, health reform, the postal service, and development aid. In concrete terms: the government's strict consolidation course, equalization of financial burdens between the Federal Government and the laender, the law to secure business location Germany, health, railway, and postal reforms, and asylum laws. We are still competent in all these areas, and the SPD is not. [FOCUS] According to all the opinion polls, the majority of voters sees this quite differently. [Waigel] This does not scare me. If I were to ask the people who has the necessary experience in health matters, seven out of 10 would say: Horst Seehofer, not Rudolf Dressler. As far as the debate on postal reform goes, the voters do not know anyone in the opposition who has commented on that matter. [FOCUS] But you cannot gloss over the low morale. [Waigel] It is, of course, right that nine months before the general elections, we are going through difficult and unsteady times and that the government and the coalition have to mobilize all their forces to deal with our political opponents. So far, they have hardly ever done that and have been busy with themselves. It no longer makes sense to work our way from coalition circle to coalition circle, from mediation committee to mediation committee. Due to the agonizingly slow decisionmaking processes, the results of these actions are no longer credited to the government. [FOCUS] How do you want to change this? [Waigel] It is a matter of doing what can be done. In nursing insurance, for instance, a decision has to be taken during the next few weeks: Is there still something to do or not. [FOCUS] There is not much to do in other areas either. Most people seem to have lost hope that the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/CSU can lead them out of the recession. [Waigel] Everyone should know that the reasons that brought about the recession, and thus the strict austerity measures, could not have been influenced and were no responsibility of the government: the structural crisis of the economy, European problems, reunification, loss of the East European markets. [FOCUS] However, the question "How can the government lead us out of this misery?" remains unanswered. [Waigel] I see this quite differently. Our fiscal and economic policy has resulted in the first signs of economic recovery. This year, we will certainly have some economic growth again. The interest rates on the capital market are lower than ever before and offer a good starting point for investment. The inflation rate is declining, possibly to below 3 percent this year. There have been tax reliefs for companies. All these factors will strengthen the positive economic trend. But, we must also say this: Politics is not responsible for everything that happens in the economy, especially not for things resulting from false wage policies. Reasonable wage settlements are necessary. Strikes are the last thing we need in this situation. [FOCUS] As finance minister, you are the best hated politician in Bonn because, with your strict austerity measures, you are after people's purses. How do you cope with that? [Waigel] Without severe public savings, the problems cannot be solved. Anyone who does not understand this should suggest an alternative. Savings are always expected to hit the others: If I cut social benefits, they call me a "cold social killer." If I cut the Bundeswehr budget, then security is endangered. If I cut research, I endanger technological progress. Wherever I cut, I do the wrong thing because I cannot do it right, since I have to save 70 billion German marks [DM] everywhere. The necessity to save is accepted, but the willingness to save in one's own sector leaves much to be desired. The debate on saving is a phony one. [FOCUS] Are you talking about the SPD? [Waigel] I am particularly annoyed with those who did not want reunification in 1989-1990. Like Mr. Lafontaine, who can redevelop debt-ridden Saarland with the government's help of DM8 billion, or take Mr. Scharping, who secured DM219 million in the solidarity pact negotiations to finance political leadership in his land. Both these gentlemen now add these sums to the federal debts and cry out: Look at Theo Waigel's enormous debts. They are the biggest hypocrites in the debate. I will deal with this very intensively during the next few months. [FOCUS] You are painting a very positive picture of the government's work. Why do you think the coalition is no longer supported by the majority of the population? [Waigel] Did Adenauer and Erhard let themselves be influenced by opinion polls? How often did Franz Josef Strauss have to weather the storm. They had a clear conscience and the courage to do what they thought was right in Germany's interest. We also have a clear conscience, because this government achieved more over the last four years than any other government over the last 30 years. This is why we have to stand up and say: This is the balance, these are the challenges we are facing, and this is Germany's role in the world. [FOCUS] But who is to say this? [Waigel] The chancellor must say it. [FOCUS] But he would not do it. [Waigel] He will do it, but everyone else in the government has to do it as well. The cabinet must not withdraw to a corner and sulk, but its members have to travel the country and wake people up. We have to convince people that our chances for a new beginning have never been so good before. Germany is facing a big challenge, just like in 1948. The SPD is only winning sympathies in opinion polls because it does not make any specific statements on any problems and only stirs up dissatisfaction. [FOCUS] Can you give us an example? [Waigel] The new asylum law was not passed five years earlier -- as would have been necessary -- as a result of the SPD's refusal to cooperate. If the nursing insurance fails, it will be because there are Social Democrats who would prefer to make it a topic in the election campaign. Anyone who condemns monetary and fiscal policies without telling the voters how he would come to grips with the deficits is stirring up emotions, but he is not making politics. And the opposition does, of course, not say a word about Helmut Kohl's foreign policy. Germany's relations with other countries have never been so good before. [FOCUS] But still, the vast majority of Germans do not appreciate this. [Waigel] We have to make it clear to the voters that it does not do any good to go to the polls or vote for a splinter or even a radical party out of protest. Splitting up the political forces does not bring about a solution to the problems. It is quite simple: either us or Weimar.
