FR940602-0-00020 FR940602-0-00004 Additionally, the FAA estimates that for operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes, it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to shorten the wear pins for replacement brakes, and 8 work hours per airplane to change the brakes, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost of required parts to accomplish the change in wear limits for these airplanes (that is, the cost resulting from the requirement to change the brakes before they are worn to their previously approved limits for a one-time change) is estimated to be $912 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these requirements on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes is estimated to be $29,240, or $1,462 per airplane. The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;11&hyph;07 British Aerospace: Amendment 39&hyph;8923. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;167&hyph;AD. Applicability: All Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy rejected takeoff (RTO), accomplish the following: (a) Within 180 days after the effective date of this AD, accomplish paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this AD. (1) Inspect main landing gear brakes having the brake part numbers listed below for wear. Any brake worn more than the maximum wear limit specified below must be replaced, prior to further flight, with a brake within that limit. British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 Series Airplanes Equipped With Bendix Brakes 1Airplane model 1Brake part No. 1Maximum brake wear limit (inch/mm) BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 2601225&hyph;1 0.75 inch (19.1 mm) BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 2601240&hyph;1 1.0 inch (25.4 mm) Note 1: Measuring instructions for Bendix brakes can be found in Revision 4 of the Allied Signal Component Maintenance Manual. Note 2: Revision 4 of the Allied Signal Component Maintenance Manual specifies a brake wear limit of 1.06 inch for brake part number 2601240&hyph;1. That brake wear limit is superseded by the brake wear limit of 1.0 inch specified above for that brake part number. Revision 5 of the Allied Signal Component Maintenance Manual will reflect the revised brake wear limit of 1.0 inch. Brake units having wear indicators set at 1.06 inch will be considered to be fully worn when either wear indicator pin is 0.06 inch or less above the surface of the carrier, provided the wear indicator pin has not been shortened on that brake unit. Note 3: Each operator should provide a method of identifying modified brakes until Revision 5 of the Allied Signal Component Maintenance Manual has been issued. Revision 5 of the manual will define a method of brake identification and reflect the brake wear limits specified above. A paint scheme similar to that used to differentiate between new and refurbished brakes could be used, for example, if a different color is used. (2) Incorporate into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program the maximum brake wear limits specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this AD. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note 4: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) This amendment becomes effective on July 5, 1994. Issued in Renton, Washington, on May 25, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13236 Filed 6&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;U
