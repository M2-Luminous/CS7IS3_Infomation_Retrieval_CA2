Speaking at a news conference for the ROC press corps in advance of President Li Teng-hui's visit, Leal said that the international community can not deny the economic strength of the ROC and its huge foreign currency reserves. He stressed that the road back to the UN will be difficult and fraught with obstacles, but the UN cannot continue to ignore the rights of the more than 21 million Chinese people living in Taiwan. Leal also said that Nicaragua will strengthen its relations with other Asia-Pacific nations, and use the ROC to help in its efforts. The ROC left the UN in 1971 after Beijing assumed the China seat.
