Indeed, there has long been a need for such a meeting of the chiefs of the leading directorates of the military establishment with the representatives of the country's mass media. Questions arise every day concerning some aspect or another of the activity of the Armed Forces. Unfortunately, lacking reliable information, journalists often publish reports on the military in newspapers or in radio and television broadcasts that are not completely accurate. "And when we hear our work being judged unfairly, this upsets us and dampens our enthusiasm," stated Col. Gen. A. Lopata in his opening remarks. He then added: "We have invited you here so that we can give candid answers to any questions you may have; so that you are not forced to guess at things on your own. We want the people of Ukraine to have the true, unvarnished, but also undistorted facts about what is happening in our Ukrainian Army." Let me begin by saying that the meeting was a success. But, judge for yourselves. The first thing that interested the journalists was whether there were any problems this year with the conscription of youths into the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine admitted that there were some problems: "But you need to understand what is causing these problems. The current conscription pool in Ukraine is extremely large. More than 800,000 youths are eligible to be drafted into our army. But existing legislation, which provides for granting deferments from the draft to many categories of young people, leaves us with only 12 percent of the total figure. Unfortunately, this is not enough. "This was what forced us to resort to an unauthorized measure--to review the decision of the Supreme Council that the term of service be one and one-half years and move to increase it to two years. We were compelled to take this step in order to maintain the combat readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the necessary level. That is why those conscripted in the spring of 1992 are only now being discharged into the reserves." Col. Gen. Anatoliy Lopata then reminded those present of the directive issued by President Yuriy Meshkov of the Republic of Crimea demanding that the peninsula's youths be conscripted only into units that are stationed in the autonomous republic. The president of Ukraine issued a decree abolishing this directive as one that violates the laws of Ukraine. As a result, conscription in the Republic of Crimea is now proceeding in normal fashion and in accordance with Ukrainian laws. Crimeans will serve on the whole territory of Ukraine. Maj. Gen. Valeriy Venher, chief of the Main Organizational and Mobilization Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, amplified on the answer of the chief of the General Staff: "Currently, the draft is proceeding according to plan. So far, the plan has not been frustrated in any way. I expect that we shall fulfill the conscription plan. "The process of discharging those who have completed their term of service into the reserves is also under way. By 3 May of this year, the last soldier drafted in the spring of 1992 will have been discharged from the Armed Forces." The journalists addressed their next question to Col. Gen. Hryhoriy Mikhaylichenko, deputy minister of defense for rear services and chief of Rear Services of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: "As we know, the former Kiev Military District included five military state farms, which helped to relieve the people of the problem of feeding the army. How do things stand today with the army's agricultural enterprises?" Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko: "The Armed Forces, like the whole Ukrainian people, have many social problems. As things stood on 1 April, the Ministry of Defense had received from the government only 43 percent of the funds appropriated in the budget for the maintenance of military personnel. "In spite of this, we are making every effort to ensure that military personnel are fed properly. Thus, officers, warrant officers, and reenlisted servicemen receive food rations. Term servicemen are also provided with standard rations. The military's state farms help to solve these problems in today's difficult circumstances. There are currently twenty farms that belong to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Actually, twenty-one, because a few days ago, a collective farm in the town of Brody in Lviv Oblast joined our ranks. Its members requested unanimously to be transferred under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense. "What percentage of goods do the military's state farms supply? They provide the army with enough meat for 70 days, milk for virtually the whole year (345 days), eggs for 122 days (at four eggs per week for each term serviceman), oil for 173 days, potatoes and vegetables for 22 days. Obviously, this significantly reduces the problem of providing the troops with food products. "We are currently building an enterprise to process agricultural production in partnership with a foreign firm. This enterprise will fully process meat, leather, milk, and grain crops. This will significantly improve our ability to provision military personnel." The chief of Rear Services of the Armed Forces of Ukraine assured the journalists attending the meeting and asked them to reassure the parents of military personnel, especially term servicemen, in their reports that no matter how difficult things may be, there will be no irregularities in the normal feeding, medical care, and material provisioning of personnel. Volodymyr Chykalik, the military commentator of VECHIRNIY KYYIV, passed on to Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko a question that had been addressed to his newspaper by the personnel of the missile cruiser Ukrayina, which is undergoing repairs in Mykolayiv: Why do Ukrainian sailors have to pay the Black Sea Fleet for their medical treatment? Hryhoriy Mykolayovych was well informed about this problem: "This matter will be settled. We will definitely reach an agreement with the command of the Black Sea Fleet. It is inconceivable that military personnel should have to pay for their medical care. By the way, our medical facilities provide Black Sea Fleet personnel with free medical treatment." The next question posed by the journalists concerned the introduction of a new uniform. They wanted to know whether the deadline for switching to the new uniform, which had been set in a recent presidential decree, would be kept. Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko: "The new military uniform for the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been designed and is being introduced. During the first half of this year, uniforms will be sewn for generals and the officer corps at military institutes and schools and for top personnel at the Ministry of Defense, the military districts, and the different corps. Uniforms for everybody else will be sewn in 1995. "The necessary cloth has already been issued to the districts and they have begun to implement the president's decree. But a shortage of funds has slowed this process. "We have taken a number of steps to make the uniforms of military school cadets more attractive. These uniforms will be very similar to those worn by officers. In addition, on 1 September, students will be issued camouflage uniforms. Term servicemen will wear laced army boots instead of high boots [kyrzovi], jackets of coat-quality cloth instead of greatcoats, and the uncomfortable parade-dress single-breasted jacket will be replaced by an elegant, youthful jacket. Funds are a problem, but we are getting things done. "The uniforms are the subject of a great deal of talk. Especially, should there be fur caps or not, and why do generals need leather coats? It would be interesting to hear the opinion of the chief of rear services on this subject." "The leather coats have been introduced as a representative item. They are not included in the standard issue. The generals order these coats at their own expense. In my opinion, it is a good thing for the minister of defense and other generals when they travel abroad to represent our country in such high-quality uniforms. This adds to Ukraine's prestige." Col. Gen. Anatoliy Lopata noted that very many Ukrainians have leather clothing and no one criticizes them for this, whereas there was immediate criticism of the army. He added: "In the past, every general in the Soviet Army had the right to buy a full, better-quality field uniform and a better-quality rain cloak at his own expense. For some reason, no one seemed to notice this then." Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko: "Apropos the fur caps. Such caps were part of traditional Ukrainian attire and were worn by the Cossacks. Abolishing them caused concern even outside the military. Many civilians appealed to the Ministry of Defense to restore the fur caps as part of the uniform for generals and colonels. There were also countless requests regarding this from more junior officers. Like the braid worn by generals, the fur caps serve as kind of incentive. Young officers inherently yearn to acquire these symbols of rank. That is precisely why the commission approved them as part of the new uniform." From problems pertaining to rear services, the journalists moved on to purely military issues. Especially those that concern armaments. Lt. Gen. Lev Hnatenko, chief of the Armaments Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, held his own in a battle of sorts. Lyubov Yanyuk, the newspaper UKRAYINA MOLODA: "If you please, a few words about the progress of nuclear disarmament." "We are adhering to the schedule for dismantling the nuclear warheads that was agreed upon. Despite the fact that there is some deviation on the part of Russia, which is not adhering to the schedule for delivering heat-generating assemblies to Ukrainian nuclear electric power stations. This issue is currently being decided at the government level. It will be settled in the very near future." Marat Pohoryelov, Ukrainian Radio: "What is our strategy for our own armaments? What will we do when the weapons we have become obsolete?" Lt. Gen. L. Hnatenko: "I am not revealing any secrets when I tell you that it is very expensive to manufacture weapons. No country, with the exception of the former USSR and the U.S., makes its own weapons from start to finish. The situation in the USSR was such that no one republic could manufacture weapons independently. In other words, Ukraine does not have a single assembly plant, although approximately 25 percent of different components of various weapons are manufactured here. "We conducted a study of all types of weapons and assessed the situation. This served as the basis for working out a state program of weapons development up to the year 2000 and a long-term program up to the year 2010. "Right now we are trying to set up weapons production at a maximum number of facilities. This question has been partially resolved. The Ukrainian T-80 tank is being successfully produced in Kharkiv, Ukrainian shipyards are building military ships; the best military transport airplane, the AN-70, has been built in Kiev; radar systems are being developed, as well as a Ukrainian satellite, which will be launched very soon. But, as everywhere, there are many problems. "There is only one solution. In order to maintain the combat readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we must modernize our armaments by making use of the facilities of our repair enterprises. Such projects exist, but their implementation will depend on the availability of financing. "So far, we have financed only 24.3 percent of the scientific-research and research-design projects that need to be done and and bought only 8.8 percent of the weapons and spare parts that we require. We are trying to obtain the rest from extrabudgetary sources--by selling old weaponry and equipment that has done its job to the national economy. But this does not bring in enough money to allow us to execute our plan." The journalists were also interested in how things stand with the transfer of officers and warrant officers home from abroad. Lt. Gen. Hryhoriy Dyachuk, chief of the Main Directorate for Personnel [Cadres] of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, gave a detailed answer: "More than 26,000 officers and warrant officers have already returned to Ukraine. This process is continuing. Earlier reports put the figure of servicemen who want to return to Ukraine at some 140,000. But this figure was inaccurate. According to the data that I have, only another 10,000 officers and warrant officers, who submitted requests for transfers, have not yet returned. "There is indeed a circumstance that complicates this process. Under Article 2 of the Law of Ukraine `On Ukrainian Citizenship,' we can avoid bureaucratic red tape in transferring personnel who filed a request to serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine before 1 October 1992. Later, the Cabinet of Ministers came to our assistance and extended this deadline to 1 October 1993. And now? The Supreme Council and the president have to extend this deadline once again." Unsurprisingly, among the questions that were of interest to journalists was one concerning the construction of housing for military personnel. Col. Gen. A. Lopata, the chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and first deputy minister of defense, described how this problem is being solved. Anatoliy Vasylyovych noted that this is probably the most difficult problem facing the military. There are close to 80,000 military personnel without housing in our army. A shortage of funds is making this problem difficult to solve. Earlier, 28,000 apartments were built every year; now only 20 percent of this number is being built. Col. Gen. Lopata stressed that 19.98 trillion karbovantsi are needed to carry out the housing construction program. The amount appropriated for the Ministry of Defense is only 1.4 trillion, or 17.2 percent of sum it needs. Col. Gen. H. Mikhaylichenko described how the Ministry of Defense plans to solve this financial problem. He said that this matter was discussed at a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov. In addition, the minister of defense will report on the state of financing in the Armed Forces and on providing them with fuel and lubricants at a meeting of the Presidium of the Cabinet of Ministers on 18 April. Also, General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy has made a request for interest-free credit to pay off debts. This credit will be granted soon. The journalists were also interested in military education, its future and its problems. Maj. Gen. Viktor Hudym gave the attending journalists a relatively detailed report: "On the whole, the system of military education created in Ukraine is progressive. It is designed to provide the Armed Forces with officer cadres, but many mistakes were made when it was set up. "Taking into account my own concept of military education, I believe that we should not have copied the system in existence in Western countries, including in the United States. The standard of officer training in the former Soviet Union was high--a fact that even Western experts acknowledge. All that needed to be done was to incorporate in it the latest attainments in the field of science and to assure that the diplomas were convertible. Instead, the creation of a new system, the creation of new educational institutions within its framework and the elimination of existing schools resulted in the loss of valuable professorial and teaching personnel and the destruction of the invaluable material and technical base of many higher educational institutions. "Decisions were made without proper justification to dismantle costly permanently installed equipment and to move it to other locations. Some of this equipment never reached its new destination. Not all of the equipment that did arrive has been put into working order. "Schools that we still need today were closed. Thus, the only general military school, which was located in Kiev, was closed. In Odessa, they began training specialists for the Land Forces without sufficient preparation. A decision was made to close the Zhytomyr Higher Radar School of the Air Defense Forces--the only such school in the former Soviet Union, which trained specialists for the space forces. But no provision has been made for training these specialists elsewhere. The Kharkiv Higher Command Tank School was eliminated. The training of these specialists has been assigned to the Kiev Tank and Technical School, which used to train deputy weapons commanders and not commanders of tank platoons. This school lacks the proper field training base and many other things that Kharkiv had. Now the Kharkiv base has been handed over to the National Guard, the border troops, and others. Meanwhile, we are already feeling an acute need of commanders of tank subunits. "In addition, the change to a six-year course of study means that there will be no officers graduating in some specialties in 1997 and 1998. Particularly, those in specialties that were not previously trained by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. "It is necessary to amend certain government decisions, revoke the corresponding decree of the Cabinet of Ministers, and solve other problems jointly with the Main Directorate for Personnel. "We have no facilities at which to train psychologists, professors, and instructors. A decision was adopted to establish the Institute for the umanities in Kiev. In principle, this institution has already been created. What still needs to be decided is the question of site and material base. "The next question that must be resolved immediately is how to disburden the Odessa and Kiev land forces institutes. The meeting of the Military College of the Ministry of Defense on 22 April will be devoted to the problems of military education. I believe that most important issues will be settled at this meeting." ...The meeting came to an end, but the journalists still had many questions in their notebooks. Col. Gen. Anatoliy Lopata assured us that we would get answers to these questions in future briefings. And there will be plenty of them inasmuch as such meetings are very productive both for the journalists and for the military.
