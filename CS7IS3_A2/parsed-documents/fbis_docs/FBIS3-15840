The president answered questions of journalists, one of whom was an Interfax reporter. Asked by Interfax's Boris Grishchenko about the civil peace in the country, Yeltsin said, "I called for civil peace and accord in the presidential message to the Federal Assembly and in my talk to parliament. We must work out an appropriate document on this. An accord must be reached between various parties, movements and branches of authority. This idea was supported by the leadership of the State Duma and the Federation Council, the government and numerous parliamentary groups. I invited the leaders of these organizations to meet at 10:00 tomorrow, Thursday to agree on working out the document on civil peace and accord. It must be drafted within about two weeks. Then we will decide in what procedure it should be adopted. All strata of our society should contribute to the wording of this document if a genuine civil accord should follow its signing. I hope that this will be so." He had this to say about his Wednesday meeting the television officials: "I had a difficult talk with Aleksandr Yakovlev and Oleg Poptsov about political processes in the country as well as television. I had told the Federal Assembly that the first and second channels must be state-owned. This caused what can be described in mild terms as agitation in Ostankino (television center), as far as I know. I don't think this should be dramatized. In particular, Yakovlev suggests a `softer' version of the future presidential decree. Poptsov has his own view of the problem. All this can be negotiated. But we must come out with a solution, otherwise we stand to lose state channels to various parties and movements. The channels may be fragmented and bribery may take its toll." Speaking of the economic situation in the country Yeltsin said, "In the morning I had a thorough talk with Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha, in particular on agriculture. I am saying this for the first time to the Russian people, the CIS member states and the world: for the first time in three or four decades we will not buy grain abroad at all this year. Somebody can be surprised that we will not buy wool, eiher, because we could never do without imported wool but this year we will. Nor will we buy flax. All Russian processing factories have a good supply of agricultural raw materials. In particular, we have grain of good quality for the spring sowing. As recently as two years ago many people said that hunger was imminent but now we are in a position to say that the Russians will undoubtedly have enough food. We can discuss variety of foodstuffs and their quality which should be at least as high as in foreign products. We are thinking of more reasonable prices." Answering questions about the status of the Russo-American relations, in particular the spying scare in the U.S.A., Yeltsin emphasized, "This has happened on numerous occasions. Every country has an intelligence service. Whoever catches a foreign intelligence officer wins, those who are caught lose. No dramatic conclusions should be made from such events. I am sure that this will not affect the Russo-American relations. Now, former U.S. president Richard Nixon met with Rutskoy, Zyuganov and others of this kind. But he came here for a meeting with me. I appreciate President Bill Clinton's disavowal of Nixon." Interfax's question: Will you receive the U.S. ex-president? Yeltsin: No, not after this. He will not be received by the government, either. Nor will [presidential chief of staff] Filatov receive him. Mr. Nixon must know that Russia is a great country which must not be trifled with. The Americans and we must prepare carefully the Vladivostok meeting of foreign ministers (scheduled for March 14). The Russo-American partnership was not easy to come by and we should not lose it. I am sure that we will not."
