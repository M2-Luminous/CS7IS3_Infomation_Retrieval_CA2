Jiang Zemin extended warm congratulations and paid high tributes to prize winners and to scientists and technicians working in various sectors across the nation. He urged the broad mass of scientists and technicians to sow the seeds of scientific progress across the country and contribute even more to the development of the economy and to social progress. Jiang Zemin said Comrade Deng Xiaoping incisively proposed an important exposition that "science and technology are the primary productive forces." His exposition has developed Marxist theory on science and technology and played a great promotive role to China's science and technology work and to the entire economic construction. Those who are involved in science and technology work must persist in implementing the policy of "holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field open" as this policy has correctly solved the relationship between basic, applied, and development research. Jiang Zemin pointed out that the great practice for reform and development requires being armed with correct theory and rich knowledge. All levels of leading comrades should study hard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and information on a socialist market economy and on modern science and technology so as to constantly score new victories for China's socialist construction. Present at the meeting with the prize-winning representatives and attending the prize-award meeting were Wen Jiabao, Lu Jiaxi, Li Peiyao, Song Jian, Chen Junsheng, Luo Gan, and others. For those who are involved in science and technology, receiving a national scientific and technological prize has been viewed as a top honor. The entire evaluation and screening process to select the winning projects and winners for the 1993 national scientific and technological prizes has ended. Following a hectic evaluation and screening process, several thousand scientists, professors, and experts selected 781 outstanding scientific and technological results and 4,484 winners. A total of 52 scientific and technological results won State Natural Science Prizes; 441 won State Science and Technology Progress Prizes; and 113 won State Spark Plan Prizes. The percentage of prize-winning trade and industry are as follows: 42.9 percent for industry, transportation; 16.8 percent for farming and animal husbandry; 6 percent for basic research; 9 percent for culture, education, and public health; 19.6 percent for national defense and public security; and 5.7 percent for other sectors. Incomplete statistics show that the accumulated economic benefits generated following the implementation of the prize-winning scientific results, many of them reaching the world's advanced level, top 21.3 billion yuan. Zhu Lilan, executive vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, spoke at today's meeting. She said the party and government adopt the principle of using both spiritual and material incentives, with the emphasis on spiritual, to encourage scientific and technological personnel. This system has produced the desired effect of "not only encouraging an individual but also a lot of other people and of not only encouraging a particular project, but also many other projects." Through encouragement, we provide guidance on the direction of scientific and technological development to various levels of scientific and technological units; effectively help promote conversion of scientific and technological results to production; bring about close integration between science and economy; enhance the people's awareness of science and technology; strengthen the cohesive force among scientific and technological workers; spread patriotism, collectivism, and the spirit of work-dedication; and advance the cause of socialist spiritual civilization.
