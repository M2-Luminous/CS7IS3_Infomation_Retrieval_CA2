M., N. Mattem, and Farid Kemmar: "Demonstrations Against Terrorism Increase Throughout the Country; Marches Under Rain and Snow"--first paragraph is ALGER REPUBLICAIN introduction] [Text] In such cases, in spite of what some media would have us believe, stereotyped political language becomes irrelevant. Similar events keep occurring again and again in inland towns. The phenomenon is turning into a vast, broad, irresistible mass movement. Fearful and enraged, our fellow citizens took to the streets to denounce terrorism and express their support to the forces engaged in a merciless fight to contain and eradicate it. How shall we interpret the demonstrations that took place at Sidi-Aich, Biskra, Laghouat, Tizi-Ouzou, Bejaia, Tamanrasset, Babar, and Souk-Ahras? Or those of yesterday at Ouargla, Setif, Touggourt, and Bordj-Bou-Arreridj? Or those that are announced for this weekend? Rallies or demonstrations against terrorism and in support of a government determined to eradicate it and restore law and order to Algeria, bled white, on its knees, and undergoing an economic perfusion. The people increasingly understand what situation the country is in, and they are getting better at discerning what games are being played. Somehow drugged, abused, and robbed, the people understand more clearly the true problems faced by our society. Believing in integrity, they expected to be helped by angels coming down from heaven. All they saw was death, grief, destruction, and abominable exclusions. Actually, they were the terrorized witnesses of the rise of fascism. This slow and painful realization actually amounted to the political education of an entire people. Remember that in 1954 there were only a handful of men determined to take up arms and liberate the country. How can we fight against a massively armed army, NATO, air and naval forces, with mere peashooters, people would ask then. Yet, against this armada, there was the concept of justice: Algeria must be freed from the settlers that oppressed it. It was hard. Very hard. Our revolutionary experience may well have been unique. This is what we risked losing with the Afghan runts. What is the ideal of the fundamentalists and their mafia supporters? Perhaps it was this aspect that determined the choices of Algeria, the green multinational, and its masters. It was an entire people, trusting and naive, that was almost led to the slaughterhouse or in the arena where dwarfs assemble. It was like a breath of fresh air when we learned, yesterday, that thousands of Algerians had marched under the snow at Bordj-Bou-Arreridj. This courageous march is quite a symbol. Does it mean that something more profound is on the move? Patriots, democrats, and republicans will have to pay attention to these demonstrations. At Bordj-Bou-Arreridj Despite the cold and the snow, a march against terrorism and in support of President Zeroual took place on Wednesday at 1000, at Bordj-Bou-Arreridj. Initiated at the governorate's second conference of the UNJA [National Union of Algerian Youth] High-School section, held on Monday, 7 February, at the Belgharbi junior high school, this demonstration was organized by Bordj civil society. They thus expressed their support for law and order and for the country's new government. What is remarkable, too, was their boldness in displaying banners bearing the slogans: "No to terrorism!" In Bordj, that is something new. Thousands of demonstrators met near the stadium and marched all the way to the town hall. From the balcony of the building, overlooking Place de la Liberte, a youth read a motion denouncing the terrorists' barbarity and supporting the new president. The bad weather that prevailed in the last two days did not discourage the citizens. They came in great numbers to take part in the march that took place under the snow. Young people expressed their joy by throwing snowballs. According to demonstrators belonging to mass organizations (the UNJA and UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers] in particular), local FLN National Liberation Front] representatives, including one member of the Central Committee, did not hesitate to put pressure on their militants to prevent them from taking part in the march. These FLN officials intended to continue boycotting what the country started after the National Conference of 25 January. This demonstration of the Bordj-Bou-Arreridj civil society can be improved upon. But it remains independent from politicians' calculations. In Setif On Wednesday morning, in spite of the bitter cold and driving rain mixed with snow, hundreds of Setif governorate citizens made it a point to express their support to the chief of State, Mr. Liamine Zeroual, by organizing a march through the streets and main avenues of the governorate seat. Thus, participants from all walks of life, representing civil society, took part in the march, carrying banners and calling to the fight against terrorism and for a total break with the former regime. We should mention that the march ended with a motion of support for the chief of State, Mr. Liamine Zeroual, which was read to the audience and in which citizens repeated their demands for the institution of a modern state and a return to the moral and cultural values of the Algerian people. In Touggourt Last Tuesday, over 3,000 citizens of Touggourt--a town located 160 km from the governorate center--organized a march in support of President Liamine Zeroual's recent speech to the nation. During the march, which was organized by local social and cultural associations, the demonstrators displayed banners in which they called for the preservation of national unity and recourse to dialogue, while denouncing the use of violence to solve political problems. After the march, which ended at the district seat, the organizers read a motion of support to President Liamine Zeroual, whom they called a man of integrity and a patriot. They also denounced foreign interference in Algeria's internal affairs. The participants also expressed their profound attachment to national values and their conviction that pursuing the dialogue is the only sure way to achieve stability and find a global solution to the present crisis. At Ouargla At Ouargla, yesterday, several hundreds of people took part in a march to support President Liamine Zeroual and his recent speech to the nation. Organized by local popular associations and organizations, the march brought together citizens of both sexes and all ages, carrying banners and shouting slogans to express their support to the president, denouncing violence, calling for an end to the bloodshed in Algeria, and appealing to society to unite and build a strong and prosperous Algerian nation. The demonstrators started from Place Sedrata and headed for the governorate seat, where a motion was read in which they expressed their support to Mr. Liamine Zeroual, and emphasized the need for a serious debate to overcome the crisis, and their commitment to help bring Algerians together and put an end to violence and bloodshed. At Annaba Union leaders of the Annaba governorate held a general meeting this Wednesday at the town's union college, and expressed their "support to Mr. Liamine Zeroual's appointment as chief of State which they believe represents a guarantee of reinforced national unity and the materialization of the strength of political authority." In addition to supporting any political measure aiming to ensure stability in the country, end criminal attacks, establish law and order, and stimulate the national economy, union leaders promised "to oppose any attempt against national unity, the nation's values, and the principles of the glorious November revolution." "The defense of the basic interests of the working class and the preservation of its dignity, under the law, with no demagoguery or maneuvers to involve it in political confrontations, remain, according to union leaders, immutable principles dictated by their commitment to putting the nation's highest interest ahead of any other consideration, in the name of a united Algeria and the principles of the November revolution." Students' March in Tizi-Ouzou; No to the `Zaouia' University Yesterday, in Tizi-Ouzou, thousands of university and high-school students answered the call to march issued by the local students' committee. A march had already been scheduled for last Sunday, but it was not authorized and did not take place. At the opening of the national conference on universities, the local students' committee organized a march to protest against exclusion and the policy aiming to sell off the university. The march started around 1030 at the Hasnaoua campus. As soon as the participants had gathered, squares were formed, with banners reading: "Repeal first; national conference later," "No to university selloff," etc. The demonstrators also shouted slogans such as "Djeba bara," "Outdated system," "Enough is enough; the university has its honor." All the way, from the Hasnaoua campus to the hospital, the cultural center, and the governorate seat, university and high-school students shouted their rejection of ministerial circulars and their hope in a modern university. The students themselves were in charge of controlling the crowd, and they did so impeccably. During the demonstration, a spokesman for the students' committee told us: "We are always mobilized; we are determined to struggle to the end, for the pure and simple repeal of the circular." Concerning the opening of the national conference, he said: "Our efforts came after a vague protest movement. We set a condition for our participation; the circular must be repealed (...). Circular 22/23 of 1993 deals with students' orientation and evaluation, disqualifying marks, and the exam system. During the entire march, students denounced the system that is turning the university into a "zaouia." On reaching the end point, one committee member stated: "The committee thanks the 15 high-school students who contributed their support to the march, as well as the citizens who answered the call. We shall continue our struggle for a new university project in Tizi-Ouzou." A biology student told us: "The future of the University is at stake; it is the entire school system that must be redesigned." Right after the march, the crowd scattered peacefully, with hope in their hearts. According to the organizers, "the march was a success; we will remain mobilized until our demands are met and until we have a new University project." Note that, as the march went by, the town's merchants pulled down their shutters until the demonstration was over.
