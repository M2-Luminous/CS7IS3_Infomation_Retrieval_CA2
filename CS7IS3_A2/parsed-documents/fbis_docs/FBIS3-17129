Moscow's Peacekeeping Efforts: Useless Fuss"] [Text] The resumption of fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh late last week once again brought to naught Russia's peacekeeping efforts. Neither did the participants in the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly manage to make their contribution to the normalization of the situation, as they failed to persuade Azerbaijan's representatives to soften their demands on the withdrawal of the Armenian troops as a necessary condition for the resumption of dialogue with the Armenians. As for Geydar Aliyev's statements made on national television on Sunday, they generally put in doubt chances for the sides' reconciliation. Having termed the combat operations by the Azerbaijan Army as just and liberating, Aliyev actually called upon his fellow countrymen for war till victory -- until "Armenia's troops of occupation leave all the occupied lands." Diplomatic efforts, including those of Moscow, in his opinion, should be aimed at achieving this goal. The main points of Aliyev's Sunday address were repeated later in the day, in his own interpretation, by Ara Saakyan, first deputy chairman of the Armenian parliament. He stressed that normalization was possible only if fighting stops and Karabakh's legal status is determined. Without this, in his opinion, it is senseless to speak about any separation of the opposing sides. Saakyan simultaneously stated Yerevan's intention to turn for help in the settlement of the conflict to states of Europe and the United States, which attests to the fact that the idea of internationalizing the conflict is increasingly gaining popularity in the capitals of the opposing sides.
