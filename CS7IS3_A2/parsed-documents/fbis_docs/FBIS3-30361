That is the opinion of right-wing politicians. Such is also, more or less, the conclusion expressed in a statement by Primate Jozef Glemp upon his return from a visit to Germany. The right word here is trust because the church protested against the word "support." The Christian-National Union [ZChN] won the sympathy of priests with their firm fight for issues that party activists, judging from the statements of hierarchy representatives, consider important. The ZChN was accused of blindly following the church of defending everything that was said to be its stance or in its interest. Common are opinions that this devotion paid off to the party of Jurek and Niesiolowski. In the 1991 elections, many representatives of the clergy portrayed to believers the election list of the Electoral Catholic Action, established by the ZChN, as the right list to choose. The celebration of the 100th anniversary of the peasant movement in the Warsaw cathedral, declarations (in the statements of leaders, at least) of the desire to defend the Concordat, statements protecting money collected at church Masses from tax, references to the image of a traditionally religious peasant who is tied to the belief of his forefathers as much as he is to his land--as a result of all this... A Faint Odor of Incense ...has began to surround the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. It is difficult to say how many representatives of the clergy have been influenced by it. There are priests, such as the well-known Boguslaw Bijak, who have been engaged in the policy of improving relations with the peasants for a long time. Many examples of contacts between peasant activists and rural priests are no secret. All the same, it is not very likely that the church will get really involved in the coming self-governmental elections, or in any other elections in the near future. Representatives of the hierarchy are rather cautious. "I do not know whether this is merely a demonstration or the real and true attachment of a great number of people--of farmers or people linked to farming--which is tied to the church," says Cardinal Jozef Glemp. Caution as well as friendliness is also recommended by rightist politicians, traditionally linked to the church. "It is a very good thing that the PSL is willing to defend Catholic interests," says Marek Jurek. "However, we must wait and see how it will react to really important issues, such as the defense of the unborn." He believes that neither the members of the party, where one can come across "former members of the Polish United Workers' Party," nor the roots of Pawlak's party, "which stems from SL Wola [not further identified] or from PSL-Liberation," nor the behavior of the PSL Deputies' Club when the antiabortion bill was being considered, guarantee that the PSL will defend Catholic tenets in politics. We Do Not Envy, We Are Not Surprised Rightist politicians give assurances that the increasingly closer relations between the PSL and the church are not a cause of envy or surprise for them. "The church cannot afford to be in conflict with the establishment [preceding word in English]; it has certain things to see through, such as the Concordat; the PSL may become a supporter of the church. In the doctrinal sense, it is enough to broaden the peasants' economic antiliberalism with philosophical antiliberalism--to transform from a party of young Boryna [a peasant character in Polish literature] to a party of old Boryna," explains one of the coalition politicians. More radical PSL activists, such as Jacek Soska, do not like the party's gravitation toward Christian-national positions. This is not only because they differ as far as the diagnosis concerning the party's electorate's expectations is concerned; they also first of all ask what their party will gain if it develops closer relations with the church. The question that is frequently asked is whether the PSL, in fact, needs the special favors of the church. As is often recalled, this party won voters with its criticism of the economic policy of the Solidarity governments. It did not really get very deep into the philosophical side of things.
