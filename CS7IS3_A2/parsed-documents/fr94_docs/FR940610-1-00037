FR940610-1-00037 FR940610-1-00007 In calculating a standard section 7520 actuarial factor, certain assumptions are made. For all standard section 7520 actuarial factors in the single-life and term-certain tables in ยง20.2031&hyph;7(d), the interest rate for enjoyment or the postponement of enjoyment is the applicable section 7520 rate. In the case of a life annuity, income, or remainder factor, the basis for mortality rates for measuring lives is the data in Table 80 CNSMT. However, in unusual situations, where special section 7520 actuarial factors must be computed, one or more alternative assumptions may be appropriate. For example, if the actual income is known to be below applicable standards, the section 7520 interest rate may not be used to project the trust income yield. Similarly, if a measuring life is classified as terminally ill, the standard mortality data from Table 80 CNSMT may not be used as the mortality basis. But, even though one or both of these exceptions is applicable in a case, the section 7520 interest rate will ordinarily be used to discount the value of the right to any postponed enjoyment. In cases requiring the valuation of ordinary annuities, income interests, and remainder and reversionary interests, the courts have consistently recognized the need to use the standard actuarial factors prescribed by the regulations. See Ithaca Trust v. United States, 279 U.S. 151 (1929). However, the courts have recognized that the use of the standard actuarial factors is inappropriate in certain cases. Robinette v. Helvering, 318 U.S. 184 (1943) (reversionary interest with several interdependent contingencies); Stark v. United States, 477 F.2d 131 (8th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 975 (1973) (closely held stock that was not publicly traded and paid no dividends); O'Reilly v. Commissioner, 973 F.2d 1403 (8th Cir. 1992), rem'd, T.C.M. 1994&hyph;61 (disparity between .2 percent yield and 10 percent tables produced unrealistic and unreasonable result); and Commissioner v. Estate of Sternberger, 348 U.S. 187 (1955) (charitable bequest that would occur only if decedent's unmarried daughter died without issue surviving her and her mother). In addition, the courts have held that the standard actuarial factors cannot be used if the measuring life is terminally ill. Estate of McLendon v. Commissioner, T.C.M. 1993&hyph;459; Estate of Jennings v. Commissioner, 10 T.C. 323 (1948); and Estate of Denbigh v. Commissioner, 7 T.C. 387 (1946). See Rev. Rul. 80&hyph;80, 1980&hyph;1 C.B. 194, which provides that, in cases where the individual's death is imminent, the taxpayer may not use standard actuarial factors prescribed by the regulations. See also, Carter v. United States, 921 F.2d 63 (5th Cir. 1991), where the court refused to ascribe value to an income interest for purposes of the section 2013 credit where death of the measuring life was simultaneous with that of the decedent. In Shapiro v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1993&hyph;483 (1993), the Tax Court allowed the taxpayer to improperly value an annuity with a standard one-life annuity actuarial factor from Table A in ยง20.2031&hyph;7(f) in a situation in which the annuity could have exhausted the fund from which the annuity was to be paid before the death of the annuitant. The Internal Revenue Service believes that the annuity factor that should have been used in this case is a special annuity factor for the right to receive annual payments for 4 years or until the prior death of the annuitant. See Rev. Rul. 77&hyph;454, 1977&hyph;2 C.B. 351. See also Moffett v. Commissioner, 269 F.2d 738 (4th Cir. 1959), and United States v. Dean, 224 f.2d 26 (1st Cir. 1955). Therefore, the Service will not follow the result in Shapiro. Sections 1.7520&hyph;3(a), 20.7520&hyph;3(a), and 25.7520&hyph;3(a) set forth specific Code sections that are exempt from the valuation rules of section 7520. The proposed regulations contained in this notice describe other areas in which the valuation methodology applicable to standard and special section 7520 actuarial factors is not to be used. Generally, if the interest in property that is to be valued is not an ordinary annuity, income interest, or remainder interest, the standard annuity, income, and remainder factors in the tables of factors set forth in the regulations and IRS publications cannot be used. In some cases in which the standard factors from the regulations and publications tables cannot be used, a special factor may be computed by the taxpayer or by the Service upon the request of the taxpayer. In other cases where standard or special factors may not be used, the property interest may be valued using other valuation techniques. Depending upon the facts and circumstances, a property interest that cannot be valued using the standard or special section 7520 factors may have no ascertainable value. The proposed regulations establish two primary tests to determine whether the fair market value of the interest is computed by use of the standard section 7520 actuarial factors found in the regulations and IRS publications. The first test is whether the instrument of transfer provides the beneficiary with the degree of beneficial enjoyment that is consistent with the type of property interest that the standard valuation tables are designed to measure. In this regard, the rights of an annuity beneficiary must be adequately defined and, if the annuity is payable from a group of assets, the value of the assets must be sufficient to support all of the annuity payments. Similarly, the rights of an income beneficiary must be consistent with the rights of an outright owner of the property interest for the same period of time, and the rights of a remainder or reversionary beneficiary must be protected against invasion or erosion of the corpus.
