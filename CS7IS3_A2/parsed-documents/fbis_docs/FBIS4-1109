Kigali is still subject to shelling and sporadic gunfire. In the north of the country, the Patriotic Front has taken the town of Byumba, an important strategic center. This time the news has been confirmed by the United Nations. Francois Rijkmans reports: [Rijkmans] [passage omitted] Violence is continuing up country. This time it is clear that the Butare region in the south, which until now had been miraculously preserved from the massacres, is now getting its full dose. People who have taken refuge in schools or churches are being killed. The militia are barring the roads, which are crowded with thousands of people. Militiamen are slaughtering on the spot those who are fleeing. At the frontier, on the road between Butare and Bujumbura, people trying to get into Burundi have been killed. Dozens of people with machete, bullet, or shrapnel injuries have arrived in the hospital of Butare where there is a Medecins Sans Frontieres team. There is a large Tutsi minority in the Butare area, but traditionally there has been harmonious coexistence between the two groups there, to such an extent that certain Hutu radicals from the north suspect the southern Hutus of being too close to the Tutsis. The day before yesterday the prefect of the region and the military commander, two moderates, were replaced by people close to the radicals.
