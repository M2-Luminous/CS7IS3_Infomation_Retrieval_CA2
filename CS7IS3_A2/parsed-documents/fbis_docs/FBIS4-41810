Shuvaynikov, chairman of the Russian Party of Crimea (RPC), under the rubric "Party Leader's Tribune": "Why the Russian Party Did Not Join the Russia Bloc"] [Text] The article "Past Idols, Future Idols...." by V. Polyakov, a deputy from Simferopol, has prompted me to write these notes. In analyzing the course of the presidential and parliamentary elections, as well as the events that followed, the author attributed a subjective motivation to the actions and deeds of individual political leaders. Thus, in particular, having mentioned my name, he stated: "We can consider tribulations involved in nominations for the post of president a prelude for the forthcoming storm. What Mezhak understood on time, Shuvaynikov did not, and for this reason he paid for it dearly. The recent `Hyde-Park' idol turned out to be an outsider in the camp of the victors." Having read this paragraph, a poorly informed voter may indeed think that Shuvaynikov "made a mistake" when he failed to withdraw as a candidate in favor of Meshkov and did not join the Russia bloc together with his party. Since they are trying to convince the 200,000 voters who voted in the first round for the candidate of the Russian Party of this, I am compelled to discuss the situation that preceded the presidential election and emerged on the eve of the creation of the Russia bloc. As the residents of the Crimea may remember, a struggle for the institution of presidency began about one year ago. The Russian Party unambiguously determined its position as early as July: A president was necessary in the environment of a mounting political and economic crisis, and it was desirable for this post to go to a politician firmly advocating the position of the return of the Crimea to Russia, and then in a peaceful, legal manner. Unlike the Russian Party, the RPK [Republican Party of the Crimea] (the RDK [Republican Movement of the Crimea] party), together with its leader Yu. Meshkov, rejected the institution of presidency in the belief that it was being prepared solely for one well-known candidate. Moreover, Yu. Meshkov himself had doubts for a long time about whether to run for this position or not. Later, such doubts also overcame the RPK (RDK) leadership. The decision to nominate him was made as late as in the course of the campaign which had already begun. Still before the beginning of candidate registration, several meetings were held between the representatives of the RNP [Republican People's Party] and the Russian Party at which scenarios for the nomination of a common candidate to counter N. Bagrov were discussed. Yu. Meshkov did not personally attend these meetings. Moreover, the last meeting before the beginning date of nomination was frustrated: Only I and S. Tsekov, the current speaker of the Crimean Supreme Soviet and leader of the RPK (RDK), met in front of the closed doors of the Bagram cafe. This is why the Russian Party, in carrying out previous decisions, was the first one to register its candidate and to begin the propaganda effort. Nonetheless, the problem of a common candidate remained because the danger of splitting the vote existed which gave N. Bagrov a certain advantage. On the initiative of V. Klychnikov, the NPK [People's Party of the Crimea] executive committee chairman, three registered candidates--Yu. Meshkov, V. Mezhak, and I--met at the Bagram cafe on 9 December in order to specify positions and determine the principles for selecting a common candidate. There was no discussion of the Russia bloc yet; it was not even at the draft stage. I proposed the following scenario for our actions to my colleagues: 1) In view of the fact that the mass media tried to pit us against each other thus sowing discord in the ranks of our supporters, to make a statement in the press about the commonality of our purpose and the aspiration to designate a common candidate; 2) To hold as soon as possible a rating survey of voters in order to obtain objective data on the real chances of each one of us; 3) To give me, the candidate of the Russian Party, one week to coordinate all issues with the political council which had nominated me as a candidate. After a certain period of doubt, V. Mezhak announced that he was prepared to withdraw as a candidate that very day, but only in favor of Yu. Meshkov. Ultimately, both candidates agreed to my proposal concerning the statement, charged me with preparing its text by Monday, and had no objections to the one-week deadline. However, the events that followed indicated that the agreements reached were merely a tactical move; the RPK (RDK) and NPK leaders did not intend to comply with them. One day later, a meeting between Yu. Meshkov and V. Mezhak, and the contender for candidate, A. Kruglov, and activists of pro-Russian organizations was held in Sevastopol. Incidentally, A. Kruglov, while in the ranks of the Russian Party, voted in favor of my candidacy. Later, without adducing convincing arguments, Aleksandr Georgiyevich resolved to independently nominate himself for president and announced his departure from the Russian Party. I would not like to analyze the motives for his actions because Kruglov is a person who is sincerely devoted to the Russian idea. However, at that time he noticeably harmed the Russian cause, perhaps not being aware of this himself. As a matter of fact, a treaty on the common candidate Yu. Meshkov and the creation of the informal Russia bloc was concluded at this meeting to which I was not invited. On the same day, it was heard from the lips of Yu. Meshkov's supporters at an RPK (RDK) rally that Shuvaynikov was withdrawing as a candidate in favor of the Republican leader. Someone might say that in politics all means are good if they justify the end. Alas, I do not think so; to put it mildly, the haste, impropriety, and unreliability of the two party candidates who had so rapidly "laid to rest" the achieved "gentlemen's" agreement put me on my guard. When I brought the text of the statement on Monday it turned out that nobody needed it. NPK Chairman V. Mezhak demanded, in a form bordering on an ultimatum (according to him, suggested) that I withdraw as a candidate in favor of Yu. Meshkov and join the Russia bloc that was being created. I refused because there were serious arguments in favor of it that had great significance for the future political events in the Crimea. I outlined them to my comrades in the Russian Party, asking one question first: If the two leaders do not give much thought to choosing their means, what goal do they set for themselves? Why was a bloc with the attractive name Russia being so hastily created? Long before the presidential election, the RPK (RDK) made a vigorous effort to create the People's Unity bloc in which the issue of Russia as a specific objective of Crimea's political movement would not figure and would be carefully avoided with references to the fact that this could give the Ukrainian authorities a pretext to accuse the Republicans of "violating Ukrainian legislation." Therefore, only the Russian Party, which was labeled "chauvinist" and "Fascist," talked about Russia. The People's Unity bloc was not to be, but the RPK (RDK) program to this day talks about an independent Crimea in some kind of an alliance with the countries of the artificially created CIS. The program of the People's Party which emerged later out of the RDK splinters sees the future of the Crimea in a confederation with Ukraine. I recall this deliberately because these two particular parties acted as the foundation of the Russia bloc abandoning for the election period their programmatic documents and adopting the slogans of Russian orientation which even the day before they considered "poorly timed politically" and even "instigative." At a meeting of the Russian Party political council, the views concerning the Russia bloc and the common candidate Yu. Meshkov were also mixed. A majority agreed that the name "Russia" was being used by the Republicans for purely propaganda purposes, in order to attract a greater number of voters. In reality, the RPK (RDK) does not intend to give up the idea of building an "independent" [preceding word published in Ukrainian] Crimea. This does not suit the Russian Party because it views the independence of the Crimea merely as a stage on the way to the peninsula's return to Russia. For the Republicans, independence turns into some kind of an end unto itself which may entail unpredictable political and economic consequences, up to an armed confrontation and economic blockade. A few members of the political council did not agree with the majority opinion and went over to the camp of Russia block supporters, accusing me of [bringing about] a split. I am narrating this in detail because the time has shown that the majority of the Russian Party political council members were right. When I hear now from the lips of one of the Russia bloc leaders that the Crimean parliament never raised, does not raise, nor will ever raise the issue of the Crimea's secession from Ukraine, I ask myself this question: Was there such a thing as the Russia bloc? And if there was, what and who are the Crimean voters to believe now? We did not join the Russia bloc precisely because as early as in winter the leadership of the Russian Party had predicted the current political events whereby the Crimean-Russian idea would begin to be forgotten or ignored. We did not join deliberately because we do not wish to bear the responsibility for a political course, which hinges solely on the idea of "an independent Crimea in an alliance with the CIS," rather than the idea of "political and economic integration with Russia with the subsequent return of the Crimea to it." Moreover, we have real apprehensions that the geopolitical factor of Turkey in the Crimea will be enlarged against the background of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which is being played out as if in a bad dream. There is a real foundation for this--the Crimean Tatar population that has returned from exile and has been granted special political privileges as a deported nation. All of this may only make more distant the programmatic goals of the Russian Party--the recreation of a unified Slavic state and the restoration of historical justice, the return of the Crimea to Russia. For the Russian Party, and for me, its leader, power is not an end unto itself. All "pro" and "contra" notwithstanding, we supported the candidacy of Yu. Meshkov after the first round of the presidential election; we believe that at present the first president needs constructive assistance and confidence of the parliament rather than a search for his miscalculations or the mistakes made. Let us not forget that the residents of the Crimea now believe Yu. Meshkov and his pre-election promises, and we should not interfere with his keeping the promises. After all, all authorities are responsible to the people, and some time later the people will be entitled to hold them accountable for everything that has been bad or good, including the Crimean parliament which is learning the ABC's of legislative work with difficulty. As far as the Russian Party is concerned, we remain an association of citizens who are faithful to their programmatic objectives and tasks. We do not make our failures into a tragedy.
