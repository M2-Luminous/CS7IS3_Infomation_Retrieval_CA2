Mr. Gammuh, explaining a Prime Ministry order issued earlier this week, said the government would use the savings from the operational budgets of the ministries and departments to improve public services and productive sectors of the economy. The minister said the government was hoping to save up to JD 20 million through the ordered reductions in spending in all areas of current expenditure--water, electricity, transport, communications, stationery, etc. However, he indicated that JD 20 million was not an absolute figure. More importantly, he said, "we want to raise the awareness of everybody concerned while dealing with public funds of need to be careful and prudent." "Everyone has to ensure that resources are spent in the right channel with optimum benefits to serve the purpose for which they are allocated," he told the JORDAN TIMES. Mr. Gammuh said the move was also intended as a message to "all concerned," including ministers and senior decision-making officials at various departments that "there is a need for better management of economy" and that they should exercise control. "Wastage has to be reduced and better utilisation of funds and cost-effectiveness have to be achieved in all government ministries and departments," he said. "We know this is difficult, in view of the fact that the (1994) budget is already tight," Mr. Gammuh said. "But there is no alternative if we were to advance towards self-reliance and indpendence from external assistance." The JD 1.487 billion fiscal budget for 1994 projects a shortfall of JD 158 million, expected to be addressed by external assistance. The "operational budgets" covered under the government measures are estimated at nearly JD 200 million for 1994. Dr. Fahid al-Fanik, an economist and newspaper columnist, agreed that it was "difficult to cut expenditures" but said the government move was "worth exploring." Reducing expenditure has been adopted by the government as a means to cut the budget deficit for several years now, "and there is a limit to which one could go in reducing expenses before reaching the bone," Dr. al-Fanik said. However, the economist said he saw room for reduction in the travel expenditures and allowances for government officials. "I think the minister is seeking a saving of JD 10 million to JD 20 million," given the nature of expenses as given in a government circular issued Sunday, Dr. al-Fanik said. "It will be worthwhile even if we save JD 1 million or JD 2 million," he said. The circular from the Prime Ministry defined the areas of reduction as water, electricity, fuel, telephone, telex, mail and stationery expenses. It said a significant increase in expenditure was noticed in these areas and that it was necessary to economise in line with the economic restructuring programme under way in the Kingdom. Mr. Gammuh said the measures to cut expenditures applied also to all public sector undertakings, including institutions such as the Social Security Corporation, the Jordan Investment Bureau and other agencies which operate directly under government guidance.
