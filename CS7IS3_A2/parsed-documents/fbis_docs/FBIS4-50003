They discussed bilateral relations between China and the United States and some international issues. Rong expressed his appreciation over former U.S. President Nixon's efforts in opening the door of Sino-U.S. relations and in pushing the normalization of formal relations between the two countries. Kissinger, as an assistant to the former U.S. president, has also made great contributions in this aspect, Rong said. China hopes to see a peaceful and stable international environment and that differences between China and the U.S. should be solved through discussions and consultations on an equal footing, he stated. Kissinger said he hoped that U.S.-China relations would be improved and developed in a "constructive way", and the trade between the two countries should also be separated from human rights and all other issues. He believed that the two countries can cooperate in a still wider sphere. The meeting proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.
