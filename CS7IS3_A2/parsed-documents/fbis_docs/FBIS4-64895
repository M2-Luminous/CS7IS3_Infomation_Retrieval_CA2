What are the Christian Democratic Union's [CDU] concepts for the new laender? [Hintze] First, we will have to continue promoting growth, which will be 7-8 percent in eastern Germany this year. We are on the right track in this respect. The second priority refers to subsidy cuts, and we would like to point out that this mainly refers to cuts in the west. Between 1991 and 1994, 25 percent of subsidies were cut in the west. We will have to repeat this between 1995 and 1997. We will have to make sure that we keep the process that we have initiated in the new laender going. That is entirely clear to us. What is also important is a consistent support of their economic development. We have achieved particularly good results in this respect over the last few days. [Oertel] Like what? [Hintze] Take the chemical industry in Saxony-Anhalt, or electronics in Saxony, or the strong hopes that we now have for Thuringia. I think the reason why people talk less about the new laender now is because every field has been promoted by a very intense package of measures -- tax, legal, supportive, and economic measures. We have to make sure now that both tendencies -- growth and reduction of the inflation rate -- continue. The great political challenge we face now is an all-German one; it can no longer be separated into east and west. [Oertel] In spite of increasing wages, people in the east are afraid that real wages might continue to decline. What is your party's response to this? [Hintze] We have to make sure there is not too wide a gap between wages and productivity. I think that this has meanwhile become a principle in eastern Germany as well. We are aiming at similar living conditions, but we have to do it in such a way that the economy can cope with it. This is a very important principle. All we can promise the population is that the increasing economy will bring about an adjustment of income levels. This entire economic process cannot be controlled by the state. Rather, conditions have to be improved so we can achieve this independently. We are well on our way with this. We have a special problem in eastern Germany. We need the instruments of labor policy to a far greater extent there -- for the large number of people that do not have jobs yet through no fault of their own. [Oertel] Do you expect the labor market situation to improve? [Hintze] As many as five out of six economic institutes say that it will begin to improve in 1995. That means that the lowest point in employment has also been reached now in eastern Germany. The trend will be clearly upward from now on. I do not know whether we will see this expressed in real figures this year, but I certainly expect it for 1995. [Oertel] Let us talk about landtag elections. The CDU is in the government everywhere except Brandenburg. Might there be a need for new alliances, perhaps with the Greens in Saxony? [Hintze] In Saxony, I quite realistically expect Kurt Biedenkopf to win an absolute majority again, so we will not need a coalition partner at all. In the other laender, we will fight for a strategic majority, which will enable us to provide the minister-presidents and determine the way we want to form such governments. I would wish for the coalition with the Free Democratic Party [FDP] to be continued and for the FDP to show the necessary power in the election campaigns. [Oertel] There has been a proposal by Mr. Mahrenholz that the hunt for small informers should come to an end now. What is your opinion on that? [Hintze] I think this is a matter for those in charge in the new laender to discuss and to come up with a proposal. I do not think that such a proposal should come from western Germany. This should be discussed by those that were affected very strongly by the former GDR state. This does not mean that I am criticizing Mr. Mahrenholz, who, being a former constitutional judge, does, of course, have a right to contribute his view to the debate. I do not want to set a course in this question. [Oertel] The Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] must be taken seriously in the new laender: What is the CDU's way of dealing with them in view of the election campaign? [Hintze] Our political opponents in the election campaign are the Social Democrats. Political cooperation with the PDS is no option for us, neither at the moment nor in the future. [Oertel] Yet, CDU delegates have been elected with PDS votes in some places and joint votes were cast, as in Brandenburg. Do you consider that normal? [Hintze] I am sticking to my statement: For me, there is no political cooperation with the PDS.
