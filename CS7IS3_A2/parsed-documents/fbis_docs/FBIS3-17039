Skyriene said until there was some dimness in the system of Lithuanian banks, credits are suspended but not cancelled. Workers of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Vilnius bureaus confirmed the information. Head of World Bank Baltic states subunit Vilnius department Ramune Zabuliene said the bank "did not suspend any project" and added that "implementation of the project of restructuring of enterprises and financial sector is being protracted". Skyriene said until new banking laws corresponding to international standards are not approved, process of bankruptcies is not actually realized and a prospect of Currency Board remains vague, problems with credits may remain. Statements of the economic memorandum oblige the government to present the parliament laws of Central bank and commercial banks, to change law of bankruptcies and to present the law "On the creation of a specialized bankruptcy court". Such a court should be established before transferring the second part of EEC loan. Officials of international institutions are not directly linking the suspension of credits with creation of the Currency Board. IMF is interested not in the Currency Board itself but in the results of the reforms, and inflation rate -- first of all, as it now exceeds the allowed level. Up to March 21, international institutions have lent Lithuania 454 million U.S. dollars, 292 million of them have been already used.
