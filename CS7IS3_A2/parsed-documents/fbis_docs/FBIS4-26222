In the recent influx of foreign investment, the construction of a new foreign-funded farm, the country's biggest in farm production joined by overseas firms, has started in the vast stretches of land under the jurisdiction of Fujin city, in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. The project, covering an area of 38,000 hectares of wasteland, was jointly financed by China and the Republic of Korea with investments totalling 227 million yuan (26.7 million U.S. dollars). It is expected to be completed in three years and provide an annual grain output of 105,000 tons. According to an official with the provincial agricultural development department, in Heilongjiang there is a total of 8.6 million hectares of farmland and 1.8 million hectares of cultivatable wasteland. The rich land resources are becoming a main attraction for overseas business people who seek to invest in China. He said that the World Bank also has shown great interest in the development of arable lands in this area. It has approved loans of 120 million U.S. dollars in developing land resources in the province. The loans will be used in cultivation of wastelands, improvement of low-yield lands and grasslands and processing of sideline products. The project will start in 1997. Also, a Thai- and Malaysian-funded project involving 10 million U.S. dollars is being built in Hulin County of the province. When the farm is completed, all its sideline products will be exported. To boost the development of its agriculture, the provincial government has implemented preferential policies for use of wastelands. In other parts of China, including Liaoning and Jilin provinces also in the northeast, the local governments have also made efforts to encourage foreign investors to invest in agricultural projects, particularly in the processing of sideline products. Xiao Zhuofu, vice-governor of Liaoning, said that his government has decided to select more farmlands for development by foreign firms. A farm experimental center will be built near Jinxi city to show how overseas investment has been attracted to the province, he said. The Chinese central government has long paid attention to development and construction of grain production bases in northeast China. Toward the end of the 1970s, one farm in Heilongjiang Province took out loans of one million U.S. dollars to import more than 60 sets of farm machinery. Later, the country's first modernized farm, called "Honghe Farm," was built in this province with a loan of 110 million yuan from the Japanese Government in the form of compensation trade. About 20,000 hectares of wasteland were cultivated. The loan had been paid years ago with the soybeans produced in the farm, which is now affiliated with a new town. So far, a number of such farms have been built in this vast fertile plain.
