The two sides agreed to meet again, but officials predicted there will likely be no real progress until the "final hours" before a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on February 11. "It is like any negotiation -- you get right up to the final edge and most of that will probably be worked out in the final hours," said State Department Counselor Tim Wirth. The talks at the U.S. Trade Representative Office centered on the Japanese insurance market, one of three market sectors designated as priority areas in the Japan-U.S. framework negotiation process. Mid-level officials from the Japanese Finance Ministry and the U.S. Trade Representative Office are trying to put together a draft that incorporates both agreement and disagreement for further negotiation on a more senior level, Japanese sources said. Apart from the huge 300 billion dollar Japanese insurance market, the U.S. also wants to increase sales in the Japanese automobile market and hike its share of Japanese Government purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment. Under a schedule worked out between U.S. and Japanese officials, deputy ministers from the two countries will try to seek common ground in two more rounds of talks, the first set for January 25 to 26 in Washington and the other February 3 to 5 in Tokyo. So far, one chief difference is over the type of so-called "objective criteria" -- a requirement prescribed in the framework accord -- for assessing progress of import penetration in Japanese markets. Washington has insisted on using the level of imports in other group of seven industrial nations as "the norm" for Japan to follow. Japanese officials have called the U.S. position "unacceptable," saying such measures would amount to setting aside a specific market share for foreign goods and services. "In a market economy, the government has no such power," said a Japanese official who briefed reporters on the latest round of framework talks. Japanese officials also expressed dissatisfaction about a U.S. refusal to negotiate market access issues in the United States, particularly with respect to the U.S. insurance market. Japanese officials insisted that Tokyo has the right to raise such issues under terms of the framework accord. The agreement, reached last July between Clinton and then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, calls for "consultations...under the basic principle of two-way dialogue." "They say that is merely a promise to hold talks, to consult, but not to negotiate," said a Japanese official, who requested that he not be identified. "This is clearly sophistry," he said. Such rhetoric marked an escalation in the war of words between Japanese and U.S. Government bureaucrats involved in the tenuous trade negotiations between the two trading partners. Last week, Under Secretary of State Joan Spero called Japanese trade officials "quite rigid" and accused them of spreading "disinformation" on U.S. objectives regarding access to Japanese markets. Japanese officials have expressed dismay about what they view as a U.S. attempt to discredit Japanese bureaucrats. "We are clearly not happy about it, and we told them so," a Japanese official said.
