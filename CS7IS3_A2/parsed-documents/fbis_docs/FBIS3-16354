This programme of action, together with the theses of the party's detailed programme, was submitted on Tuesday for the consideration of a plenary meeting of the Communist Party's Central Executive Committee. Addressing the meeting with a report, party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov noted that all the previous hypothetical programmes just described the communists' intentions in case of their coming to power. In contrast to them, now the party should develop a plan of concrete actions. "We are to formulate our tasks exactly as an opposition force", Zyuganov added. The communist leader expounded on the principal ideas to form the basis of the proposed programme of action. Remaining in opposition to the political and economic course followed by the Russian president and government, the Communist Party plans to make its contribution to the process of achieving civic peace and accord. However, Zyuganov said, civic peace does not mean universal fraternization. Struggle between various social trends is inevitable, but it should not destroy the state, he stressed. To prevent this, a broad coalition should be formed. "The political spectrum of such a coalition may prove quite extensive and range from communists and socialists through nationalist patriotic movements to centrists and true democrats", the leader specified. Zyuganov recalled the conditions that the parliament's communist faction considers necessary to achieve civic peace. They provide for an immediate turnabout on the current social and economic line, formation of "a government of national confidence resting on parliamentary majority" (which "calls for removal from the government of such people as Kozyrev, Chubays and others"), immediate payoff of debts to peasants and of delayed wages to workers, urgent measures to fight corruption and organized crime, as well as "restoration of a renewed union state on a voluntary basis at Russia's initiative". According to the communist leader, the strategic goal at the current stage is to expand the opposition footing, to build on this basis a large-scale bloc of forces and to push it to power by parliamentary means. Early presidential elections (without Boris Yeltsin's participation) would be the best variant, Zyuganov believes. The party leader expressed regret over increasing political inertness in Russia and urged party members to prepare "quietly and pragmatically" for a new upsurge in social activities. The Communist Party's primary organizations, whose age and social composition "is not in line with the spirit of the times", should work for "rejuvenation of the party" and "stop stewing in their own juice". Zyuganov called to put into practice "the small steps theory": to set up standing election committees, to participate in public organizations, above all in trade-unions, to step up propaganda activities and so forth. The short-term programme of action is expected to be adopted at the Communist Party's conference in April, while the detailed strategic programme is to be passed at the 3rd party congress scheduled for this autumn.
