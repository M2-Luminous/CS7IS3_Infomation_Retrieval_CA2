He said that the Geneva Summit has placed the key in the lock but we must not be hasty and think that the doors have been opened. Speaker Birri met today with Chairman of the Editors Association Milhim Karam and the Association Council members. He called for maintaining the principles that were established at the beginning of the present regime. These are: national solidarity, first and foremost; solidarity with fraternal Syria; and adherence to UN Security Council Resolution 425. He said that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad has placed the ball in the Israeli court, but we must not be overly optimistic. He expressed the view that Israel will try to find a way to dodge the new U.S. position. After stressing the importance of internal solidarity, he maintained that the recent explosions and tension were done before the U.S.-Syrian summit to divert attention from the need to liberate the occupied border strip and to discuss ways to calm the situation. Regarding his holiness the pope's visit to Lebanon, Speaker Birri confirmed that this visit will take place and that all Lebanese will welcome his holiness the pope because it will benefit Lebanon and the Arabs.
