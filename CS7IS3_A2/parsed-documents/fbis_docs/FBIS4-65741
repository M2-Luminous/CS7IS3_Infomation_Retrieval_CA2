Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis stated that it is no longer certain that the UN secretary general's report will be circulated today or tomorrow, as expected. The protest was made by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis to Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative in Cyprus. The foreign minister also asked the UN official to explain whether Turkish press reports that the United Nations submitted a series of proposals to the Turkish Cypriot side during the deliberations in Vienna are true. The proposals reportedly satisfy many of the Turkish demands on implementing the confidence-building measures. Specifically, the Turkish press reports note that the United Nations and Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus, made the following proposals to the Turkish side: First, two separate customs departments should be established; second, there should be an equal number of flights for the two sides from the Nicosia Airport; third, the Greek Cypriots' access to Famagusta will be monitored by Turkish Cypriot policemen in civilian clothes; and fourth, within one year, before the operation of the Nicosia Airport, France, Germany, Canada, and Australia will accept the entry of Turkish Cypriot citizens using Turkish Cypriot passports. The press reports also note that Feissel accepted that access to Famagusta will be controlled by the Turkish side. Kasoulidhis repeated that the confidence-building measures process has ended, and that a Cyprus solution be promoted only through alternative methods. He also said that if the submission of the UN secretary general's report is delayed beyond Tuesday [24 May], it would mean that the actions of the pseudostate in convening the so-called council of ministers and the pseudostate itself receive consideration. The spokesman stressed that the 21 March document clearly refers to all the issues. He added that the elements noted in the Turkish Cypriot press are new.
