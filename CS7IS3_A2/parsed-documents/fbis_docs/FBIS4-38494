He has pointed out that on the whole, the direction of movement on the road of economic reform chosen by this package of documents is correct, but the "very execution of the edicts leaves much to be desired." "Politically, this is an attempt by the president to seize the initiative in the absence of such in the government. However, the content of the edicts raises big doubts as to the realism of the measures implied by them," G. Yavlinskiy stressed.
