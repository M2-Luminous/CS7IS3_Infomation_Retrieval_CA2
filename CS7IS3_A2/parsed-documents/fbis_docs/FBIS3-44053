The DP said in a statement that the increases were outrageous and asked the commission for administration to rescind the decision immediately. The DP spokesman on the public service, Mr. Roger Burrows, criticized what he called the secretive manner in which the increases had been handled. Earlier at a conference on the reconstruction of the country the ANC decided to ask that the increases be frozen, and that the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] investigate the matter. The minister in charge of the public service, Mr. Sam de Beer, says that only 1.5 percent of the 850 million rands made available in May last year for salary increases was set aside for senior officials. He said about 35 percent of the money had been earmarked for lower qualified public servants. Mr. de Beer said he would comment further on the issue at a news conference on Thursday [27 Thrusday].
