Gavrileva; place and date not given: "Rossiya Will Not Depart From Its Program"] [Text] Quite a pile of material, in which people ask to one extent or another what has happened to the Rossiya bloc, why has it become virtually in opposition to the president, and much else, has accumulated at the newspaper recently. We put these questions to Sergey Nikulin, Rossiya faction chairman. [Gavrileva] So what has happened to the Rossiya bloc since the elections? People say that it has ceased to exist.... [Nikulin] Truly, the bloc did end its existence simultaneously with the conclusion of the elections to the Supreme Soviet--this is legally unexceptionable and should not be a cause for any concern. But the bloc's traditions and continuity have been preserved in the Rossiya faction, which has absorbed almost all the supporters of this election bloc--more than 40 persons; they are united by its program. Please recall that it is based on the program of the Crimea Republican Party, (Crimea republican movement), the party that secured election victory for the president and deputies of the Supreme Soviet. [Gavrileva] But, at a news conference the Respublika faction declared that you had departed somewhat from the joint election program and, how to put this as gently as possible, that you observe somewhat different moral principles.... [Nikulin] As far as the program is concerned, let anyone find even one insignificant clause in which this has been manifested. For example, we spoke to our electorate about the restoration of the constitution of 6 May, it was done, it was restored. We spoke about the protection of Crimean conscripts--it was done, the law on the service of Crimeans in Crimea--it was adopted. We spoke about privileges for needy families--a decree on the cancellation of VAT on children's passes was adopted. I could continue.... [Gavrileva] Enough for the time being, time is clearly short.... [Nikulin] As far as moral principles are concerned.... It is sufficient to hear how representatives of the Respublika faction behave at plenary meetings--they have not submitted a single constructive proposal, everything is geared to destructiveness according to the principle of the worse, the better. I, truly, cannot recall a serviceable proposal coming from this group. [Gavrileva] Please explain, if possible, the faction's position in regard to parliament's relationship with the president's team. [Nikulin] Let us begin with the fact that the contradictions between the president's team and the Supreme Soviet are clearly exaggerated--there are certain forces in Crimea and outside that are endeavoring to split the two branches of power--this is really in vogue, note, and not only here in Crimea. An attempt was made to accuse the leaders of the Rossiya faction and the Republican Party of an endeavor to push through "their" people into government. For heaven's sake, the Republican Party is the victorious party, and throughout the civilized world it is the victorious parties that form the government. It was assumed that this was how it would be with us also. This is a normal process. We have a fine team and the most experienced and professional specialists of all sectors of the economy. The list by which Mr. Saburov and MESHCHANSKAYA GAZETA attempted to put us to shame was prepared by us at the behest of the president of the Republic of Crimea and Sergey Pavlovich Tsekov (at that time still simply leader of the party) and at the request of V. Minin, leader of the Office for Public Administration. So these are not "our" people, if by this is implied people selected according to the principle of nepotism and family relationships, but the people of the president of the Republic of Crimea, who secured his dazzling victory at the presidential elections and who are recognized specialists in their fields. We should be speaking today, rather, about the others being appointed as a counterweight to our proposals and according to the principles mentioned above, what is more. Nonetheless, I have complete confidence that the government will treat our recommendations correctly because we have already shown our competency in the building of the statehood of the Republic of Crimea. But I see nothing extraordinary in the events connected with the situation surrounding the government: The normal mutual adaptation of two branches of power only just recognized and supported by the people is taking place. And inappropriate emotions should not be added to this. [Gavrileva] Sergey Vladimirovich, what can you say about the fact that both in our editorial mail and in telegrams to the Supreme Soviet your faction virtually is being accused of betrayal of the president? [Nikulin] Moreover, we are being accused of having been elected to the Supreme Soviet on an oath of loyalty to the president and of not fulfilling it! But let us take these things in order. We have supported the president in all his undertakings, except for his being granted decree-issuing authority: We believe that it is necessary to operate not from the position of a state of emergency but on the basis of a profoundly calibrated and practicable plan. It was this plan that we wanted to hear from Vice Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov and his ministers. It is not our fault (or misfortune) but theirs that they were unable to present it to the Supreme Soviet, and this is why additional time for the conclusive formulation of their intention was determined. Nonetheless, those whom the president has proposed have been appointed ministers, and as quickly as possible, what is more. And apropos the "oath of loyalty" I will say that the same "oath" was given by the president of the Republican Party to the Rossiya bloc--this oath being the actual program of the bloc, which both we and the president intend to fulfill.
