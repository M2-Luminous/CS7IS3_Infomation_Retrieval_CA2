Theuretsbacher, P. Grolig, and E. Bieber: "Witnesses: State Police Official Was Guest in Villa of Intelligence Chief Wolf"] [Excerpt] "People will be surprised how many are involved in the affair," an insider hinted to KURIER, suggesting a widening of the affair surrounding the state police official Gustav Hochenbichler. A former agent for the East is still in office -- within the state police. "He is much more important, has good contacts, and knows a great deal about explosive state affairs," the insider claimed. As reported yesterday, the 56-year-old police official, who is seriously ill, is suspected of having worked for an eastern intelligence service for many years. Two former Stasi members who were interrogated by the Vienna provincial court on Wednesday [12 January] claim that the senior police official was a former Stasi agent. The two men think they remember that Hochenbichler was even received by East German intelligence chief Markus Wolf, 70, at his villa. The police official was confronted on Friday by the two former agents who should recognize him in person, not only in photographs. The court has not disclosed any information about the result. The suspect disappeared from public view after the court interrogation. It was not possible to contact him at home or with his relatives in Lower Austria. The court believes that, as head of the Vienna state police office, Hochenbichler passed on former German Democratic Republic [GDR] refugee data. At the time, the Austrian state police questioned every East German refugee who was registered in Austria. Hochenbichler may also have been attractive for an eastern secret service because of his activities in embassies. The police official had numerous contacts with diplomats and often visited foreign missions. He was also responsible for ensuring the safety of official visitors to Vienna. Former Stasi members mentioned a "dead letter box" through which the contact in Vienna allegedly passed on his information. This hiding place was reportedly located in a tube near Hochenbichler's home. When the investigators checked the place, they actually discovered a serviceable system of tubes that led into the basement. Hochenbichler denies all accusations -- just as he did two years ago when allegations surfaced for the first time. Then, he assured his closest aides that these were all lies. As a result of the rumors, he was not promoted to head the Vienna state police when that spot became vacant. [passage omitted]
