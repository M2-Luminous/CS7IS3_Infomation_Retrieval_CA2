[passage omitted] The call confirmed that Aden and every inch of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which he imagined in his sick dreams he would control, were beyond him. The call said that it was time to get rid of this bloody regime, whose hands had been smeared by blood since he took control of the northern governorates. It appealed to the sons of our Yemeni people to assume their patriotic duties to destroy this malignant microbe, which had corrupted many aspects of life in all parts of the coutnry. The call confirmed that the Sanaa regime was approaching its end and was facing its last hours. It called on citizens to cut off supplies to its forces, because they had become tired and exhausted, and because the regime had failed to achieve its promises to them that they would be in Aden within two days.
