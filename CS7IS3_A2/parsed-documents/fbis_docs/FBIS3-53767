The plan for the first time sets goals for the ministry's units and Israel's representations abroad. The most prominent political goal is the establishment of full relations between Israel and Muslim countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and Pakistan -- in Asia; Tanzania, Senegal, and Djibouti -- in Africa; and the North African and Gulf countries of the Middle East. The Foreign Ministry aspires to establish normalization and economic relations even before full diplomatic relations are established. Political sources have said that it is important that ties with the large Muslim countries be established before negotiations on the future of Jerusalem start. Progress in establishing ties with the Muslim and regional countries will depend on progress on and the implementation of the agreement with the PLO and the peace negotiations on the other tracks. The plan sets two economic goals for the Foreign Ministry: Reducing trade deficit between Israel and the European countries, and fortifying the spread of Israeli economic representatives around the world, with a focus on East Asia. Negotiations on drafting the new agreement between Israel and the EC will begin next month, according to the mandate the EC Council issued in December. The plan urges increasing the incorporation of the private sector in economic activity abroad, and calls on Israel's representatives abroad to assist in the establishment of ties between Israeli and foreign businessmen to give trade a boost.
