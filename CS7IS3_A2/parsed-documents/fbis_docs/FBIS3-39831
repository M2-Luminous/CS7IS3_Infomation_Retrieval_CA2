In particular he put forward as a vital precondition that the majority vote should not be weakened and that Community achievements should be fully respected. In return, the Twelve may grant a transitional period in the most sensitive spheres, namely agriculture and fishing. In general, he thinks that French enterprises should derive a commercial advantage from it. [LES ECHOS] Four countries are trying to complete their negotiations on EU membership before 1 March. What importance do these new partners have for France? [Lamassoure] Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway are democratic and highly developed countries with which we have numerous historical, political, economic, and cultural ties. That is why we want them to be capable of joining us. In addition, these countries represent significant potential outlets for our enterprises, which have hitherto not been sufficiently investigated. In 1992, France's trade deficit with these four countries was 27 billion francs [Fr], with a total of Fr40 billion in exports but Fr67 billion in imports. By means of these new memberships, we hope to see our foreign trade with them balanced (the Norwegian case is special because of our purchases of hydrocarbons), as was the case with Spain and Portugal when they joined the Community. [LES ECHOS] Would it also be an opportunity for European building as a whole? [Lamassoure] These countries have economic, cultural, and political traditions which are sometimes different from ours: so much the better! France has never thought that Europe should be a uniform entity. Europe's originality lies in its variety. But on one condition: We want the candidate countries, whichever they are -- Austria and the Nordic countries today, Central and Eastern Europe in the future -- to accept not only the spirit and letter of the European institutions but also their ultimate aim. For us, Europe is not only a market, it is an economic power, a political edifice. From this viewpoint, we are satisfied with the agreement already reached with the four candidates on the "foreign and security policy" chapter which we thought would be the most difficult. However, they have all agreed to adapt their legislation to the requirements of the foreign and security policy. Having said that, expansion is not an end in itself for the EU. It does not have a hegemonistic vocation. We will not measure its success by its final geographical dimension. Membership is a prospect offered to the European countries currently outside the EU. It is for them to know whether they wish to join us and, to that end, whether they are ready to accept the rules of the European "club." [LES ECHOS] This means that the countries currently negotiating with Brussels must make major concessions compared with their initial demands. [Lamassoure] They must accept the rules of the game which we have set for ourselves in all spheres. What is called the Community achievements. I am thinking in particular of everything relating to equal conditions of competition, the agricultural price policy, fishing, and the funding of the European budget. On these points we can accept transitional provisions but no permanent exemptions under any circumstances. [LES ECHOS] Are there other essential conditions for France to ratify this membership treaty? [Lamassoure] For us, these negotiations must result in progress for Europe, not in a questioning of the achievements, or a threat to our future decisionmaking system. Let us take agriculture: With our 11 partners, we want to see all the candidate countries applying the European agricultural prices from the first year. However, they will have the opportunity, during a transitional period, to pay their farmers national income support to compensate for the necessary price cuts in Austria, Finland, and Norway. These countries have agricultural prices which are much higher than the European prices. As for the implementation of compensatory amounts to rebalance the prices at the borders, the statistics currently available show that this solution would be too costly for the Community budget: ECU1.5 billion over five years for the three countries concerned, of which 156 million would be paid in the first year. However, all three have a per capita income that is markedly higher than the Community average, and does not justify such a contribution from the Community budget. [LES ECHOS] The candidate countries may also be counting on regional aid, knowing that the least wealthy regions are precisely those in which agriculture is less competitive. [Lamassoure] Absolutely. Alongside the common agricultural system which we have just discussed, the new members will be able to benefit from the European regulations on aid to underprivileged regions, which consists of a mixture of national and Community aid based on existing criteria. This approach will make it possible to support the Austrian Burgenland and a large part of the arctic regions. [LES ECHOS] Do other issues specific to particular countries also present a problem? [Lamassoure] Fishing is one of them. Norway wanted there to be two "blue Europes" -- ours and its own. There can obviously only be one. The EU is a single market, meaning the pooling of resources. Although, here too, we can accept a transitional period. On the other hand, we certainly have lessons to learn, in France and in Europe, from the Norwegian fishing policy, especially with regard to the stringency of their management of resources and the organization of the producers. There is also a problem with regard to road transport in Austria. But France is less concerned than others because French transporters are only involved in 0.7 percent of truck traffic between Germany and Italy. Our concern, in this case too, is to reach a common market rationale as quickly as possible and to get rid of the bilateral systems which limit relations between France and Austria. [LES ECHOS] Does France share the positions of its 11 partners on all these points under negotiation? [Lamassoure] I think I can say that there is a great similarity of views among the Twelve. We have had no problem in drawing up joint positions. And with regard to the Commission, we will be very vigilant, as we were during the GATT negotiations. [LES ECHOS] In all, are you optimistic about the chances of reaching agreement with the four candidate countries by 1 March? [Lamassoure] Like most of my colleagues, I think that we have a 50 percent chance of reaching agreement by the deadline. It depends on the candidate countries. [LES ECHOS] Will increasing from 12 to 16 change the EU's identity? [Lamassoure] Yes, I am convinced of it. This quantitative change will also correspond to a qualitative threshold, without the identity of the four new countries being in question. In this case, going from 12 to 16 means crossing a threshold. We have been clearly aware of that since there have been 16 of us around one table during foreign policy cooperation exercises. That is why this change within the EU must lead us to rapidly adapt the Community institutions. We are determined that this expansion should not be carried out to the detriment of the EU's efficiency and especially its decisionmaking system. We have spent years negotiating among ourselves, with 10 members and then 12, the establishment of an effective system, with a qualified majority vote within the Council of Ministers. We can therefore only accept an expansion if the weighting of the blocking minority within the Council of Ministers increases arithmetically. In other words, if the four countries join at the same time, it must go from 23 votes (out of a total of 76) to 27 votes (out of 90). That is a vital precondition. Omitting it would amount to blocking the European decisionmaking mechanism. We are currently divided from our British and Spanish friends on this point. The present French Government even wanted more major reforms to be carried out at the same time as the membership negotiations. We said that in particular at the European Council meeting in Brussels on 29 October. The majority of our partners thought otherwise, preferring that these discussions should take place at the time stipulated by the Maastricht Treaty -- in 1996. The countries which are now candidates, if they have meanwhile become EU members, will therefore participate with us in the 1996 institutional exercise. [LES ECHOS] That would not make it impossible to start thinking about possible reforms within a working group. [Lamassoure] We are not really in favor of that, because the reform has been postponed. The idea of a committee of wisemen does not displease us. I think I was among the first to discuss it a few months ago. But starting a major debate now without being able to complete it would only complicate matters, both in the candidate countries, whose populations will vote in a referendum, and within the Twelve, where the June European election campaign is due to start. [LES ECHOS] In the absence of current thinking by the Twelve, is there already a French position, particularly within the government coalition? [Lamassoure] We must await the political parties' platforms for the June elections. With regard to the majority, I note that there are broad areas of agreement between the UDF [Union for French Democracy] and RPR [Rally for the Republic]. The working group which brings together the leaderships of the two parties should produce a joint document fairly soon. But before changing the institutions, the important thing is to adapt our Community administration method to the new responsibilities which the Maastricht Treaty gives us: currency, foreign policy, internal affairs, and justice. With regard to the currency, we have an accurately defined administration system which is centered on the European Monetary Institute. On the other hand, with regard to foreign policy, internal affairs, and justice, the treaty only put forward the principle of European competence and the qualified majority decisionmaking method for what are called "common actions." It does not stipulate the preparation of the decision or its funding. So, it is as if we were pretending to have a common foreign policy with 12 ministers and no ministry! There is no body around the Council table capable of evaluating a foreign policy option, of defining the common interest which is never the sum of the individual interests, and then ensuring the implementation of the decision made. Similarly there is the question of funding this foreign policy. At present there is only one example: We have decided on a humanitarian program to help Bosnia, worth ECU48 million, on a half-Community, half-national basis. But this case is not a precedent. We do not yet have a joint position of principle. [LES ECHOS] Do these unresolved problems cast doubt on expansion to Eastern Europe? [Lamassoure] We need to solve them, with or without expansion. With regard to the eastern part of the continent, France thinks that the definition of relations with Central and Eastern Europe is a fundamental point on which it wants to make progress during its term as EU president (in the first half of 1995). There is an urgent need: Hungary will make a formal application for membership. We have so far told these countries that they have a vocation to join us, but without specifying the conditions, the methods, or a timetable. We are proposing to draw up criteria which will make it possible to assess the convergence of the economies and societies of those countries with ours. Specifying that all the Central and East European countries must be put on an equal footing. We are to have a discussion at France's request at the European Council of Ministers meeting on 7 and 8 March.
