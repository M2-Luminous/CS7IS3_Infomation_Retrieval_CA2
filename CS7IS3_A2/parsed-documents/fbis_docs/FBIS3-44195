Addressing a conference on radio broadcasting in Johannesburg, he said the imminent deregulation of the industry would mean a loss of income for the SABC, as many new broadcasters would enter the advertising market. [passage omitted] The chairman of the National Association of Broadcasters, Mr. Stan Katz, told the conference that the Independent Broadcast Authority would probably be established towards the end of March. He said permanent licenses for new broadcasters would be granted in about six to eight months from now. Mr. Katz said he did not believe that private broadcasters were needed before the April election to ensure adequate voter education and coverage of political events.
