Delivering the inaugural address General Bilal said the symposium is the outcome of positive cooperation between anti-narcotics authorities in the kingdom and France. He praised the efforts exerted by the Saudi Government to provide security and stability for both citizens and residents. He reviewed agreements signed by the kingdom in the field of combating narcotics and stressed that Saudi Arabia has enacted several extremely deterrent regulations to curb drug smuggling or trafficking. He said the kingdom has also gone a long way in international and regional cooperation to combat narcotics. The acting director of the anti-narcotics department and supervisor of the symposium Brigadier General Darwish Bin Ibrahim Faqiha [spelling as received] said the symposium was held in line with the directives of Interior Minister Prince Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz who is extremely keen on fighting narcotics in the Arab world in general and the kingdom in particular. He said the kingdom exerts intensive efforts to combat narcotics on the basis of a number of concepts foremost among which is the commitment to Islam and original Arab traditions. He said the kingdom is among the least affected countries by the narcotics problem because of the Saudi Government's keeness on the security and safety of the citizens and the homeland. He stressed that the kingdom has never had one incident of growing, producing or making illegal drugs of any kind and that the death penalty has been applied to deter drug traffickers, smugglers and carriers. He added that out of his conviction that drug addicts are sick persons who need medical and psychological treatment, Prince Nayif has ordered that addicts be treated as such and three specialized hospitals have been established for this purpose in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam. He said the anti-narcotics department, in collaboration with the national anti-narcotics committee chaired by the President of Youth Welfare Prince Faysal Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, implements a comprehensive strategy on preventive awareness against illegal drug abuse. The head of the French central anti-narcotics bureau delivered a speech in which he pointed to the importance of Saudi-French anti-narcotics cooperation and expressed hope that this cooperation would continue. Saudi and French officials and experts are participating in the four-day symposium. The inaugural session was attended by the French ambassador to the kingdom and several Saudi officials.
