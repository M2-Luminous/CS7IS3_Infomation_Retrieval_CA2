In those countries where U.S. notarizing officers are not permitted to take testimony (see §92.55(c)) and where depositions must be taken before a foreign authority, letters rogatory are usually issued to a foreign court. * * * * * (d) Transmission of commissions to foreign officials or other persons. A commission to take depositions which is addressed to an official or person in a foreign country other than a United States notarizing officer may be sent directly to the person designated. However, if such a Commission is sent to the United States diplomatic mission in the country where the depositions are intended to be taken, it should be forwarded to the Foreign Office for transmission to the person appointed in the commission. If sent to a United States consular office, the commission may be forwarded by that office direct to the person designated, or, if the notarial officer deems it more advisable to do so, he may send the commission to the United States diplomatic mission for transmission through the medium of the foreign office. §§92.3, 92.8, 92.9, 91.10, 92.11, 92.12, 92.15, 92.17, 92.23, 92.24, 92.27, 92.29, 92.31, 92.32, 92.33, 92.35, 92.56, 92.57, 92.58, 92.60, 92.61, 92.62, and 92.64 [Amended] 13.
