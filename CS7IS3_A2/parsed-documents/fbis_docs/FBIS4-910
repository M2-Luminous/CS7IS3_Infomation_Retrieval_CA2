Speaking one day after his return from a visit to Paris, which lasted more than one month, the chairman of the opposition's High Council of Resistance [HCR] said that "if we must resort to demonstrations to express our point of view, we will do so." "Demonstrations and rallies are part of the HCR's program, and no one can ask us to halt them. We will not allow anyone to annihilate us and we will continue to act democratically. We avoid violence and we will not take up arms," Father Abessole added. The opposition leader also made "an urgent appeal to the government for the immediate release of those arrested in February" during unrest in Libreville. According to Father Abessole, "at least 80" supporters of his party, the National Lumberjacks Rally [RNB], were arrested. The government has blamed the opposition leader and his party for the violence which resulted in nine deaths, according to official figures, which also reported that 77 people were arrested, although some were released immediately. Meanwhile, HCR Deputy Chairman Pierre Louis Agondjo-Okawe stated that the negotiations with the government to defuse the crisis that emerged after President Omar Bongo's reelection in December 1993, which was rejected by the opposition, "have not started yet." According to the HCR, the negotiations depend on the revision of the electoral code, because "if a true law-abiding state is not established, we will no longer participate in elections," Agondjo- Okawe added. He rejected the government's scheduling of local elections for August because the date "was not negotiated."
