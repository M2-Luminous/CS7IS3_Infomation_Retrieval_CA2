Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to tell this to ROK President Kim Yong-sam, who is scheduled to visit Japan beginning 24 March. Japan is not a nonpermanent member of the UNSC at present, but it will become eligible for membership in 1995. However, with regard to being a nonpermanent member, which strongly implies being a regional representative, the government has decided to turn over the right to represent Asia to the ROK and to concentrate on winning permanent membership for itself. There are 10 nonpermanent member states of the UNSC. They differ from the five permanent member states (the United States, Great Britain, France, Russia, and China) in that they do not possess veto rights, but they can always participate in the UNSC deliberations. The term for nonpermanent members is two years, and half of the members are elected every year. Together with Pakistan, Japan served as the representative of Asia until last December. It has so far been said within the government that "at a time when Japan is intending to apply for permanent membership, this will be a serious blow because Japan will not be able to obtain sufficient information" (as stated by a Foreign Ministry source). Based on this viewpoint, it has been said that to maintain contacts with the UNSC, Japan should try to remain on the UNSC as a nonpermanent member for as long as possible and until a definite decision has been made on its becoming a permanent member. On the other hand, it has also been said that because Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at last year's UN General Assembly session "indicated Japan's intention to become a permanent member rather than insisting for some reasons [not further specified] on serving as a nonpermanent member, Japan should concentrate its efforts on seeking permanent membership" (as stated by a Foreign Ministry source). Under such circumstances, when ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu visited Japan last September, he disclosed the ROK's intention to apply for nonpermanent membership on the UNSC and and sought Japan's support in this. In this connection, the decision has been made based on the assessment that it would be better to win Asian nations' understanding, which is indispensable to Japan's winning permanent membership, by supporting the ROK's position.
