ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby adopts regulations for specific crop provisions to insure cotton. These provisions will supplement the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8) which contains standard terms and conditions common to most crops. The intended effect of this rule is to move specific crop provisions for insuring cotton from the General Crop Insurance Policy (ยง401.8) to the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8) for ease of use by the public and conformance among policy terms. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mari L. Dunleavy, Regulatory and Procedural Development, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, telephone (202) 254&hyph;8314. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1. This action constitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is March 1, 1999. This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .), the information collection or record-keeping requirements included in this rule are found in 7 CFR part 400, subpart H. It has been determined under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. The policies and procedures contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. This action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amount of work required of the insurance companies delivering these policies will not increase from the amount required to deliver previous policies. Therefore, this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared. This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450. This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
