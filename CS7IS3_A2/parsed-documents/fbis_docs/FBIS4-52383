DEC, the highest-level trade consultative body to fine-tune two countries'views, is now destined to discontinue under the circumstances in which innumerable trade issues pending between the two countries--such as the lowering of tariffs on foreign cars and the protection of intellectual property rights--are brought up. As a result, trade friction between the ROK and the United States will further deepen. On 8 May, a person in authority at the government said: "DEC was established last year with a view to systematically dealing with pending economic and trade issues between the ROK and the United States, treating it as a matter of policy. But, because the United States has been making an item-by-item approach to pending trade issues, DEC is in fact becoming good for nothing. In this respect, the government is seriously considering whether to discontinue DEC." He continued: "The United States, too, is now making clear that DEC is unnecessary unless major pending trade issues, including intellectual property rights and the lowering of tariffs on sausages and foreign cars, are resolved. Therefore, it is predicted that DEC will virtually discontinue at the end of this June." Presently, in addition to DEC, there are other consultative bodies between the ROK and the United States such as the ROK-U.S. Economic Consultative Meeting and the ROK-U.S. Trade Working-Level Committee.
