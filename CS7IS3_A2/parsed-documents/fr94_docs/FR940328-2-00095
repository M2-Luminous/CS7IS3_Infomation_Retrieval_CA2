FR940328-2-00095 FR940328-2-00053 8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends, and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report to the applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that the methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that the calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon this review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Experts with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request for these work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in its initial report referred to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. The applicants will take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports. 10. The prospectuses of the Funds, if such is the case, will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another class in the Fund. 11. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to those standards. 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors of the Funds with respect to the multi-class arrangement will be set forth in guidelines that will be furnished to the directors. 13. Each Fund will disclose in its prospectus the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, CDSCs, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to the classes of shares of the Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares of such Fund. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value or public offering price will separately present this information for each class of shares. 14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.
