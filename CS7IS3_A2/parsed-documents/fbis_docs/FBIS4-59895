REUTERS quoting Shaqaqi had earlier reported that the Islamic Jihad Movement was considering a new strategy to prove that it was a political movement, and that it was ready to cooperate with the Palestinian police to enforce the Gaza-Jericho deal. The movement in a statement published Tuesday, reiterated its commitment to its strategy of confronting the Zionist regime, and said "this policy is definite and unalterable." It said that struggle is a legal, historical and religious right for the Palestinian people that can by no means be ignored. The movement would encounter the Zionist aggressors any time and anywhere, it stressed. Fathi Shaqaqi had told the daily that "the movement would do its best to avoid clashes with Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho even though this might make us change some of our tactics." Shaqaqi had continued by saying that the principled stance of the movement was based on rejecting and disgracing the Gaza-Jericho compromise deal, and opposing any measure which would likely legitimize the occupation of each and every part of Palestine.
