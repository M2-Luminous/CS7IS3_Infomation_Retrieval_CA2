FR940125-1-00002 FR940125-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;200&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model 4101 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. This proposal would require a visual inspection of an area beneath the flooring for foreign objects and debris, removal of any foreign object or debris found, and installation of a protective guard on the rear cabin attendant seat. This proposal would also require a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance program to include repetitive visual inspections of the area above the protective guard for foreign objects and debris, and removal of any foreign object or debris found. This proposal is prompted by reports that foreign objects and debris have been found in the area around the elevator and rudder trim cables below the floor. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent foreign objects and debris from lodging in the control circuits and jamming the elevator and rudder trim systems. DATES: Comments must be received by March 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;200&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft, Inc., P.O. Box 16029, Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC 20041&hyph;6029. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington.

Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;200&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received reports that foreign objects and debris (in these cases, forks and crushed soft drink cans) have been found in the area around the elevator and rudder trim cables below the floor. The foreign objects and debris passed through a vent via a gap between the cushion and back of the rear cabin attendant seat. These foreign objects and debris can lodge in the elevator and rudder trim control circuits. This condition, if not corrected, could result in jamming of the elevator and rudder trim systems. Jetstream has issued Series 4100 Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A25&hyph;034, Revision 1, dated October 30, 1993, that describes procedures for a visual inspection of an area beneath the flooring for foreign objects and debris, and removal of any foreign object or debris found. The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for installation of a protective guard on the rear cabin attendant seat. Installation of this guard will prevent any foreign object or debris from passing through the floor vent. In addition, the alert service bulletin describes procedures for revising regularly scheduled maintenance procedures to include repetitive visual inspections of the area above the protective guard for foreign objects and debris, and removal of any foreign object or debris found. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directive 003&hyph;10&hyph;93 in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.
