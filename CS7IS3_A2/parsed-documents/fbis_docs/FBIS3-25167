Ntaryamira kept a promise to draw his government from both his own party the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) and the main opposition Party of Unity and National Progress (UPRONA), a government source said. The source said that the 60 percent of government seats would go to the FRODEBU and the rest would be made up of the UPRONA. Ntaryamira, a member of the majority Hutu tribe, was elected president after the murder of former president Melchior Ndadaye, the country's first Hutu leader. His murder in a failed coup bid on October 21 unleashed a tide of tribal violence between the Hutu and Tusi tribes, which left an estimated 100,000 people dead and caused another 700,000 to flee.
