The most important of the documents to be signed is the heads of governments' memorandum of mutual understanding on questions of ensuring the functioning of the Baykonur space center. As Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin explained in conversation with your correspondent, the governments have been able to agree on the main principle: Russia will use the space center under lease from Kazakhstan. This principle also extends to the military test sites located on Kazakh territory. Russian specialists and military contingents will be based there and equipment will be deployed there. Russian law will apply at the leased installations, apparently side by side with Kazakhstani law. Chernomyrdin stressed that the principle is reciprocal: Kazakhstan may maintain its military installations in Russia on the same terms. The actual conditions of the lease -- the scale of payment and the term -- have not been decided yet, but Shokhin has noted that in his view the optimum lease on Baykonur would run for 99 years. Answering a question from your IZVESTIYA correspondent, Chernomyrdin said that work to ensure the functioning of Baykonur could begin "right away" without waiting for the signing of the concretizing documents, which is due to take place in January. The situation which has developed at the space center as a result of the uncertainty over its status has now led to extreme consequences. This unique complex, which belongs not only to Kazakhstan and Russia but also to all mankind, is in a very sorry state. Some of the launch installations have become unfit for use [okazalis razmorozhennymi], some of the equipment has been put out of commission, while some has simply been stolen. The settlement of the question of ownership is no less important for other military sites too. A completely paradoxical situation, according to Shokhin, has developed with regard to the strategic nuclear weapon basing zones: Ballistic missiles which have been declared the property of Kazakhstan continue to be serviced by the Russian military! However, such a situation with regard to nuclear weapons is not just nonsensical, it is downright dangerous. In Shokhin's words, the question of the ownership of the uranium component of the nuclear missiles stationed in Kazakhstan and subject to dismantling was also discussed. It is proposed that Russia will take part in the actual process of dismantling. In addition, the reprocessing of the highly enriched "military" uranium will also be carried out in Russia because only Russia has the necessary technologies.
