FR941107-2-00006 FR941107-2-00003 2. Assignment of Non-Nodal Counties to Nodes Of the nation's 3,141 counties, 836 counties are in metropolitan nodes and 38 counties are nonmetropolitan nodes. Each of the remaining 2,267 non-nodal counties is analyzed to determine the node to which it is most closely related. The initial assignment of about 75 percent of the non-nodal counties is based on journey-to-work data from the 1990 Census of Population. These counties are assigned to nodes based on their largest county-to-county commuting flows. In many instances, the association between a county and a particular node is based, not on direct commuting ties to a nodal county, but on commuting ties to a non-nodal county that is tied to the node. The initial assignment of most of the other non-nodal counties is based on newspaper circulation data. These counties are assigned to nodes based on the locations of the regional newspapers that are most widely read in these counties. In all cases, contiguity of a non-nodal county to a node or to another non-nodal county already assigned to the node is required before the initial assignment is made. The initial assignment of a few of the non-nodal counties requires special procedures. These usually apply in counties with very small populations or unusual contiguity problems. The initial assignments of non-nodal counties are based on the strongest county-to-county relationships; these need not reflect the strongest county-to-CEA relationships. Following the initial definitions of the CEA's, 373 counties are reassigned to ensure that, to the extent possible, each county is assigned to the CEA with which it has the strongest commuting ties. (Six counties do not meet this objective because they are not contiguous with the CEA's to which they have the most commuting.) 3. Aggregation to Economic Areas The 348 CEA's are used as building blocks for the proposed 174 BEA economic areas. CEA's are aggregated so that (1) as far as possible, the labor force of each resulting economic area works and resides in that area and (2) each resulting economic area is large enough economically to be part of BEA's local-area economic projections program. In general, aggregation to economic areas has two parts. In the first part, the 59 CEA's with PMSA's as nodes are combined into 17 economic areas corresponding to the 17 consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (CMSA's) that comprise the PMSA's. (A CMSA is an MSA that has more than 1 million residents and is subdivided into two or more PMSA's.) In the second part of the aggregation, each of 141 CEA's that do not meet size and commuting criteria is combined with the CEA to which it has the most commuting. Part III: Map and List of the Proposed 174 BEA Economic Areas Codes from 1 to 174 are assigned to the proposed economic areas in approximate geographic order, beginning with 1 in northern Maine, continuing south to Florida, then north to the Great Lakes, and continuing in a serpentine pattern to the West Coast. With the exception of three special-node areas (Alaskan Panhandle, Western Oklahoma, and Northern Michigan), each economic area is named for the node of its largest CEA. The following list provides economic-area codes and names. Economic-area boundaries and codes are shown on the map following the list.
