FR940822-2-00036 FR940822-2-00024 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;362&hyph;000] Black Marlin Pipeline Co.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff August 16, 1994. Take notice that on August 12, 1994, Black Marlin Pipeline Company (Black Marlin) tendered for filing to become part of Black Marlin's FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, proposed to be effective September 1, 1994: First Revised Sheet No. 314 Black Marlin states that in conjunction with its implementation of Order 636 and in compliance with the Commission's order dated October 14, 1993, in Docket No. RS92&hyph;56&hyph;002, Black Marlin filed its form of Electronic Bulletin Board Subscriber Agreement (Subscriber Agreement) to become part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1. Paragraph 3 of the Subscriber Agreement provides that EBB Customers will reimburse Black Marlin $135.61 plus applicable taxes for licensing charges Black Marlin incurs to provide service. The licensing fees incurred by Black Marlin for new customers have risen to $157.42 plus applicable taxes and will continue to change periodically. Black Marlin states that it is filing herein to remove the fixed dollar amount from the form of Subscriber Agreement in its tariff. Black Marlin states that it will continue to charge new EBB Customers only the actual charges incurred by Black Marlin on their behalf, with no administrative or handling fees or other forms of consideration. The change proposed herein will eliminate the need for a tariff filing each time the licensing fees are changed. Black Marlin requests that the Commission grant any and all waivers of its rules, regulations, and orders as may be necessary, specifically (but not limited to) Section 154.22 of the Commission's Regulations, so as to permit the tariff sheets submitted herewith to become effective September f1, 1994. Black Marlin further states that copies of the filing have been mailed to each of its customers affected by this filing and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before August 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
