Their talks concerned primarily aspects of human and civic rights of individuals and national communities, the ratification of the Slovak Republic's agreement on association with the European Union [EU] by the parliaments of EU member states, and the Partnership for Peace project. [passage omitted] At a briefing held after the meeting, Miguel Angel Martinez reiterated his conviction that Slovakia is a country respecting the freedom of citizens and their right of assembly. The Komarno rally [of representatives of the Hungarian minority on 8 January 1994] is a proof of this. Ivan Gasparovic stressed the fact that M.A. Martinez had declared his visit as a working trip to one of the member countries of the Council of Europe and not as an inspection. The highest representative of the National Council of the Slovak Republic briefed his guest about the territorial and administrative division of Slovakia currently under preparation and about Slovakia's rejection of the [Hungarian minority representatives'] project of the country's division on the basis of the ethnic principle. He also spoke with him about planned legislation addressing the issue of designating the names of communities in the language of ethnic minorities and the writing of their names and surnames. The president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe showed understanding for this approach. [passage omitted] Later in the evening, at the end of the first day of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly delegation's stay in Slovakia, Miguel Angel Martinez was received by Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.
