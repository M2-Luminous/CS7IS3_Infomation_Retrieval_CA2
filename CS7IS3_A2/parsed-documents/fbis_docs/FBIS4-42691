The aimlessness of the European Union (EU) strikes the citizen in the face like a tasteless striptease. [Van Miert] Here are two examples. In Germany and elsewhere, there are those who fervently advocate the rapid integration of a number of central European countries, i.e., enlargement as the certificate of good European behavior. Nobody is warning about the dramatic consequences this will have for the countries joining. We have obviously not learned from the unexpected integration of East Germany. Enlargement means that the new member states will be entitled to get money from the EU budgets. The amount of the regional and structural funds must be increased immediately. That presupposes doubling the European budget. Germany set the ball rolling for a rapid accession of the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia. Yet it is aiming to slim down its own contribution. So we are faced with a flagrant contradiction which creates a tremendous amount of conflict. [Camps] Europe is threatening to sink beneath its own foundations. [Van Miert] The EU institutional organization can clearly digest the enlargement from 12 to 16 member states. With the accession of a number of central European countries, however, the administrative apparatus is backed into a tight corner. And that is not all. The Greeks, British, and Spaniards are now calling for Malta and Cyprus to join the EU. In short, a total imbroglio is right outside our door with an escalation of the conflicts between large and small states plus the prestige envy between small countries and ministates. Will anyone ever agree that Malta should speak for the entire EU as Luxembourg can today? With this harebrained accession policy we are heading straight for the abyss. Some people can see this, but hesitate to warn others about it. Others secretly reckon that Europe will go to its institutional chaos." What most grieves the European commissioner is the fact that the original motivation for European unification has been abandoned. Somberly, he said: "A Community that goes further than an interstate cooperation is needed now more than ever. We once again find ourselves in a political context which at that time was so crucial for the EU creation: Europe as an answer to the spiral of border conflicts. Those who thought that the passion for territory had subsided now have one less illusion because of the tragedy in Yugoslavia. Within the Union too, the yearning for border corrections is rife. The new majority in Italy has already let it be known publicly that it wants to review its border with Yugoslavia. Istria could be the beginning of a nightmare. In Germany, too, the border issue is a sensitive point. The EU is a child of the Cold War. Now that the Cold War is over, some people have growing desire to modify the former borders. It surprises me that a European offensive has not yet gotten under way to counteract this perverse mentality." Karel Van Miert does not want to be called a prophet of doom. However: "For the first time in postwar history, there is the danger that we will all wake up in the old Europe of the 1930's." The only antidote he sees to the irreversible process of unravelling and dilution is the faster implementation of political and monetary union, even in a Europe moving at different speeds. "If monetary union is not implemented within five years, then it could be too late. I am afraid that by then we would have definitely missed our chance." [Camps] So the Maastricht Treaty has been outstripped. [Van Miert] Maastricht was a failure. We did not feel the historical momentum of the time. Kohl himself said that Europe had to be institutionally reinforced in view of German unification. The signal was not picked up in Maastricht. For me it has been an enormous disappointment. Instead of quickly elaborating a monetary union and a defense community, Maastricht awakened the illusion that a common foreign policy had been set aside for Europe. That is like putting the cart before the horse. Foreign policy must grow out of a common monetary and defense policy. Not the other way around. [passage omitted]
