The conference was addressed by chairman of the Russian committee for state property, Anatoliy Chubays, who said that unlike the first stage of voucher privatisation, during the second stage priority will be given to quality standards. The evaluation of property to be privatised after July 1, will be made in prices which were in effect as of January 1, 1994. The market value of a privatised object will differ from the starting price by several dozen per cent, rather than by several dozen times, Chubays said. The programme of post-voucher privatisation will enable local authorities to increase the starting cost of property by 70-200 per cent, depending on conditions of each particular region, Chubays said. Privileges granted to work collectives in the course of privatisation have underwent substantial changes in the new programme. Workers and managers of enterprises who will prefer the first variant will be given only 25 per cent of privileged shares (while under the programme in effect today, workers and managers, including the directors' corps, received 40 per cent of the athorised stock). A second variant, which is the most popular among privatised enterprises, envisages that only 10 per cent of shares will given to them on privileged terms (against 51 per cent in effect today.) Nevertheless, privatised enterprises will be allowed to appropriate 51 percent of all revenues from privatisation, Chubays said, adding that this measure will help former state-run enterprises overcome the structural crisis as soon as possible.
