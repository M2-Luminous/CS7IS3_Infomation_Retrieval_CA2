One crucial amendment allows for stabilizing changes to be made in Russia's basic law but as before, the signatories are banned from launching campaigns in favor of an early general election which is not envisaged in the constitution. One other amendment binds the government to try to narrow the income gap this year. Unlike the previous version shifting the burden of responsibility for CIS integration and Russia's breakthrough into the world market on the government alone, this is to be shared by the president and two houses of parliament as well. At the same time, the Federal Assembly is bound to approve this year's budget come what may. The clause binding the republics and regions to drop any claims for a change in their constitutional standing has been deleted and a new paragraph inserted in the chapter on ethnic relations which outlines mechanisms for implementing the law on the rehabilitation of deported peoples. The section on ways of implementing the civic accord was largely amended including a new clause saying the president can hold regular meetings with signatories to discuss key issues relating to the enforcement of the accord. Apart from a monitoring function, the conciliatory commission is now vested with powers of permanent coordination. Parts of the document dealing with its validity term and signing procedure have also been deleted.
