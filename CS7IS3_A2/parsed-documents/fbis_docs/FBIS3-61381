Under these conditions, the responsibility of political parties and movements of truly democratic, reformist orientation is high. By pulling together they can still restore the influence and role of common democratic movement, which have begun all the transformations that have occurred in the Republic of Moldova between 1987 and today, mobilize the creative potential of the society, and develop and implement concrete effective programs for stabilizing the situation and proceeding to a new qualitative level of social and economic development. The complexity of tasks facing the democratic movement in the country at this important stage demands a constructive approach on the part of political parties and public movements united by common ideals and goals. For this we need, first and foremost, to get rid of narrow group interests, corporate ambitions, and the desire to establish oneself at the expense of discrediting and diminishing political opponents and the organizations they represent. In this context, a graphic example of confrontational style in thinking and approach to political reality are some articles about the LCM [Liberal Convention of Moldova] that appeared in the OBSERVATORUL newspaper. By juggling and distorting the facts, the authors of these materials, in particular V. Butnaru, try to portray me as a dissident, who has challenged all the president's men and jumped into the vortex of political struggle with the purpose of exposing and denouncing others. Fortunately, I have not had the fortune of earning a general's rank in the national army in order to afford myself the luxury of taking the stance of an exposer. Moreover, I consider such actions destructive and useless unless they are followed by concrete proposals on how to improve the situation and concrete efforts aimed at overcoming the shortcomings. The main reason for my voluntary resignation from the job of state adviser on military issues was the realization of the need to consolidate the forces of centrist, reformist orientation in Moldova, to unite the people who are concerned with the future of the country and see the way out of the crisis situation by working out an integrated and concrete concept on the basis of values of modern liberalism and creative rethinking of the experience of developed democratic countries. When others placed their trust in me by electing me the chairman of the Liberal Convention of Moldova, I made a decision to completely concentrate on political activities, seeing it as the most important of all on the difficult road to a new democratic state of the society. I believe that the president of Moldova, Mr. Mircea Snegur, has taken upon himself the burden of one of the most difficult tasks of the transition period--to ensure a gradual reform of the economy, democratization of the society, prevention of extremes, and resolution of conflict situations from the position of common sense and taking into account the current realities. Being a guarantor of these transformations, a middleman in the competition of new political parties, the president of the country frequently becomes a target of criticism on the part of radical and extremist forces, of those groups that are against territorial integrity and independence of Moldova. The Liberal Convention has proclaimed its support for those forces that aid in the implementation of real reforms while preserving stability in the society. Guided first and foremost by its program planks, the LCM will strive to implement concrete comprehensive plans developed on the basis of the liberal idea, and is ready to constructively cooperate with all political and public organizations that share these principles.
