Every day five tourists are expelled from Portugal. Isn't it contradictory to close the borders when there are 4.5 million Portuguese abroad? [Soares] I am against the restrictive immigration policy, which falls under the government's jurisdiction, and not under my jurisdiction. Portugal has international obligations because it is a member of the EU which, as is known, is abolishing internal borders. I believe foreigners should be treated with due consideration, especially Brazilians, because for years Brazil has welcomed the Portuguese, and is still giving privileged treatment to the Portuguese who are living in that country. [Cohen] Are you and Prime Minister Cavaco Silva afraid of the social consequences of the possible return to the country of 500,000 Portuguese immigrants from South Africa? [Soares] I believe this will not happen. Efforts should be made for the Portuguese who are in South Africa to cooperate with the democratization process. I am willing to ask for the Portuguese people's support in the elections, because elections are very important. If things do not work properly, we cannot abandon the Portuguese who are living there. [Cohen] Twenty years after the Revolution of Nails [Revolucao dos Cravos], do you think the ideals that prompted the military revolt have been betrayed? [Soares] No. The Revolution of Nails attained its objectives, which are outlined in the so-called three D's: democratization, decolonization, and development. [Cohen] The decolonization process was traumatic, and could not be overcome by the main ex-colonies, like Angola and Mozambique. What is, in your opinion, the reason for this failure? [Soares] I would not say decolonization in Africa has failed. I blame the traumas on the conditions under which the colonial war developed. Portugal was placed under a ferocious dictatorship. It impeded the formation of African elites, making the nationalists shift to the international communist movement. [Cohen] What do you think of the criticism of actress Christiane Torloni about the boycott she suffered in Portugal? [Soares] I believe her criticism was a bit inopportune, but I do not attach too much significance to the case. She is a nice artist who enjoys popularity in Portugal, who received a major subsidy, and who appeared in funny ads. [Cohen] The euphoria that prevailed in Portugal at the end of the 1980's, and the myth that the country was an oasis, gave rise to an economic crisis. What went wrong? [Soares] The European Community aid was important for the development and modernization of some infrastructure areas, but some reforms the country needs have not yet been implemented. Free market conditions are posing problems for Portuguese enterprises. Tourism seems to be improving. We still have to receive major aid from the Community. I hope it will be properly used so we can reactivate, as we should, the Portuguese productive sector. Over the past few years the entire European continent has experienced a strong recession, which has also affected Portugal. [Cohen] What is the solution to the crisis? [Soares] To strengthen the Portuguese productive sector. This also involves the field of education. We should bet on the intelligence of the Portuguese people, on their immense capacity for adaptation and creativity. [Cohen] Do you agree with Ambassador Jose Aparecido de Oliveira's project to create a Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries? [Soares] It is very important for Brazil and for Portugal to understand that it could be very profitable for them to create a true brotherhood and design common plans for the future. The fact that Portugal is a European country and an EU member is not in contradiction with its love for Brazil or with our priority purpose of designing a coordinated policy with Brazil. [Cohen] What are, in your opinion, the mistakes that led to the defeat of the French Socialist Party? [Soares] The French Socialist Party had a very sketchy vision of the French situation. It tried to implement a nationalization policy, but had to back down three years later because of poor economic results. There were lamentable corruption cases, even though they are neither more nor less significant than those occurring in rightist governments. They are more serious when they occur within the leftist sector, because a lot more is always expected from this sector.
