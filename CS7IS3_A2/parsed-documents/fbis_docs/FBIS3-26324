The two sides have reached a common understanding as stated below: 1. Both sides maintain that they should adopt a pragmatic attitude and avoid political issues in the talks between them on operational matters. The two sides have just discussed three topics concerning operational matters, including the "issue of repatriation of personnel entering the other side's domain in violation of the relevant regulations and other concerned matters." They have reached a very close, common understanding in this regard, but efforts have yet to be made to iron out some differences between them so that a written agreement can be concluded as soon as possible. The two sides have agreed to hold the fourth round of talks on operational matters in Beijing in the latter half of March, and an agreement, if concluded, will be signed by the persons in charge of the two parties in Taipei. During the fourth round of talks on operational matters, the two sides will also exchange views on or discuss the following areas: The issue "of joint operation against smuggling and robbery at sea and other criminal activities," the issue of "mutual protection of intellectual property rights," "contact and mutual assistance between courts on the two shores of the strait (mutual assistance between judicial organs on the two shores of the strait)," and certain topics concerning the fields of economy and science and technology that are listed in the "Joint Agreement of the Wang Daohan-Ku Chengfu talks." 2. The two sides have agreed on the "procedures to accommodate exchange of visits by staff of the ARATS and the SEF between the two shores," which have come into effect by an exchange of documents. 3. The two sides have agreed in principle to expand the range of variety of copies of notarial documents to be exchanged between the two shores, in accordance with Article 2 of the "Agreement on the Use and Verification of Notarial Documents Between the Two Shores." Further discussion will be held to set out detailed procedures. 4. The two sides will extend assistance to each other on inheritance matters. 5. The two sides have agreed to make continued efforts this year to promote exchanges of visits between mass media leading staff members, young people, and scientific and technological personnel on the two shores of the strait. The two sides will continue to comprehensively implement all the agreements concluded through the Wang Daohan-Ku Chengfu talks, keep the contact and negotiating channels operating smoothly between them, and thus pave the way for the second Wang Daohan-Ku Chengfu talks.
