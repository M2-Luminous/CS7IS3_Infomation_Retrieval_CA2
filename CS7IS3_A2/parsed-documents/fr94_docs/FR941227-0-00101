Subpart F_Small Cities Program §570.420 General. (a) HUD administration of nonentitlement CDBG funds. Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 permits each State to elect to administer all aspects of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program annual fund allocation for the nonentitlement areas within its jurisdiction. This subpart sets forth policies and procedures applicable to grants for nonentitlement areas in States that have not elected to administer the CDBG Program. States that elected to administer the program after the close of fiscal year 1984 cannot return administration of the program to HUD. A decision by a State to discontinue administration of the program would result in the loss of CDBG funds for nonentitled areas in that State and the reallocation of those funds to all States in the succeeding fiscal year. (b) Scope and applicability. (1) This subpart describes the policies and procedures of the Small Cities Program which apply to nonentitlement areas in States where HUD administers the CDBG Program. HUD currently administers the Small Cities Program in only two States_New York and Hawaii. This subpart principally addresses the requirements for New York, and §570.429&hyph;30 identifies special procedures applicable to Hawaii. (2) The allocation of formula CDBG funds for use in nonentitled areas of Hawaii and New York is as provided in subpart A of this part. The policies and procedures set forth in the following identified subparts of this part 570 apply to the HUD-administered Small Cities Program, except as modified or limited under the provisions thereof or this subpart: (i) Subpart A_General Provisions; (ii) Subpart C_Eligible Activities; (iii) Subpart J_Grant Administration; (iv) Subpart K_Other Program Requirements; and (v) Subpart O_Performance Reviews. (c) Public notification requirements. (1) Section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545) contains a number of provisions that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance administered by HUD. All competitive grants in the HUD-administered Small Cities Program in New York are affected by this legislation, and the requirements identified at 24 CFR part 12 apply to them. Imminent threat grants under §570.424 and section 108 repayment grants under §570.432 are not affected by section 102 as they are not competitive grants. (2) The Hawaii HUD-administered Small Cities Program is not subject to section 102, since the funds are not distributed in a competitive manner. (d) Abbreviated CHAS. Applications for the HUD-administered Small Cities Program which contain housing activities must include a certification that the proposed housing activities are consistent with the applicant's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy as described at 24 CFR part 91. (e) National and primary objectives. (1) Each activity funded through the Small Cities Program must meet one of the following national objectives as defined under the criteria in §570.208.
