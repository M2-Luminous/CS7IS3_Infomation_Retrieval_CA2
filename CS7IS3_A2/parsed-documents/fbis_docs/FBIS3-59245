Our troops must leave the country by 31 March. Carmen Lasorella interviewed Carmine Fiore, the commander of the troops. [Begin recording] [Lasorella] General, within two months everyone will be back home. Will the mission in Somalia remain unfulfilled? [Fiore] The mission in Somalia is not unfulfilled; it is not yet finished. We intervened in the country as part of a team -- an international team. We must neither have the presumption nor the worry of trying to resolve the problem on our own. We are leaving the game at this point, but other players are coming onto the field. Let's hope that they play the game as well if not better than we did. [Lasorella] The United Nations set itself schedules and objectives. Neither these objectives nor these deadlines were reached. We cannot speak of success, so what can you say about the current situation? [Fiore] As I said before, the mission has not finished yet. The results will only be added up at the end. [Lasorella] You have gone through a notable experience. What must be strengthened -- more planning, more coordination, perhaps less waste of energy? [Fiore] There are two main problems. One concerns the Armed Forces, and we will study this problem in great depth; the other, in my opinion, concerns administration. There should be greater cooperation between the ministries in order to improve our effort. [Lasorella] So we could have done more? [Fiore] We could certainly have done more. [Lasorella] There are two months left. Do you think that they will be difficult months? [Fiore] I think so. We must remember that the game is not over yet. It will be difficult, especially in the final days. [end recording]
