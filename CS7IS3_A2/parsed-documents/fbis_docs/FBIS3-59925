The delegations of the United States headed by S. Talbott, ambassador-at-large and special adviser to the secretary on the newly independent states, and of Russia headed by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs G. Mamedov took part in the negotiations. The Ukrainian delegation was headed by Vice Prime Minister V. Shmarov. As reported by the Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of Ministers Press Service, the sides agreed that questions of Ukraine's security should be jointly resolved with Russia and the United States on questions of the elimination of missiles. As reported by the UNIAN press agency, V. Shmarov said that particularly good understanding was reached with regard to compensation for both tactical nuclear weapons transferred to Russia and strategic missiles. The vice prime minister also stated that Ukraine had already taken 17 of the most up-to-date SS-24 missiles off combat alert. V. Shmarov considers this to be a serious step attesting to the fact that our state is striving to pursue a nuclear-free policy. The Press Center of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense has not confirmed V. Shmarov's information that the deactivating the SS-24 missiles has begun. The UNIAN correspondent was told that the Ministry of Defense is not authorized to comment upon such statements.
