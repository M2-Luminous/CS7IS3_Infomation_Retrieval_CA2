How to handle the current account imbalance has become the weakest part of the Hiraiwa Report (final report of Economic Reform Research Committee). 2. The "domestic emphasis" approach of achieving a reduction in the current account surplus through improving the quality of life has been supported by the research committee. This purport is not reflected in the report. 3. The choice of financial resources for social infrastructure spending holds important meaning as a specific policy concerning this problem. However, a fiscal viewpoint has been placed at the center of financial resources rather than macroeconomic policy. As a result, it fails to propose specific policy by the "domestic emphasis" approach. Savings Not Tied to Public Investment The Economic Reform Research Committee started by embracing various issues such as relaxation of regulations and conversion of the industrial structure. Important among them is the theme of how to handle the current account imbalance. This is a topic carried over from the Maekawa Report. However, the handling of this topic is the weakest. Without specific proposals, it describes the situation as if it were someone else's affair that someday "it will be close to a form that can harmonize internationally." Why is there such a big setback like this on the most important topic? I should like to examine this issue looking back over the course of the discussions. The message of the Maekawa Report is that the current account surplus should be reduced for the sake of international harmony. It states that the aim will be an improvement in the quality of the people's life through the process of that realization. It is not generally known, but at the first meeting of the Hiraiwa Research Committee, many members voiced the opinion that a reverse approach from the Maekawa Report should be taken. In other words, first aim at an improvement in the quality of life and reform the domestic economic structure. A reduction in the current account surplus will be achieved as a result. It should be called a "domestic emphasis" approach, so to speak. If reduction of the current account surplus is cited as the main goal, it seems that the goal will be achieved just by reduction of the surplus through economic recovery. The reason that the proposal of the Maekawa Report came to an impasse probably lies here. What is needed now is examination of the structural part of the current account surplus, and it should begin with domestic issues before attempting the reduction of the current account surplus. "Domestic Emphasis" Not Reflected; Social Infrastructure Spending by Construction Bonds Consequently, taking a "domestic emphasis" approach is correct, and I also approve. However, this initial purport unfortunately is not reflected in the final report. People are saving for homes and old age. Not a small portion of those savings are directed to overseas asset holdings without ties to private investment or public investment. Domestic social capital is still as meager as ever, and precious savings for old age are being exposed to asset employment risks such as foreign exchange losses. This is the issue of Japan's economic structure which is involved in the current account surplus. The effective use of household savings domestically, direction toward necessary investment, improvement in the quality of life, and the practice of good-quality stock formation for old age: such changes in structure are "economic reform." There is an important policy for such domestic reforms and the key that will tie it to reduction of the current account surplus, or in other words, the "domestic emphasis" approach. That is the choice of financial resources (taxes or bonds) for social infrastructure spending. Let's explain this a little. If savings exceed investments, there will be an increase in debt (government bonds) for the government or debt to foreign countries. Consequently, reduction of the current account surplus is tantamount to increasing private consumption and investment (expansion of domestic demand) or expansion of the fiscal deficit. By increased issue of construction bonds, the weight of the composition of public assets will shift from foreign assets to government bonds and that of the macro resource allocation from foreign investment and consumption to domestic social capital. In other words, it means that household savings are directly connected to repletion of the domestic living and industrial bases. So long as expansion of the fiscal deficit is completely offset by expansion of the private-sector savings and investment differential, the current account surplus will decrease. Thus, the financial resource for social infrastructure spending has a close relationship with macro resource allocation. General concern about the current account balance is concentrated on whether or not numerical goals for surplus reduction will be established. As a specific policy issue, however, this financial resource issue is a very important theme. Theory of Burden on Future Generations Lacks Accuracy An intense dispute developed in the research committee concerning the financial resource for social infrastructure spending. There are two viewpoints in the financial resource dispute. One is the public burden, particularly the issue related to the balance of the burden between generations, and the other is the macroeconomic policy mentioned previously. Of course, the latter viewpoint is important in the "domestic emphasis" approach. Looking from this viewpoint, the increased issue of construction bonds to carry out social infrastructure spending is clearly desired. In other words, what is the best way to hold public savings? Viewing the current state of Japan, it is necessary to reduce the relative weight of foreign debt and hold high-quality social capital domestically. That is done by issuing construction bonds. Unfortunately, however, discussion from this viewpoint is not fully made. That is because the argument against construction bonds is made only within the framework of the burden on future generations. That is as follows: "If social infrastructure spending is made with government debt, it will defer the bill for the debt to future generations and conversely inflict pain on them." This concept is easy to accept at first glance; however, it is not correct because the point that government debt and the debt for the economy overall are confused. Government bonds are a liability for the government, but an asset for the people who hold the government bonds. When the government redeems its bonds, a stratum receiving the redemption (owners of government bonds) will exist at the same time. Consequently, viewed by the economy overall, it is not a debt. Redemption of government bonds is no more than a transfer of income inside a future generation. Next, "The cumulative increase in the government bond balance will bring an increase in government bond costs and hold down future policy expenditures." Such a problem in budget compilation certainly will be generated. Even now, government bond costs have risen to 21.3 percent of general account expenditures (initial budget). However, it is not good to focus only on the future burden concerning this problem because it is possible to exceed fixed tax revenues by issue of government bonds and execute it anticipating future problems. Social capital is an issue that should be started at an early point in time. Consequently, in this sense, not balancing public finance is rather desired at this time. Moreover, in the case of construction bonds, assets will remain corresponding to the amount of the government bond issue. Consequently, with regard to the cumulative increase in the government bond balance, the size itself is almost meaningless. So, the problem is which to emphasize, this fiscal viewpoint or the aforementioned macroeconomic policy viewpoint. The conclusion of the financial resource dispute is the following sentence: " To secure financial resources that will not leave a burden on future generations as the premise, a review should be conducted of the basic plan for public investment..." It had been "(tax) financial resources" in the draft, but at the final stage, the word (tax) was taken out. As already mentioned, construction bonds also do not leave a burden on future generations. Consequently, the choice of tax or bond is not made in this part. On the other hand, no reference is made in the report regarding the financial resources desired from the viewpoint of macroeconomic policy. Taxes Lose Mobility as Financial Resource The most important route in the "domestic emphasis" approach disappears here. Financial resources appear to be a small problem, but it was an important point involving the framework of the report. As a postscript, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) does not perceive the logic that construction bonds do not leave a burden on future generations. Consequently, the "financial resources" written in the report probably are interpreted to indicate taxes. If that interpretation goes unchallenged, there is a great possibility that an increase amount in the basic plan on public investment will not be realized. That is because there are great limitations on financial resources, but this is the biggest problem point when taxes are considered the financial resource. In other words, there is a possibility that the necessary investment cannot be made in the necessary time period. Viewed in terms of results, it must be said that the "domestic emphasis" approach is defeated by MOF fiscal supremacy. Fiscal supremacy conceives that a fiscal balance has precedence over the Japanese economy. If the people's savings are used effectively, the living base and future industrial base will rapidly be made replete, and it will be possible to obtain more affluence. However, the report fails to point out the way.
