FBIS4-53922 "dreas100_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 24 May 1994 South Korea U.S., DPRK Reportedly Hold Working-Level Contact U.S., DPRK Reportedly Hold Working-Level Contact SK2405024194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0151 GMT 24 May 94 SK2405024194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Washington, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The United States, looking to hold a third round of negotiations with North Korea in early June, held a working-level contact in New York Monday afternoon to prepare for the proposed talks. Meanwhile, the South Korean ambassador in charge of nuclear affairs, Kim Sam-hun, met with Robert Gallucci, chairman of the Clinton Administration Policy Group on Korea, to coordinate their countries' positions on the next round of Washington-Pyongyang high-level talks. In New York, the U.S. side was said to have proposed a date for the negotiations after reiterating its conditions for the talks. Depending on North Korea's attitude, there is a strong possibility the talks could be held in early June, sources said. State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry confirmed that an unofficial contact with North Korea had taken place in New York. McCurry also said that Gallucci, in addition to his meeting with Kim Sam-hun, is expected to hold several days of talks with officials from Japan and China on the North Korean nuclear dispute in New York beginning Tuesday. Speaking at a regular weekly press briefing, McCurry said that if North Korea could agree with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the question of maintaining nuclear safeguards, there would be no obstacle to the third round of talks. "The IAEA's ability to conduct the activities it needs to maintain safeguards on spent fuel -- as long as that is preserved, we would see no obstacle to another round of high-level talks," McCurry said. The spokesman called on Pyongyang to accommodate the activities of the IAEA inspection team as soon as possible. "We certainly urge North Korea to agree to the procedures the IAEA needs as soon as possible and not to jeopardize the IAEA's ability to conduct activities necessary to maintain safeguards on the spent fuel," he said. The United States has not decided on the date for the third round of talks, McCurry said. "We wouldn't proceed to announcing a date without a full range of consultations with others that we share an interest in this subject with," he added. "That would include the Government of Japan and obviously South Korea." But one senior State Department official said further talks with Pyongyang could be held early next month, when the two countries are expected to discuss the nuclear issue as well as problems related to normalizing political and trade relations. Following his meeting with Gallucci, South Korean Ambassador Kim hinted that the conditions for third-round talks between Washington and Pyongyang have pratically been satisfied. Specifically, Kim said the principal condition for the talks is additional IAEA inspection of a key radiochemical laboratory and servicing of surveillance equipment. As for the refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, Kim said that if North Korea continued to remove spent fuel rods, the basis for dialogue could "collapse." But discussions on the refueling between the IAEA and Pyongyang can proceed in parallel with the U.S.-North Korea talks if measurement of the spent fuel rods by the IAEA later is guaranteed, Kim said. McCurry said that should the discharge of fuel from the 5-megawatt reactor continue without any of the IAEA's proposed steps being in place, then North Korea would inevitably undermine the basis for dialogue. "We'd have no choice but to return the matter to the United Nations Security Council," he said.
