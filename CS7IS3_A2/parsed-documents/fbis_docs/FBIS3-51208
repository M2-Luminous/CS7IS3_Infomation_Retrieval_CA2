[Cristiani] The Fifth Central American Games have already begun. We believe it is quite clear that sports can serve as an example of Central American brotherhood and what characteristics all good citizens require. Obviously, as Salvadorans, we hope our team wins the upcoming games. We, however, will be satisfied if all participants do their best. Once a year we review salary policies, and this is being studied right now, as it has been done in previous years. I really cannot see how they [public workers] can justify asking for salary increases after just three months since their last increase, or how they can then threaten to go on strike if no increases are granted. I believe this is mainly politically motivated. I believe public workers should trust the fact that every year salary policies have been reviewed, and this will also be the case this year. Nevertheless, we do not yield to these sort of pressures -- politically motivated pressures. I repeat, I do not think that this is proper just three months since the last increase. [Moderator] Mario Jovel from the "Up to Date" newscast [San Salvador Canal Doce Television]. [Jovel] Mr. President, yesterday Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] Director Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo said that there were delays in the peace accords regarding land transfers and the reinsertion of former fighters into civilian life. What are the problems or difficulties, and might they not cause some sort of conflict? [Cristiani] No, they definitely cannot create any sort of conflict. Although there might be delays, these are not new delays but a delay that has existed right from the start. You may have heard all of the reasons for the delays in implementing certain programs, but we are expediting things as much as possible. I believe Dr. Ramirez Ocampo said that although there are delays, the process continues to move ahead. This does not necessarily mean there are problems. [Moderator] Carlos Dominquez, Megavision. [Dominguez] Good morning, Mr. President. I have two questions. The first one: Yesterday we heard statements by the Ombudsman for Human Rights, as a member of the special commission investigating the illegal armed groups, when he mentioned certain delays to get organized. We would like to first hear your views on what the government is able to do for this commission to begin its work. [Cristiani] We have said this commission is autonomous and that any delays are not the fault of the government, and we have not received any requests. We have clearly stated that we will help with anything the Joint Commission requests from the government, provided it is within our means. We have no influence whatsoever with what happens within the Joint Commission, and, therefore, this is their business. What the ombudsman should do is try to expedite things within the commission. It is not that the government is delaying things; we are keeping our hands out of it. Whatever they do is up to them. They may request something, but, I repeat, nothing has been asked of us up to now. [Dominguez] Thank you, Mr. President. The other question is: we want to have your official confirmation on what is being unofficially mentioned or rumored regarding the alleged arrest of four Salvadorans in the clashes in Chiapas State, Mexico. [Cristiani] We have not received any official report; these are press reports. The Mexican Government has not officially reported about them. [Moderator] Jaime Atencio, Cadena Sonora. [Atencio] Good morning, Mr. President. My question is this: This morning National Civilian Police [PNC] representatives in La Union reported the presence of Honduran troops in the village of Poloros. What is the government doing about it? Does the government know about this? [Cristiani] We have permanent contact with the Honduran Government through our Foreign Ministry, and the first thing one does in these cases is to investigate to see what the facts are and then try and resolve it somehow through diplomatic channels. We believe this is the way to resolve these problems and not allow this to become a bigger problem. It is the Foreign Ministry that resolves these problems. [Moderator] William Hernandez from LA PRENSA GRAFICA. [Hernandez] Do you have confirmed reports on these troops? [Cristiani] We have received reports from citizens. I, at least, have not received an official report from the PNC on recent cases or, rather, cases from yesterday. Prior to that, we had received reports from Salvadorans who have said that there have been Honduran troops in what is considered Salvadoran territory. Part of the problem is that many of the people do not really know where the border lies following The Hague ruling. Sometimes this may lead to confusion or to the belief that something is in our territory when in fact it is not so. In turn, it is necessary to open an investigation. Of course, it is clear that Poloros is Salvadoran, and this will have to be fully investigated and worked out through the Foreign Ministry. [Moderator] William Hernandez of LA PRENSA GRAFICA [as heard]. [?Hernandez] Good morning, Mr. President. I would like you to confirm the PNC deployment scheduled for next week. There have been rumors that it will be in Mejicanos and Ayutuxtepeque. [Cristiani] No, the next deployment will be in Nueva San Salvador and Antiguo Cuscatlan municipalities. I understand the PNC graduation will be on 21 January and the deployment will be a few days later. [Moderator] Wilber Gomez of "The Newscast." [Gomez] Mr. President, regarding the PNC deployment throughout San Salvador, how many will there be? Where will the San Salvador National Police be deployed? [Cristiani] We believe 340 will graduate from the PNC academy. We have no way of know how many may fail, but the final number is somewhere around 340. We understand there are approximately 40 additional PNC members who fell behind in some subjects and others who will be ready for this deployment. In other words, we are aiming to have about 400 PNC members for those two municipalities. The remaining will be deployed in the rest of the metropolitan area that remains under National Police responsibility. [Gomez] But where will the National Police from these areas be deployed? [Cristiani] To the remaining municipalities in the San Salvadors metropolitan area. [passage omitted]
