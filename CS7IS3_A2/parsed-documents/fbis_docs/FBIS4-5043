Japanese Ambassador to Cambodia Yukio Imagawa and Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut exchanged documents on the agreement in Phnom Penh, the ministry said. The aid will be used to purchase fertilizers and agricultural machinery, it said. Food production in Cambodia is very slow because its economy was destroyed by years of war and because of lack of fertilizers and machinery, the ministry said. The latest aid brings the total amount of Japanese grant-in-aid to Cambodia in fiscal 1993 to about 8.4 billion yen, it said.
