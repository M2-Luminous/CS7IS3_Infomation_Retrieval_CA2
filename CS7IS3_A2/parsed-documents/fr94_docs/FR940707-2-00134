In FY 1987 HUD began consolidating the Title I program by establishing the first of three multi-regional Debt Management Center (``DMC's'') in Seattle, Washington. The purpose of the DMC was to collect debts owed to the Department which result from defaulted Title I loans assigned to the Department. The consolidation effort was completed in FY 1989 with the opening of the Chicago, Illinois center. The three DMC's are located in Albany, New York, Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington. The role of the Debt Management Centers has expanded to include collection and management responsibility for not only Title I, but other FHA debt that has been referred to the DMCs for collection. This redelegation of authority grants to the Director, Office of Mortgage Insurance Accounting and Servicing, Office of the FHA-Comptroller, and to each of the three DMC Directors the power and authority to perform the following functions, without regard to geographical area, in connection with FHA debt referred to the DMC for collection and debt arising from the payment of claims under Title I of the National Housing Act: 1) execute documents necessary to transfer or subordinate title in and to any debt, contract, claim or security instrument obtained by the Secretary; 2) satisfy and/or execute deeds, liens, and notes; and 3) execute settlement agreements and/or write-off in connection with the collection of any such debt, contract, claim, or security instrument. The Director of the Title I Accounting and Servicing Division, Office of Mortgage Insurance Accounting and Servicing is also redelegated the authority to issue implementing policies and procedures with respect to all functions specified in this redelegation. This redelegation does not in any way include the power and authority to transfer title to real property, except as it relates to the collection and settlement of Title I and referred FHA debt.
