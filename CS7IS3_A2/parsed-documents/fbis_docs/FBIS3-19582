The prime minister was replying to correspondents' questions as he left the Chamber of Deputies where Greece's 150 years of parliamentary life was celebrated. Replying to a question on whether he believes that the many open fronts and dangers around us could develop into unfortunate situations for our region, Papandreou said he does not think anything like this could happen. If we have our eyes open and are united with a common goal to protect the nation and our people, he said, I think we can overcome all difficulties. Responding to another question on whether he feels that some are trying to increase the tension in the region with the topic of the Turkish troops' participation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Papandreou said: There are always circles who seek division, disorientation and promotion of their own interests, but I do not think they will succeed in their mission. Replying to another question, Papandreou said that our democracy has been sheltered long enough to face the problems in our country now.
