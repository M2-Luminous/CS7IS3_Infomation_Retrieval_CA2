General Michel 'Awn had called for this conference, which was attended by Dory Sham'un, leader of the National Liberal Party and many Lebanese expatriates and opposition figures, in addition to French figures from the Senate and National Assembly. Our colleague Salim Badawi will tell us about the final session, decisions, and recommendations: [Begin Badawi recording] [First,] declaring the foundation of the Lebanese National Congress as a comprehensive united institution that embraces the national current whose objective is to achieve Lebanon's freedom, independence, and full sovereignty over all its territories within its internationally-recognized historical border. Second, the constituent body of the congress, together with those in charge of it, will form a constituent assembly to draft its bylaw and to appoint its legislative and executive staff. Third, the congress announces the formation of the board of trustees under the chairmanship of the secretary general who will be in charge of running, organizing, and activating the general secretariat. Fourth, the congress announces the formation of the national assembly, which will be considered the legislative body of the congress. On the other hand, the Lebanese National Congress defined its militant priorities through the following objectives: [First,] liberation through organizing ties of cohesion and cooperation among the Lebanese to activate their role toward expanding the field of militant action on the Lebanese and international levels. Second, mobilizing the potentials of the Lebanese throughout the world to influence the decisionmakers, particularly in the five permanent members of the Security Council. Third, the congress will establish ties with international and regional organizations -- East and West -- particularly the ones that have influence on the Lebanese future. Fourth, the congress charged the board of trustees with following up dialogue and constitutional studies with prominent Lebanese and international experts to lay out and present alternative options to the sectarian system so that this will prepare for a secular political system that transfers power from the sects to the government. Regarding the peace process, the congress believes that the Israeli-Arab peace process, which began in Madrid in the wake of the Gulf war, constitutes the most important political framework to the Lebanese future. The statement adds: It would be a big danger to Lebanon's sovereignty and independence if Lebanon participated in the talks through a government whose decisionmaking is captive and seized and which lacks legitimacy and popular authorization. The final statement adds: Lebanon insists that its war has not ended, its peace will not be genuine, and its people will never enjoy sovereignty, freedom, and independence so long as the non-Lebanese forces have not withdrawn from all the Lebanese territory, in accordance with Security Council Resolutions 425 and 520. Lebanon is eager to have excellent relations with all its neighbors, not distinguished with any party. The congress also called for achieving a solid and comprehensive Lebanese reconciliation among the Lebanese leaders who agree on negotiations to liberate Lebanon within the framework of a transitional government that represents all parties that accept the principle of peace and work toward this objective.
