He told a press conference on Tuesday that the Central Electoral Commission had officially registered the support groups of 19 candidates. Hryb also said that the current developments in Belarus must be closely followed. Commenting on the agreement on the unification of the Belarussian and Russian monetary systems and on its compliance with the constitution, above all the provision on the powers of the National Bank of Belarus, Hryb said that interpretation of laws and state documents was the exclusive prerogative of the parliament. He also announced that the problem of parliamentary elections would be considered during the spring parliamentary session. In experts' estimate, this means that the current parliament will perform its duties until the end of the constitution-provided term and that early parliamentary elections will not be held. Among the main issues to be discussed during the emergency session opening on 27 April, is elections of the Constitutional Court and amendments in the customs legislation that are expected to cancel customs duties in Russian-Belarussian trade, given the forthcoming unification of the monetary systems.
