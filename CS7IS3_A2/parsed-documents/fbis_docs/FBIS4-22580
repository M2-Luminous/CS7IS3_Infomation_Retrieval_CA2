An interesting trend is emerging: The more convincingly L.M. maintains that "parliamentary elections" will not take place (and the hypnotic persistence with which he keeps repeating it begins to border on a call to boycott the elections), the more Central Executive Committee Chairman Ivan Yemets and GOLOS UKRAINY--both subordinate to Kravchuk--print documents on the upcoming presidential elections. It appears that Ivan Plyushch is indeed the obstacle, against which Kravchuk's hopes to ward off the new parliament's work ran aground. The president's game plan is becoming increasingly transparent by the day: to stall under any pretext--even, as some people on Grushevskiy Street maintain, by resorting to presidential rule--his own reelection; and it is only possible to impose such rule by provoking the population to nonparticipation in the elections on a massive scale. That Kravchuk's contention regarding a "power vacuum in the state" is, to put it mildly, somewhat exaggerated seems to be clear to everyone but the president: The old Supreme Council, in accordance with current legislation, retains its powers until the first session of the new Supreme Council. Therefore, the president's words may be interpreted in a purely human context, as an awareness as to how much a person may not want successful elections to the parliament, from which one may expect anything--for instance, reaffirming the June elections or a decision that Ukraine will be a parliamentary republic altogether. The conflict between the two parts of the nomenklatura has reached its apogee. Ivan Stepanovich made an effort in advance to ensure that Kravchuk would not have substantial influence on the conduct of elections by, among other things, placing his own people in charge of electoral commissions at all levels. "The subsequent course of events," says a man who works on the speaker's staff and is knowledgeable about the rules of nomenklatura games, "was not difficult to foresee: Kravchuk's people added a great number of candidates in the districts in order to confuse the voters and thus get the elections postponed." It appears that the only factor that works for Kravchuk in carrying out his plan is the weather, since sunny days may prompt practical Ukrainians to tend to more practical matters than politics--for instance, vegetable gardens. There are some signs, however, that Plyushch's people have considered this possibility, too. "Ivan Stepanovich also is a skillful apparatchik," says my interlocutor, "and some preparations have been made in this respect, too" (meaning apparently the decision to hold the elections on any day before 10 April of this year--ed.). That is, as long as Plyushch can influence the course of elections, there is still hope that they will take place after all. There is another substantial factor that now has been added to the fight for parliament seats and possibly for the right to be the president. The speaker's chances to claim the presidency are currently higher than ever. It is quite possible that his plans for the future presidency are the main reason why the Supreme Council never adopted the package of laws defining the functions and substantially limiting the rights of a "popularly elected" one. Undoubtedly, in today's Ukraine Ivan Plyushch is the man who in real terms and to considerable degree shapes the political situation. He has a phenomenal memory, incredible capacity for work, and his skill in manipulating parliament is amazing: There have been practically no instances of the Supreme Council approving something contrary to the speaker's wish, or not approving something when Ivan Plyushch wanted it approved. He is very set in his views, and it is extraordinarily difficult to convince him that the opposite point of view may be the correct one. Only once did he admit openly at a presidium meeting that giving L. Kuchma's government the right to issue legislative acts had been a tremendous mistake on the part of himself, the speaker. It was easy to see with the naked eye, however, how hard it was for Ivan Plyushch to bring himself to admit this. One can say almost with certainty that in the near future the determinant influence in Ukrainian political life will be that of the relations, mutual counteraction, and tactical compromises between the parliamentary and executive nomenklatura groups headed by L. Kravchuk and I. Plyushch. Comparing their chances, one observes first and foremost that the president is playing for "maintaining" the situation on the current level, and as is known, he who stays in place loses more often. Ivan Plyushch, however, is very interesting now in his silent importance--the eloquent silence of a man who is stubbornly climbing to the pinnacle of power.
