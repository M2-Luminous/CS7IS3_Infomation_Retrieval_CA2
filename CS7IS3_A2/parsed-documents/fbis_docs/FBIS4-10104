This information was given to EL OBSERVADOR by James Coates, the commander in chief of the Uruguayan Navy, who also pointed out that Navies will place greater emphasis on safeguarding the interests of the state within its territorial waters. President Luis Alberto Lacalle on 24 March lunched with the commanders in chief of the 16 participating countries. Prior to the luncheon, he said: "The naval topic has an enormous importance for Uruguay, because our territorial waters are nearly as large as our land area." He maintained: "The government has enhanced the nation's maritime role. During our tenure we have incorporated six units and are carrying out patrols. We are protecting our natural resources. We are ready for the task of an eventual defense that one hopes will not occur." Coates told EL OBSERVADOR: "The reason for these meetings is to exchange ideas, opinions, and to submit papers on the common links of the Continent's Navies." He added: "The naval roles within the framework of the new world order were the main topics discussed at this conference." He remarked: "There was an exchange of information regarding the policing role by the Navies and on the fight against trafficking." Coates indicated that a common point that was expounded by the participating countries was the fact that "governments have become more relaxed, that the threat of a war is seen as minor, that regional conflicts will increase, and thus they will set guidelines for defense matters." Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, the United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, and a delegation from the Inter-American Defense Board are participating in the meeting, which will conclude this coming weekend.
