According to Admiral Jan Klenberg, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, such plans were canceled when the Eduskunta appropriated another 207 million markkas for defense for the current year. The military received funds as a result of the collective bargaining agreement approved by the state. "According to the collective bargaining agreement, the Armed Forces will not be required to initiate new staff cutbacks or mandatory furloughs during the 1994-95 period," noted Adm. Klenberg in a speech during the opening ceremonies of the National Defense Course last Monday [11 January] in Helsinki. "By implementing the other significant savings measures that we have planned, we should be able to get through this year in some manner," opined Klenberg. He emphasized that the military operating expenditures for next year should, according to the Eduskunta, be brought to "a level consistent with our defense readiness." Last September, Klenberg presented the preliminary plans for the closing of garrisons. All garrisons were supposed to close for a month, and, at the same time, conscripts and permanent employees were to take mandatory furloughs. In his opening speech, Adm. Klenberg also talked about the domestic defense industry. He expressed concern about its continued viability. In Klenberg's view, cuts in defense spending will lead, during the next years, to the military being unable to order munitions from the domestic defense industry.
