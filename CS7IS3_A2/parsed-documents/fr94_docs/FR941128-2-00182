This BIB meeting would be closed, therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) (1), (2), and (9)(B). Premature disclosure of the information discussed would likely: (1) significantly frustrate implementation of proposed agency action, including but not limited to negotiations abroad; (2) disclose matters that would be properly classified to be kept secret in the interests of foreign policy; and (3) in some instances, relate solely to internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.
