(a)(1) One hundred percent of the final projected deficiency payment for the crop, as determined in accordance with §1413.104(b), reduced by the amount of any advance deficiency payment, will be made to producers of barley, oats, and wheat after December 1 of the year in which the crop is normally harvested. Any difference between the final projected deficiency payment and the actual final deficiency payment shall be made after July 1 of the year following the year in which the crop is normally harvested. (2) Deficiency payments determined in accordance with §1413.104 (a) and (b) will be made to producers of upland cotton and rice after February 1 following the year in which the crop is normally harvested. (3) Seventy-five percent of the final projected deficiency payment for the crop, as determined in accordance with §1413.104(b), reduced by the amount of any advance deficiency payment, will be made to producers of corn and grain sorghum after March 1 of the year following the year in which the crop is normally harvested. A final deficiency payment for the crop, as determined in accordance with §1413.104(b) and reduced by the amounts of all previous advance and projected final deficiency payments will be made to producers of corn and grain sorghum after October 1 of the year following the year in which the crop is normally harvested. (4) Deficiency payments determined in accordance with §1413.104(a) will be made to producers of ELS cotton after May 15 following the year in which the crop is normally harvested. (b) If applicable, the increased deficiency payments for feed grains and wheat calculated in accordance with §1413.104(c) shall be made as soon as practicable after: (1) July 1 following the year in which the crop is normally harvested for wheat, barley, and oats; and (2) October 1 following the year in which the crop is normally harvested for corn and grain sorghum. (c) If, with respect to each of the 1994 and 1995 crops of wheat, feed grains, and rice, and with respect to each of the 1994 through 1997 crops of upland cotton, 90 percent of the 1985 farm program payment yield exceeds the farm program payment yield for the farm established in accordance with §1413.15, deficiency payments for such crops for each year shall be determined by multiplying the farm program acreage by 90 percent of the 1985 farm program payment yield by the deficiency payment rate. Such payments shall be made at the same time and in the same manner as deficiency payments are made to the producer. (d)(1) For the 1994 crops of wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice, if an acreage reduction limitation program is in effect, CCC shall make available 50 percent of the projected final deficiency payments made in accordance with §1413.104 as an advance payment to producers in the manner determined and announced by CCC. (2) For the 1995 crops of wheat, feed grains, and rice, and the 1995 through 1997 crops of upland cotton, if an acreage reduction limitation program is in effect, CCC shall make available 40 percent of the projected final deficiency payments, made in accordance with §1413.104, as an advance payment to producers in the manner determined and announced by CCC. §1413.106 Division of payments. (a) Each producer on a farm shall be given the opportunity to participate in the program for a crop and receive program benefits in proportion to such producer's interest in the program crop on the farm or the interest such producer would have had if the crop had been produced. The name of all such producers shall be listed on the CCC&hyph;477. Federal agencies can earn no program payments, but any shares to which such agencies would otherwise be entitled, shall also be shown on the CCC&hyph;477 as though the agencies were earning them. The sum of the percentage shares of the program payment shall equal 100 percent. (b)(1) For the 1994 and subsequent years, each producer's share of the farm program payment for a crop shall be based on the following:
