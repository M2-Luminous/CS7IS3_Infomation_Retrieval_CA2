Beijing's XINHUA NEWS AGENCY said Sunday that Wu Lihong, 22, Yu Aijun, 23, and Hu Zhihan, 24, all from Zhejiang Province, robbed the tourists and then killed everyone on board the ship. This is the first time that Beijing has admitted that the deaths were not the result of an accident, but resulted from foul play. Mainland Chinese Premier Li Peng said Monday in Beijing that the boat disaster was a major criminal case. He said that those arrested would be dealt with according to the law. Li also offered his condolences to those killed in the boat disaster. He made the remarks in a news conference before his departure for a visit of the Central Asian States and Mongolia. Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) officials said Beijing failed to provide any details of the accident other than the names of the three men arrested. They urged Beijing authorities to disclose the reason and method behind the murder in written statements. They said that the lifting of a Taiwan ban on cross-strait cultural and other exchanges imposed in the wake of Qiandao disaster would hinge on whether these details were released. Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] Deputy Secretary-General Li Ching-ping, also said that Beijing's report that three men were arrested in connection with the case was not enough, he demanded a detailed report on the investigations. The foundation is Taipei's conduit for unofficial dialogue with Beijing. He said that Beijing's summary report through XINHUA NEWS AGENCY only bred more doubts and misgivings about the case. Ko Chen Hui-mei, mother of victim Kao Yu-lan, said she did not believe three men could overwhelm all 32 people on board. She suspected the three were scapegoats. Meanwhile, Hsu Chin-jui, chairman of the Taipei Association of Travel Agents, said Monday that a planned boycott of mainland travel starting May 1 would continue.
