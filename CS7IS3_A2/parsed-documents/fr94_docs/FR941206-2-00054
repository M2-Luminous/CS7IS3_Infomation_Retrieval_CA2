FR941206-2-00054 FR941206-2-00041 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC&hyph;512] Assessment of Knowledge of the Relationship Between Folic Acid Consumption and the Prevention of Spina Bifida and Anencephaly Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1995 funds for a sole-source grant with the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation for the evaluation of the effectiveness of public health programs to prevent birth defects through an assessment of the current state of knowledge among reproductive-age women relative to folic acid consumption and the prevention of spina bifida and anencephaly. Approximately $75,000 is available in FY 1995 to fund this project. It is expected that the award will begin on or about February 1, 1995, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period up to three years. Funding estimates are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds. The primary purpose of this project is for the March of Dimes to provide an assessment of the current state of knowledge and behavior among U.S. women of reproductive age relative to folic acid consumption and the prevention of SBA, as well as other pregnancy-related health issues. The assessment will be done by conducting a study of reproductive-age women (ages 18&hyph;45). It is envisioned that results from the study will be used to direct planning for national, State and local SBA prevention programs, and will provide a baseline from which to later evaluate progress in knowledge and behavior relative to folic acid consumption.
