He was summing up the results of the talks held with Switzerland's head of federal department of foreign affairs Flavio Cotti in Moscow today. The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry and his Swiss counterpart signed a protocol on cooperation between foreign policy departments of the two countries. Andrey Kozyrev called Bern's stand on international issues "responsible and constructive". He noted that the Russian foreign policy has been rid of "not only of the ideology syndrome, but of the complex of gigantomania as well". Kozyrev emphasised: In Moscow we have "learnt to value a partner, even if it seems to be a small country." "Switzerland, which is situated in the very centre of Europe, is our reliable friend and partner", he said, ascertaining that bilateral relations are quite intensively developing in all directions, including economic". The Russian foreign minister also noted personal friendly relations which he had established with Flavio Cotti during the head of the Russian foreign department's first official visit to Switzerland in 1992. The Russian minister said that during today's talks they discussed regional problems. Kozyrev highly praised activities of Swiss diplomat and U.N. secretary-General's special envoy in Georgia Edouard Brunner. He called the latter's peace efforts an "example of concrete participation in settling the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict together with Russia." Flavio Cotti thinks that Russia's peacemaking activities, naturally within the framework of international decisions, are in common interests". According to him, envoy Brunner also shares this conviction. The Swiss head of department of foreign affairs said that he agrees to Brunner's mission in Georgia being extended to an additional period, and he had recently spoken about it to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in Geneva. Taking into consideration the situation in Georgia, we are of the view that Brunner's mandate will be more directed towards organizational, legal and institutional issues. Besides this, in Cotti's opinion, it concerns the continuation of the traditionally peculiar to Switzerland diplomatic activities of mediation and rendering good services.
