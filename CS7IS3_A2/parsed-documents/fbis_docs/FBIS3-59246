General Grachev in fact indicated to his Belgian counterpart, Mr. Leo Delcroix -- during the latter's visit to Russia on Tuesday and Wednesday -- that he was prepared to come and explain this doctrine to NATO leaders, members of the minister's entourage reported. This Russian briefing -- which NATO is eagerly awaiting -- has already been reported on repeated occasions. Initially scheduled for last December, it was postponed until two days after the NATO summit on January 10 and 11 and then subsequently cancelled, observers recall. According to a colleague of Mr. Delcroix, Gen. Gratchev could come and deliver his briefing at the time of the joint meeting of NATO defense ministers and their East European "partners" which is planned for late May in Brussels. The Belgian minister will inform NATO of this offer on the part of Russia, the national Defense Ministry added. Diplomatic sources report that NATO is already in possession of 24 of the 27 pages of the document on the new Russian military doctrine. The three secret pages could concern the sometimes difficult relations between Russia and Ukraine -- notably following the reluctance of Kiev to dismantle its strategic nuclear weapons as laid down in the StART-1 nuclear disarmament treaty, and as ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament in November 1993. Mr. Delcroix also invited his Russian counterpart to pay an official visit to Belgium next April, and the two men are also to pay a joint visit to a contingent of Belgian and Russian blue helmets in eastern Croatia. The minister returned on Wednesday evening from a two-day visit to Russia during which he became the first Westerner to visit the ballistic nuclear missile base of Bologoye, located between Moscow and St. Petersburg. Mr. Delcroix -- who was accompanied by Major General John Schellemans, his principal private secretary, and Lieutenant General Jose Charlier, his chief of staff -- was taking up a "personal invitation" from Gen. Grachev. The Belgian delegation was able to visit the Russian strategic missile command in Moscow -- a force consisting of some 200,000 men -- and, at a launch site, a silo containing an SS-17 intercontinental missile with multiple warheads and a range of 11,000 kms. Access to these sites had previously been denied to any foreigners and even to the highest Russian authorities. Members of the Russian military indicated to the Belgian delegation that nuclear weapons inherited from the former Soviet Union were being kept "completely under control," the same source indicated. At a meeting to discuss problems of international security, Mr. Delcroix and Gen. Grachev again raised in particular the Partnership for Peace proposal that NATO has made to its former enemies in East Europe. This program seeks to increase political and military cooperation with the countries of Central and East Europe with a view to eventual NATO membership for some of them. According to Mr. Delcroix' office, Gen. Grachev has expressed an interest in this partnership, stressing that in future it should guarantee peace and stability in Europe.
