This time I skipped the above procedure and went straight from Beijing to the most basic cells of the Chinese society. My arrival brings quite a bit of excitement to Huxia village which normally leads a quiet life. Historically, no reporter has ever patronized Huxia, let alone stayed for a whole week. Compared to Huxia village's branch party secretary, Guanfu village's secretary Fu Jiannian [0102 1696 1628] is more active, hot-tempered, and outspoken. In seeing Du Shuiyuan, he ignored the presence of other people and said, "Secretary Du, this year, our per capita income will at most reach 700 yuan; we won't be able to meet the 900-plus yuan goal." He has been village branch secretary for only a year. It will not be wrong to say that he fought and won the post of village branch secretary. At the beginning, everybody was surprised. A capable man who had gone out to do business and gotten rich in the construction business has suddenly returned to hold a government post, and he even told Du Shuiyuan that if he served, he wanted to be village branch secretary in charge of the village. I visited Zou Mugen's [6760 2606 2704] family in Huxia village's Fujianao village. His eldest son and daughter work in an electronics factory in Shenzhen. His son wrote home and ended his letter with the words "bye-bye." His parents were shocked. They asked me, "What does `bye-bye' mean?" Compared to the shock the Guanfu villagers are experiencing, Zou Mugen's was nothing. After wandering around for many years and having seen the world, Fu Jianning returned to the village to be branch party committee secretary. Du Shuiyuan asked about his plans. He said, "Repair the roads, build a factory, and propagate scientific and technological results." What upset the villagers most was that the village had 776 people but only 580 mu of farm, but in one stroke, he transformed 241 mu into a nursery to grow citrus fruits, loquat, peaches, and other cash crops intermingled with other grain crops. He said, "There is so little land, and if we only plant grain, it won't even be enough to feed everybody." The peasants did not understand. They fought their way to his house and yelled obscenities at him. He pretended that he didn't hear them. Soon, he invited a scholar from town, and after three rounds of drinks, he said, "Would you write something for me?" "Write what?" "`House of Fury'" Bolstered by a few drinks, the scholar took a giant pen and wrote on the white wall three big one-meter-square characters. "Why `House of Fury'?" I asked. "Of course I have to accomplish something big here; otherwise, why would I give up good money on the outside and come back here to this poverty-stricken village to be a branch secretary?" He said, "I'm not being arrogant, but there are too few people like me in the villages." Not long ago, he sent me a five-year-plan to change the face of Guanfu village. He said that he would fulfill each and every one of his plans. New Biographies of the Heroic Sons and Daughters--by reporter Mao Hao [3029 3185] Upon entering Guozi village, the first thing that comes into sight is a yet-unfinished, four-story building. Surrounded by lower civilian homes, it stands like a crane among chickens. This building which is built according to state specifications and will soon have air-conditioners installed is the Yanlin Elementary School, named after industrialist Liu Yanlin who donated 400,000 yuan. In Guangan county, everybody has heard of Liu Yanlin. At the station, this reporter heard the driver talked about Boss Liu getting a new car for the county mayor. In recent years, Liu has given his village nearly a million yuan. In 1992, he paid to repair the road that allowed farm machinery to move from his house to the end of the village. In 1993, Guangan went to the coastal areas to solicit business and investments. Liu indicated that he was interested in investing 10 million in a joint investment with the county to build the Guangfu building. But Liu's mother thinks little of his son's success. "He is in small business. His work is not as stable as yours. Out there, he is like playing mahjong; he wins if he draws the right tile, and someone else wins if he doesn't." We can't blame her. In a traditional farming community, people have their own idea of a hero. This reporter looked up Who's Who in the Guangan County Annals. Many government officials' names are in there, followed by those in scientific and technological fields, and there are names of all kinds of skilled craftsmen, but under industries, there is only Hu Zhongshi [5170 0112 1395]. Traditionally, people only admired those will exceptional farming skills. The local people have a saying, "The business of buying and selling is just like a flower that doesn't last. It is the hoe that works the ground that yields the crop." Liu's father was a typical country hero. He not only was a successful farmer but he was honest, sincere, and never offensive. When the younger Liu first revealed his rebellious side, he took quite a few lashes from his father. The village clan also rebuked him for being a bad son. He was not a bit like his old man; he was superficial, and he ran around all day long on his motorcycle (the kind pig-sellers ride), and hard on his heels were a bunch of creditors. This was the impression Liu Yanlin left behind when he took off. Liu simply could not stay in that environment. He left home in 1991 with 9 yuan and 2 jiao in his pocket. "In 1985, Number Two Son came home and said he wanted to buy a brick factory and borrow 5,000 yuan from the credit cooperative. He took the note home, but neither his father nor I dared to sign the note." Liu's mother recalled. "He got married that year, and many people warned the girl against it, saying he had several hundred thousand yuan's debt out there that he had not paid off. Whoever married him would certain cry her eyes out later." Yet only a few years later, Liu came back to Guangan with his huge economic clout, and the succession of action he took stirred the people of Guangan. They were forced to reassess him and his flaws. Liu Yanlin's elementary school teacher, Liu Huaifu [0491 0001 4395] had joined him a year earlier. He was cautious in talking about Liu: "Liu Yanlin's greatest asset is that he is bold; he is full of drive; he is never hesitant or indecisive; he is never complacent or satisfied with what he has." Teacher Liu has nothing but admiration for his former student. "Only those who have been out and about can appreciate that he deserves to get rich." Indeed, Liu's success deeply affects the young people of Guozi village. Today, any young person who has not traveled around a bit will be considered a worthless wretch. In the last few years, Guozi villagers have gone so far as the northeast and Xinjiang, and there are scores of bosses with hundreds of thousands of yuan in assets. At the village's elementary school, I asked the children whom they admired most, and they answered in one voice, "Liu Yanlin." At the end of 1993, even though Liu's family had moved to Guangdong, he was still named first among Guangan's top ten young people. The Same Eyes, But Shine Brighter--by reporter Sun Kai [1327 0418] Guo Sanhu [6753 0005 5706] who has been away doing small business for seven-eight years said that having been away for a few years and coming back today, one can see that there are more and more ways to make money. He said that in the days of the "Gang of Four," just that little bit of land couldn't produce enough to keep people alive, but they were still forced to remain on the farm and were not allowed to leave. Every year, people looked forward to the day they were paid dividends, but usually when that day came, they not only did not get anything but found out that they actually owed the brigade money. In the village some people smuggled grain from Shaanxi and sold them in the village. The leaders even led militiamen to the railway station to arrest them. People not only did not have enough to eat, they couldn't even afford to buy salt. The truth is, what Guo Sanhu described was the history not only of Xinzhuang village. It was the epitome of the by-gone days for numerous villages in rural China. Today, Xinzhuang's people have bid farewell to the poverty of yesterday. Going away has meant many new ways for the people to make money. The bright ones bring Gangu's chili noodles and Chinese herbal medicine to the outside to be sold and shipped elsewhere and do some small business while they are out there. The strong ones make money in the construction teams. The old folks and the women stay home to farm what little land there is. Those who have been away and come back inevitably find many ways to make money--women who stay home can process chili noodles and do some embroidery work on the ready-made clothing they sell, or they can work on the sweaters and so on and let other people take them out and sell them. All these can bring substantial income. Old people can set up a pingpong table, and each month they can make more money than a department-level cadre. Different types of peasants are finding different ways to make money. Some of these money-making avenues have always been there, but they were not discovered until people started going out and their horizon began to broaden; others were created and developed only after people gained mobility. Mobility has allowed the peasants to make lots and lots of money. Mobility has allowed the people to look away from the land and set their sights on the broad horizon yonder. Mobility has changed the people's concept of wealth, which is far more valuable than just giving these peasants more money. Today One Realizes That Education Is Money--by reporter Dai Yuanzhi [2071 5913 2388] A township enterprise in southern Jiangsu reaches across the river to recruit workers. The test for the applicants is very simple: Bring in a sewing machine and sew in the hidden pocket below the waistline on the trousers, and then the applicant leaves his or her name and identification card number. The qualified workers show up for work with their ID cards. More and more factories are hiring working boys and girls, but they only hire the skilled ones. There used to be a saying in Yancheng, "You can't pick up pennies without bending down." It means if one is not willing to work hard, one cannot make money. And so everybody bend down to "scrap" money off the ground. When they first arrived in town, they thought that physical strength alone could earn them some money. But once they had to work with machines, reality taught them that physical strengthen alone was not enough; they needed technology and skill. "Migatory bird," Liu Xunjun said, "This is known as `if you ride other people's horse, you carry other people's gun'--you work for other people and you learn their skills." Once, the workshop contractor quietly sent him to Zhangjiagang's Chenghang Township to work in a factory to install axles and repair cars while the workshop director arranged to have someone else take over his old job. He made money for the workshop, and so besides his original wage and bonus, he also made extra money. The other factory manager saw that he was a good technician and kept him there and paid him 500 yuan a month. Life has taught him that skill is money. Work is to earn money, but without skills, there will be fewer job opportunities and one would earn less. "With skills, the world opens up." Yet, learning a skill is not easy. When Liu first arrived at the Zhongshi Factory, he was assigned to sweep floors. He swept floors while learning from the master craftsmen. He caught up with some young men who had entered the plant before him and borrowed such technical books as "1515 Loom Repair and Maintenance Manual" and "1515 Multiple Shuttle Box Maintenance Manual." Behind his back the plant's master craftsmen said, "Let him read. He can't understand anyway." Workers who came to the plant before him also asked him, "Can you understand?" Reading alone was not enough. When the looms broke down, he took one look before the master craftsman came to repair it, and he took another look after the repair, and after a few more tries on his own, he began to figure things out. Chen Chao [7115 6389] had a similar experience. After he borrowed the book, he would "match everything by number" to the machine according to the book. He looked at the machine and then checked the flow chart and he clutched the books and let the master craftsmen test him. But when repairing the machines, some master craftsmen would send him away. Some would even warn him, saying, "You don't know how to do it. Don't touch." When the machines break down, repair work is the day shift job. Chen Chao also wanted to try it. At the beginning, he was scared, afraid that he could not do it and the master craftsman would yell at him. So he read some books first and then thought about what the master would do. When he really couldn't do it, the next day he went to the master craftsman to apologize. The teacher saw that he was willing to learn and did not give him a hard time. "Three months after I arrived, I was doing the day shift, but after dinner, I would also work the swing shift. I wanted to learn to repair cone winders. Someone in that shift was also from northern Jiangsu. He had been there for more than a year. He told my master, `Don't let him come.' It turned out that this man was negotiating with the unit, and he figured that if someone else learned the skill, his deal with the unit would fall through." Today, in Chen Chao's factory dormitory, he still has Cotton Spinning, Carding Machine Repair Manual and other technical books by his bedside. Lu Ningdong [4151 1380 2639] the "migratory bird" who worked in a construction company and ended up losing his job also worked hard to learn a skill, and ultimately he made good and became the platform car brigade leader. The workshop director even let him contract his work. He said after he began contracting he wanted to quit two lowing-paying "basic jobs" in the city, but the workshop supervisor would not let him and gave him a 50-yuan-a-month raise instead. Of course with the raise came more responsibilities. Without skill, how could he have made an extra 50 yuan a month? At the Xinsu Machinery Factory where Chen Liang [7115 0081] works, the young men from Yangzhou's Tiaxing who are certified technicians who have "fourth-level knowledge plus third-level know-how" have a competitive edge over the young men from Yancheng's Funing and are hot commodities in the factories. Among the Funing youths, those who are smart already realize that skill is money. When Chen Liang returned to the village, he talked about a young "combination factory worker and peasant" in his workshop who had once been "foolish": This young man asked to extend his apprenticeship for another month so that he could learn more from the master. The workship was fairly open-minded and did not keep him to his quota for that month so that he could fully learn his skills. Today, among the two groups of 80 young workers from Funing, the first 10 who passed the tests have been upgraded by half a grade in pay by the factory. After throwing away the scythe, if one truly wants to pick up the hammer, one must have skills. A Jiangsu Provincial Labor Bureau official told me that today, Nantong has added an educational course called "Employment Guide" for the graduating middle and high school classes. This year. Jiangsu has handed down its guidance-oriented plan to the labor exporting localities asking them to provide training for 340,000 people. Looking Forward To Autumn In Spring--by reporter Liu Jian [0491 0256] Forty-eight-year-old Liu Zaitian [0491 0961 3944] was probably the youngest kid in Liujiaguanfang village to learn to write with a brush. He is very smart, but unfortunately, he only went as far as finishing elementary school. In 1977, Heilongjiang Province's Qitaihe Mining Bureau was recruiting many full-time miners. His older brother who had long planted roots in Qitaihe asked someone to send in an application for him, and when everything was arranged, he took off. A few years later, his whole family moved to Qitaihe, and henceforth they would no longer be Shandong people. This is Liujiaguanfang's typical emigration story. Those who have no luck will always come home no matter how long they have been away. Those who come back are back, and those who come back first should not regard those who come back later as "extraterrestrials," and those who have just returned will get rid of their little bit of northeastern accent after ten days or half a month, and then basically they become "one of the crowd" and go back to do what they have been doing all along. As for people who had been away but have returned to the village to hold government posts and change the village, occasionally one may read about them in the newspaper in Liujiaguanfang. The village's rule is that those who are village cadres or have a chance of becoming village cadres obviously will not go "wandering around," and generally speaking, those who did go out have very little hope of returning to serve as officials. At first, many who left Liujiaguanfang did so because they owed people money or were trying to stay out of debt. But this situation no longer holds true today. Since 1992, young people who have no debts and whose families are fairly well-off have been leaving simply because they want to earn more money. When I returned home to gather materials for this story, a fairly well-off elderly lady in the village asked me to pull strings for his son so he could get his driver's license, because the line for driver's license examination was too long at the local traffic police training center. Five or six young kids from the village have already obtained their "driver's licenses" and have gone to nearby Linyi and Rizhao to make money driving cars, and some have even gone to Jiaodong Peninsula. They clearly make more money than the others. They have not been gone for long, and it is not likely that they will be returning home soon. In a place like Liujiaguanfang, if one can find a job at a state-owned or collective enterprise in the nearby towns and townships, it is considered something to be proud of. This is different from venturing out to the northeast. Anybody can get out to the northeast, and anybody out there can find a job, good or bad. But to be able to go to work in an enterprise or an institution in the city, county, or even the township (even as a driver) is something else. It requires pulling strings. Scarce goods are always better. Even though one can clearly make more money working in the northeast than at home, at home one does not have to go down to the coal pits and suffer. From the point of future impact on these small villages, those who move about in nearby cities and towns will have greater impact than those who venture out east of Shanhaiguan. Almost 70 percent of those who go to the northeast end up in Qitaihe, Shuangyashan, Jixi, Hegang, and Daxinganling and Xiaoxinganling and other mining towns and forest areas to do work that requires sheer physical labor. Shandong's workers have little opportunity of getting into even construction work. Over there, the civilian construction market belongs to the Jiangsu people. That is why although they travel far, their horizon may be broaden at most to the extent of knowing that at the end of several thousand kilometers of railway line lies a mine or a huge forest. Moreover, the northeast is a region with the oldest tradition of planned economy. The young people who do not stray too far from home are different. Almost all of them are also engaged in physical labor, but they are in Linyi, Rizhao, Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai, and they directly observe life in another world. They are fully stimulated. When these people (and not those who venture out to the northeast) decide to go back to the villages, will they create a "revolution"?
