When a businessman is dissatisfied with a competitor, the state-legal machine is turned on: Click--there is no competitor. The subject of a MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS article, "Taras Bulba Goes on the Warpath," concerned the examination by a group of State Duma deputies of the legality of closing the check investment fund Neft-Almaz-Invest by Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for Management of State Property] (GKI). New facts in the scandal have become known to the editorial staff. The license issued earlier by Goskomimushchestvo to the check fund was suspended on 5 March. The formal pretext--the leadership of the fund did not submit the annual report on time. However, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation postponed the date for submission of the annual report to 1 April. The second discrepancy--the fund is accused of stealing vouchers. This served as yet another pretext for invalidating the license. I personally saw a half million vouchers in three armored safes. According to Mosaudit data, the fund's assets are shares of stock of 71 very large Russian enterprises, including oil extracting and gold mining, and the expected profit is $22 billion. Large blocks of stock of the pillars of national industry cannot help but whet the appetite of potential competitors. In addition to everything else, in the event the fund is closed, 572,700 vouchers will shift to the control of the GKI, but from there... In the opinion of parliamentary experts and the fund's management, a model of forced bankruptcy, approved at Tekh Progress, is being employed with respect to Neft-Almaz-Invest. The fund is being accused of "insolvency" in correspondence through "its own" journalists in the mass media. A wave of popular anger is growing among ordinary shareholders. The GKI has been swamped with "letters from workers." The license is being suspended on this basis, and an audit is beginning. During the audit the competitors get a "handicap," and they correct their affairs. The auditors are putting all their energy into digging for compromising material. The fund is being closed. The assets are being transferred to the GKI. Further, they are divided among the large check investment funds. To whom and how much is decided by Goskomimushchestvo officials. Afterwards, the obligations (stocks, certificates) are exchanged for obligations of its former competitors. The deed is done. As a rule, people do not suspect anything. What difference does it make whose paper one holds. The main thing is that the dividends come in. What they would have been in a ruined fund, and what they will become after the division of the pelt of the killed bear, only those initiated into the mysteries of the property court can guess. Aleksandr Ignatenko, an employee of the UEP GUVD [Economic Audit Department of the Main Administration of Internal Affairs] and a member of the GKI commission to audit the fund, said: "We have already been working for several weeks. We cannot bring any charges at present. But I think we will find swindlers..." G. Khodakov, manager of the commission and a senior employee of the GKI, said: "The parliamentary commission for examination of our activity has not been established officially. The deputies, of course, can audit us, but does this make any sense..." An opponent of Khodakov--Nadezhda Razuvayeva from Mosaudit, said: "Based on the `presumption of innocence,' the management of the fund had every right to involve the deputies in monitoring the audit. All the deputies are professional experts. But whether they are Chubays' expert employees... The audit method raises doubts about this. All documentation representing a commercial secret was confiscated. The commission has its own Xerox machine. Papers are copied and sent who knows where. Strangers who have no relationship to the fund or the commission are continuously encountered in the building where the auditors are working. Indeed, the commission staff is always changing..." The commission continued its work yesterday.
