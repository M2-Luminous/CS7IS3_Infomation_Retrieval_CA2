Shakeup in Government May Affect Aleksandr Zaveryukha"] [Text] Boris Fedorov, Russian Federation finance minister, does not intend to reign for the time being. This was told to your SEGODNYA correspondent by a high-ranking Russian Federation Government official who wished to remain unnamed. The vice premier repeatedly stated earlier, in confidential discussions, his unwillingness to work in a coalition government. The Constitution, however, permits the president to form the cabinet personally. The participation of Mr. Fedorov in Viktor Chernomyrdin's coalition government is quite possible on condition that the course toward financial stabilization will be preserved. To all appearances, Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, who became member of the Russian cabinet back in summer 1991 and who at one time played the leading role in forming the post-Communist government of Yegor Gaydar, will keep his position in the government, too. One of the reasons for his keeping the role of supervisor of the foreign economic bloc, experts think, is that there are no aspirants yet in sight for a position in which one is supposed to handle the problem of Russia's relations with the other CIS countries. Besides, Aleksandr Shokhin is Russia's director of the IMF and the World Bank, and in line with the charters of these international finance organizations, the term of office in this position is two years. At the same time, Gennadiy Melikyan, nominated by Aleksandr Shokhin and his comrades in arms in the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], is apparently threatened with resignation. According to some information, the State Committee for Nationalities Policy led by the head of the PRES, Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, will also be scrapped. It is not to be hoped that Mr. Shakhray will leave administrative bodies. According to unofficial information, he intends to combine parliamentary activity with work in the president's staff. Boris Saltykov, who currently holds the position of deputy science minister, also pins his hopes for a further political career on the State Duma. The candidacy of former vice premier Mr. Saltykov will in all probability be offered by the ruling cabinet for the position of Duma deputy speaker. Mr. Zaveryukha, vice premier for agriculture, who leads the Agrarian Party, may lose his position. His vigorous lobbying in the Council of Ministers may become even an even more significant reason for that than the fact that his party's faction in the Duma is in open opposition to the government and president.
