This initiative aims to strengthen the spirit of brotherhood and cordiality among the sons of Kurdistan and to continue the reconstruction of what has been destroyed by the Iraqi regime's aggressive and [word indistinct] policies. The initiative also aims to consolidate the spirit of democratic freedoms and human rights in Kurdistan and to enable the region's government and elected parliament to exercise their work in the service of the sons of Kurdistan. The initiative stressed the need to strengthen the alliance between the members of the Kurdistan Front, especially between the PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], so as to proceed with the unification of all resources and capabilities on solid bases and to direct them against our people's enemies and the dictatorial regime in order to bring it down and establish a democratic, federal, and pluralistic regime in Iraq. Brother Talabani said in his announcement: To achieve these noble and legitimate objectives, the PUK has, on its part, decided the following: 1. To stop the fighting immediately and unconditionally, to withdraw all the PUK forces from the areas of (?fighting), and to return these forces to their former bases under the supervision of the Kurdistan Front and the Unified Iraqi National Congress [UINC]. 2. To release all persons detained and arrested by the PUK. 3. To stop all forms of media campaign and not to reply to media campaigns. 4. To let all government employees affiliated with the PUK return to their departments immediately so as to extend their services to the citizens. The brother secretary general expressed his thanks and gratitude to all the sons of Irbil for their noble feelings and sincere efforts to calm and normalize the situation. He also sincerely thanked the sons of al-Sulaymaniyah for their goodwill efforts for that purpose. Brother Jalal expressed his gratitude to all the officials and leaders of the parties in the Kurdistan Front, the UNIC, the KDP, the PUK, and other Kurdish political forces for their sincere efforts to put an end to the extraordinary situation and normalize the situation as quickly as possible. He also thanked the Kurdish and Iraqi parties, especially the Assyrian and Turkmen ones, and also the professional and mass organizations for their serious and great efforts to tackle the problem, for their desire to uphold the atmosphere of brotherhood, love, and cordiality, and for presenting peaceful solutions to all the differences. Brother Jalal Talabani called on all our people in Kurdistan to act and to take the following facts into account: 1. To take care of the spirit of brotherhood and peace between us in view of its positive effects at the domestic and foreign level. 2. To achieve a comprehensive and general reconciliation that will include all the parties in Kurdistan. 3. To condemn the violations of human rights and deviations from Kurdish, revolutionary, and Islamic values and norms. 4. Not to squander the foreign support and backing by speeding up the efforts to tackle problems, reorganize ourselves, and let the region's government and parliament perform their normal duties. Brother Talabani referred to: the need to consolidate security and to maintain the brotherly ties and the atmosphere of cordiality and rapport in the region of Kurdistan; the need to unite all the forces and efforts in order to confront the plots of our people's enemies who want to thwart this experiment, pour oil on fire, and sow sedition and conflict. Brother Jalal called on all to rally and cooperate to entomb these vile plots being hatched by our people's enemies and to stand together in one trench against the enemies instead of standing in opposing trenches. He demanded the immediate and rapid implementation of the clauses mentioned in the initiative. Concluding his initiative, brother Jalal Talabani called on the struggling masses of Kurdistan, all their political forces, and all the faithful sons of our people to work together toward consolidating law and order, strengthening democracy and human rights, protecting our people's gains without being selfish, and working together toward having a Kurdistan where we all enjoy freedom, democratic, and human rights.
