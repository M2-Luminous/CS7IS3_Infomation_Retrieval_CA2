In particular, major general contractors (comprehensive construction firms) stand unrivaled at the construction of nuclear power plants. Any construction site is lined with the company flags of Kajima, Taisei, and Shimizu. Large-scale civil engineering technology and mechanized engineering procedures, which have been developed through building the nuclear power plants, are the driving force for those companies to lead far ahead of other smaller companies, and they have enjoyed the name, "super general contractors." Leading the Construction of Nuclear Reactors Facing the Sea of Japan is the construction site of No. 6 and 7 reactors of the Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd.'s Kashiwazaki Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Niigata. At the site of No. 7 reactor handled by a joint venture [JV] led by Shimizu Corporation, world's largest wheel crane lifts reinforcing rods pre-assembled as a rectangular structure of several tens of meters, and carries it to the construction site of reactor's containment vessel. Next to the No. 7 reactor is the construction site of No. 6 reactor, which is handled by a Kajima-led JV. All-weather construction method is employed in which the entire construction field is covered with a temporary roof and walls. Kashiwazaki is a prominent area of heavy snowfall in Japan. In order to overcome the delay in construction during wintertime, general contractors invented an efficient method using large steel assembled framework and all-weather construction method. These methods are unique to Japan which cannot be found even in the Western nations that are advanced in the nuclear power technology. The "Atomic Energy Office" was set up in Kajima Corporation under the supervision of the fourth president (the late) Morinosuke Kajima in 1956, one year after the Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. established the "President's Office Atomic Power Plant Section", the first organization to bear the name of "atomic power." Kajima's former Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama, who was arrested in the general contractors' bribery scandal, was the young hope of the company then. He was sent to the United Kingdom to learn the technology of Calder-Hall Type No. 1, the world's first commercial nuclear power plant. That "[he] studied so hard by visiting various places that his shoe got a hole" is still talked about as a legend in the company. Morinosuke Kajima did not allow to close the Atomic Power Office even when its management accumulated a deficit, saying [the investment in the office] was "prior investment." The accumulation of knowledge at that time is now useful. Tokyo Electric has started on the reform of bidding system from 4 April, and it has paved the way for domestic and foreign entrants to bid for its projects. However, the construction of a reactor's core is handled by the three super general contractors. Obayashi Corporation is still the main force in the construction projects of the Kansai Electric Power Co., Ltd. and Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. Semi-major class contractors tried to absorb the construction technology through the JVs. Hitoshi Tobishima, adviser of Tobishima Corporation says, "All the nine electric companies are our clients," but, his company cannot attain the level of the four leading companies. In expectation of the demand for dismantling reactors after the year 2000, Maeda Construction Co., Ltd. has developed its own technology to dismantle a nuclear reactor by applying an electric current to the reinforcing rods of the reactor's containment vessel. But a case like Maeda is rare. Contractor's Own Research Laboratories Hiroshi Kitamura, vice president of Taisei Corporation, proudly says, "Japan's general contractors are the only ones among other construction companies in the world which have their own research institutes." Each leading company has a laboratory that is capable of developing and designing antiseismic structures, skyscrapers, and underground cities. However, even the research and development expense of Kajima, which is the largest, is 22 billion yen. The amount corresponds only to 1.3 percent of its sales. Taisei's R&D cost is 15 billion yen, which is 0.8 percent of its sales. These ratios are merely 1/10th of the level of Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation, whose R&D expenses amount to 8 to 10 percent of their sales. Each company has a state-of-the-art supercomputer, and uses it for structure analysis and various sorts of simulations. But the reality is that "those computers were purchased in return for contracts for the construction of semiconductor factories and main office buildings," according to a major general contractor. The purchase of supercomputers was for more of a reciprocal trade than a genuine research and development. The research and development ability of smaller general contractors is poor. Japan's first JV was formed only by major contractors in order to share the risks involved in the construction of a U.S. base after the war. "The JV was so powerful that it even asked the Fair Trade Commission whether it violated the Antimonopoly Law," according to Kajima. But, without one's knowing it, the nature of JV has changed to a "convoy" in which small general contractors follow the big ones. An executive of a major general contractor says, "The productivity of construction industry is 80 percent of that of general manufacturing industry," because the number of companies with bad efficiency are not reduced while there are 530,000 construction companies in the nation. In order to catch up with the super general contractors, major and semi-major general contractors, such as Kumagai Gumi Co., Ltd., Tobishima, Hazama, and Aoki Corporation, invested in real estate at home and abroad, constructed golf courses, or acquired a hotel chain, but it all ended in failure, and they are struggling to rebuild their management. There is a persistent rumor that "Maeda Construction, a company separated from Tobishima, will help Tobishima's reconstruction." However, Maeda's head flatly denied, "It is impossible for a child to swallow its parent." Sense of Crisis in the Ministry of Construction Likewise, the super general contractors have diversified their business, and took contracts worth more than 2 trillion yen at the peak. Although the amount of contracts declined to 1.3 - 1.4 trillion yen due to the collapse of the economy, Kazuhiko Kondo, managing director of Shimizu, is not pessimistic. "Eighty percent of our contracts are taken from the private sector, and 70 percent of the private-sector contracts are special orders which are not possible for other companies to handle." The situation is different from those local construction firms which are fully dependent on public works projects, and directly hit by the introduction of open competitive bidding system. At the beginning of this year, the head of a super general contractor expressed a view in a magazine that, "Major contractors will survive while small and medium ones will go out of business," and was scolded by the Construction Ministry. While his remark was certainly inappropriate, the view prevails in the construction industry now that "the ministry's reaction to the remark was the reflection of the Construction Ministry's sense of crisis against the reorganization of the industry."
