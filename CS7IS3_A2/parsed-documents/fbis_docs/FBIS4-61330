Cornelius by ELTA under the "Loans" rubric; place and date not given: "IMF Does Not Waste Resources"] [Text] In October of 1993, the IMF Executive Council approved a program for Lithuania which is comprised of two parts -- the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum (continuous financial assistance) and the so-called system transformation loan. These resources are allocated to support Lithuania's economic reform which will be conducted for a year and a half -- from the middle of 1993 to late 1994. IMF representative in Lithuania P. Cornelius has commented on this assistance rendered by the IMF to an ELTA correspondent. [ELTA] What is the difference between an IMF loan extended according to the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum from that of system transformation? [Cornelius] According to system transformation loans, Lithuania can receive its quota of 50 percent, while according to the memorandum -- 25 percent (Lithuania's quota in the IMF is about $145 million). This money is paid in separate installments, that is, the total is not paid in bulk. The IMF extends system transformation loans mostly to those countries which are experiencing a so-called trade shock. Lithuania had this situation when oil and gas prices jumped to the world level. According to this loan, Lithuania's 25-percent quota, which is about $26 million, was paid out in October of 1993. The country received another $36-million quota according to the system transformation loan several weeks ago -- on 8 April. These finances must be utilized to settle payment balances. [ELTA] What about loans under the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum? [Cornelius] These are extended to Lithuania to enlarge its fund for stabilizing the national currency. Your country will receive this money in five installments. Lithuania received 5 percent of its quota -- $7 million -- in October of 1993. It will get the remaining 5-percent installments if it meets certain economic requirements. According to the requirements that Lithuania had to fulfill by late March of this year, another 5-percent installment must be paid out to Lithuania in mid May, while the remaining two -- in the middle of November, and in February of 1995. Lithuania can use this money in exceptional cases as domestic loans. Its key goal now is to enhance our trust in the newly established Currencies Council. [ELTA] IMF loans directly depend on the situation in the Lithuanian economy. How does the IMF Executive Council assess it? [Cornelius] Lithuania's great progress in stabilizing its macroeconomic situation is noticeable, particularly concerning inflation which has dropped to a monthly rate of 3-4 percent. There are very many signs proving that the economic operation of the state sector is reviving. Tendencies that make the entire economy more dynamic have intensified, and the private sector is developing and expanding rapidly. Before the establishment of the Currencies Council, Lithuanian banks toughened their monetary policy and noticeably reduced inflation. The fiscal policy is also very strict, and Lithuania's state budget is balanced. This also contributed to the stabilization of the macroeconomic system. One must also mention progress in terms of structure. Lithuania's move toward reform of import and export tariffs -- when import duties were abolished or reduced to a minimum -- is welcome. This will enhance the level of Lithuania's economic reliability and productivity. The replacement of the general excise tax with the value added tax, and the establishment of the Currencies Council will also have a favorable effect on the state budget. In our opinion, all these prominent changes ensue from economic progress and the correctly chosen economic policy, even though we must remain cautious. There are some spheres, however, on which Lithuania should focus more. These are privatization, reform in the financial sector, and the personal income tax. [ELTA] The Lithuanian economic policy memorandum is valid until the end of this year. We have heard that there are plans to draft another program for three years. [Cornelius] Discussions on the drafting of a new program for Lithuania are already under way. The Lithuanian Government has expressed a desire to draft this program according to the so-called extended IMF loan which would embrace three years of Lithuania's economic policy. Its key goal is to focus on structural issues. Thus far, we have discussed general guidelines with the Lithuanian Government, which could serve as the basis for providing an extended loan. An IMF mission is scheduled to arrive from Washington this Wednesday [20 Apr]. Its representatives along with the Lithuanian Government will specify the economic policy measures that Lithuania intends to adopt with the aim of receiving this loan. We believe that the IMF can provide an extended loan immediately after the term of the current economic policy memorandum expires. However, the drafting of a new program requires at least two IMF missions so as to discuss all the details in developing Lithuania's economy. [ELTA] What does the Lithuanian economy lack most of all to make its reform more rapid? [Cornelius] More attention should be devoted to the so-called structural reform and spheres that must be strengthened more rapidly. This is reform in the financial sector, laws on the Lithuanian Bank and commercial banks and their implementation, and the supervision and auditing of Lithuanian banks. We would like to see more favorable changes in privatization. Undoubtedly, the system of taxes and their collection must be considerably upgraded. [ELTA] When can the IMF suspend its assistance to Lithuania? [Cornelius] All changes in the Lithuanian economy are observed according to requirements that are set for each year and its quarter. This is the requirement to possess a certain amount of hard currency in the Lithuanian Bank, to repay foreign debts by fixed deadlines, and to settle the fiscal deficit. Lithuania is not allowed to possess a so-called growing debt to foreign countries. If these requirements were not satisfied, it is very unlikely that the IMF would continue its loans according to the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, because the IMF Executive Council reviews and assesses a country's economic situation before every payment. However, there is no such threat to Lithuania. [ELTA] The Lithuanian Government is sometimes reprimanded for executing the principles of the economic policy memorandum dictated by the IMF too blindly.... [Cornelius] I would like to stress that this is a program of the Lithuanian Government rather than of the IMF economic reform. We only assessed the economic situation in Lithuania and proposed the IMF Executive Council to back such economic reform. The fund has pledged to extend resources that would help to implement the Lithuanian economic policy memorandum, because the Executive Council has noticed great economic progress and successful reform in Lithuania. Therefore, the fear that Lithuania is fulfilling the IMF requirements alone is unfounded.
