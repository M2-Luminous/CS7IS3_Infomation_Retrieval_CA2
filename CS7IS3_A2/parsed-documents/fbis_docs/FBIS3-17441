FBIS3-17441 "drsov058__a94009" FBIS-SOV-94-058-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 March 1994 ANNEX Russia `Viewpoint' Report From Public Opinion Foundation LD1703131894 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1042 GMT 17 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD1703131894 Moscow INTERFAX Language: English Article Type:BFN ["Viewpoint" report; materials prepared by the Public Opinion Foundation, Viewpoint's sociological service, and the INTERFAX News Agency] [Text] "It is time for President Yeltsin to step down", believe 46% of the Russian city respondents. The notions "market," "reform," "renewal" are in the background of the Russian mentality. The Russians do not imagine a decent life without children, while the Americans without educated children. The reform acceleration means the transfer to regulated prices, believe almost 25% of the pro-acceleration repondents. Russian rich people may envy their American counterparts. Directors more often consider the work collective as the owner of a privatized enterprise, while the workers consider it is the director. As many as 49% of the polled Russian city residents believe high prices are better than the deficit. "IT IS TIME FOR PRESIDENT YELTSIN TO STEP DOWN", believe 46% of the polled residents of the Russian cities. Asked "Do you believe that it is time for President Yeltsin to step down?", the respondents answered in the following way: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |September 1993 (%) |February 1994 (%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yes |30 |46 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No |41 |34 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Undecided |29 |20 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thus, over six months the number of people who believe that it is time for President Yeltsin to resign increased by 16%. Their number has grown at the expense of those who earlier were against the resignation, and at the expense of those who earlier were undecided. NOTIONS "MARKET", "REFORM" AND "RENEWAL" AT THE BACKGROUND OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE MENTALITY During the poll conducted late last year, the 3483 respondents were suggested to underline the words which express in the best way their impression of a decent, happy life and Russia's renewal. No more than 9 out of 38 words were to be chosen. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |% |Ranking of importance | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Peace |56 |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Law and order |52 |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Safety |48 |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Family |46 |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Democracy |18 |21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Property |12 |28 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Market economy |8 |32 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Renewal |7 |33 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Reform |4 |37 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Among the outsiders are the words which symbolize changes. Sociologists have found that people of Russia are seeking calm and prosperity but only a few link these notions with the economic reforms going on in the country. RUSSIAN PEOPLE DO NOT IMAGINE HAPPY LIFE WITHOUT CHILDREN, WHILE THEIR AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS WITHOUT EDUCATED CHILDREN To the question: "What do you need for a happy life?" Americans and Russian answer in the following way (the first three places): ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |USA |Ranking of importance |Russia | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Own house |1 |Good health | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Car |2 |Happy marriage | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Happy marriage |3 |Children | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Children |4 |Much money | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Educated children |5 |Highly-paid job | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Interesting job |6 |Own flat | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Highly-paid job |7 |Stability, confidence in | | | |future | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Orchard, lawn |8 |Car | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Much money |9 |Own cottage in countrysi-| | | |de | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Colour TV-set |10 |Loyal friends | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Like the Russians, the Americans do not imagine a happy life without children. However, they attach much importance to the education of the young generation, while the Russians think in the last place about this (19th line in the list). People of Russia link more rarely than the Americans the happy life with the interesting job. The Russians place it the 16th on the list, the Americans place it above the highly-paid job. The Russians want to gain much money. Well, when it comes to money, the Russians say that much money is good for a decent life. The "loyal friends" are among the first ten component parts of the happy life. The Americans have no such point. Taking part in the poll held in November 1993 were 1472 inhabitants of the towns and villages of the Voronezh and Tula regions. In the United States that poll was conducted by the Roper Organization. "SPEEDING UP REFORMS MEANS TRANSFER TO REGULATED PRICES," believes one fourth of respondents backing such a speeding up. "Implementation of economic reforms in Russia should be sped up," believe 41% of respondents representing Russia's city residents. As many as 13% are in favor it their slowing down, and 16% believe that it's high time to stop the reforms. A total of 30% of the opinion poll participants found it difficult to answer this question. Those who spoke in favor of reforms' speeding up adhere to following notions regarding the essence of economic reforms (percentage of those who wish to speed up reforms): ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lowering of taxes |44 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Speeding up privatization |32 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Speeding up development of private se-|31 | |ctor | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Increasing salaries |26 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Stopping support to economically weak |23 | |enterprises | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Transfer to regulated prices |23 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Indexation of citizens' deposits in s-|15 | |aving banks | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Increase of pensions and benefits |13 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Found it difficult to answer |14 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sociologists believe that Russians still have no clear notion what is "the speeding up of economic reforms." Respondents had an opportunity to choose three answers; this should have increased the percentage of those who answered any of the proposed variants. More than one third of the respondents called "taxes' lowering." However, the population knows quite well that the reform must improve the life. That's why many of its supporters believe that it must improve their private well-being. There are different notions about the reform in the society: some people connect speeding up of the economic reform with their near term interests, expectations (increase of wages, transfer to regulated prices, etc.) and others -- with real changes in the economy's type. Analysts think that it is not by chance that "lowering of prices" received the first place. According to experts, those who think that the question concerns taxes of enterprises, those who perceived them as income taxes, those who think about the reform as about "a good life," and those who are concerned over the changes in the type of the economy have presented identical answers. People tried to introduce the facts which are going on in the country into the sphere of their interests, expectations, and wishes. As many as 1059 respondents living in various cities of Russia participated in the opinion poll held this February. THE RICH IN RUSSIA WILL ENVY THE RICH IN AMERICA..... if they consider the nation's attitude to them. Here's how the question: "Do you agree that the state must restrict the level of incomes earned by the wealthiest people?" put to American and Russian citizens was answered (% of the number of those questioned): ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Americans |Russians | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yes |9 |52 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No |83 |31 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Undecided |8 |17 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A majority of respondents in the USA are against restricting incomes. The Russians think differently. According to analysts, many Russians believe that this will help the poor. In the Russian Federation the poll was conducted among the urban and rural population in Voronezh and Tula Regions last November. 1472 persons were questioned. In the USA it was sponsored by The Roper Organization (Roper reports 92-2). DIRECTORS VIEW LABOR STAFFS AS OWNERS OF PRIVATIZED FACILITY, WHILE WORKERS BELIEVE THAT DIRECTORS ARE THE OWNERS This conclusion can be made after reviewing answers to the following question: "Who is the real owner of privatized facility in your view?" (% of the number of those questioned). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Directors |Workers | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |It's the director |7 |25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |It's the labor staff |43 |24 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This question related to the privatization formula under which most shares are in the hands of the labor staff. According to analysts, the difference in the views of the directors and the workers shows that in the near future the real process of privatization may give rise to confrontations or conflicts between the leaders of privatized facilities and their rank-and- file members. The poll was conducted at the end of last year; it involved 3483 respondents. 49% OF RESPONDENTS IN RUSSIAN CITIES PREFER HIGH PRICES TO SHORTAGES "What do you prefer: shortages of goods with low prices, or availability of goods with high prices?" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Shortages of goods with low prices |25% | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Availability of goods with high prices|49% | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Undecided |26% | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When people are invited to make a choice: whether to return to the past, to the empty shops of 1991, or remain in the present with its supermarkets which in the past could be seen only on television screens, not simply evaluate the reforms, a majority of respondents opt for the present after all. Much fewer people wish to return to the past. The poll was conducted among Russia's urban population last February; it involved 1204 respondents.
