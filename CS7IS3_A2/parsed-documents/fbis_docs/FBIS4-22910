Tubinis, ``Radioactive Container''] [Text] A radioactive container was detected in the territory of the former Severnyy camp where first a Soviet, and later a Russian division had been headquartered for many years at the center of Vilnius. It is reported that the source is emitting 3,300 ï¿½R/h. It is not clear how it appeared there since after the transfer the territory was carefully examined by experts. Much has been written about the harm inflicted to Lithuania by the former Soviet Army, and each case of environmental damage is carefully documented. Lithuanian experts have long suspected that radioactive substances may remain in the territory of former military units, but even in the camps which house missile divisions, nothing has been found thus far. The problem mostly amounted to soil contamination with petroleum products. Here, the military units indeed ``worked hard.'' In some places, the soil was penetrated so deep that cleanup calls for enormous hard currency outlays. A lot of petroleum products penetrated the soil even in the territory of the Severnyy camp. This was established by environmental experts. Yet this contamination did not pose a serious problem for the future of this territory. The municipal administration has decided to set up the largest business center in the region on this spot with offices, hotels, and banks. I do not think that the unpleasant finding will destroy these cheerful prospects.
