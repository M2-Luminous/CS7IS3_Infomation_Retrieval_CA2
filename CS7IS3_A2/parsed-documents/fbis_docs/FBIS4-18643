At the Marrakesh meeting of the 121 GATT countries (from 12 to 15 April), he will call on the trading partners to solve these problems in a discussion, which should be characterized by mutual understanding, says a statement by Rexrodt, who is currently in India, which was published in Bonn on Thursday [7 April]. The interrelations between trade and environment as well as trade and labor or social standards are highly political fields of negotiation, which are extremely sensitive for the developing countries. The minister had already come out against social dumping and against sanctions to have trade advantages of the developing countries reduced, e.g. in the textile sector, which they get because of their relatively low wages. The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has called on the Federal Government to follow the United States and agree to the new World Trade Organization, WTO, the successor of GATT, only if certain minimum standards for working people's rights are agreed beforehand. SPD Deputy Hans Buettner stated: "Free trade union work, the right to freely negotiable minimum wages, as well as a minimum of labor protection are the precondition for a fair exchange of goods and services."
