The "100-Scientist Program" will adopt public recruitment with the aim of selecting about 100 outstanding young scientists all over the country. Scientists under 45 years old can apply to join the program. They are expected to become leading members of major research projects in the next century. It is said that 10 to 15 such scientists will be selected each year for the program. CAS will apply preferential treatment in research expenditure, housing and salaries for the program members. A special leading group for the program has been set up at CAS. The members working in state key research centers and laboratories will be selected from those conducting research into new sciences, multi-disciplinary sciences, frontier sciences and key projects. In recent years CAS has carried out a series of training programs for young scientists. Now some 56 percent of scientists at the academy are under 45. And senior researchers under 45 accounted for ten percent of CAS's total.
