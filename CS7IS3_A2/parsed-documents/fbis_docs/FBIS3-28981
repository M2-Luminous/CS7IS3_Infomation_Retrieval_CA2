The source said the Cabinet, on 2 November last year, resolved that the Ministries of Defence, Commerce, Agriculture, and Foreign Affairs negotiate with the Italian government to barter farm produce for six G-222 planes on behalf of the Royal Thai Air Force. But to date, the ministries have not been able to finalise details of an agreement with the Italians and further delay will likely mean that the price of the aircraft will become too expensive. The aircraft, worth about 3.4 billion baht including spare parts and the cost of training, would be accounted for in the fiscal period to 1998. To accelerate the barter process, the Defence Ministry has proposed the Cabinet assign the ministry to handle the task. Alternatively it suggested waiting until the four ministries come up with some solutions, but this would have to be soon. According to the source, the Defense Ministry preferred forwarding the issue for debate by the Cabinet, so as to avoid further delay.
