While secretly approaching the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] members who are expected to leave the LDP, it is hastily making efforts to improve circumstances for a merger with the Japan New Party [JNP]. Sakigake has been spurred to activity by such factors as its sense of crisis about Shinseito's attempt to strengthen its power within the ruling coalition by luring JNP members, and about the fact that Shinseito and Komeito have taken initiatives in policymaking within the ruling coalition on such issues as how to handle political reform bills in the Diet. Thinking that House of Representatives elections will be held following the passage of the political reform bills, Sakigake has drawn up a political realignment scenario under which the party will: 1) hasten a merger with the JNP, a pending issue between the two parties; 2) call on the LDP members who advocate electoral reform to join Sakigake; and 3) join hands at the final stage with some of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] members to establish a new party with a membership of about 100. In mid-November, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa (also JNP representative) "urged" Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and Sakigake representative, to realize a merger between the two parties. However, Takemura said "there are different views (within the JNP)." As stated by Takemura, there are two groups in the JNP, one which supports the merger with Sakigake and the other which takes a negative stance on the merger. Sakigake plans to do its utmost to obtain consent from the latter group to the merger. Sakigake believes that about 30 LDP members are prepared to leave he LDP. Of them, Sakigake has frequently made contacts with 20 or so LDP members close to them, including a group led by Masayasu Kitagawa, telling them that "we would like to form a political group composed of those who take the same political stance" while watching carefully the developments of the electoral reform debate. Sakigake also gropes for measures to form an alliance with "Democrats," a new political group composed of right-wing and neutral factions of the SDPJ. Moreover, it has frequently held study meetings with "Group C&C," a political group within the DSP composed of former labor union members. Sakigake aims to achieve a "moderate multiparty" political system, taking a different stance from Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa and others who propose a "two-party system." Based on this stand, Sakigake will prepare for the second phase of political realignment. On joining hands with DSP members, a senior Sakigake official said: "We will contact only those who do not belong to a group led by DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa, who is close to Ozawa." With the participation by independent lower house member Koichiro Genba, Sakigake has become the third largest force in the ruling coalition, placing the DSP behind it. Genba was initially expected to join Shinseito. It is likely that friction between Sakigake and Shinseito and between Sakigake and some DSP groups will inevitably intensify in the future.
