He stressed that all efforts should be aimed first at securing a cease-fire. Asked about the possibility of restoring Kuwaiti-Iraqi relations if Iraqi President Saddam Husayn announces in a clear statement that Kuwait is a free independent state which Iraqi has nothing to do with, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said: The Iraqi president must announce that and register this recognition in the Security Council and the United Nations first. Because there are no relations between the two countries at the bilateral level. And there are Security Council resolutions which Iraq must comply with and implement first. On lifting the embargo in Iraq and the Security Council's remarks in this connection, he said: We have nothing to do with that issue, and the council must decide what it deems right in accordance with the resolution adopted by it. On Arab reconciliation he said that it still needs time, especially in view of the current deteriorating Arab conditions, as the region is full of problems and disputes which should be resolved first.
