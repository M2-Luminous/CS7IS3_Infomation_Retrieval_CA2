Some of Its Colleagues Promise To Follow Its Commandments"] [Text] At yesterday evening's news conference in the Rossiya Hotel well-known opposition leaders presented a "Statement by Leaders of Parties and Public Organizations 'On the Illegitimacy of the Constitution Submitted to the Referendum by B. Yeltsin.'" In the opinion of the authors of the statement, the constitution restores an authoritarian system; it was cooked "in the president's kitchen" and was adopted with extremely gross violations not only of the 1978 Constitution but even the 1990 Referendum Law, namely: the election commissions were formed on the decision of the executive branch; they openly campaigned in favor of the constitution; and the opposition was not given access to the media, while the vote count was conducted incorrectly and with widespread rigging. Therefore the politicians who had invited the journalists proposed that the constitution be deemed illegitimate. The Federal Assembly, however, in their opinion may work, but work only with one goal -- to approve the law on elections to the Constituent Assembly which in its turn will adopt a new and "fair" constitution. The statement was signed by Rumyantsev, Aksyuchits, Pavlov, Astafyev, and other well-known opponents of the presidential team representing the National Salvation Front, the Constitutional Democrats, the Russian People's Union, the Russian Christian Democratic Movement, and other organizations of similar orientation. What makes the statement special, however, according to the meeting's organizers, is not the fact that it bears a few signatures by newly elected deputies to the Federal Assembly (for instance, Mr. Baburin) but the promise to join the signatories given by leaders of the Agrarian Party and the communists. Thus, according to Mr. Rumyantsev, the agrarians were among the initiators of working out the document, while according to Mr. Pavlov, not only communist leader Zyuganov expressed a wish to sign the document, but even a party plenary session has already made a corresponding decision. Therefore, in the opinion of the press conference organizers, the first sessions of the State Duma will follow not the presidential scenario wherein "Mr. Filatov wags his finger to tell the deputies to engage in organizational matters for two months" but, to the contrary, they will proceed according to the plan devised by the authors of the statement. With just a day to go before the opening of the Duma the opponents of the Yeltsin team are sure that the objective of many factions and deputies will be to analyze the question of their own legitimacy in light of the events of last September-October, which will naturally come into conflict with the goals of the president's supporters. Because as of now, according to Mr. Rumyantsev, we have "a powerless Duma," this opposition inside it will not immediately lead to the goals declared in the statement -- the adoption of a law on the Constituent Assembly and a new, "democratic" constitution. In these conditions special importance will be taken on not so much by opposition to the government course in the Duma as by extra parliamentary struggle wherein a weighty word will be spoken by politicians not elected as deputies, that is to say, an overwhelming majority of signatories to the document that was promulgated to the press. Such hopes are surely not devoid of certain reason. Even coming from outstanding parliamentarians of the recent past, however, they appear rather to be illusions since the movements represented in the Federal Assembly certainly have their own cadre plans, including with respect to activity outside the State Duma. And although the upcoming Duma debates cannot possibly be called cool, it seems that the factions in opposition to the government will follow the path proposed by their colleagues with no deputy mandates precisely up to the point where their fervor results in an undesirable and irreversible buildup of pressure in the Duma boiler.
