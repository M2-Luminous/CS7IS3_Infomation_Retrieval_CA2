Abstract: THe 1988 amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) require pesticide registrants to pay an annual fee for each pesticide registered with EPA. To aid in the collection of these fees, EPA will send a maintenance fee filing form (EPA Form No. 8570&hyph;30 and instructions) to each registrant. The registrants must complete this form and return it to the Agency. The Agency uses the information to ensure that the fees prescribed by the recent revisions to FIFRA have been paid by each registrant. These data are also used to ensure proper adjustment to the Agency's computer files. The files are updated to reflect changes in the status of registrations resulting from registrants responses. Burden Statement: The burden for this collection of information is estimated to average less than one hour per response. This estimate includes the time needed to review instructions, gather the data needed, complete the form and review the collection of information. Respondents: Pesticide Product Registrants.
