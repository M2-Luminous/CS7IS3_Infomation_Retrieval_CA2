This was reported in an interview with Interfax on Thursday by the Ministry's Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin. He recalled that at their meeting on Bosnia in London on Tuesday [26 April], experts from Russia, US, EU, and UN had decided to set up a contact group for work with the conflicting parties. "This tallies with the plan suggested by Russia of further joint steps. This design provides for work at expert level to pave the way for a meeting between the foreign ministers of Russia, US, and EC countries, and subsequently for a summit on a Bosnian settlement," Karasin said. In his words, such a contact group is already at work. Russia is represented in it by the First Deputy Director of the Foreign Ministry's European Department Alexey Nikiforov, the United States by the President's Special Envoy Charles Redman. Other participants in the contact will be represented at the same level. According to Karasin, Nikiforov will take over from Churkin the bulk of technical work. Churkin will be called in only for crucial decisions, Karasin explained. In the words of yet another senior Russian diplomat, Churkin, who is known as the "Moscow shuttle" abroad, will still be responsible for events in Yugoslavia at the Russian Foreign Ministry but will apparently scale down his trips abroad.
