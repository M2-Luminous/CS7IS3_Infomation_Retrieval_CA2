FR940825-2-00192 FR940825-2-00112 Past efforts in opening up developing technology to include access for persons with communication disabilities have been retrospective rather than prospective. Too frequently telecommunications technologies are developed and become widely used before consumers who have communication disabilities become aware of the barriers they inadvertently contain. There is a need to affect the development of telecommunications technology, regulations, and standards in order to promote the incorporation of universal design features. Furthermore, there is a need to communicate information routinely to appropriate researchers, manufacturers, and other major contributors to communication technology that will contribute to the development of accessible telecommunications devices and systems. The need for special customer-premised equipment will be reduced when international standards include features that make general-market products accessible to persons with communications disabilities. Technological advances in the field of telecommunications, both in this country and internationally, have the potential to represent either new opportunities to disabled people or new barriers. This proposed RERC shall work closely with developers and manufacturers to enhance awareness of how emerging telecommunications developments can be modified to incorporate features that are directly responsive to the special needs of individuals with communication disabilities. Applicants for this priority must demonstrate knowledge of the history and present roles of various Government agencies in telecommunications and electronic equipment accessibility, such as NIDRR, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), the General Services Administration (GSA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA). Applicants must also demonstrate a knowledge of other NIDRR-funded programs studying issues of persons with communications impairments as well as related information databases, private national and international organizations, such as the United States Telephone Association and the Telecommunications Industries Association and the International Telecommunication Union's Technology unit (ITU&hyph;T). Proposed Priority An RERC on universal telecommunications access shall_ â€¢Undertake a systems engineering analysis of emerging telecommunications technology (such as signal compression, analog to digital systems transitions, satellite transmission, development of a national information infrastructure, telecommunity living, voice-to-print, Mosaic and Windows multimedia interfaces, etc.) to identify potential technological barriers and marketplace disincentives for persons with communication disabilities, and, based on these analyses, identify and develop universal design strategies to avoid these barriers;
