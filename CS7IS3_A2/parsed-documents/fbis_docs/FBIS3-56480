He spoke in an interview with Interfax on Friday. Ukraine's debt for fuel imports from Russia ran at more than 1 Tn rubles as of December 1, 1993, according to Russia's government statistical committee. Earlier in the day, Kozyrev told Interfax that Kiev would receive fuel grade uranium for its nuclear reactors but "any write-off of the Ukrainian debt is out of the question." For his own part, President Kravchuk, speaking at a news conference in the Ukrainian embassy on Friday, said Moscow was committed to compensating Ukraine both for long range and tactical nuclear weapons. Kravchuk said Ukraine is to receive compensation in fuel grade uranium for the withdrawal of the long range weapons from its territory but Moscow will be solely in charge of exports of 500 tons of the uranium reprocessed from the nuclear warheads. The Ukrainian leader said experts on the three sides were yet to define the amount and form of compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from Ukraine. He believes one option is to write off Kiev's debt for fuel imports from Russia. As he rejected Kozyrev's statement, the Ukrainian minister said the write off formula was laid down in the tripartite agreement.
