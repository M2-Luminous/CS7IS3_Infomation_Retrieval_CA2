The LDP said in a statement that the ruling parties are to blame for the current situation of "political anarchy." The statement, adopted at a meeting of all LDP members in the House of Representatives, expressed sympathy with the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which declared early Tuesday that it is quitting the coalition. "The LDP, as a similar parliamentary political party, can understand the SDP's firm stand to bloc high-handed political management," the statement said. Meanwhile, LDP President Yohei Kono told reporters that a major change has emerged in the coalition, saying "an insincere act was done to a coalition member." "Is it okay to entrust the future of the people to such an insincere government which employs high-handed political methods? We cannot help but answer 'no'," Kono said. The LDP joined the opposition camp last August after 38 years of uninterrupted rule.
