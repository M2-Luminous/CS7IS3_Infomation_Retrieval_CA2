Zou Jiahua delivered a speech at the banquet. He said: Canadian Prime Minister Chretien's treating the development of relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific Region as the major point of Canada's foreign policy will promote the development of Sino-Canadian economic relations and trade. The potential for developing Sino- Canadian relations is tremendous. Zou Jiahua hoped that Chinese people in Canada will continue to play the role of a bridge promoting friendship between the Chinese and Canadian peoples. He also briefed those present at the banquet on China's domestic situation. Eggleton, president of Canada's Federal Treasury Board, attended the banquet. In his speech he said: Canada must rely on all people, including the Chinese people present at the banquet, for its economic development; it cannot rely on only mayors and governors. The activities of Chinese people play a very important role in strengthening Sino-Canadian relations. Chinese people in the Toronto area are very active. This is one of the reasons for Toronto's success. Eggleton also said the Canadian Government will seize the opportunity to develop Sino-Canadian relations. Representatives of local Chinese people also took the floor at the welcoming banquet.
