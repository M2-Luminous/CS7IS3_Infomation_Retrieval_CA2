"The opposite is the case. The results of the investigation must be made public as quickly as possible," he said yesterday when commenting on reports in ILTA SANOMAT that the government is trying to keep the "report on the repercussions" secret. The report says that a section of industry would move abroad, as would many jobs. Nor would there be new investment in a Finland that had placed itself outside the European Union. According to Salolainen, the reason why the government has not made the report public is that the work on it is still continuing. For example, the sections on agriculture, regional policy, and foreign policy are still only half finished. The report, sections of which have now leaked out to the general public, is the report that the government commissioned in spring 1993 and that is to figure in the EU debate prior to the referendum later this year.
