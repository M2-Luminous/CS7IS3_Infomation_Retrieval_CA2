Experts feel that poverty is ancestral since its origins date back 500 years. Oaxaca State has a poverty level of 11 percent and is the poorest state in the country. Mexico City, with a poverty level of 0.1 percent, is the least impoverished. Chiapas State's 111 municipalities are poor. It is the second most impoverished state in the country. The poverty there, as anywhere else, generates ignorance. There is poverty, not misery, in Chiapas. Poverty and the ignorance of those suffering from its consequences have become a breeding ground for professional terrorists who have pit the people of Chiapas -- luckily a minority of them -- against their institutions. Rural areas have the highest poverty levels in this state. Monoculture is the chief occupation of the people here. [passage omitted] It is in these areas where the level of production and service infrastructure is very low. About 60 percent of Chiapas residents live in rural areas. Moreover, 99 percent of the state's 16,400 towns are rural. Poverty in Chiapas has many indicators. For instance, 60 percent of the economically active population earns minimum wages. Indians make up one-fifth of the population. Also, 19 percent of the people have no income. The illiteracy rate is 30 percent. There are no roads. [passage omitted] [Lopez] Chiapas has a population of approximately 3.6 million. The current strife zone is located in six of its 111 municipalities. Four of these municipalities have a population of a little more than 360,000 persons, or 11.8 percent of the population. The majority of the people in Ocosingo, San Cristobal de las Casas, Las Margaritas, and Comitan de Dominguez, the site of last week's clashes, work the land. That is where one cause of the conflict lies. With almost nonexistent land reform following the victory of the revolution and inadequate land distribution during the Cardenas eras, pressure on the land has displaced a large number of people, mostly Indians.
