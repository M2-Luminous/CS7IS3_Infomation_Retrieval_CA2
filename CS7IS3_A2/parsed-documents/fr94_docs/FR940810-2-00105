On November 1, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, a proposed rule change to modify the operational features of the SelectNet service. 1 On May 3, 1994, the Commission issued an order instituting proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the NASD's proposed rule change. 2 1 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33141 (Nov. 3, 1993), 58 FR 59504 (Nov. 9, 1993). The NASD originally filed the proposed rule change on October 25, 1993, pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. On October 29, 1993, the Commission issued an Order of Summary Abrogation abrogating the NASD's October 25th rule change. The Commission's Order of Summary Abrogation suggested that the procedures provided by Section 19(b)(2) of the Act provide a more appropriate mechanism for determining whether the NASD's rule change is consistent with the Act. Thus, on November 1, 1993, the NASD refiled its rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(2). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34000 (May 3, 1994); 59 FR 23909 (May 9, 1994). By a letter dated July 25, 1994, the NASD advised the Commission of its decision to withdraw its SelectNet filing, SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;63. 3 The Commission has considered the letter from the NASD as a request for the Commission to terminate the proceeding to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change. Accordingly, based on the NASD's decision to withdraw its proposal SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;61, the proceeding to determine whether to disapprove is hereby terminated. 3 Letter from Robert E. Aber, Vice President and General Counsel, The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., to Michael Ryan, SEC (July 25, 1994). By the Commission. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
