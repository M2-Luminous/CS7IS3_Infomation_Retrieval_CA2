FR940817-2-00080 FR940817-2-00043 Next, the nonautomotive contribution to PM 4 Mn was estimated and added to the estimated automotive contribution to obtain the projected personal exposure levels of total PM 4 Mn. Assuming the estimated PM 4 Mn distribution has the same form as the PM 10 Mn distribution from PTEAM (approximately lognormal with equal geometric standard deviations), the ratio of the PM 4 :PM 10 arithmetic mean personal exposure levels yields a scaling factor that can be applied to the PM 10 distribution to obtain the PM 4 distributions. Because of the alternative bases for adjusting the SIM PM 2.5 data for personal exposures (as noted above), two different scaling factors were multiplied by the PM 10 distribution, thereby producing a higher and a lower estimate of the distribution of 24-hour average PM 4 Mn personal exposure levels. In addition, because long-term exposures are likely to have less variance than 24-hour exposures, it is appropriate to adjust the distributions of 24-hour average exposure levels to better reflect longer periods of exposure. Of various methods that may be used for this purpose (Wallace et al., 1994), two approaches were applied to adjust the geometric standard deviations of the two projected exposure distributions, based on data from either the PTEAM study or the smaller pilot study that preceded the PTEAM Riverside study. These alternative methods were applied to the two estimated distributions of 24-hour average exposures to yield the distributions of long-term average PM 4 Mn personal exposure levels depicted as lines 1 and 2 in Figure 2 (only the highest and lowest of the four resulting estimates are shown). It must be emphasized that these two distributions do not represent upper and lower bounds, because even higher or lower estimates could be produced by alternative assumptions and adjustments of the data. Moreover, if data were available for another time of the year (e.g., spring in addition to fall), the estimates would not be season-specific and could possibly be much higher or much lower. Nevertheless, given the limited available data, lines 1 and 2 in Figure 2 represent two reasonable estimates of the projected long-term (autumnal) personal exposure levels of PM 4 Mn in relation to MMT usage at 1/32 g Mn/gal in 100% of unleaded gasoline.
