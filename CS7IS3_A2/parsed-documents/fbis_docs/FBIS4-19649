The best proof of it is not provided by the 37 victims of Serbian shells on Sunday [17 April] in Gorazde alone, but the suggestions by French Foreign Minister Juppe on the following day: The United States, the United Nations, the European Union [EU], and Russia should set up a study group for the sake of defining a joint position. In plain English: Everything remains the way it is. Juppe said literally: France is "neither for resignation nor for escalation." Meanwhile, the Serbs are not planning a study group, but continue their attacks against the UN safe haven (!) of Gorazde with twice as much rage. The UNHCR has reported that a shell is hitting the city center every 20 seconds. After the collapse of the Muslim resistance, General Rose, the commander of the blue helmets, has spoken of a "catastrophe." And the Security Council in New York has expressed its "regret": about the obstruction and blockade of UN personnel. Of course, it also "condemned" the "escalating military activities" of the Serbs. Who is to blame for these terrible events? The answer is simple: all those who had the possibility to act. The severest tactical mistake was made on Friday by Yasushi Akashi, the supreme UN civilian on location. Believing that the Serbs would keep their cease-fire pledge, he denied Gen. Rose the requested air support. On Saturday, Serbian tanks forced their way through Gorazde. On Sunday, Akashi was duped again: The Serbs again promised to withdraw, but again used the break to better prepare their attack. World history is not made by public servants, however. Akashi read the signs of the times very well, which had been indicating for days that his bosses in the United Nations -- the superpowers -- had stripped him of his power to act and sign on behalf of the firm. After the two half-hearted U.S. bomber attacks, America's determination was exhausted again: On Friday, Clinton made it known that one did not want to involve NATO "in this war to create advantages for one or the other side." This was the response to the supplication of the Muslims --and it was music to the ears of the Serbs. On Saturday, when they got away with shooting down a British Harrier and attacked a British post, the direction in which they were heading was clear: Gorazde. And the Russians? Their dubious game -- one day a mediator, the other a water bearer -- is the most important background factor of the tragedy: The harsh words from Moscow have intimidated the West, which has not been very resolute to begin with, and encouraged the Serbs, who have reacted sensibly to any shift of force. Today, Russian mediator Churkin is "deeply disappointed." Never before have "so many (Serbian) promises been broken in such a short time." In view of their dual-track diplomacy, the sympathy with the Russians has to be limited. In the hour of truth, they and the West showed that the "international community" is nothing more but the sum total of conflicting interests.
