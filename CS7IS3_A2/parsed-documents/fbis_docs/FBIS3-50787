Colosio already sent the draft text based on agreements reflected in the statements of the various candidates in condemning violence in the State of Chiapas. The text, if approved by all parties -- Cecilia Soto of the Labor Party, Marcela Lombardo of the Popular Socialist Party, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, Jorge Gonzalez Torres of the Mexican Green Ecologist Party, Rafael Aguilar Talamantes of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, and Pablo Emilio Madero of the Mexican Democratic Party -- the joint declaration would state: No conflict, no difference, no aspiration should be reason to break social peace and jeopardize the life of Mexicans. The declaration adds that violence only generates rancor, division, and loss of human life; everyone loses with violence. The joint declaration of the presidential candidates adds that social underdevelopment [rezagos] angers everyone; it is a national priority to overcome this. We can only achieve this, however, when there is stability and harmony in community life. We are a nation that loves liberty, that believes in dialogue and peaceful coexistence, and that rejects bloodshed as a means of settling differences. The declaration also states that the repudiation of violence in Chiapas reaffirms the humanistic nature of our people. We urge, the declaration states, those who are operating outside the framework of the law to respect the legal state that we Mexicans established and thus achieve the lofty goals of the nation.
