Their support for the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], he believes, is aimed at taking the issue to the Security Council for it to acknowledge the secession. In a statement to AL-SAFIR at his place of residence in Paris, where he seeks meetings with French officials, 'Abd-al-Ghani stressed that what is taking place in Yemen now "was not born on the spur of moment, but is the natural result of several steps made by the YSP, especially during and after the signing of the Pledge and Accord document in Amman." [passage omitted] Asked why the YSP is blamed for the war, 'Abd-al-Ghani said: "Since the signing of the Pledge and Accord document in Jordan, 'Ali Salim al-Bid has been preparing for secession. He ordered that the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade be besieged, and he wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia immediately after the signing to say that the military situation dictated secession. But the Army's Signal Corps, which was united, discovered the scheme, and the Jordanian hospitality forced al-Bid to stay in Amman longer than he expected. [no closing quotation marks as published] Asked whether al-Bid and Saudi Arabia had agreed in advance about the secession, the northern official answered: "Al-Bid himself said that in an interview to a Gulf newspaper. Indeed, he later blamed his brothers in the Gulf because they had abandoned him. All this indicates that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates have something to do, near or far, with what is taking place." He added: "Perhaps no one likes to see his neighbor stronger than himself. Perhaps the discovery of oil helped strengthen the feelings of anxiety in the neighboring countries, which still attach great importance to the land. We suspect that some countries are working to divide Yemen, not only into two parts, but into many regions." He said: "Calls by the Gulf countries to impose a cease-fire on the Yemeni Government are aimed at portraying the government as objector to a cease-fire. This would help bring the issue to the Security Council, and perhaps lead the latter to recognize the status quo and to the provision of direct and public support for the southerners." [passage omitted] Concerning other foreign interventions affecting developments in Yemen, 'Abd-al-Ghani suggested that the Egyptian position is vague and directly linked to the Saudi position. He said the claim that Iraq is supporting the north contains much fabrication and falsehood. "How can one believe al-Bid's claim that Baghdad sent us warplanes when no Iraqi Air Force plane can take off without the permission of the international forces?" he asked. 'Abd-al-Ghani also noted the negative Russian position, reflected by the absence of the Russian ambassador from 'Abd-al-Ghani's meeting with the ambassadors of the Security Council permanent member states. This position, 'Abd-al-Ghani said, proceeds from Russia's economic interests in the Gulf states. As regard to the United States and Britain "they have no interest in breaking up Yemen unless interests are given precedence over principles and stability of nations." He denied that the current situation has isolated the Yemeni president. He said: "Our contacts with the Gulf states and other countries have continued, and we are intensifying initiatives to stop the bloodshed among the sons of the homeland." He added: "Let us assume that we made a mistake in the past. We apologized, but we cannot continue to endlessly pay a price." 'Abd-al-Ghani ruled out the involvement of the Islamic trends or tribes in the situation. He explained: "Al-Bid tried to suggest that Islamic trends are influencing the decisions of the president and that Yemen will turn into an Islamic country like Sudan, but the facts disprove this, just as they prove that the legitimate army is alone in the battlefield. We are avoiding bringing the tribes into the conflict or arming the people because we are not engaged in a civil war." The northern official stressed that the oil wells are far from the centers of the struggle "and that Washington asked for them to be neutralized."
