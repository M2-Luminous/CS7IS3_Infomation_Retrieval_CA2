FR941102-0-00048 FR941102-0-00008 II. Background Section 2(a)(1)(B)(v) of the CEA, 7 which was adopted as part of the Futures Trading Act of 1982, 8 provides that it is unlawful to trade a futures contract on an individual security unless that security is an exempted security under Section 3 of the Securities Act or Section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act. 9 These sections of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act explicitly designate certain securities, including government securities and municipal securities, as exempted securities. Securities issued by foreign governments, however, are not ``government securities'' within the meaning of the federal securities laws. 10 Therefore, securities issued by foreign governments are not deemed to be exempted securities under the statutory language. 7 7 U.S.C. 2(1)(B)(v) (1991). 8 Pub. L. No. 97&hyph;444, 96 Stat. 2294, 7 U.S.C. 1 et seq. [codified at 7 U.S.C. 2(a)]. 9 Section 2(a)(1)(B)(v) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 2(1)(B)(v) (1991), provides that ``[n]o person shall offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm the execution of any contract of sale (or option on such contract) for future delivery of any security, or interest therein or based on the value thereof, except an exempted security under Section 3 of the Securities Act *␣*␣* or Section 3(a)(12) of the [Exchange Act] *␣*␣*.'' 10 See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(42), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(42) (defining the term ``government security'' for purposes of the Exchange Act). Section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act, however, provides the Commission with the authority to designate other securities as exempted securities, either unconditionally or for specified purposes. 11 Rule 3a12&hyph;8 was adopted in 1984 12 pursuant to this exemptive authority in order to facilitate the trading of futures contracts on securities of foreign governments by U.S. persons. 13 As originally adopted, the Rule provided that debt obligations of Canada and the United Kingdom would be deemed to be exempted securities, solely for the purpose of permitting the offer, sale, and confirmation of ``qualifying foreign futures contracts'' on such securities, so long as the securities in question were neither registered under the Securities Act nor the subject of any American Depositary Receipt so registered. A futures contract on such a debt obligation is deemed under the Rule to be a ``qualifying foreign futures contract'' if delivery under the contract is settled outside the United States and is traded on a board of trade. 14 11 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12). 12 Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 20708 (``Adopting Release'') (March 2, 1984), 49 FR 8595 (March 8, 1984) and 19811 (``Proposing Release'') (May 25, 1983), 48 FR 24725 (June 2, 1983). 13 The marketing and trading of foreign futures contracts to U.S. persons is subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''). In particular, Section 4b of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 6b, authorizes the CFTC to regulate the offer and sale of foreign futures contracts to U.S. persons, and Rule 9, 17 CFR 30.9, promulgated under Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 2(1)(A), is intended to prohibit fraud in connection with the offer and sale to U.S. persons of futures contracts executed on foreign exchanges. Additional rules promulgated under Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 2(1)(A), govern the domestic offer and sale of futures and options contracts traded on foreign boards of trade. These rules require, among other things, that the domestic offer and sale of foreign futures be effected through CFTC registrants or through entities subject to a foreign regulatory framework comparable to that governing domestic futures trading. See 17 CFR 30.3, 30.4, and 30.5 (1991). In enacting the Futures Trading Act of 1982, Congress expressed its understanding that neither the SEC nor the CFTC had intended to bar the sale of futures contracts on debt obligations of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (``United Kingdom'') to U.S. persons, and its expectation that administrative action would be taken to allow the sale of such futures contracts in the United States. See Proposing Release, supra note 12, 48 FR at 24725 [citing 128 Cong. Rec. H7492 (daily ed. September 23, 1982) (statements of Representatives Daschle and Wirth)]. 14 As originally adopted, the Rule required that the board of trade be located in the country that issued the underlying securities. This requirement was eliminated in 1987. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24209 (March 12, 1987), 52 FR 8875 (March 20, 1987). The conditions imposed by the Rule were intended to facilitate the trading of futures contracts on foreign government securities without sacrificing the longstanding policy under the federal securities laws of requiring foreign government securities to comply with the basic requirements of the federal securities laws in order to be marketed and traded in the United States. Accordingly, the conditions set forth in the Rule were designed to ensure that, absent registration, a domestic market in unregistered foreign government securities would not develop, and that markets for futures on these instruments would not be used to avoid the registration requirements and other provisions of the federal securities laws.
