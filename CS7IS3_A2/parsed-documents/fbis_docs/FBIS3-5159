After his arrival in Phnom Penh the king will organize a ceremony to mark the 90th anniversary of his late mother, Queen Sisowath Kosomak, to be held in the royal palace one day after his arrival. In this message the king says that he plans to meet with Cambodian Government leaders and the Throne Council. Apart from this, the king will remain in Cambodia in order to receive credentials from various ambassadors, who were recently appointed, such as the envoy from Great Britain. The king will also stay on to take part in the new year celebrations, a tradition of the Cambodian nation. Apart from this, the prince father will also receive an important guest. This is the state visit by the prime minister of Malaysia, who will shortly visit Cambodia. [passage omitted] Before returning to Phnom Penh in early April, the king will leave Beijing for Pyongyang, North Korea, for a three- or four-day visit and then leave from there for Phnom Penh. The king, however, says that Chinese doctors have asked him to return to Beijing in June to continue his medical treatment. The king notes that: "I am a lot better from the cancer in the bone marrow in my back." I am far from being cured as concerns the cancerous marrow bone in my back. [preceding sentence in English] King Norodom Sihanouk specifies that he can no longer continue his writing or his other literary activities because "I have become an old man who is sick, weak, and very fragile." It is to be noted that King Norodom Sihanouk underlines the words very fragile [preceding two words in English]. The essence of this message was excerpted and printed in the CAMBODIA DAILY BULLETIN published in Phnom Penh in three languages. This bulletin also reveals that a palace official in Phnom Penh affirmed on 28 February that the king plans to return to Phnom Penh on 8 April. This official, however, did not give a schedule of King Norodom Sihanouk's visit to Pyongyang. He only said that "it is a tradition for the king to travel to Pyongyang close to 15 April, a date which coincides with the birthday of Kim Il-song."
