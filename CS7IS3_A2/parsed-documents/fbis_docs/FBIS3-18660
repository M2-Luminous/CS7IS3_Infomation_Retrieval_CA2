In an interview with ET-1, Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou repeated that Greece wants dialogue, not concessions. [Begin recording] [Papandreou] For two years now, the international community did not deal with this issue as a serious problem, and there was a de facto acceptance of things that affected Greece and international law. There was an offensive propaganda, a big idealism by Skopje that unfortunately caused instability in the region. Today, with this movement we hope that a solution can be found. One cannot be too optimistic. It is a difficult problem, but we see that, through the initiatives of the European Union and the United States, a mediation process and a real approach to the problem has began. We therefore hope that these efforts will bear fruit so the two countries will be able to live peacefully together. [Correspondent Fivos Karzis] Papandreou stressed that adopting Greek measures against Skopje has led to a clear change in the international diplomatic climate. [Papandreou] There is substantial inaction by the international community on the Skopje issue. The problems raised by Greece regarding the symbols, name, constitution, and borders--that is, issues that actually have to do with the meaning of so-called greater Macedonia--are types of expansionism by this state against Greece. These Greek measures have succeeded in getting the international community to intervene and begin a discussion of these problems. In the end, these discussions should not legitimize the issues that are against Greece. [Karzis] The deputy foreign minister believes the attacks against Greece in the European press will ultimately be proven groundless. [Papandreou] I think the attacks against Greece during the last few days were particularly unfair and unacceptable, especially since it is the country that has been presiding over the European Union with particular success these days, during a very difficult and important case--the expansion of the Union.
