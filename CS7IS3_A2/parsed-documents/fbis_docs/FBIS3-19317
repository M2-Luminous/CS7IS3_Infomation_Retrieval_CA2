With a strict diet for ministers who, next year, must keep their budgets riveted to 1994 levels. Entities such as the Post Office and the Railways will be able to cover "further demands" only through price and tariff increases. The basic objective is to ensure a stable relationship between public indebtedness and GDP until 1995. The outlines of the next three years' austerity program are contained in a circular which has just been completed by the Treasury Minister, setting out strict criteria for preparing budget forecasts for 1994 and for the 1995-97 three-year period. The document issued by the State Audit Office also anticipates certain alarming figures with regard to this year's government accounts: "The latest development of the main indicators leads us to believe that it will not be easy to achieve the forecasts of economic growth previously formulated for the present year. ``The reduction in the average rate of inflation from the 4.2 percent achieved in 1993 to the 3.5 percent figure programmed for 1994 could prove problematic. Problems are also possible relating to the impact on domestic prices of the monetary devaluation. The recent impressive fall in interest rates could well flatten out and even come to a halt.'' It will be up to the quarterly cash report to set out, in the coming weeks, the official government forecasts on public finances. It is unlikely to depart substantially from the figure of a 15 trillion lira deficit put forward by the Monetary Fund, which has scaled down the growth of our economy to a rate of 1.1 percent. The Treasury warns: "The restrictive approach taken in recent years to budget forecasts must be maintained." There are no short cuts. The Audit Office indicates as a reference point the objectives set out in the monitoring procedure agreed to with the European Union. Under attack are the acquisition of goods and services, investments, and transfers to decentralized entities. The watchword for the next maneuver will be "nominal nonvariance." Expenditure on goods and services may not be higher than those of 1994, and with an expansion of no more than 2 percent in 1996 and 1.5 percent in 1997. The Audit Office is assuming that a hatchet will be taken to amounts earmarked for studies, inquiries, reports, committees, commissions, special assignments, and publicity, in order to "arrive at their elimination or at least to a significant scaling down." The strictures will also apply to defense: "It is necessary to proceed to redefine the various plans and projects, taking account of the changing international context and the coming into operation of the new defense model, with a concomitant postponement of expenditures for modernization and development, compatible with the implementation of the new programs." But ministers' slimming cure will not be enough. The next finance bill will also have to "freeze," for three years, at 1994 levels, the special funds for new legislative provisions. On its last page the circular fixes the broad lines for the three-year maneuver: For tax income one can assume a nominal GDP growth on the order of 4.5 to 5.0 percent in 1995 and 4.0 to 4.5 percent in 1996 and 1997. Current 1995 expenses will have to be contained within the levels set by the 1994 adjusted budget, while expenditure on personnel and the acquisition of goods and services essential for the operation of government may not grow by more than 2.0 percent in 1996 and 1.5 percent in 1997. Investments over the three-year period may not grow by more than 2.5 percent, 2.0 percent and 1.5 percent respectively.
