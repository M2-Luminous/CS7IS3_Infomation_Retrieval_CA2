Moczulski proposed that Poland should rather take care of its own Armed Forces. According to Moczulski, Poland's policy related to the NATO membership has focused on reaching certain propagandist goals. It produced no positive results in the past several years but halted the country's defence preparations. "One should have at least rebuilt the army to make it capable of counteracting threats we may encounter," Moczulski said.
