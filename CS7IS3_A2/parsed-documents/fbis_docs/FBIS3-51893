In this connection, it would be well to remember that the closer relations between the MAS and Caldera began in 1989. It was then that the idea was gaining ground among us that a break between Caldera and his party--barely perceptible at that time--would inevitably mean a significant change in the Venezuelan political-party picture, creating the conditions for the development of a wide breach in the bipartisan wall. This strategic option took on an additional dimension after the events of 4 February, when it became clear that the bar could be set even higher. Caldera's candidacy could serve as the focus of a confluence of forces capable of defeating bipartisanism, rather than simply breaching it. And so then, as of 1990, the country began to see movement toward creating an alliance. There were sporadic and calculated statements by some MAS leaders, as well as Caldera himself, indicating willingness to attend a meeting. There was the noisy presence of Caldera at the MAS convention in Los Caracas in July of 1990 (when the group of leaders gathered there enthusiastically made it clear how far their preferences went, and Caldera made a point of his conviction that an agreement with the MAS would not by any means displease him). And there was even the folkloric detail, in the best sense of the word, of the domino game with Caldera, which said more than 100 articles ever could have. It is clear, then, that Caldera's victory constituted a political success of no small importance for the MAS--perhaps the greatest in its history, along with the achievement of its own birth. Prejudices, misunderstandings, and a certain leftist inertia had to be overcome both within and outside the MAS to make possible the crystallization of that strategic achievement represented by the perception of the tremendous potential in the "non-COPEI [Social Christian Party]" candidacy of Caldera. But it should be noted that the veteran leader also had to face prejudices, misunderstandings, and a certain conservative inertia in order to facilitate a convergence with the MAS, and then with other lesser forces, without which he knew perfectly well he could not win. In this connection, Caldera's vision of the breadth of the alliance and his courage in maintaining his standards, although he knew that his adversaries would attempt to exploit his alliance with "the communists" to discredit him with his traditional supporters, provide the measure of the courage of this leader and statesman. In all of his speeches and televised appearances, Caldera took pains to emphasize the presence of each of his supporters. He began with the MAS, and always ended with a respectful and very courageous reference to the PCV [Communist Party of Venezuela]. This provided a lesson not only for a country that urgently needed to put sectarianism and subordinate quarrels behind it, but also, most certainly, for those who were not clear in their own minds that his victory would only be possible if the votes of every little faction, however modest, were added together. The result could not have spoken more eloquently. Of all the votes for Caldera, 35 percent were "orange" and nine percent represented the other groups and parties in the alliance. Without that 44 percent of the total, Caldera could not have become president. The veteran leader made no mistake, then, when, despite the efforts made to ridicule his undertaking, he tried to avoid excluding anyone, however unimportant he might be. The MAS participated in this alliance without imposing any type of bureaucratic conditions, so traditional in the rigid structure of Venezuelan politics. We drafted a strategy and we implemented it. The important thing was to triumph over bipartisanship, to release the country from the paralyzing AD [Democratic Action]-COPEI straitjacket, to adapt the political structure, and to encourage the implementation of policies different from those that at the end of a 35-year period had plunged the country into its deepest crisis. The measure of our success was Caldera's victory, and not the size of a certain bureaucratic quota to which we might have aspired on the basis of the political traditions imposed by the AD and the COPEI. In fact, the MAS does not have the slightest intention of involving itself in those ignoble bureaucratic tangles that have contributed so much to discrediting the Venezuelan political system. However, that having been said, it is not hard to understand that the MAS presence in the government is necessary. It is required in order to face up to the tremendous demand for political change expressed by the combined votes of the Caldera alliance and La Causa R. The country voted against the AD and the COPEI. The country gave new protagonists a mandate. The country would lose confidence in a government that failed to express, in a realistic and cautious measure, the collective desire that other people assume leadership responsibilities. Fortunately, Caldera understands this perfectly, as was the case with the alliance to the creation of which he contributed in order to win. The futile effort to blackmail him with the presence of the MAS in the alliance, which, had it been successful, would have led to his defeat, will not sit well now either. Where the MAS is concerned, just as it knew how and was able to participate in the campaign without trying to steal the show, aware that in the final analysis, it was certainly a relatively weak faction, it will also know how and will be able to make its presence felt in the government without creating unnecessary vulnerabilities. As for the rest, God will provide.
