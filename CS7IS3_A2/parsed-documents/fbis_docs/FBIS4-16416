He said the two presidents were not planning to hold talks in the near future. He also announced that initially there had been plans to hold a quadripartite meeting on Russia's initiative, involving the Russian, Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents, and Chairman of Karabakh's State Committee for Defense Robert Kocharyan, who was also in Moscow during the summit. "If Azerbaijan had given its general agreement to the Russian peace plan, which envisaged the use of peacekeeping forces and was supported by Yerevan and Stepanakert, the talks would have been held by all means," stated Papazyan. "Only Russia is ready to send its troops to the conflict zone. The UN cannot do so at the moment," he said. He noted, however, that the participation of other CIS countries or Eastern European states, would be desirable for Russia. "I'm sure this would be desirable for Azerbaijan, as well," he said. Commenting on Aliyev's statement that Armenia was carrying out aggression against Azerbaijan, Papazyan said that "Armenian has been entangled into the conflict, but it is not a warring side." He pointed out, at the same time, that if the population of Karabakh came under the threat of deportation or genocide, Armenia would get involved in fighting "in earnest." Now Yerevan is trying to abstain from active participation in the conflict to avoid its escalation.
