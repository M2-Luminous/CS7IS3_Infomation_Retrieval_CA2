Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-23FEB94-RUSSIA Debt Crisis Temporarily Halts State Broadcasting S U M M A RY Protesting state-owned television and radio companies' prolonged failure to pay for broadcasting services, Ministry of Communications workers struck on 10 February, disrupting broadcasts across much of Russia. Although Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin persuaded the broadcasters to end their strike the same day by promising to pay the debt, he hinted that the government may turn to privatization of some television and radio companies to reduce the debt problem. The belated government response to the strike threat suggests that new state television chief Aleksandr Yakovlev, who is not a member of the cabinet, may not be well positioned in the government to serve as an effective spokesman for his sector. END SUMMARY Ministry of Communications workers launched their strike on 10 February complaining that they had not been paid in months, and that state television and radio companies owed them 80 billion rubles. During the strike the workers refused to broadcast state programming except news. According to various reports, the strike curtailed broadcasting in 30 to 60 regions including St. Petersburg but not Moscow (Interfax, 10 February; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 February). Efforts by the government to avert the strike appear to have been too little, too late. According to Anatoliy Nazeykin, chairman of the Central Committee of the Russian Federation Trade Union of Communications Workers, on 21 January a conference of communications industry representatives sent to the government a package of proposals on resolving the situation along with a demand that the government pay the debt by I February, but the government did not reply (Segodnya, 10 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January). The government began to react after Russian Television reported on 8 February that the central committee of the Union of Communications Workers had threatened to strike on 10 February if the debts were not paid. On 9 February Chernomyrdin convened an "emergency" meeting with Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak, whom he reportedly had to call away from a medical examination, Aleksandr Yakovlev, Chairman of the Russian Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and Communications Ministry officials, but without representatives of the communications workers trade union (Trud, 10 February). After the meeting Chernomyrdin ordered the Finance Ministry to "explore the possibilities" for a gradual repayment of the debt (Segodnya, 10 February) and "appealed" to communications workers to continue broadcasting (Radio Rossii, 10 February). Communications workers rejected Chernomyrdin's response to their demands and went ahead with their strike as threatened. Nazeykin called Chernomyrdin's response "vague and indefinite" and dismissed his instructions to the Finance Ministry as unconvincing--" instructions are not the same as money" (Segodnya, 10 February; Interfax, 10 February). Nazeykin said that the government had issued more than 10 such instructions in 1993 but the problem remained unsolved and had become "extremely exacerbated" (ITAR-TASS, 10 February). The seriousness of the television debt situation first became apparent in June of 1993 when broadcasters threatened blackouts to draw attention to their plight. At that time the Finance Ministry, under pressure from Russian Television and its radio affiliate Radio Rossii, averted widespread blackouts, (though regional blackouts did occur), by agreeing to pay one quarter of an 8 billion ruble debt. The situation continued to deteriorate, however, as the television companies fell further and further in arrears to communications companies, and the latters' debts to their energy suppliers steadily grew. Strike Settled, Problem Remains Making more promises to pay off the debt, Chernomyrdin persuaded the communications workers to end their strike quickly, but he hinted that the government may resort to privatizing some television channels to relieve the debt problem. Nezavisimaya Gazeta (12 February) reported that Chernomyrdin had made a "firm promise" to pay off the debt by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 1994 and asked the communications workers to resume normal broadcasting. By the evening of 10 February they did, and the strike ended. Nezavisimaya Gazeta television affairs commentator Irina Petrovskaya pointed out the temporary nature of the solution warning that "everyone understands: the situation may be repeated." Commenting on the strike's end, Chernomyrdin suggested that the government may ultimately try to deal with the debt problem by privatizing some state-owned channels: "one should look to see what needs to be corporatized and what should be privatized" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 February). Implications The communication workers' demand for payment is only one of a number of large claims being pressed on the government now that the most influential monetarists, who were the staunchest opponents of such budget busting demands, have left the cabinet. Indeed, the workers may have been emboldened to escalate pressure to meet their demands by the monetarists' exit and the agricultural lobby's recent success in grabbing a chunk of the budget. It is noteworthy that Chernomyrdin, seemingly pressed by claimants on all sides, hinted at privatization rather than administrative measures, to relieve the broadcasters' debt crisis.
