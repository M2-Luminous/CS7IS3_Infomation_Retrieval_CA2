This statement was made today in Thessaloniki by Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos. Asked to comment on information regarding the increased U.S. presence in Skopje, Venizelos said: [Begin recording] [Venizelos] I do not want to comment on this possibility. I would instead like to remind you of the government's basic statement of last Friday [11 February]: that there are limits to Greece's patience in awaiting practical indications that Skopje has accepted its conditions, and these limits are being reached. No one should underestimate this message, which has many addressees. [Unidentified correspondent] Have there been any conciliatory signs from Skopje since the government's statement? [Venizelos] There was a letter from [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov to U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday -- Thursday night -- which had provocative contents for Greece. [Correspondent] And the dialogue? [Venizelos] The dialogue will depend on practical signs of Skopje accepting Greece's conditions. I repeat that Greece can only participate in a dialogue following specific and practical signs that Skopje has accepted its conditions. This position remains absolutely and firmly in effect.
