FR940203-1-00062 FR940203-1-00013 (1) That they own and are responsible for the maintenance of customer-owned lines; (2) Of the requirements for maintenance of those lines in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; (3) Who should be contacted to assist in the maintenance of customer-owned lines; (4) Of information that the operator has concerning the maintenance of its lines that could aid the customer in performing such maintenance; and (5) That periodic maintenance of customer-owned lines is necessary in order to avoid potential safety problems, such as gas leakage. (b) If the applicable codes and standards do not address maintenance of those lines, the information that operators provide under paragraph (a)(4) of this section must describe the maintenance requirements for customer-owned lines. (c) The notification requirements in paragraph (a) (of this section) apply to operators for which one or more customers have responsibility for maintenance of a substantial portion of the primary underground natural gas supply pipe between the operator's main and the foundation wall of the customer's premise, or its equivalent in those installations where the supply piping does not enter a building but rather goes directly to end-use equipment located outdoors. AGA's petition is on file in the docket and was taken into consideration during development of this notice of proposed rulemaking. Proposals Federal gas pipeline safety standards do not require gas pipeline operators to maintain customer-owned service lines. In many cases, the owner of the customer-owned service line is not aware he or she is responsible for the maintenance of the customer-owned service line or what those maintenance responsibilities are. To address these concerns, AGA's petition, and the statutory mandate, RSPA proposes to revise ยง192.3 to add a definition of customer-owned service lines, and to add ยง192.16 concerning notification requirements for customer-owned service lines to subpart A of 49 CFR part 192. At this time, RSPA is proposing to apply the notification requirements to operators of petroleum gas systems covered under ยง192.11. Thus, for the purpose of this discussion, the word ``operator'' will apply to those operators of natural gas and petroleum gas distribution systems that do not maintain customer-owned service lines up to the home or building wall or to the end-use equipment. RSPA is aware there are situations where the meter is adjacent to, but not at, the home or building wall or the end-use equipment. In these instances, the operator is responsible for the pipeline up to the meter, and the customer is responsible for the small portion of buried pipeline from the outlet of the meter to the home or building wall or to the end-use equipment. At this time, RSPA is proposing to apply the notification requirements to these sections of pipeline when the operator does not voluntarily maintain these sections of pipeline. RSPA invites public comment on whether these short sections of customer-owned service line have been properly installed and whether they are periodically maintained. RSPA believes that some of these sections were installed and are voluntarily maintained by the operator, even though they are the responsibility of the customer. Commenters are requested to support their responses with leak and incident data that includes information on personal injuries, deaths, and property damages. The following discussion covers the requirements listed within section 115(a) of the Act and how RSPA proposes to address them. Maintenance Requirements for Customer-Owned Service Lines RSPA requires operator-owned service lines to be operated and maintained to 49 CFR part 192 standards. These pipeline safety standards include leak detection surveys and corrosion control. Subpart I details the requirements for corrosion control, and subpart M details leak detection surveys and other maintenance requirements. Local codes and standards may also address operation and maintenance requirements. This notice proposes that operators provide to the owners of customer-owned service lines general information on these safety requirements. The proposal does not require operators to take over the maintenance of these lines. Under the proposal, operators would be allowed to use any written means to provide actual notification of the required information to customers. RSPA anticipates most operators will provide notice through inserts mailed to the customer and flyers hand delivered by the meter readers. Maintenance Resources Many resources are available to assist owners of customer-owned service lines in obtaining information to assure effective service line maintenance, including information supplied by the operator. The sources referenced below can provide general information on corrosion control and leakage surveys, and may be able to provide an actual listing of gas distribution contractors (including plumbers) or other individuals who could perform these maintenance requirements. The addresses and telephone numbers listed are current to the best of RSPA's knowledge. The State Licensing Board for Plumbers and State Plumbers' Associations The state licensing board for plumbers and state plumbers' associations can provide owners of customer-owned service lines with a listing of qualified, independent contractors who perform leakage surveys, gas piping repair and replacement, and valve repair and replacement.
