One cannot speak of interference, according to former Chamber of Deputies President Antoine Joseph, who considers it normal for the United States to request President Aristide to choose a new prime minister to fill the vacuum created by the departure of Prime Minister Robert Malval. Let us listen to Antoine Joseph: [Begin recording, in Creole] What you call giving orders is what I see as the fact that the United States is now considered the world cop. Second, the United States is very strong in the United Nations and has played an important role in the Haitian crisis. If they can call that giving orders.... Furthermore, the United States has given pretty substantial support to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. It is true that there are difficulties preventing his physical return. Personally, I do not consider it a big deal that the United States, seeing that there is now an executive vacuum and that this vacuum is tempting, that this vacuum is a kind of bait, believes that the vacuum entails the sort of resolutions resulting from these national conferences. The United States may deem it necessary for the vacuum to be filled as soon as possible. It therefore asks President Aristide to name a prime minister so as to begin filling the executive vacuum. [end recording] Furthermore, Antoine Joseph considers the resolution recently adopted by the employers' associations realistic. This resolution supports the main themes of the Governors Island agreement and of the New York pact. Joseph thinks the military considers the UN Mission in Haiti [MINUHA] a real slap. The MINUHA agreements can be revised by the Haitian parliament, according to Dr. Joseph, former president of the Chamber of Deputies. [passage omitted]
