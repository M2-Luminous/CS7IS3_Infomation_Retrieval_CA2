Aramar is where the Navy developed the uranium enrichment technology used in the construction of the first Brazilian nuclear submarine. Some of the civilian employees threatened with eviction are among Brazil's top nuclear experts. The eviction order was given by Admiral Domingos Alfredo da Silva, director general of the Navy material department. He is one rank above Admiral Othon Luis Pinheiro da Silva, president of the Coordinating Center for Special Projects (Copesp), the agency that administers the Aramar center. The scientists have been given until 29 June to leave the Navy houses. The civilian employees, who did not want to be identified to avoid being dismissed, said the measure affects dozens of experts from Sao Paulo and other states who moved to the area when they were hired by the Navy. One of them said: "The houses were offered as compensation for moving our residences, given that Navy salaries have always been below market salaries." Nearly 1,000 civilian and military employees live in Aramar. They say the 650 civilians are being discriminated against. One consequence of this move will be the flight of experts in ultra centrifuge techniques and in other subjects that the Navy Ministry considers strategic. The Aramar nuclear program has so far cost the Brazilian Government nearly $700 million. The material department director and the Copesp president were sought by journalists yesterday to explain the eviction of civilian employees. Advisers reported that Navy officers can only speak to journalists with the authorization of the office of Navy Minister Ivan Andrade Serpa. Although his office was contacted by fax, there has been no answer so far.
