The circular points out: Lately, vicious incidents of jointly beating price inspection personnel have occurred frequently, posing a threat to price inspectors in executing their official duties, directly impeding normal operations of the general price inspection, and causing serious social repercussions. To ensure smooth progress of the general price inspection, price departments and public security and procuratorial organs at all levels must investigate and handle cases of using violence or coercion to obstruct price inspection once they are discovered, dealing with them resolutely to ensure the personal safety of price inspectors and the smooth progress of price inspection. The circular says: Public security and procuratorial organs at all levels must enforce the law and handle cases strictly according to the law. Cases of obstructing price inspectors from performing official duties, which constitute an offense against public order, must be duly handled by public security organs according to the relevant provisions in the "Regulations Governing Punishment for Offenses Against Public Order." Once facts are verified and evidence proven, cases of using violence and coercion to obstruct price inspectors from performing their official duties should be promptly examined and transferred by the public security organ to the procuratorial organ for approval to arrest, indictment, and investigation of offenders' criminal responsibilities according to the law. In the course of handling cases, price departments and public security and procuratorial organs in all localities should step up the publicity and education, teaching business operators to conscientiously abide by various government price policies and regulations, to engage in lawful operations, and to voluntarily accept price inspection. Price-inspecting offices at various levels should strengthen education on the legal system among price inspectors to enhance their level of law enforcement and enable them to perform duties strictly according to the law.
