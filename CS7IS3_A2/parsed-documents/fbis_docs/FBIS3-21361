Five minutes to six, Jerusalem time, the phone rang at his home in a Tunis suburb. The report was choppy: Blood in the mosque, bodies in the courtyard. The Jewish army is shooting. It was one of his commands that phoned right from the field. Rajub jumped out of bed and ran to wake up Chairman 'Arafat. He was born 42 years ago in Hebron. His father and grandfather were also born there. He knows the area like the palm of his hand. That may be why, after he was expelled from there by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] more than seven years ago, Yasir 'Arafat made him commander for the West Bank at PLO headquarters. 'Arafat listens to him, and in Tunis they say that what Jibril says reflects what 'Arafat is thinking. He is absolutely loyal to his boss. You have to understand the nature of Jibril's job: The person responsible for the West Bank in the PLO is also the operations officer of the intifadah. At its height, he was the one who would relay instructions to the field by satellite telephone. He would also dictate the manifestos and plan the operations. "Yes, I am a terrorist," he confessed, and there are legal grounds for saying so: He spent 17 years in Israeli prisons for planning and being involved in attacks. When he was released, he was suspected of plotting to assassinate Yitzhaq Shamir and 'Ariq Sharon. Defense Minister Moshe 'Arens decided to expel him. When the Oslo talks began, Rajub was the most ardent supporter in PLO headquarters of the agreement reached with Israel. Since then he has been careful to stay behind the curtains and not take a direct part in the negotiations. Israelis involved in the agreement remember long night-time conversations with him by telephone, especially when the negotiations hit a snag, and they were looking for a channel to 'Arafat. "I felt that the terror and the intifadah had justified themselves. We had fought, and now we were going to make peace," he said in those days. This week he was singing a different tune: "I am stuck here in Tunis while crazy Jews from Brooklyn are entering my house in Hebron. Everything is lost, how can we continue now?" On the morning of the slaughter he went quickly to Arafat's house. Suha opened the door for him. For four hours Suha, Yasir 'Arafat, and Rajub sat by the telephone trying to gather details from Hebron: How many were killed, how many wounded, what was the situation in the field? Alongside a list of the dead, they began to put together lists of the wounded. The shock was great, and only later did they begin to firm up their reactions. The opponents of the agreement signed with Israel began coming out from where they had dug themselves in. And even as his image was burned in effigy by his own countrymen calling him "traitor," 'Arafat began releasing radical declarations: He swore not to return to the negotiating table until Israel did away with the settlements, brought UN troops into the field and immediately began negotiating on the final agreement--conditions that were unacceptable. Still, 'Arafat was not yet closing the door all the way. At the end of the week he hinted to Clinton: "Give me a week or two for passions to calm and we will see what will be." He gave those Israelis who were in contact with him to understand that he did not intend to "break all the dishes." Either way, 'Arafat is trapped. He is now caught between American-Egyptian-Israeli pressure from above and the pressure of the residents of the territories from below. A difficult and fragile moment. So fragile that many Western analysts believe that if he does not return to the negotiating table, 'Arafat will lose his leadership. Jibril Rajub, 'Arafat's close adviser and confidant, has an altogether different interpretation. "I know 'Arafat well," he said this week in a special interview with YEDIO'T AHARONOT. "'Arafat would prefer to die now and lose his leadership rather than be portrayed as a traitor in the eyes of his people. I also see the pressures from the field. In the West Bank they do not want to hear any more about the agreement with Israel, and 'Arafat cannot follow through on the agreement without the support of the majority of the Palestinian people." [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] A terrible thing happened in the mosque, but would you miss the opportunity for peace because of one madman? [Rajub] First of all, it is now clear that the slaughter was carried out in two stages. In the first stage the settlers entered the mosque and opened fire, and I also have testimony that it was not just the madman Goldstein. Our people who escaped from the mosque were killed by IDF soldiers outside. A settler kills people at prayer, they flee to save themselves--and your soldiers kill them. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] The facts that the IDF and the Israeli Government have are different. They claim that Baruch Goldstein was alone in the mosque. [Rajub] In any case, with whom, precisely, can we now make peace? With those from Qiryat Arba' who kill and afterward dance and party? Killing people at prayer and afterward celebrating? [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Some of your people killed more than a few Jews over the last few years. Nevertheless Israel opted for peace with you. [Rajub] If we were to kill people at prayer on the Sabbath in a synagogue, a world war would break out. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] The slaughter pains all of us, but try to be logical now. What must happen in order for the process to continue? [Rajub] Rabin must remove all the settlers from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. "Transfer" them to hell. That is what must be done. Those settlements are illegal. Move them to Petah Tiqva or Tel Aviv, wherever. As long as they are on the West Bank there will not be peace. What happened made it very clear to us that we cannot coexist together. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You certainly must know that Rabin will not dismantle the settlements. [Rajub] If not, we will distribute weapons to the Palestinian inhabitants and go back to armed struggle. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You mean back to the days of the intifadah? [Rajub] Much worse, and I am not prepared to go into detail. You are always boasting that you have the tanks and the planes, but still there are plans. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You supported the peace agreement and said it was dear to you. Maybe you can think of a reasonable solution that would allow a return to the negotiating table. [Rajub] For six months you have been claiming that you would not come to an agreement if there was no protection for the Jewish settlers. In order for the Palestinians to have security, the Jewish settlers have to be removed from there and you have to withdraw the army forces from Jericho and let us come in immediately. Look, it is absurd: One of your soldiers was killed and you expelled 417 of our people. We also want security. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You are encouraging your people to take revenge. [Rajub] The people in the field are pressuring me to go back to armed struggle. They want revenge but also to protect themselves. I am not encouraging them but I understand them. A boy spoke to me whose brother was killed in the mosque. His father ran to the hospital to give blood and within the hospital confines a soldier shot him and killed him, too. How can I tell this boy that he cannot take revenge? [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] It is hard to believe a soldier shot someone in the hospital. [Rajub] Check with the military administration. The family name is Abu-Sanin. The incident occurred in the Al-Ahala hospital. A shocking incident. In another family a father of six girls and seven boys was killed at prayer. What do I tell the orphans? That there is a peace agreement? [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] If that is your line, the only thing we can look forward to in the area is a bloodbath. Your people will kill and so will ours. [Rajub] What I am saying is: Tear down the settlements, give us our territory. We do not want to live alongside people who kill us. You say they will not tear down the settlements. Then there is nothing to talk about. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You sound desperate. [Rajub] I am not desperate. I was born an optimist. You know how much effort I put into getting this peace agreement. But today I feel they tricked us. I am in the position of field commander. I hear what people are saying, how they are pressuring. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Are you sorry about the agreement? [Rajub] I was for it, but today I see things differently. It cannot be that the army did not cooperate with the madman Goldstein. I will explain to you again: The people fled from the mosque and the soldiers killed them. Nothing like that happened with the Nazis. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You are exaggerating. [Rajub] I am not exaggerating. And I am not even talking about the fact that the murderer was in uniform, entered a mosque during prayers, and no one stopped him. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] A commission of inquiry has now been appointed. [Rajub] It is an Israeli matter to establish a commission of inquiry. Why, for example, were steps not taken against those who danced from happiness after the slaughter? Hanan Porat was there to encourage them. Can I make peace with someone like that? I have a feeling that you have people both in the political and diplomatic echelons who have regretted the agreement and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] If 'Arafat retreats from the agreement, politically he is lost. [Rajub] 'Arafat cannot and does not want to keep the agreement now. He must first of all provide security to the Palestinian people. The situation is critical. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Do you think it is preferable to skip the Oslo agreement and get right to work on negotiations for the final agreement? [Rajub] I know we have people who want that. I hope that the Americans will exert pressure where they have to and that Israel removes the settlements. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Rabin also has public opinion and a government that he has to watch out for. How can he remove the settlements now? [Rajub] If he cannot remove the settlements, he can take the Oslo agreement, put it in a picture frame and hang it on the wall. [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Jibril, you are a terrorist, you served time in prison, you were expelled from your home. You fought and were fought against. Peace was so close and you wanted it. Are you prepared to give it all up tomorrow? [Rajub] We have done everything. Now the ball is in Israel's court.
