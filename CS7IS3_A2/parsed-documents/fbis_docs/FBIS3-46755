Answer: First of all I appealed to them to remain Catholics. I know that many of them have quit going to church. In modern Australian life, people tend to forget about God. Secondly, I reminded them of the values of reconciliation, of redemption, unity, solidarity and mutual forgiveness. Were the Australian people still talking about the human rights situation in our country? Yes. They talk about it every day. They would rather I talk about that than about seminary matters. In the United States and Canada, it was the same. I got upset over there as I had not come to discuss human rights. My top priority was establishing the seminary. But the same question came up again and again, so when we were in Canada, the priest who was escorting us suggested that I talk a little bit about human rights so that the congregation would be inclined to donate funds (the bishop said this as a humorous aside). So, as far as I was concerned, I did not go there for human rights. In Australia, to those who asked the questions I replied: "You already know it all." Whatever happens over here, they will learn about it over there. It happens here in the morning, in the afternoon everybody knows about it over there. So, there is no point in trying to hide what happens over here. Although we can exercise censorship on the press, on the television, and although we have here sophisticated means to filter news, everybody will find out. Were the Australians still asking about the November 12, 1991, incident? Oh, a lot was asked about it. It was a big joke in the cathedral as well as among the Australian press. But I told them I did not come for that topic. I respect those who have passed away, I pray for them, and I pray that such a thing will never happen again. What is important to me now is the future. I would like to forget the incident, learn from what has happened, prepare our young generation, and hope that this will never happen again. My mission is to build a young generation with no internal conflicts and suspicion. Although these kind of things are taboos and they are not supposed to be discussed in public, in those countries it is an everyday issue. So, the main problem is, in today's world we cannot hide anything. With the globalization we have now, we cannot hide anything from the world. Domestically we can suppress news, but not internationally. What is your opinion about the situation in and the condition of East Timor today? My impression is, the people are not 100 percent at ease yet. Not yet. Problems that emerge are usually prompted by problems of economy, social justice, and job opportunity. All of them. So, let us pay more attention to the people. Let us have more dialogues. Security in East Timor has been achieved. In order to complement it, perhaps we need to foster more civilian diplomacy. What do you think about this? Diplomacy can involve everybody: the military, civilians, the bishop, the pope, well...everybody. Lately, we have seen a growing push for democratization in every aspect of our lives. What is your opinion? Well, hopefully that is true. Hopefully the people have opened their eyes and their minds so that they can participate in the process and participate in the openness. If they have opinions and views to express, they should express them openly. Otherwise, we will become a backward nation, still feudalistic, still authoritarian. Suppose that the democratization forces are genuine, does it mean that repressive practices should be reduced? There should be courage to do that, yes, and I can see it. When I was still in Portugal, we had a fascist regime. Then a revolution broke out. Those from the military refused to step down at that time due to their vested interests. However, the time was for democratization in Portugal, so all of them eventually fell. But that was OK. There should be input from all sides, from the press, from the people themselves. Groups should be brave enough not to keep on defending their own interests. In the Portuguese language, we have the word tacho; it connotes a person who has achieved a good position, has accumulated a lot of wealth, but then defends his personal interests as if on behalf of national and state interests or the necessity to defend the country. Do you have anything to say to those who have opened their eyes and who have been participating in the democratization efforts? Well... I call for them to be more courageous in pushing for democratization in the country. I know on campuses students have become more outspoken. It serves no purpose but to educate the people to be more mature in various aspects, such as the economy, politics, culture and so on. Do you think that what has been taking place on campuses is a reflection of progress in the democratization efforts? Well, at least there are differences in opinion, and there is the courage to state them. Could you imagine if we had to live in a society with no courage and no initiative...? Hopefully those students will become crusaders in the future. Not only those students, but our intellectuals, too. In the efforts to bring about democracy? Yes. What is your expectation of the newly set up National Commission of Human Rights? Let us give them some time. Let us wait and see how they accommodate the people's aspirations. Only then can we make comments. Let us move to another topic now. It appears that local people have been asking for more opportunity to play a bigger role on the political stage. Does this mean that their understanding of politics has reached an advanced level? I once made my comment on that. Ready or not, they should be given enough opportunity. We have been wondering, when will they be allowed to lead their own communities? Not yet ready, not yet stable, not yet prepared, these are always the excuses for not letting them do it. Consequently, the people are being treated like a baby who is deprived of the opportunity to develop psychologically. A baby, or a teenager for that matter should develop in all sorts of difficulty, although he may have to be guided all the time. [passage omitted on culture]
