FR940524-0-00023 FR940524-0-00007 (b) Bidding credits. Businesses owned by women and/or minorities, including small businesses owned by women and/or minorities will be eligible for a twenty-five percent (25) bidding credit when bidding on the following licenses: (1) The nationwide licenses on Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel 11; (2) All regional licenses on Channel 13 and Channel 17; (3) All MTA licenses on Channel 19, Channel 22, Channel 24; and (4) All BTA licenses on Channel 26. See 47 CFR 24.129. The bidding credit will reduce by 25 percent the bid price that businesses owned by women and/or minorities will be required to pay to obtain a license. The licenses that will be eligible for bidding credits are indicated by an (**) in §24.129. (c) Tax certificates. Any initial investor in a business owned by minorities and/or women and who provides ``start-up'' financing, which allows such business to acquire a narrowband PCS license(s), and any investor who purchases an ownership interest in a narrowband PCS licensee owned by minorities and/or women within the first year after license issuance, which allows for the stabilization of the entity's capital base, may, upon the sale of such investment or interest, request from the Commission a tax certificate, so long as such investor transaction does not reduce minority or female ownership or control in the entity below 50.1 percent. Any narrowband PCS licensee who assigns or transfers control of its license to a business owned by minorities and/or women may request that the Commission issue it a tax certificate. (d) Unjust enrichment. Designated entities using installment payments, bidding credits or tax certificates to obtain a narrowband PCS license will be subject to the following unjust enrichment provisions: (1) If a small business paying for a narrowband PCS license in installment payments seeks to transfer a license to a non-small business entity during the term of the license, the remaining principal balance must be repaid as a condition of the license transfer. (2) Female and minority-owned businesses seeking to transfer a license to an entity that is not owned by women or minorities will be required to reimburse the government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus interest at the rate imposed for installment financing at the time the license was awarded, before transfer will be permitted. The amount of this penalty will be reduced over time as follows: a transfer in the first two years of the license term will result in a forfeiture of 100 percent of the value of the bidding credit; in year three of the licenses term the penalty will be 75 percent; in year four the penalty will be 50 percent and in year five the penalty will be 25 percent, after which there will be no penalty. (3) Any business owned by minorities and or women that obtains a narrowband PCS license through the benefit of tax certificates shall not assign or transfer control of its license within one year of its license grant date. If the assignee or transferee is a business owned by minorities and or women, this paragraph shall not apply; Provided, however, that the assignee or transferee shall not assign or transfer control of the license within one year of the grant date of the assignment or transfer. 8.
