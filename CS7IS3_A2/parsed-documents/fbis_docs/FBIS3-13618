In a statement to an INA correspondent in Cairo, al-Qidrah said the PLO and the Arab people have received with extreme dissatisfaction Clinton's statements, which do not at all help the establishment of a just peace in the region. He added that the Palestinian people do not trust the United States at all. He stressed that negotiations with the Zionist entity cannot resume under the absolute U.S. bias toward the Zionist entity and the UN Security Council's glaring and full submissiveness to the United States. He stressed that the PLO cannot resume these negotiations unless a clear UN Security Council resolution condemning the Zionist massacre in Hebron is issued. Meanwhile, in statements published here today, Mahmud 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin [PLO Executive Committee member], criticized Clinton's statements. He said the United States should have unhesitatingly condemned the Zionist massacre and forced the Zionist entity to abide by international law. Abu-Mazin rejected the U.S. President's statements on Jerusalem. He said these statements clearly show that as it provides the Zionist entity with support and protection, Washington obstructs international efforts to secure the issuance of an international resolution through the UN Security Council condemning the Hebron massacre. In similar statements, Mrs. Hanan 'Ashrawi, former spokeswoman for the Palestinian negotiating delegation, said Washington has completely lost its credibility in the eyes of the Palestinian and Arab people in general. She stressed that Washington seeks to appease the Zionist entity through irresponsible statements or through the obstruction of any resolution condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. In her statements, Hanan 'Ashrawi indicated that a feeling of violent and regrettable shock is prevailing in the occupied Arab territories as a result of the recent U.S. statements, which are absolutely unacceptable. She said she believes the U.S. Administration is employing every means of pressure against the PLO and the Palestinian negotiators to push them to offer unilateral concessions. She called for reconsidering calculations and positions and avoiding contributing to the loss of the Palestine question, which is now experiencing its most delicate stages.
