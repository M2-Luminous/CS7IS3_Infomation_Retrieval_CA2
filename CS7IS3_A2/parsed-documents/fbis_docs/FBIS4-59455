In an interview with GMA Radio, a Philippine OCW identified as Josie Oliva said they have been advised to return home immediately. According to Oliva, she and 30 other OCW's are safe and are staying at the Sheraton Hotel. She fears that if they are unable to leave today, their lives may be in danger. In this connection, the Department of Foreign Affairs has revealed that two C-130 planes from the Philippine Air Force are set to fly to Yemen to retrieve the Phlippine OCW's once a landing permit is secured. [Begin Oliva recording, in progress] ...as of now we are safe; we have not yet been affected in any way. But we do not know about tomorrow; we do not know what will happen tomorrow. They have already advised us to get out because we are the only ones left here. As I mentioned before, all other nationals have been rescued by their respective governments. Only the Philippine Government has not acted. We are still okay, including my brother and my uncle, but we do not have any outside contact. We cannot communicate because there is no international line available here. [end recording]
