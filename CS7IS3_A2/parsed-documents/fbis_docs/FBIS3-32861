The leaders of the 3-80 Northern Front (FN 3-80) proposed a meeting to be held today, Monday, with a peace commission that would be made up of representatives of the church and the International Commission of Support and Verification of the OAS. Recontra leader Elvin Talavera, alias "Chacalin," told the press that the rebels had accepted a peace proposal by the church and writer Pantonio Cuadra and that they are willing to negotiate on the basis of that document. The plan, disclosed more than a week ago, suggests the demobilization of the so-called "recontras" but does not mention any of the political demands the recontras have made since they took up their weapons against the government. The unconventional forces are respecting the cease-fire they unilaterally declared 10 days ago, even though on Friday a group killed two soldiers and injured three others when they ambushed a military vehicle in Buena Vista, 8 km from a big military base. The Army has also refrained from conducting military operations in the northern area of the country and has announced that they do not wish to hinder the efforts being made toward disarmament. Therefore, they will not take reprisals for the attack. Chacalin, whom the Army reported as having been killed a week ago, said that the group is willing to talk but that the presence of the soldiers in that area "could hinder" the process. To date, the recontras have not mentioned any political demands in exchange for disarming and have only asked that their safety be ensured. A few months ago, the rebels demanded the resignation of President Violeta Chamorro and Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo and the removal Humberto Ortega, commander in chief of the Sandinist People's Army. Regarding their former demands, Chacalin said that "we are thinking about the upcoming elections (in 1996); we must head for a civic struggle." Chacalin hinted that there is a possibility that the group will join the recently formed Nicaraguan Resistance Party (PRN). The PRN is formed by former contras who, several years ago, chose the civic way of struggle. Another FN 3-80 leader known by his alias, "Martin Negro," told AFP that they will ask the government to establish new safety zones to which the Army will not have access. If the government agrees to these demands, "the meetings will continue" to discuss other points in the proposal that includes the creation of another peace commission, Martin Negro said.
