Tavrovskiy; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Here is a sensational report we have received from the ITAR-TASS news agency today. This is what it says. The North Korean Foreign Ministry has stated that North Korea is to pull out of the International Atomic Energy Agency immediately and is set to pursue its independent nuclear program in the future. [Tavrovskiy] The declaration made public by the North Korean Foreign Ministry says that the reason for adopting it was the recent decision by the International Atomic Energy Agency to stop technical aid to North Korea. Pyongyang confirmed that North Korea's membership of the Nonproliferation Treaty has been suspended. Moreover, North Korea is refusing to allow international observers to inspect its nuclear sites in the future. At the same time, the IAEA said that it had received no notification as yet from North Korea about its decision to resign from the agency. Perhaps, after North Korea's step today, sanctions which the United States, Japan, and South Korea want will be inevitable. At the same time, Pyongyang says that if the sanctions are imposed, a terrible war will be waged on the Korean peninsula. There is no doubt that the actions of the North Korean regime must be condemned. Nevertheless, I would like to say that South Africa and Israel may well have a nuclear bomb as well. It is quite possible that Libya and Pakistan also possess it. So when North Korea blames the IAEA of double-standards, its words carry a certain grain of truth. The best way out of the current situation may be the Russian proposal for an international conference for nuclear security in the Korean peninsula with all the interested parties taking part.
