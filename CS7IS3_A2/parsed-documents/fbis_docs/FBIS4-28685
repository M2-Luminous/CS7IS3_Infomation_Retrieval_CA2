Answering questions put by reporters, he said: "The great leader President Kim Il-song made it clear more than once long ago that our country has neither intention nor capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons. "What do we need such weapons for? The 'nuclear issue' of our country was raised because the United States has been suspicious of our peaceful nuclear activities from the beginning. "As our country has foundations of the independent national economy and a powerful defence capacity, any 'sanctions' can never frighten us," he declared, and said: "We demand that the United States respond to talks for a peaceful solution to the issue with due attention. It would be well advised to be clearly mindful that if it failed to respond to the talks, trying to resolve the issue with pressure and 'sanctions', it will result only in causing tension on the Korean peninsula." Kim Yong-nam declared that the Korean people will achieve national reunification independently in accordance with the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity."
