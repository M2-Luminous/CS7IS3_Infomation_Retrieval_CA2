Debris Contaminated With Newly Listed or Identified Wastes Debris contaminated with the hazardous wastes included in today's rule must be treated prior to land disposal. The hazardous debris may be treated to meet the treatment standards promulgated today for the constituents which are contaminating the debris, or it may be treated to meet the alternative debris standards promulgated in the LDR for Newly Listed Wastes and Hazardous Debris (57 FR 37194, August 18, 1992). A. Debris Treated To Meet the Phase II Treatment Standards Debris that is treated to meet the treatment standards promulgated in today's rule for newly listed wastes would remain subject to the hazardous waste management regulations (subtitle C) for as long as the debris ``contains'' the hazardous waste (see 57 FR 37625&hyph;26, August 18, 1992). On the other hand, debris that is treated to meet the treatment standards promulgated in today's rule for newly identified TC organic wastes, including any underlying hazardous constituents the generator reasonably expects to be present in the waste, could be disposed in a nonhazardous waste (subtitle D) landfill because the characteristic identifying the waste as hazardous is removed through meeting the LDR treatment standards. B. Debris Treated To Meet the Alternative Debris Treatment Standards The alternative treatment standards require the use of specific technologies from one or more of the following categories: extraction technologies, destruction technologies, or immobilization. Treatment must be performed in accordance with specified performance standards found in the regulations at 40 CFR 268.45. If one of the extraction or destruction technologies is used, and the debris does not display any characteristic of hazardous waste, then EPA would consider the treated debris to no longer contain hazardous waste. Such treated debris could, therefore, be reused, returned to the natural environment, or disposed in a nonhazardous waste (subtitle D) facility. Nondebris residuals generated from the treatment of debris contaminated with listed wastes would still be hazardous wastes by virtue of the derived-from rule and would be subject to the hazardous waste management system, including the treatment standards for newly listed wastes in today's rule. VII. Response to Comments Regarding Exclusion of Hazardous Debris That Has Been Treated by Immobilization Technologies A. Background The final Phase I Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) rule promulgated on June 30, 1992 (57 FR 37194, August 18, 1992), excludes from Subtitle C control hazardous debris that is treated using an extraction or destruction technology provided the treated debris meets the performance standards specified in §268.45 Table 1. Our basis for doing this is that the debris no longer contains the hazardous waste. On the other hand, hazardous debris treated by an immobilization technology is still subject to the hazardous waste regulations because the Agency has insufficient data or information to support that such treated debris would not leach Appendix VIII constituents over time in a manner that would be protective to human health and the environment. In our proposal to the Phase I LDR rule, the Agency solicited comment on whether immobilized hazardous debris should be excluded from Subtitle C control. While the Agency received favorable comments on excluding such treated debris from the hazardous waste regulations, no information or data was provided to support such a position. Therefore, the final rule requires that immobilized hazardous debris continue to be managed as a hazardous waste. The Agency decided to revisit the issue of whether immobilized hazardous debris, if treated in certain ways or is treated to meet certain limits, should be excluded from Subtitle C control. As a result, since the promulgation of the Phase I LDR rule, the Agency has undertaken a number of activities. B. Roundtable Discussion In an attempt to gather information on the issue, the Agency sponsored a roundtable discussion on August 3, 1992. Participants at the meeting included persons who commented on the Phase I LDR rule, debris treatment vendors, hazardous waste treaters and disposers, state officials, and officials from the Department of Energy (see Docket for specific list of attendees). Representatives from the environmental interest groups were also invited but were unable to attend. The purpose of the meeting was to gather information and discuss various regulatory approaches that would allow the Agency to exclude immobilized hazardous debris from Subtitle C control. While no specific data was gathered, there was a general discussion on the types of standards that could be applied such as design and operating standards, leach test, structural integrity test, permeability test for encapsulating material, so as to exclude immobilized hazardous debris from hazardous waste control. Additionally, the following points were also made by one or more participants at the roundtable. •A number of the attendees indicated that even if immobilized hazardous debris were excluded from hazardous waste control, it would continue to be managed as a hazardous waste due to CERCLA liability concerns. •There was some question whether a specific exclusion for immobilized hazardous debris was necessary or whether the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) may be a more appropriate mechanism for addressing this issue. •A representative from the glass industry suggested that glass cullet and vitreous materials should have a separate treatment standard. He indicated that the glass matrix would not leach lead at a higher rate than would an immobilized product_that is, it made little sense to grind up the glass material and then to stabilize it when the original matrix is just as sound.
