Al-Bid contacted Saudi King Fahd, Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan of the UAE and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad by telephone as northern forces launched a new intensive bombardment of this southern stronghold. He told them of "the persistence of the military regime in Sanaa" in continuing the war, and its "repeated violations of UN Security Council Resolution 924 which called for an immediate ceasefire," the television said. Fighting raged Sunday in the suburbs of Aden, following the collapse of the fifth ceasefire to be announced in the two-month-old civil war. The Arab leaders expressed concern at continued fighting and called for an immediate truce, the television reported. War broke out on May 5 between al-Bid's southern forces and those of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, ending four years of uneasy unity since former conservative, tribal North Yemen merged with the Marxist South.
