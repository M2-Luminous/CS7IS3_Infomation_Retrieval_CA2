The IMF noted that among the reasons for granting the loan is the Nicaraguan Government's commitment to promote an economic program "that will achieve 3 percent real growth in the Gross Domestic Product next year," the source added. The directorate added that "in a new commitment to Nicaraguan society the IMF sympathized with the social conditions of Nicaragua's neediest" and that "the new ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] includes programs to upgrade health and education," as well as a Social Investment Fund for the benefit "of the hardest hit" sectors. The Social Investment Fund is aimed at "the most vulnerable segments of society" and will generate "more jobs, alleviate poverty," and upgrade the conditions of those hit the hardest by the war, the Directorate's communique indicated. On another matter, the IMF said that "it has taken note" of the Nicaraguan Government's view on the need to restructure its foreign debt "under concessional terms." One can infer from this that the international financial organization would support the request the Nicaraguan Government will make along those lines in September when it goes to negotiate with the Paris Club. In the September meeting, the government will ask that all the foreign debt stocks [preceding word in English] -- probably as much as $500 million -- be forgiven. Although the foreign debt to the Paris Club does not represent the bulk of what the government owes, it is important because the countries that belong to the Club are the ones currently granting the greatest volume of financial aid to Nicaragua. In addition, the IMF loan to Nicaragua is in keeping with the signing of the ESAF and World Bank agreements, as well as with the results of the recently held meeting of the World Bank's Consultative Group.
