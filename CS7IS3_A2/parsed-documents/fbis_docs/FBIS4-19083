Mr. Mulutinovic also visited Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias at the Foreign Ministry this morning. According to a government spokesman's statement at noon today, the subject of discussion was developments in Bosnia. Despite all this, and although Mr. Milutinovic was asked last night what he discussed with the prime minister, and he said that he had conveyed a message, when we asked government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos what the message was about he said that the important thing is that the developments in Bosnia were discussed and that there is nothing more that can be released. In addition, Mr. Venizelos described as extremely unpleasant the fact that there is war in his area. The spokesman made this statement in response to a question on whether the fear that the war will expand to the south is justified. Mr. Venizelos reiterated that it is Greece's opinion that neighboring countries or countries with historic relations in the region should not become involved in the areas of tension. [passage omitted] Concerning the tension created in Greek-Albanian relations, this tension escalated after Tirana declared the Greek consul general in Gjirokaster persona non grata. Mr. Khristos Iakovou was told by the Albanian authorities to leave Albania within 48 hours. This move followed the well-known incident at a military camp guard post in the Gjirokaster area [words indistinct] and the Albanian insistence on accusing Greece openly through letters to international organizations, the United Nations, European Union, and the CSCE of being responsible for this incident. The government spokesman said once again in this connection that these accusations are unfounded and, in any case, our country reacted to the Albanian Government's decision to expel the consul general in Gjirokaster Khristos Iakovou. Our country reacted by declaring Kastriot Robo, first secretary at the Albanian Embassy in Athens, persona non grata. He was asked by the Foreign Ministry to leave our country within 48 hours. Despite all this, the Greek Government expresses its regret for these developments for which, according to a Foreign Ministry statement, the whole responsibility is born by the Albanian side. Albania, because of the recent criminal incident on its territory by unidentified elements, is trying to create a climate of bilateral tension. The Foreign Ministry statement further notes that the government has not spared any effort to support the Albanian people's efforts for the reconstruction of their country and expects the Albanian side to demonstrate the necessary responsibility to overcome the current tension to the benefit of security and stability in the region.
