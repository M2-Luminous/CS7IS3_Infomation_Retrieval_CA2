When she arrived in the Cuban capital, Mrs. Sanin de Rubio spoke to Cuban and foreign journalists about the objectives of her visit and the outlook for bilateral relations. [Begin recording] [Sanin] Since the reestablishment of relations, we have sought to obtain in-depth knowledge of our mutual circumstances. Therefore, we are going to address bilateral topics, exchange opinions and information on our respective countries, and review the bilateral agenda on commercial, cultural, and educational topics. There might also be an opportunity to talk with important Cuban personalities. I want to obtain in-depth knowledge of the reforms undertaken by Cuba in economic and political areas, because we all have great hopes that current problems will be overcome and there will be a greater opening at different levels as a result of Cuba's achievements and the reforms that have begun, based on Cuba's self-determination. [Unidentified reporter] What are the most immediate trade prospects between the two countries? [Sanin] Well, our overall trade amounts to $12 million. There are great opportunities. Colombian businessmen will be paying a visit. I am interested in speaking with the Cuban authorities about some points which are important to promoting greater Colombian investment in Cuba and improving trade. This brings development and opportunities. Many of our products can have a market here and many of your products can have a market in Colombia. I think we have to review certain conditions, such as the possibility of signing an agreement on investment protection. I also want to review with the Cuban authorities the possibilities for foreign investments. [Reporter] Does Colombia uphold its decision to sell petroleum to Cuba? [Sanin] Colombia will sell petroleum to Cuba without any problem as long as Cuba can pay within the terms and conditions Colombia establishes for the sale of oil. If you can accept the Colombian terms, we see no problem in selling it. The letter of credit and the terms are being discussed. [Reporter] In your view, are relations with Cuba going well? [Sanin] They are going well because they are developing with mutual respect for domestic affairs and with a great sense of cooperation and understanding. There is interest in all sectors of the two countries. [Reporter] How much petroleum is being negotiated? [Sanin] I do not have that exact information because the quantity would be established based on the terms and conditions. [Reporter] What priorities or topics does Colombia, as host, have for the fourth [Ibero-American] summit? [Sanin] Economic topics as a basis for political reforms and their sustainability, because economic and political reforms cannot be carried out without emphasizing social aspects. In addition to the extreme poverty of a large part of our population, Latin America's great problem is the inequalities in our societies. We are going to review the opportunities that integration provides for economic development and prosperity for our peoples, but always based on in-depth social reforms. [Reporter] Will your visit lead to a possible visit by President Gaviria before (?the end of his presidential term)? [Sanin] It is not scheduled. The president's agenda is already quite heavy. We had not [words indistinct] but in any case we will hold the Ibero-American summit in Cartagena and we will receive President Fidel Castro on 14 and 15 (?July). [Reporter] [Words indistinct] expect an agreement? [Sanin] The transaction is being carried out like two normal countries. There is talk of prices, duration, and guarantees. The duration is being discussed. You are asking for a longer duration than what Colombia is willing to offer and you are offering a guarantee different from the one we are accustomed to receiving. Nevertheless, it is a normal discussion in commercial terms. We want it to be a normal commercial operation and we are discussing it. Therefore, if we reach agreement, there is a sale, and if not, it will be like so many other commercial operations that are not carried through. It would not mean [words indistinct]. [Reporter] [Passage indistinct] [Sanin] That is what we want, that it be a step in the strengthening of relations, a sign of cooperation and mutual respect, and of my country's desire to learn up close about the reforms under way in Cuba. Everyone knows that Cuba is experiencing various difficulties, but we are very hopeful about the political resolve and President Fidel Castro's statements yesterday about this being the beginning and that you are willing to establish [words indistinct] reforms to resolve the island's problems. We have great hope that these measures will be effective. We respect that the reforms will stem from Cuba's self-determination and we hope that the political resolve that has been expressed will be clear and real. We all want the Cuban people to be prosperous, enjoy well-being, and be able to maintain the reforms the country has achieved in social aspects such as education, health, and other fields. [end recording] The program for the Colombian foreign minister's 24-hour visit to Cuba includes meetings with Carlos Lage, vice president of the Councils of State and Ministers, and a working luncheon with Army General Raul Castro. In addition, she will visit the National Library and the Casa de las Americas to deliver donations of books and crafts. Along with the Cuban foreign minister, she will confirm the work program of the joint intergovernmental commission that was recently created and will sign an educational agreement. Before leaving Cuba, Mrs. Sanin de Rubio will hold a news conference.
