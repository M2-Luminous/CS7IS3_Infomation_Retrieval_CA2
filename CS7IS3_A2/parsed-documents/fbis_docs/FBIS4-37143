The member states of the organization of petroleum exporting countries could meet more than 53 percent of the world's oil demands, he told IRNA. The ambassador urged OPEC member states not to let political differences have adverse effect on their economic interests. Kazempur, who has been nominated by Iran for the post of OPEC secretary general, said it would be regrettable to make any concession to buyers and let them buy this God-given gift at the lowest price just because of political differences. He said the most important role that OPEC can play now was to prevent political differences among its members from having any adverse effects on their economic interests. Kazempur felt confidence that by setting an oil output ceiling and taking into consideration the growing demands for oil, OPEC would soon witness considerable increase in the prices of oil provided that its members refrain from overproducing. OPEC members are now meeting in Vienna to determine an oil production ceiling and elect OPEC's new secretary general.
