The two countries are expected to sign an agreement on investment protection and possibly, a protocol on this year's bilateral trade, a senior Russian diplomat told INTERFAX on Monday. He said the two papers were almost ready for signing though some technicalities remained in the second draft but "these will have been resolved." The diplomat spoke of no painful issues in relations between Moscow and Prague. He described them as good though admitting to some problems as well including the former Soviet Union's debt to ex-Czechoslovakia. "The trouble is both of them do no longer exist, but this is not to say the problem is insoluble," he said.
