Some of those parties, however, fell below us in popularity. We are continuing our series of interviews with prominent party leaders with an interview with the leader of the Socialist Party, Kiro Popovski. It is interesting that this is Popovski's first interview with the press since the first elections, at least according to his own records. [Geroski] In view of the results of the by-elections in several electoral districts, including the latest ones in the 103d, and especially the results of some public opinion polls, one gets the impression that your party's standing, at least in comparison with certain others, let us say, has shown growth, which is being perceived as a surprise.... [Popovski] The surprise is a consequence of the simplified assessment of the standings of political parties, which are reduced to the number of deputies in parliament. That figure does not actually correspond to the number of votes that we received from the citizens. Let me recall that in the first elections we received about 95,000 votes--the other parties received more, but not as many as the difference in the number of deputy seats seems to indicate. In any case, you will agree that any party's standing is best shown through support in the elections themselves, which means that it will evidently be demonstrated in the next elections. In some cases, there may be indications from the results of several parliamentary by-elections during this term, but not just in the 103d, in addition to public opinion polls, especially those of the Gallup Institute. In general, I think that we can be satisfied with the Socialist Party's standing, and especially with the fact that in all those tests we did not have any fluctuations and declines, which indicates stability in membership, sympathizers, and support. I think that that is also confirmed by the results that we achieved in the previous three by-elections. In two electoral districts, our candidates were in second place, and in all three, we got into the second round. As far as the 103d is concerned, we have a large membership and sympathizers there, and consequently part of this electoral district is represented by our deputy in the City Assembly. Without an Inheritance [Geroski] Why, then, didn't you decide to try your luck independently? [Popovski] Such proposals were made, and we were prepared; we even had our own candidate. Nevertheless, because of the polarization that occurred and the political grouping that was expected, we assessed that we would achieve better results if we came forward with a joint candidate. I think that our participation was significant in the outcome of the election campaign, and that fact is also acknowledged by the other coalition partners. At the same time, it was a sort of test to see how much our sympathizers and the sympathizers of the other two parties would accept our decision on a joint approach. In discussion groups and conversations in this electoral district, we received broad support for this platform from citizens. In any case, these days our party is having several meetings and discussion groups throughout the republic, and almost nowhere have we been in a situation in which we have had to interrupt them, as has happened to several other parties. [Geroski] In the past there was an impression that your party was, in a certain way, to put it crudely, an appendage of the coalition or of the major parties, but the results show that in the future a different balance of power is possible. How much is that influenced by the fact that you are one of the parties which inherited an infrastructure, in terms of personnel, office spaces, possibly even money...? [Popovski] Let me tell you at once--we did not inherit any kind of office spaces. In almost all the municipalities, we get the same treatment as all the other parties: As part of the distribution of office spaces, in the majority of municipalities, we only got one office. Other parties are far better situated than we are. Nevertheless, probably through inertia, and in view of the situation in several other political structures, that is being said of us, but it is not true. It is true that even before pluralism we had a well-equipped infrastructure, and that for the past four years that infrastructure has continued to function throughout the entire republic. Otherwise, with respect to what you were saying--an appendage--I don't know what big party you are thinking of, since some of those big parties have dropped below us in popularity. Furthermore, we have clearly declared that we are finally getting rid of all those former encumbrances and that the Socialist Party is acting as an independent political entity, with its own platform and positions. The fact that in some discussions, in parliament and elsewhere, our positions coincide with those of some large parties, which are primarily civic-oriented, is a result of the closeness of our programs. We are in a coalition now, and the party that has the largest number of deputies has the most say in the coalition, so someone thus draws the conclusion that we are under the wing of some party, which is not true. Figuratively speaking, the 28 deputies of that party have as much weight as our six, since neither they nor we can form a majority in parliament by ourselves. Coalition for November? [Geroski] Will that ruling coalition, which is now also the campaign coalition from the 103d, maintain itself until November? [Popovski] I would like to remind you of something, although it will perhaps sound immodest: In 1990, the Socialist Party was the only one that had a realistic assessment of what would happen on the political scene in the republic. We established that assessment on the basis of the situation after the initial results from the parliamentary elections in Croatia and Slovenia. We realistically estimated that two national blocs would be created in the republic, and would not have a civic orientation; and that if the democratic parties were not united, their performance would be significantly worse. For that purpose, we also published a special declaration that year regarding the formation of a coalition of democratic forces in Macedonia. It is well-known that that coalition was not fulfilled; the only ones to join us were PCER [Party for the Full Emancipation of Romanies] and the Association of Macedonian Muslims. We estimate that in the next elections as well there will be a grouping of parties, since I do not believe that with this kind of political map in Macedonia one party can win the elections. It has also been demonstrated that the formation of a coalition between two rounds or after elections is hard to achieve, and without the same effects as in an election campaign. So far, there have not been any really direct talks on this level, except for this attempt in the 103d. I expect that soon every party will prepare realistic assessments of its own capabilities, and that there will be a grouping. There are already indications in the national bloc, and I assume that there will be a corresponding grouping among the parties of the nationalities. The parties that are now acting jointly are arguing that they are civic and democratic, and I think that in this case as well common interests may be found for the formation of a campaign coalition. In any case, if such a coalition is formed, we will urge that it be exclusively on an equal basis, and based on a clearly defined program and mutual obligations, since the one we have now is far from what it should be, and that is why we have this situation in parliament and elsewhere. [Geroski] Entering that kind of coalition will be hampered by the voters' "memory" that that government coalition has one more member--the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity]. That will also be one of the key campaign themes that will be pushed by the opposition.... [Popovski] I don't know whether any party is proceeding on the basis of an assessment that if it gains power it will exclude representatives of the nationalities in Macedonia, although from the political and legal standpoint, in a pluralist and parliamentary system, the party that wins the elections also assumes power. Nevertheless, I think that excluding the nationalities from power would mean the further exacerbation of interethnic relations and an intensification of mutual distrust, which will contribute to separating and homogenizing them, which in turn will lead to mutual conflicts. After all, that has also been demonstrated on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. I don't know why or with which of the nationalities' parties we would enter a coalition--our example with PCER shows that it can be done, if a firm program and elements for the functioning of such a coalition are prepared. Nevertheless, the hindrance that you are talking about does perhaps exist, since there is speculation that the coalition that exists now means the abandonment of any sort of principled policy by the parties that associate with the PDP. They want to use those national parties to create an artificial hindrance, in order to lower the standing of the coalition's parties. I think, however, that the citizens will be able to assess realistically what is what. "Rigid" or Principled? [Geroski] At the last two meetings of the Assembly, there have been incidents (the stalemate over the electoral law, the problems with the Census Law), which seem to be increasing that risk.... [Popovski] What you are saying to me now is confirmation of my previous assessment about the principled nature of the positions of these parties in the coalition. If we were to act in an unprincipled manner, that crisis would probably not have occurred: We would accept all the demands of the participants in the coalition and we would adopt all those laws without any problem. It is precisely because of that principled approach that we cannot comply with demands that are unacceptable to us. That is why the crisis is occurring. [Geroski] They say that you are somehow the most principled of the principled, not to say the "most rigid" with respect to that so-called conciliation of the Albanians in the coalition. Is that true? [Popovski] And now, whether I am "rigid" or not... I think that I am principled. Our slogan in 1990 was, and still is, that no one in Macedonia should be threatened because of his ethnic identity and that all citizens must be equal before the Constitution and the laws. Coexistence and mutual trust have to be ensured. Any other alternative will be fatal to our state. Some people perceive the fact that I am principled to the end as my being harsh on certain issues, or "rigid," as you say. I think, however, that it has to be assessed realistically. Some things in our country are still not fully developed as legal solutions, and one must always take into account expediency and reality. For more radical changes in mutual relations, it is also necessary to have a broader awareness among the citizens, a higher level of economic development, and greater mutual trust. [Geroski] Finally, the last question: The elections are close. What is the minimum that the Socialist Party will consider a success in these elections? [Popovski] I don't know whether any party could give you an answer to that question. In any case, if we exclude the Socialist Party of Serbia, we are the only socialist party in the former Yugoslav republics that has not only survived, but has also done continuously risen in popularity. Probably the minimum will be that we continue to remain in the inner circle of the political parties that have a fundamental influence upon the overall policy and development of the republic. That is not just for the sake of our political interests and party standing, but also so that we can make our own contribution to the state's survival and to ensuring prospects for its development.
