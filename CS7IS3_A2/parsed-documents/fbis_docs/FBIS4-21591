The vote on the resolution, sponsored by 17 board members including the United States, Britain, Germany and Russia, was 25 for, one against and five abstentions. China, whose position on the issue had attracted the most interest, abstained along with India, Indonesia, Brazil and Lebanon. The only opposing vote was cast by Libya. Cuba and Syria did not take part in the voting. The resolution contained wording that said the IAEA will notify the UN Security Council of the matter. However, it is believed the resolution is more than an act of notification as it indirectly urges the Security Council to implement countermeasures, observers said. The resolution expresses the most serious concern ever by the IAEA board of governors over the possibility that North Korea has diverted nuclear material for other than stated purposes. It asks IAEA Director-General Hans Blix to report the resolution not only to all IAEA members but also the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. The resolution specifically mentions that the IAEA could not prove that North Korea had not used nuclear material for nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices. The observers deemed it significant that the IAEA has used the terms "nuclear weapons" and "nuclear explosive devices" for the first time in its resolution on the North Korean issue. The resolution, consisting of seven items, expresses regret that the IAEA was unable to fulfill the Security Council's request to resolve the dispute because of North Korea's uncooperative attitude. It recalls that the Security Council instructed Blix last May to report back to the council on how the issue was progressing, thus indirectly requesting that the Security Council eventually deliberate countermeasures. At the same time, the resolution urged North Korea once again to allow unfettered IAEA inspections, implement the nuclear safeguards agreement and fulfill its obligations as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The IAEA said the North Korean problem will remain a major pending issue and warned that, if Pyongyang does not fulfill its obligations under the nuclear safeguards agreement, it will take follow-up steps in accordance with its charter including disqualification and suspension of technology cooperation. In his opening report to the board meeting, Blix said inspection of the radiochemical laboratory was a must and North Korea had already agreed to allow it. Despite its earlier agreement, North Korea refused to let IAEA inspectors check the laboratory, making it impossible to determine whether the stalinist state had diverted nuclear material for non- peaceful purposes since the last inspection in February. Blix warned that the IAEA would no longer remain silent on the issue. The IAEA is ready to send experts again to check facilities they could not inspect last time. In order to do so, North Korea must offer the UN watchdog a clear commitment that it would allow all inspections. The North Korean representative denounced the resolution, charging that the IAEA had reached a hasty and irrational conclusion and was putting unjust pressure on Pyongyang.
