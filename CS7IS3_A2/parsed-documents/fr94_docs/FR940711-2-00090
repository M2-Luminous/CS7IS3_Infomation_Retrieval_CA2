FR940711-2-00090 FR940711-2-00040 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Announcement Number 483] State Injury Intervention Programs; Notice of Availability of Funds for Fiscal Year 1994 Introduction The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for cooperative agreements for State Injury Intervention Programs. These programs will develop, implement, and evaluate multi-faceted, injury prevention and/or surveillance programs to reduce the incidence of injuries and deaths in the following areas: bicycle-related head injuries, fire-related burn injuries, motor vehicle injuries, firearm-related injuries, violence against women, and alcohol-related injuries. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives described in ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority areas of Violent and Abusive Behavior and Unintentional Injuries. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the Section Where to Obtain Additional Information. ) Authority This program announcement is authorized under Sections 301, 317, and 391&hyph;394 (42 U.S.C. 241, 247b, and 280b&hyph;280b&hyph;3) of the Public Health Service Act as amended. Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Eligible Applicants Assistance will be provided only to the official public health agencies of States or their bona fide agents. This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. In addition, official public health agencies of county or city governments with jurisdictional populations greater than 3,500,000 (based on 1990 census data) are eligible. Availability of Funds Approximately $3,500,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund up to twenty projects to implement and evaluate injury intervention and surveillance programs in five priority areas: bicycle-related head injuries (4&hyph;5 to be awarded), fire-related burn injuries (4&hyph;5 to be awarded), motor vehicle injuries (4&hyph;5 to be awarded), firearm-related injuries (6 to be awarded), and alcohol-related injuries (1 to be awarded). Awards are expected to range from $150,000 to $200,000 with an average award of $175,000 for each 12-month budget period. In addition, approximately $750,000 will be available to fund up to three projects to perform activities for the prevention of violence against women. Awards are expected to range from $225,000 to $275,000, with an average award of $250,000. Funds are expected to be awarded on or about September 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period. Programs addressing bicycle-related head injuries, fire-related burn injuries, motor vehicle injuries, firearm-related injuries, and alcohol-related injuries will have a 3-year project period and those addressing violence against women will have a 5-year project period. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project periods will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress as evidenced by required reports and the availability of funds. Note : At the request of the applicant, Federal personnel may be assigned in lieu of a portion of the financial assistance. Purpose The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to enable State public health agencies to implement and evaluate priority injury prevention and control activities. Specifically, State public health agencies may submit applications to develop programs in EACH OR ANY of six areas: 1. Prevention of bicycle-related head injuries through increased usage of bicycle helmets; 2. Prevention of fire-related burns through increased installation and utilization of smoke detectors; 3. Prevention of motor vehicle injuries through increased usage of occupant protection, including seat belts, child safety seats, and air bags; 4. Identification of firearm-related injuries; 5. Identification and prevention of violence against women; and 6. Identification and prevention of alcohol-related injuries. Programs in any of these six areas will develop, implement, and evaluate targeted activities designed to accurately measure and reduce morbidity, mortality, severity, disability, and costs associated with injuries. This funding will allow the applicant to establish or strengthen a lead capacity for prevention and control of the targeted injury (e.g., bicycle-related head injuries). It is expected that any program developed will function as a component of the public health agency's injury control program, will coordinate related activities both within the agency and within the jurisdiction, and will mobilize, seek input from, and utilize broad coalitions.
