Azerbaijan Signs Russian Peace Plan With Reservations"] [Text] Azerbaijan has joined the protocol on a cease-fire in the area of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, which was earlier signed by the Armenian parliament chief, representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, and also mediators from the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly. While affixing his signature to the Bishkek document, Azerbaijani Parliament Chairman Rasul Guliyev voiced two reservations. The Azerbaijani side requested that the term "occupied territories" be replaced with "seized territories." The Azerbaijani side also changed the passage setting forth the need to bring in CIS observers into "international observers or international forces." Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, Russian special envoy, said in a press conference in Baku that these amendments should not be seen as changes to the text itself, because "for all those who signed the document in Bishkek the text will remain just as they signed it." When asked why the cities of Lachin and Shusha were not included in the list of regions to be freed from a troop presence, he said: "The situation of Shusha is somewhat reminiscent of Jerusalem's. The Azerbaijani side says that this is its city, but the Armenian side does not agree." So far, the Russian plan calls for the cities of Agdam, Dzhebrail, Fizuli, Zangelan, and a number of others to be freed. Kazimirov denied a statement that Russia is trying to realize its imperial ambitions. He said that Russia's objective is to put an end to the drawn-out conflict. The Russian envoy recalled that the Moscow-proposed plan includes three stages: a cease-fire and the cessation of hostilities within six days; the release of all seized territories (except for Shusha and Lachin), a speedy exchange of hostages and prisoners of war, and the restoration of communications within 34 days. The third stage involves negotiations on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Meanwhile, the decision by the Azerbaijani parliament leadership to sign the Bishkek protocol has drawn a negative reaction from many opposition forces. On 10 May, a joint statement was passed by 12 of the republic's political parties. "Azerbaijani political forces do not recognize the protocol signed in Bishkek, because it runs counter to the interests of the Azerbaijani nation and effectively legally formalizes the separation of the cities of Shusha and Lachin from Azerbaijan," the appeal says. The document stresses that disengagement forces may only be brought into the region under the aegis of the United Nations and the CSCE. Representatives of 12 political parties called on People's Assembly deputies to voice a protest against the Russian Federation peace plan and to annul Rasul Guliyev's signature under the protocol. In Baku, the possibility of implementing the Bishkek protocol is assessed pessimistically, because after Rasul Guliyev signed the protocol, David Shakhnazaryan, the Armenian president's special envoy, said that the Karabakh forces were not going to leave the occupied Azerbaijani territories in any event unless peacekeeping troops are brought into the region. Azerbaijan, however, opposes this approach, believing that if any disengagement forces are to be brought in, this move must be preceded by a complete withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied territories.
