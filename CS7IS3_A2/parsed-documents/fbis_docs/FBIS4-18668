Is the correction on the international share markets already at the point of ending? One look at the development of leading market indicators around the middle of the week could give precisely that impression. After turbulent days with high losses in rates, the stockbrokers again enjoyed rising rates. It will probably be no more than a short breather, however. Anyone who looks at the basic data -- removed from all the hectic of the market, the hysteria of some brokers, and the often little illuminating comments by analysts -- comes to the conclusion: The international share markets are currently correcting the excesses of the past year. And this correction does not seem to be completely over yet. The danger of a profound slump is not particularly great, however. Once again, the hedge funds and other professional speculators, such as the big banks' own brokers, smelled a rat in time. This was not difficult. In contrast to the majority of analysts, they correctly advocated the view that a rising prime rate in the United States would put a temporary end to the boom on the bond markets and then on the share markets. The speculators got rid of large amounts of those investments that were good in 1993, but had become too expensive in the end. After losses in the quotations over the past few weeks, some of which were painfully high, it now seems that good advice is difficult to get. Many analysis, who predicted skyrocketing rates at the beginning of the year, are now exercising -- in conformity with the market -- slump scenarios. If, however, one takes a sober look at the situation, the following scenario seems to be likely: If interests in the United States continue to rise and there are prospects that the dollar will go up, more and more uncertain U.S. investors will take their leave from the share markets all over the world and will invest their money in domestic bonds. This leads to another correction of the excessively expensive dividend values. In the United Stats and on most of the European markets, shares are still too expensive, measured by the usual target figures and compared with the past. Conservative European investors will not be willing to fill the gap left behind by withdrawing U.S. capital at such high prices. Therefore, the correction on Wall Street and at the European stock exchanges will continue. However, this very likely correction of values is laying the foundation for a new, well-founded upswing at the end of the year. The U.S. interest policy will probably lead to a low-inflation, constant growth in the Anglo-Saxon countries. Together with rising company profits, this will provide the stock markets with trust and higher rates; the European markets will follow with a slight delay. At the moment, there is no fundamental justification for a slump. Therefore, investors with courage and good nerves are selling shares and U.S. bonds; they are buying European bonds. And, being certain of generous interest revenues, they are waiting for the appropriate opportunity to purchase on the share markets.
