FBIS4-28593 "dreas113_m_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-113 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 Thailand Villagers Want `Safe Area' Camp Moved Villagers Want `Safe Area' Camp Moved BK1306093694 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 13 Jun 94 pp 1, 4 BK1306093694 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Excerpt] Most villagers living in the vicinity of the so-called "safe area" for dissident Burmese students in Rat Buri's Pak Tho district are disgusted with the behaviour of the students, saying they are unruly, aggressive and arrogant, with a distinct bent for the bottle. The villagers say they would rather see the Burmese Students Centre, as the designated safe area is officially called, relocated elsewhere so that peace can once again return to their community. Relations between the villagers and the students worsened recently when four Burmese at the centre were injured in attacks by Thai villagers, with each side blaming the other for the escalating tension. The incident sparked an outcry from the students who duly filed through their representatives complaints with the Interior Ministry, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and foreign embassies in Bangkok, and also used the media to highlight their plight. The students say they have been targets of constant attack by villagers and since their so-called "safe area" was no longer secure they didn't want to continue living there. There are a total of 183 Burmese housed at the Rat Buri centre, also called Ban Maniloi, according to the latest count. The students told the media of the stress they were going through stemming from the constant fear of another attack by Thai villagers since the security guards at the entrance of the centre not only didn't help them but tended to side with the villagers. "We want to live with the Thai villagers like brothers and sisters, but we do not know why the villagers do not like us and want to hurt us," one of them said. But according to the villagers the Burmese are the trouble-makers, a fact confirmed by camp officials, who requested anonymity. Samruai Kaenkut, the headman of Ban Maniloi, was less critical, saying as far as he knew only 16 students had acted in an arrogant and irresponsible manner, causing trouble not only to their colleagues but also to the villagers. Police have to be careful in dealing with them because the students being foreigners, any legal action against them may entail intervention from foreign missions in Bangkok, including the UNHCR. The alleged rape of a seven-year-old schoolgirl of Wat Maniloi School by a Burmese student is believed to have sparked the local anger and subsequent attacks on the Burmese. Police have said they will take action but after consulting their superiors and after they have gathered more evidence. [passage omitted]
