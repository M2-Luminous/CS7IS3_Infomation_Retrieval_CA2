In 1993, more than 1.4 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign funds were actually put to use in Shenzhen, doubling the figure for the previous year. Foreign-funded enterprises reported an export volume of more than 5.6 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 25 percent and accounting for more than 70 percent of the city's total. Over the past 14 years, the city has utilized nearly six billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign funds. In recent years, foreign investors have been encouraged to invest in the city's energy, transportation, and high- and new-tech industries. The foreign-funded enterprises in the city are in good performance and a sample survey showed that some 80 percent of them are profitable. A total of 370 foreign-funded enterprises increased their registered capital and extended terms of operation last year, according to a city office in charge of foreign investment.
