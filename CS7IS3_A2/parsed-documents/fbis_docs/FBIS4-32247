[Nagy] That of course would be difficult to calculate. But it would be meaningless to speculate about this if for no other reason than because the trade unions are the natural allies of a party that is pursuing social democratic values. If you were to ask me what would have happened to the MSZP without the trade unions' support, that would be the same as asking me what would have become of the MSZP if it had not started as a social democratic party in the elections? [FIGYELO] In 1989 the MSZOSZ still defined itself as a trade union movement that stood above fights between political parties. Why has the MSZOSZ altered its standpoint? [Nagy] Many people believe that this is the final resolution of an alliance, formed of necessity, between two organizations forced into quarantine in 1990. But that is not how things stand. Actually, what has changed is the situation rather than our standpoint. It was normal for us to distance ourselves from the elections and political parties during the change of political systems. But now we are speaking about the possibility and necessity of changing governments. What kind of government comes to power cannot be indifferent to the trade unions. [FIGYELO] In the autumn of 1993 you people regarded an election alliance conceivable not just with the MSZP but also with the NDSZ [National Democratic Association] and the Agrarian Alliance. But not with the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], the most likely coalition partner of the MSZP. How will you fit into a governing coalition that advocates two liberal economic policies? [Nagy] On this I am able to express only my own personal opinion, which does not play a role in the MSZP's choice of a coalition partner. Nor would it be right if it did play a role. As a trade union leader, I would not welcome a government economic policy that could be described by a single adjective, as liberal. Simply put, it would mean that the strong maintain their footing while the weak go under. If thinking in terms of shock therapy were added to all this, that would lead to conflicts. In my opinion, incidentally, the economic policy of the MSZP is characterized not so much by liberalism as by pragmatism. [FIGYELO] I assume that your acceptance of the MSZP's economic policy concept, which bears the hallmark of Laszlo Bekesi's name and is of a liberal nature after all, was also a condition of your nomination by the MSZP as a candidate for a parliamentary seat. [Nagy] I have already declared on several occasions that this program--together with its associated employment, social policy, and other programs, of course--is readily acceptable to the trade unions. At the same time, nobody has demanded of me that I, on behalf of the trade unions, endorse every line of this program and thereby give the future government what amounts to a blank check. [FIGYELO] In the end the MSZP adopted the fifth version of the Bekesi program. To what extent are the changes in the final version a result of the agreement between the MSZP and the MSZOSZ? [Nagy] We did not take part in the program's substantive elaboration, but our views were well known to the leadership of the MSZP. In the course of the debate within the MSZP, wording more agreeable to us as well were included in the program. The final version, for instance, is socially more sensitive to the problems of the strata in the worst possible situation, and it regards the reduction of unemployment as a direct objective. [FIGYELO] What do you think? Will the majority within the MSZP parliamentary group hold opinions closer to your own or to Bekesi's? [Nagy] I would be unable to assess that, and I do not know what others are thinking. But on certain questions--and here I have primarily the social problems in mind--I would not be surprised to see a majority holding views closer to my own. Otherwise our relations with Bekesi are proper; we hold consultations regularly, and also debates when necessary. [FIGYELO] During the election campaign Gyula Horn frequently advanced the argument that shifting the transformation's burdens onto wage and salary earners could not continue. You yourself said that workers have had to pay an inordinately high price for the transformation. It suggests that this is something the new government could remedy quickly, whereas spending at the expense of growing internal and external debt and the long-continuing squandering of assets have also meant the squandering of our future, which makes illusory the promise of maintaining the level of real incomes in the coming years. [Nagy] Nobody is promising a quick turnaround. We know very well that it is not possible to aim for practically full employment and a slower rate of inflation in the short term. It is particularly tragic that, to a large extent, the population's sacrifices have been in vain, because in the end the outgoing government has failed in the fiscal and monetary sphere as well. Everyone knows that difficult years are ahead. Nowhere do I find any expectations of a miracle. [FIGYELO] Do you agree with Laszlo Bekesi's statement that, under the conditions of the present crisis, social democratic answers to the problems are not possible? [Nagy] Yes. This period is not conducive to social democratic values, but they must be upheld nevertheless. The most serious social problems have to be remedied. [FIGYELO] Do you accept that halting the rapid worsening of the budget deficit and its subsequent improvement will be the principal task in the coming years? [Nagy] Perhaps this is the correct formulation in view of the sequence of the tasks. But it would be more to my liking to say that we must strive simultaneously to create the conditions for a balanced budget and economic recovery, to reduce unemployment, to roll back inflation, and to manage our social problems. Or more accurately, to optimize these partially conflicting objectives. [FIGYELO] According to Laszlo Bekesi, budgetary reform would be accompanied by a reduction of real incomes, by 4 or 5 percent a year over a period of three years, and about half of this reduction could be offset. What do these figures mean to you? [Nagy] According to the MSZP's economic policy program, budgetary reform would have to be accompanied by compensation for most members of society. If the government found that this was not feasible, it would have to negotiate with the trade unions. It is still too early to speak of numbers. But we certainly think it will be essential to halt the decline of wages within the foreseeable future, and to raise the real value of the smallest pensions, even in the short term. [FIGYELO] All the present opposition parties are against the current consolidation of banks and debtors, or rather the manner in which this is being done. How does the MSZOSZ feel about this? [Nagy] We are convinced that the rescuing of some enterprises is warranted. Consolidation should have begun sooner. But the state cannot make a practice of using taxpayers' money to rescue, time and again, the firms that get into trouble. In our opinion, the way to reconcile these two requirements is to complete the privatization of the banks as soon as possible. Then it will be in the banks' best interest to choose the solutions that will be the most suitable also in the long run. These solutions, of course, will vary by enterprises. In other words, we too oppose the present state-administrative mechanism of decisionmaking. [FIGYELO] Last fall the MSZOSZ published its standpoint on privatization in which it demanded first of all that closer attention be paid to considerations of employment. Does the MSZOSZ really believe that disguised unemployment has already ceased at the enterprises about to be privatized, and structurally they already meet the market's requirements? In other words, that layoffs at these enterprises can be avoided? [Nagy] We oppose the present practice of privatization that strives for maximum proceeds--which, incidentally, are then squandered--and does not care what happens to the enterprises after privatization. Therefore, we believe, preference should be given to buyers who guarantee to maintain the level of employment and to raise the capital. [FIGYELO] On the one hand, I do not believe that buyers paying cash are not interested in the enterprises' efficient operation in the future. On the other hand, I feel that the wider employee stock ownership, which the MSZOSZ has also been demanding, is in conflict with your concern for the enterprises' future. After all, workers usually do not have money to invest, and delaying necessary layoffs could drive the entire firm into bankruptcy. [Nagy] It would be a misconception to conclude from MSZOSZ support for employee stock ownership programs that the MSZOSZ believes in employees' holding a majority interest. We think it is more important that the firm be in good hands and the workers hold well-paying jobs than that they become owners. At the same time we believe that it would be expedient if also representatives of the industrial union concerned were present when privatization decisions were being made. Even the mutual exchange of information could avoid many misunderstandings. [FIGYELO] Don't you think that insistence on transferring state assets to Social Insurance should cease? On the one hand, a large proportion of state assets earns hardly any income. On the other hand, Social Insurance would not be a good owner because of its inability to raise capital and its incentive to extract as much profit as possible. [Nagy] Professional investors abroad welcome union pension funds, for instance, as co-owners of equity. Social Insurance's short-term paucity of cash unquestionably creates a contradictory situation. All these problems should be thought through in the bill on Social Insurance. [FIGYELO] In your dual capacity as trade union chairman and Social Insurance officer, you must have had opportunity to enjoy the pleasures stemming from the contradictions between being a ruling-party member of parliament and holding trade union office. As trade union chairman, you should be demanding the reduction of social insurance contributions, which entrepreneurs particularly find detrimental and which are an especially serious obstacle to job creation in the regular economy. But as an officer of Social Insurance, you have an interest in increasing its revenue, from which benefits are paid. To resolve this contradiction, the MSZOSZ has invented a solution that has been aired in the media, namely to offset the reduction of social insurance contributions by reallocating tax revenues. To my mind, that is merely juggling. [Nagy] The contradiction you mentioned exists only partially, and there is an answer also to the dilemma of reducing social nsurance contributions. The contributions are so high at present because willingness to pay the contributions is very low, Social Insurance has a substantial amount of contributions owed in its receivables, and many people are working in the underground economy. The next government should have the determination to declare war on the underground economy, although in a civilized manner. In that case the burdens on the regular sphere would be reduced. It is intolerable that many private entrepreneurs are employing even the best skilled workers merely for minimal wages. It is conceivable that in the future the amount of the employees' contribution fund will be determined on the basis of empirical data gathered in the given industry. Health insurance is where I regard as feasible the offsetting of lower contributions with tax revenue, on the principle of universal entitlement to health care. [FIGYELO] In recent months, both the present opposition and the MSZOSZ expressed support for concluding an economic and social pact. Do you think there is any difference in the topics on which the individual organizations wish to reach agreement? [Nagy] At present we are able to speak only of initial and rather tentative intentions. Obvious topics will be all the economic problems we have already mentioned: nominal wages and pensions, inflation, taxes, the burdens of budgetary reform, the development of social entitlements, and of real wages and incomes that can be predicted over a horizon of several years. The MSZOSZ also has objectives on which others perhaps are not laying so much stress. These objectives include laying down the statutory and legal conditions for the current reconciliation of interests, and the trade unions' operating conditions. These are not primarily financial issues. In parliament, for instance, a receiving and transmitting station ought to be established for agreements on the reconciliation of interests. To this day there is no parliamentary committee that could link with parliament's work the information circulating within the system of labor relations. There is also a need to develop the conditions for negotiating agreements at the intermediate--i.e., industry--level; such agreements barely exist at present. But if a country attaches importance to properly functioning trade unions, then I think it is conceivable that the trade unions could be granted tax exemptions for publishing newspapers, and for their hotels or commercial office buildings. [FIGYELO] Do I understand you correctly? Is the MSZOSZ demanding the expansion of the influence of the trade union apparatus, in exchange for the trade unions' self-restraint, the extent of which is, of course, open to bargaining? [Nagy] There is no question of that at all, because one is not a substitute for the other. We obviously have to represent the employees' interests first and foremost. The operating conditions stem from the trade union movement's participation in the reconciliation of interests, and related considerations rank only second, but they too are important. [FIGYELO] It is conspicuous that the militant job actions in recent months--the locomotive engineers' strike, and aviation mechanics' strike--were organized by unions that do not belong to the MSZOSZ. [Nagy] These strikes were staged in small, closed trades capable of asserting their interests effectively. The workers in these trades belong to either the League [Democratic League of Independent Trade Unions] or the Autonomous Trade Unions. In light of this, I am especially surprised, and occasionally slightly offended or perhaps bemused, to hear ourselves accused of demagoguery. During the past four years, in a period of rapidly rising unemployment and continually declining real wages, MSZOSZ policy has remained unchanged. We will continue to seek the most sensible solutions, within the limits of economic reality. [FIGYELO] In the absence of exact criteria, I suspect, trade union leaders are doomed to being accused constantly of either demagoguery or capitulation. In the open reconciliation of interests, nevertheless, there can be a role also for the views of trades, and for the various groups within society that have contrasting interests. But many people fear the intertwining of the MSZOSZ and MSZP in parliament because it offers an opportunity for bad compromises behind the scene, just as in the period of the party-state. Especially worrisome is the growing influence of the trade unions in lagging industries, because it could delay structural change. [Nagy] Nobody is thinking of secret agreements. The point is specifically that, through the economic and social pact, the public can be initiated into the economy's real dilemmas and able to understand also the background of moves made under the pressure of necessity. But this process also has its own psychology. The government must begin to reveal the situation with moves that demonstrate its own determination, such as putting an end to state squandering, unnecessary offices, and other expenditures. I realize that the resulting savings would be insignificant in comparison with the shortage, but they would demonstrate that the government is practicing what it preaches. The other urgent state task is law enforcement, the already mentioned action against the underground economy. If the government advances in these areas, it will have moral authority to ask even for further temporary belt-tightening, in view of the difficult economic situation. Straightforward talk and the government's new work method could liberate enormous energy. Under these conditions the trade unions could be ready and willing to conclude an honorable agreement.
