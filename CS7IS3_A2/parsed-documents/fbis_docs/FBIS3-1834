This was a necessary response made at the request of members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's [SAR] Preparatory Committee and people in different circles and was also aimed at the British side's unilateral publication of the White Paper last week, which distorts the contents of the talks. The publication of the truth about the talks is good for clarifying views and enables the facts to refute the British side's slanders and attacks. After reading the full text published by the Chinese side, Hong Kong people will, naturally, understand that during the 17 rounds of talks in eight months last year, there was a strong contrast between the two sides' stands and attitudes: The Chinese side was sincere during consultations, took the overall interests into account, repeatedly expressed its views with good intentions, made flexible concessions, and showed extreme forbearance. Whereas the British side acted obstinately and shamelessly; was rude, unreasonable, and overbearing; raised side issues; and deliberately undermined the talks. We can say that the concessions the Chinese side made at the negotiating table exceeded the expectations of many Hong Kong people; apart from this, the Chinese side was ready to enter into further consultations and seek further mutual understanding and mutual accommodation but the British side finally took action which caused a breakdown in the talks. Despite all this, the Chinese side still maintained the tolerance of a large and proud country, kept its former commitments, and did not publish the British side's inglorious record at the talks. However, the British side was the first to violate the understanding if secrecy between the two sides, so that the Chinese side had no alternative but to publish the main points which had been distorted by the British side. Reviewing the talks, their whole process seems to appear before us. Of course, this makes it easier to see more clearly that the British side was bent on confrontation and had no sincerity on reaching an agreement with the Chinese side through negotiations. Originally, both sides had agreed to proceed with the talks on the basis of the "three conformities," namely conformity with the Sino- British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and Sino-British understandings. From the very beginning of the talks, the British side resorted to the tactic of confirming the "three conformities" principle in abstract and negating it in reality. As a result, the talks were delayed and could not proceed on a correct track. The White Paper published by the British side last week mentions that the British side evaded the principles confirmed by the Chinese side according to the "three conformities." "Annex One" to the Chinese side's full text published yesterday fully lists the contents of the eight-point principles confirmed. Chinese and foreign personalities can see that these principles are the original meaning of the "three conformities." Why did the British side say that it was difficult to confirm? It did this because it wanted to persist in Chris Patten's "three violations" program, having no sincerity at all in the talks! The British side's White Paper uses the elections of functional constituencies to attack the Chinese side, saying that the elections of functional constituencies "can be manipulated by others" and "may lead to corruption and irregularities." As a matter of fact, the elections of functional constituencies were invented by the British side and they recommended them to the Chinese side. Long ago, both sides had already reached an agreement and understanding on the nature and electoral methods of functional constituencies. The problem was that the British side wanted to break the agreement and change the elections to disguised direct elections, therefore it tried to play down the importance of functional constituencies' elections at all costs. Unquestionably, functional constituencies' elections have their limitations but, as a transitional means under the principle of gradual and orderly progress, they will play a positive role. What was published by the Chinese side yesterday provides strict logical reasoning in refuting the British side's slanders on functional constituencies' elections and the participants. What was published by the Chinese side points out: The British side's accusation is utterly groundless and does not respect voters or the incumbent legislative councilors elected by functional constituencies. The main topic of the 17th round of Sino-British talks was on Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements. However, from the very beginning of the talks, the British side insisted on talking about three issues purely within the category of Chinese sovereignty, including the personnel arrangements for the Hong Kong SAR's Preparatory Committee. What was published yesterday clarifies the Chinese side's stand on these questions. Hong Kong people also know that from the beginning of the talks, the British side talked glibly about setting what it calls the objective criteria for boarding the "through train." Logically speaking, there must be convergence of rails before a through train can pass. As Hong Kong people put it vividly: There must be a "through train" before passengers can board it." Furthermore, many Hong Kong people pointed out long ago that the definition of qualifications for "boarding the through train" completely falls within the category of Chinese sovereignty and so does not require any consultations with the British side at all. But the British side wanted to talk about the so-called "criteria" for "boarding the through train." What was published yesterday reveals that the Chinese side even made major concessions on this and provided four-point explanations but the British side did not accept and insisted that a pledging method should be introduced to replace the appointment of members for the SAR's Preparatory Committee. As a matter of fact, it wants to completely deprive the Preparatory Committee of its appointment right--a right which gives expression to Chinese sovereignty. The publication of the truth about the talks suggests to Hong Kong citizens and the entire Chinese people that these colonialists who are moving toward their doomsday are ferociously and constantly making harsh demands. If this can be tolerated, what cannot?
