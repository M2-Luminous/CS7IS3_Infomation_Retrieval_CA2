The US and Russia have called upon India and Pakistan to join a multilateral forum for arms control. It was obvious at the time of the signing of the NPT that the spread of nuclear weapons would ultimately facilitate it for the sponsors to claim a tremendous success and advocate its extension. Flaws were pointed out by India then. It is a proof of the abject failure of the conduct of Indian diplomacy that while almost all the Indian proposals for nuclear disarmament have been subsequently accepted by the world community, the latter has now pleaded with India to accept those proposals! In South Asia, there is a situation of nuclear asymmetry, with an advanced nuclear capable China on one side and acquisition of nuclear weapon capability by Pakistan, on the other. This asymmetry is not conducive to regional stability. If strategic deterrence is to be achieved, in view of the on-going missile proliferation around India, then again, acquisition of nuclear weapon capability seems the only viable option. There is an essential universality of nuclear deterrence logic and it is as true for India and Pakistan as it was for the USA and USSR. If nuclear deterrence sustained peace in the developed world, even during the Cold War, it would sustain peace and stability in South Asia after the Cold War. The objective of the nuclear policy followed by India and Pakistan is to make certain that there is no direct nuclear threat without them being able to retaliate. During the Cold War, each had the strategic support of a superpower. Now in the absence of earlier assurances there is a need that can only be fulfilled by an overt nuclear stability in the region. Since wars in South Asia have mostly been caused by misconceptions about relative strength, there would be greater stability once such misconceptions are removed, generating the logic of deterrence peculiar to nuclear weapons. It should be obvious to the Government of India that if it did not change its policy of nuclear abstinence, it would face a highly inimical asymmetrical predicament vis-a-vis Pakistan. In fact, our nuclear disarmament effort is a convenient and self-defeating myth. The continued nuclear brahmacharya [celibacy] of India is bound to force the rest of South Asia, China and the USA to re-evaluate their attitude towards India, and that re-evaluation would not be in our favour. If calculated meaningful ambiguity is taken for bluff then the force of deterrence is lost. The tact that the ambiguity was an emasculated one was evident from the lack of any sufficient technology effort to use any mythical "bombs in the basement" in the event of any nuclear attack by, say, Pakistan. The very talk of `minimum deterrence' highlights our confused perception of the dimensions of the nuclear war. Security involves the capability to absorb the full intensity of a nuclear attack and the retaliatory ability to inflict unacceptable damage on the enemy. That is true deterrence and it is credible only if the enemy understands, not the bland assurances that we will be able to "retaliate at short notice when the need arises." Once the nuclear status of India and Pakistan is understood and acknowledged mutual deterrence would make it possible for confidence building measures to evolve on a mutually agreed basis. After possessing a minimum deterrent capability and survivable delivery system, it would not be necessary, at least for India, to enter into a nuclear arms race. Since deterrence would be the objective, and not the accumulation of a large arsenal, a South Asian nuclear arm race would not be needed. The proposal of nuclear free South Asia is not in conformity with the prevailing realities, and what we can do is to attempt to create a nuclear weapons-safe South Asia. Mutual arms reductions and confidence building can be attempted once nuclear stability is reached in South Asia. There is a deliberate Western policy to project an exaggerated over-nuclearised scenario in South Asia where tactical nuclear weapons are integrated even in routine military exercises. Therefore, a need to maintain `nuclear restraint' while trying to save the situation through regional arms control measures [sentence as published]. The Seymor Hersh article, in the NEW YORKER, was one such plant about events in 1990 that supposedly almost led to a nuclear war between the two countries. But this policy has to be viewed in the light of what happened with the much-publicised Indo-Russian cryogenic engine deal. More than the concerns about non-proliferation, and potential uses of the rocket, it was a message to India that it would be impossible to operate independently of the USA as far as proliferation is concerned; and it would not be possible for the Russians to rescue India, like in the past. One flaw in this approach is the continuing and wishful habit of treating India and Pakistan at par. Any parity, if it has to be calculated at all, can only be between India and China. With the prevalence of the India-Pakistan one, formulations of the Cold War era are again dominating South Asia. Closed-door `clubs' and `regimes' intending to impose unilateral sanctions and restrictions on technology in a discriminatory manner cannot prevent proliferation. Neither is this possible only through the arms-reduction approach. The Missile Technology Control Regime has not been as effective a deterrent as it is claimed. Pakistan's missile programme has not suffered, for example. As China pointed out in October 1993, "conditional moratorium designed to maintain nuclear superiority while refusing to renounce nuclear deterrence and commit ourselves to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons is of no significance." There has been talk that while India may not sign the NPT, it will unilaterally give an assurance to abide by its provisions. Obviously, such proposals have not taken into consideration the ineffectiveness of the International Atomic Energy Agency verifications as far as clandestine diversions are concerned. We know too well about Israel, South Africa, Iraq, Pakistan and North Korea. Since the objective of our nuclear policy is no longer valid, continuation with ambivalence would serve no purpose. Merely reiterating that India would hot be the first one to introduce nuclear weapons in the region cannot take the place of a definite policy option. That is possible if steps are taken to trade off costly conventional forces for nuclear capability while simultaneously pursuing regional confidence building measures. This would not only lower the risk factors but reduce the danger of the use of nuclear weapons, by design or accident.
