Replying to a question on the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] news programme AGENDA as to why the ANC refused police presence in the townships and at the same time demanded it, Mr Niehaus denied the ANC had refused to let the police perform their duties. He said what the ANC wanted was "proper policing", not policing by people who were involving themselves in the violence and were unpopular in the townships. "We have heard time and again from residents that they don't want the ISUs in the townships. Ask anyone and they will give you an unequivocal `no' to the presence of these units." Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] National Organiser Maxwell Nemadzivhanane said the police worked for an illegitimate regime and township residents therefore considered the Transitional Executive Council and the ISUs to be illegitimate. He added the police were finding it difficult to maintain law and order in the townships "simply because they are not acceptable there". "As long as we don't have a government that's acceptable, they (the police) are illegitimate," he said. Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] member Hennie Bekker said the IFP was against withdrawing the ISUs and said a "small war" was going on in Natal. It was "all right to criticise", but the units were necessary to prevent further slaughter. Asked whether there had been specific complaints about the ISUs, Law and Order Deputy Minister Gert Myburgh said the Goldstone Commission had reported that attacks on uniformed police were so widespread that the ISUs "had to stay". He said the police had investigated many cases, including a number against policemen, and did not spare colleagues found guilty of offences. Asked about reports that Tanzania had banned violent actions by the PAC against South Africa, Mr Nemadzivhanane said Tanzania nevertheless remained a strong supporter and was "only asking us not to make claims". On allegations of violence and lawlessness committed by self defence units, Mr Niehaus said the reasons were complex. The ANC was presently restructuring the units and it was hoped they would return to their original objectives.
