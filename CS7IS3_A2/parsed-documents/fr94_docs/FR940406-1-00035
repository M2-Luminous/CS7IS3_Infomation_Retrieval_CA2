FR940406-1-00035 FR940406-1-00011 The impact of the growing light truck population on energy conservation efforts can be more fully appreciated when the CAFE of the total light truck fleet is compared with that of the total passenger car fleet. The light truck CAFE is approximately 21 mpg, while the passenger car CAFE is approximately 28 mpg. NHTSA also notes that there has been increasing concern in recent years about the impact of cars, light trucks and other personal vehicles on global warming. There is an almost direct relationship between fuel consumption and emission of carbon dioxide, a primary ``greenhouse'' gas. In other words, reducing fuel consumption also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. As part of the Administration's Climate Change Action Plan, issued in October 1993, the White House's National Economic Council, the Office on Environmental Policy and the Office of Science and Technology Policy will co-chair a process to develop measures to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles. The efforts of the task force may have a bearing on future light truck fuel economy standards. NHTSA also notes that the Administration is supporting research in improving vehicle fuel efficiency in a number of areas, including the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. However, the purpose of this notice is a limited one_requesting comments to assist NHTSA in developing a proposal for light truck CAFE average fuel economy standards for model years after 1997, possibly through MY 2006. To aid the agency in obtaining useful comments, this notice discusses a variety of issues which are considered by NHTSA in developing a CAFE standard proposal, and asks a number of questions and makes a number of requests for data. For easy reference, the questions and requests are numbered consecutively throughout the document. In providing a comment on a particular matter or in responding to a particular question, interested persons are requested to provide any relevant factual information to support their conclusions or opinions, including but not limited to test data, statistical and cost data, and the source of such information. In addition to the questions in the body of this notice, NHTSA is also including an appendix to this notice which consists of a number of additional questions directed primarily toward light truck manufacturers. The appendix questions address their product plans through MY 2006 and the assumptions underlying those plans. The agency recognizes that the manufacturers' product plans may not be approved formally for even the earlier model years addressed in this notice and that some of the questions may be difficult to answer. Setting standards well in advance instead of only one or two years in advance necessitates reliance on less definitive information. However, that approach is necessary in order for the agency to attain greater CAFE improvements. The agency would appreciate answers that are as responsive as possible so that appropriate weight can be given to the many factors whose magnitude now can only be estimated. While the questions in the appendix are directed toward manufacturers, the agency welcomes comments from all interested persons in response to those questions. II. The Statute Section 502(b) of the Cost Savings Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue light truck fuel economy standards for each model year. The Act provides that the fuel economy standards must be set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level. In determining maximum feasible average fuel economy level, the Secretary is required under section 502(e) of the Act to consider four factors: Technological feasibility; economic practicability; the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy; and the need of the nation to conserve energy. The Secretary is permitted but not required to set separate standards for different classes of light trucks. (Responsibility for the automotive fuel economy program was delegated by the Secretary of Transportation to the Administrator of NHTSA (41 FR 25015, June 22, 1976.) Based on definitions and judicial interpretations of similar terms in other statutes, the agency interprets ``feasible'' to refer to something that is capable of being done. Therefore, a standard set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level must: (1) Be capable of being done and (2) be at the highest level that is capable of being done, taking account of what manufacturers are able to do in light of technological feasibility, economic practicability, how other Federal motor vehicle standards affect average fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy.
