The conservative CHOSON ILBO on 7 February carries on page 1, a 300-word report by reporter Kim Sung-yong from New York on a new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK. Under the headlines, "To Seize Pyongyang if North Korea Invades South Korea" and "THE NEW YORK TIMES Reports Change in U.S. strategy in ROK Defense," the report quotes the U.S. newspaper as reporting on 6 February that "the United States recently amended its strategy on defending the ROK in order to cope with possible changes in the situation on the Korean peninsula, such as North Korea's recent moves for nuclear development." The report also quotes the U.S. paper as reporting that the new strategy was initiated by the former Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea and supplemented by Gary Luck, the present Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea. Both the moderate HANGUK ILBO and the moderate TONG-A ILBO of 7 February carry 300-word reports respectively by New York-based correspondent Kim Su-chong and reporter Kim Cha-ung in New York on the front page regarding the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK. The reports cite THE NEW YORK TIMES as reporting that if North Korea attacks South Korea, the United States even has plans to seize Pyongyang and overthrow the Kim Il-song regime. They also note that the U.S. daily is concerned over North Korea's concentration of its conventional armed forces and weapons near the DMZ. On page 5, the moderate TONG-A ILBO carries a 2,500-word "gist" of the contents of the new U.S. plan for defending the ROK. Under the headlines, "A Plan For Advance Beyond Pyongyang Yet To Be Determined," "North Korea Increases Artillery Positions Around Yongbyon Nuclear Site 10 Times," and "Five U.S. Radar Systems Now Under Operation," the gist includes two parts. Under the subhead of "North Korea's Strategy for a Southward Invasion and Its Military Strength," the first part describes the gist of the content of North Korea's strategy for invading South Korea and its military capability, while noting its recent preparations for a southward invasion, including the possible infiltration of its special commandos into the rear area of the ROK and U.S. forces, the deployment of more antiaircraft artillery units in Yongbyon area, and the troop concentration near the DMZ. Under the subhead of "Plan For Defending The ROK" the second part describes the gist of the contents of plans for various joint operations between the ROK and U.S. forces, to repel North Korea's invasion. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on 7 February carries on its front page a brief 200-word article by New York-based correspondent Pak Su-man on the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK and follows it up with a 900-word analysis of this development by the same reporter on page 4 under the headline of "From Whence Did the New U.S. Defense Strategy Emerge?" Noting recent reports of U.S. plans to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to South Korea and to send an aircraft carrier to Korean waters, as well as the moves to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, the article says that the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK reflects the recent stance of the hard line group in the United States toward the North Korean nuclear issue. Expressing concern that the U.S. strategy for "seizing Pyongyang" will aggravate Pyongyang, the article stresses that the strategy can be viewed as a sort of pressure on North Korea in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue. Noting North Korea's possession of various types of missiles, including the Nodong-1 long-range missiles; its development of the Nodong-2 missile; and the recent reports on concentration of North Korean troops and huge amounts of various types of artillery guns near the DMZ, the article concludes that "even if North Korea accepts nuclear inspections, the Korean peninsula will still remain a dangerous region as long as these North Korean moves continue." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN on 7 February publishes on page 1 a 140-word report by Washington-based correspondent Chong Yon-chu on the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK under the headlines: "The United States Has Established a Plan to `Seize Pyongyang in Case North Korea Invades the South'" and "THE NEW YORK TIMES Reports The United States is Stepping Up Its Strengthing of U.S. Forces in South Korea and Deployment of the Latest Weapons." The report briefly quotes THE NEW YORK TIMES report on the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on 8 February publishes on page 4 a 900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Kyong-hyon analyzing the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK. The article notes the order by the U.S. Department of Defense to U.S. reservists to be ready for participation in the Team Spirit exercise, reporting that "this is an ultimatum calling for North Korea to clarify if it will accept nuclear inspections." The article notes that such stern countermeasures against North Korea have two meanings: One is that the stern countermeasures are a kind of procedure for the U.S. Government to take in case negotiations with North Korea on the nuclear issue fall through -- realizing it has become difficult to expect a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue -- and the other is that they are a demonstration to threaten North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. Regarding the 6 February THE NEW YORK TIMES report on the new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK, the article notes that the strategy is also another means to apply pressure on the North Korean leadership in connection with the nuclear issue, adding that "in view of such a recent U.S. hard-line attitude we cannot rule out a possibility that the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and North Korea will continue negotiations on nuclear inspections." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on 8 February publishes on page 3 a 800-word editorial entitled "Washington's Hard-line Atmosphere Toward North Korea." The editorial notes the growing tension on the Korean peninsula, including North Korea's increasing military threat following the U.S. announcement of a plan to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea, the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise in case North Korea continues to refuse nuclear inspections, and THE NEW YORK TIMES report on a new U.S. strategy for defending the ROK in which "seizure of Pyongyang" is mentioned. In conclusion, the editorial urges North Korea not to sever dialogue with the IAEA on nuclear inspections.
