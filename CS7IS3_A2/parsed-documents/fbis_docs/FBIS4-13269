Even though Jordanian authorities have said that the measure has been adopted within the framework of their country's political position vis-a-vis the Palestine crisis, no one is in doubt that the will of the Zionist regime has also influenced the decision. The Hamas office in Amman, respecting the sovereignty of the Government of Jordan, continued its solely political and propaganda activities in support of the legitimate and legal struggle of the oppressed nation of Palestine until Rabin, the prime minister of the Zionist regime said that Jordan provided shelter for the Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine. [passage omitted] In reaction to the closure of its office in Jordan, the Islamic Resistance Movement of Palestine warned the Zionist regime that it should not extend the scope of the conflict to outside the occupied Palestine. So far the Palestinian movement of Hamas has limited the scope of its organizational and jihad operations against the Zionist regime to within the occupied territories; and in order to avoid repeating the mistake of the PLO in diverting from the main struggle, it has not carried even a single guerrilla operation against the Zionist regime outside the borders of Palestine. The political and propaganda activities of the political office of Hamas in Jordan, contrary to past PLO activities in that country, have, so far, not created any kind of problem. Therefore, its closure is only due to foreign pressure, particularly by the Zionist regime and probably its Western supporters. That is why it is probable that this decision of the Jordanian Government would have negative consequences on the public opinion of Islamic countries, particularly Jordan, where most of the population are Palestinians and have strong pro-Islamic tendencies. In the opinion of political analysts, the exertion of pressure by Israel on Jordan and Jordan's leniency can have other unpleasant consequences. Such actions will encourage direct and indirect efforts by Tel Aviv to limit activities of Palestinian organizations in other countries of the region and such interference, due to their aggressive nature, would definitely create tension. Also, the aggressive nature of the Zionist regime and its clear interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the region may spread the scope of the Muslim peoples' confrontation against the Zionist regime from the occupied territories to beyond them. Such a situation, in the first instance, will be detrimental to the Zionist regime and the compromising Arab governments.
