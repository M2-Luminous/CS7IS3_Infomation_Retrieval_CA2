The researchers hope to gain clues from this experiment as to how to improve the safety standards for future nuclear reactors. The experimental plant in Cadarache was provided with additional safety equipment to prevent radioactivity from escaping from it. Moreover, the experimental reactor contained only a small fraction of the amount of fuel in reactors of the customary size. That is why critics of the experiment have doubts as to whether the results obtained here in the laboratory can be applied to the conditions in large nuclear power plants. There were contradictory statements with regard to the duration of the experiment, which might also indicate that the experiment could have been prematurely terminated on Thursday of last week. It further means that the results of the experiment will be reported on in the course of this week. The institute wants to undertake five more experiments of this kind over the next few years.
