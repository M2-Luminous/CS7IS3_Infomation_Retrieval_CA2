Speaking to journalists in Moscow on Wednesday he noted that extra funds would not be needed for these purposes. Kolesnikov said that despite positive progress in talks with the Kazakh side on the use of the Baykonur cosmodrome, a lot of problems remain unresolved. At the same time he noted that "today it is impossible to pretend that we do not need Baykonur." Answering questions, Kolesnikov spoke in favor of holding Russian-American military exercises on the Totsk test ground of the Orenburg region this summer. He expressed regret that this issue "caused heated debate" in the State Duma. "They will be command post exercises, and not a single American tank will roll on the Totsk test ground," he said. Kolesnikov said that by the beginning of this year the Russian Armed Forces numbered 2,300,000 military servicemen. He also said that by January 1, 1995, it is planned to reduce the armed forced down to less than 2 million. He said that currently the armed forces are recruited to 62 percent of capacity. He suggested that after the spring draft the figure will remain the same.
