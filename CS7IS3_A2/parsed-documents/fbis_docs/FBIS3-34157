In a statement issued from Cairo yesterday the party called for safeguarding Sudanese unity -- territory and people -- "toppling the [National Islamic] Front's regime," and holding a national constitutional conference based on the Sudanese peace agreement and the charter of the [opposition] National Democratic Grouping. It also stressed that the self-determination question in Sudan has been settled since independence in 1956. It pointed out that this issue has two aspects: a legal aspect and a political aspect. It listed the documents opposed to undermining national unity. It said: We are not listing the legal stipulations and evidence to prove that there are no regional problems in our country, but because political debates must be based on solid legal and realistic foundations, from which to proceed toward finding solutions to the new problems.
