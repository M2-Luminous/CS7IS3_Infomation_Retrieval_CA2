As a major step toward introducing a modern enterprise management mechanism, the province drafted stipulations for the appointment of state-owned enterprise managers or directors this April. According to the stipulations, no one may be reappointed within five years after serving prison terms or being deprived of their political rights for economic crimes; within three years after clearing debts following management of enterprises which went bankrupt owing to poor performance; or for not paying off debts on due dates. Hainan tried the appointment system for managers and directors in the state-owned enterprises before. However, as there were no official rules for it, often managers who had been removed due to poor performance were appointed again to similar or higher positions. The new appointment system declares that a public debate attended by workers' representatives must be held for managerial candidates. A public survey must also be conducted among employees to test workers' trust in their candidates. The move, along with other regulations, has cleared the way for an effective appointment system for the province's management personnel.
