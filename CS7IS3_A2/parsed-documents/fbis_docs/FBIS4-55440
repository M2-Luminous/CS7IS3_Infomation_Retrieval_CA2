FBIS4-55440 "dreeu094_y_94008" FBIS-EEU-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Serbia Seselj Says Bosnian Serbs Need Brcko Corridor Seselj Says Bosnian Serbs Need Brcko Corridor LD1305202694 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1950 GMT 13 May 94 LD1305202694 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Brcko, May 13 (TANJUG) -- Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj said on Friday [13 May] that the crucial battle in the Bosnian civil war would be fought in the area of Brcko in the north, because Brcko was crucial to the Bosnian Serb republic and its loss would jeopardise the Serbs' very survival. Brcko is situated in the neck of a corridor in the Sava river valley. The corridor, which is only 5 km wide at this point, links the western and eastern parts of the Bosnian Serb republic, as well as the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) in the west and Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) in the east. The R.S.K. was formed in [word indistinct] by the local Serbs in those parts within the arbitrary communist-era borders of Croatia where they are the majority population, in response to Croatia's violent secession from Yugoslavia and trampling on their rights. Speaking at a press conference at the close of a visit to Brcko, Seselj said that Croats and Moslems had no leg to stand on in the Sava river valley, 'even with the support of NATO, which can do little else except kill innocent civilians.' Seselj, whose Radical Party is in opposition in the parliaments of both Yugoslavia and its constituent republics of Serbia and Montenegro, insists the Serbs must give no quarter in this battle for the survival of the western Serb states. Commenting on a map which the Croats and Moslems agreed on as the basis for their binational federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Seselj said that `this is something the Americans can do in Nevada, or Arizona, where they have lots of space and can do what they please, but here, they cannot reckon without their host.' Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who have been fighting pitched battles for territories in central Bosnia and Herzegovina for over a year, met in Washington on March 18 and, acting under strong U.S. pressure signed an accord to form a binational federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would subsequently form a confederation with neighbouring Croatia. At their U.S.-sponsored talks in Vienna earlier this week, they laid claim to 58 percent of Bosnian territory. Bosnian Serbs currently control 70 percent of the territory.
