At the beginning of the 1970's, Brazil was under an authoritarian regime, human rights were not respected, protectionism was the economic policy touchstone, and countries intentionally avoided signing nonproliferation agreements in the field of international security. Brazilian-U.S. relations at the time, however, were deemed excellent. So much so, that some critics even classified the Brazilian international position as "sub-imperialistic." There was even a famous sentence uttered by a U.S. president asserting that the rest of Latin America would follow whatever trend Brazil adopted. Accidentally or not, the sentence caused several misunderstandings and was a source of problems for our diplomacy. However, it eloquently expressed the U.S. concept about the role performed by Brazil and emphasized the good level of relations enjoyed by the two countries. Twenty years have elapsed and now Brazil is an entirely democratic country, has a free and energetic press, and active movements are being staged by civilians. Human rights violations -- which frequently are byproducts of social problems -- are firmly fought by the government. These issues are dealt with in absolute openness. Profound structural reforms translated into liberation of the economy and privatizations have replaced old protectionist practices. Brazil's firm commitment to disarmament and nonproliferation has become the central issue of our foreign policy. This was shown by the government's decision to sign several international agreements on the peaceful use of nuclear energy and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. Despite all these changes, which actually make Brazil further approach values supported by the United States, one seems to strongly perceive that the two countries' bilateral relations have become worse. There is a widespread feeling in Brazil that Americans see our country more as a "problem" than as an important partner that deserves to be trusted. Great emphasis is placed on trade conflicts and on certain specific aspects of the human rights and environmental issues, although no similar measures are adopted by the United States. In the economic field, we have received a clear message that all the efforts already made are not enough. Instead of concentrating their attention on the 90 percent of the results already obtained, Americans seem to prefer to point out the remaining 10 percent that still must be done. A typical example of this attitude refers to the intellectual property issue. Apparently, our achievements in those areas are neither understood nor reflected in concrete and positive attitudes. We have opened our economy, but we were not granted -- except for a token offer -- better access to the U.S. market for our leading export products (contrary to one of the key promises made by President Bush in his Initiative for the Americas). Despite the strengthening of the democratic system in our country and the efforts made by the government to come down heavily on those who violate human rights, we continue to be the target of unprecedented scrutiny and oversimplified criticism by the U.S. press and public opinion. Our resolute adherence to nonproliferation and disarmament has not facilitated our access to advanced technology. Some specific and transient aspects of our situation are brought into focus with great interest, but they seem to miss the essential aspects. The most significant event in recent Brazilian history is the struggle for the consolidation of democracy, a process that, under the leadership of President Itamar Franco, has been underpinned by a strong moral component. The series of events that led to the impeachment voted through by Congress in 1992 and the probes into corruption charges that Congress currently is conducting are at the very heart of a veritable revolution that will have major implications for Brazilian political culture. Brazilians are promoting all-encompassing structural changes, which at present can only be compared with the Clean Hands Operation in Italy. Under the influence of public opinion that is becoming increasingly involved in our country's affairs, our political system is being shaken to its very foundations and will no longer be the same. We are in the process of becoming an even more democratic society with enhanced social awareness that will be built on more solid moral values. The strongholds of impunity, even those of the powerful, are already beginning to crumble. Brazil is trying to solve its economic problems in a free, democratic, and pluralistic atmosphere. We are confronting our problems without resorting to magic or conjuring tricks. We reject the authoritarian temptation of having recourse to technocratic formulas, which always impose the greatest sacrifices on the most vulnerable segments of the population. President Itamar Franco and Brazilian society have chosen a different path. It may very well be a more complex and exacting path, but it can undoubtedly be upheld by a consensual and democratic framework. Much of the criticism that one reads or hears reveals that these things are poorly understood. There are other aspects that have a significant impact on relations between Brazil and the United States. Brazil is characterized by a constant trait -- it is a country that has a natural leaning toward peace. Its actions in the international arena are predictable and trustworthy. These qualities have enabled us to maintain harmonious relations with all our neighbors in South America for a century. Our vocation for fostering nonhegemonic and cooperative relations also is projected in other regions, especially Africa. Moreover, our country is not torn by any conflicts on account of racial, cultural, or religious matters. This is particularly important at a time when the resurgence of hatred due to racial considerations is putting the lives of so many people of the world in jeopardy. We take great pride in these attributes and, besides, they obviously represent a contribution to world peace and security. Even speaking in terms of economic considerations, this unique combination of a peaceful and stable environment both domestically and internationally may prove to be a "comparative advantage" for likely investors. At a time when the Clinton administration is casting its eyes over Latin America, it is important to bear in mind that cooperation and security in our hemisphere also depend on the preservation and enhancement of relations between Brazil and the United States, which should be based on mutual trust. Brazil has a strategic importance as it is acknowledged to be a pole that irradiates values and ideas that have a great impact on several parts of the world and are considered in all international forums. We deem that democracy is the only system of government that makes it possible to have dynamic and creative social relations at the domestic level and that may assure the peaceful coexistence between peoples at the international level. We deem that respect for human rights is a universal law that is not subject to particularities of any kind, be them cultural or otherwise. Like the United States, Brazil believes in a multilateral system of free trade. We contributed greatly to the "Uruguay Round," which was recently brought to a successful conclusion. Brazil is a global trader [preceding two words in English]. The regional initiatives that we further in Latin America, and which we consider so important, like the Common Market of the South -- Mercosur, the Amazon Initiative, and the recently proposed Free Trade Zone for South America, as well as our possible future relations with NAFTA, ought to be seen from this perspective. Regional integration must strengthen the international system of trade rather than being a substitute for it. Within the broader framework of the international world order after the end of the Cold War, Brazil and the United States share basic principles and objectives, which have given us promising opportunities for cooperation. Our participation in the UN Security Council is a good example of this. We are witnessing radical changes in the international scene that even though they bring a promise of better days, demand mature thinking and an exchange of ideas from different perspectives, though not necessarily conflicting ones. We should not be afraid of dialogue, which is always synonymous with give and take, with a mutual learning process rather than blind agreement. Relations between Brazil and the United States have a strong economic substratum and a long history. They are marked by great convergence and also by some instances of disagreement. This dichotomy proves that the possible discrepancies do not override our affinity. We must, therefore, harmonize our ideas so as to try to better understand each other. The talks I held during my recent visit to Washington with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and security adviser Anthony Lake, and my contacts with think tanks [preceding two words in English] that study our relations, have led me to believe that Brazil and the United States are ready for a mature partnership. A partnership that, by bringing the two largest democracies in the hemisphere closer together, will be instrumental in turning those values that we share into concrete actions that will accrue to the advantage of both countries, and indeed the entire hemisphere.
