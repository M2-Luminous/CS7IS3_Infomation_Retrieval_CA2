Their second goal, and the main one, was to prevent a large group of NATO ships from entering the Black Sea for permanent duty. In his words, late October 1993 representatives of NATO Joint Naval command held a sitting which passed a decision to include the Black Sea into the zone of NATO's political interests. A 8-9-strong group of ships was supposed to be stationed for permanent duty in the Black Sea to exert control over this region. The source reported that the ships were to enter the Black Sea on November 14. This is why the Black Sea command made a decision to gather an operative-tactical grouping which departed to the Caucasus' coasts. "If we had not done this they would have entered the Black Sea," emphasized the source in the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. He also underlined that on the whole, the activity of NATO ships in the Black Sea is increasing. As an example, he mentioned the fact that last year 15 NATO ships which were conducting joint naval maneuvers together with Bulgarians and Romanians in close vicinity to Russia's and Ukraine's southern boundaries visited the Black Sea.
