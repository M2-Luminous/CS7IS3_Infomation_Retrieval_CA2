[Maravava] If Eduard Shevardnadze does not resign by 26 May, then on Georgian independence day the Georgian people should demonstrate for the resignation of the head of state. This statement was made by Irakliy Tsereteli, the leader of the National Independence Party. The idea of holding a protest action has been supported by several other opposition parties. Today the republic's internal political life is like a time bomb. The agreement on Abkhazia signed in Moscow on 14 May has caused an explosion of indignation in the parliamentary opposition. Demands for the head of state's resignation followed immediately, as did calls for a boycott of parliament sessions until the institution of head of state is abolished and an exclusively parliamentary form of government adopted. Boris Kakubava, the leader of the Abkhazian Liberation Union, has appealed to the Georgian Supreme Court to instigate proceedings against Shevardnadze as a traitor to his country. Thus, the opposition has set off along the path of radical struggle. As regards the majority it is in full battle readiness, and is calling for a boycott of supreme legislative body sessions, accusing the opposition of trying to drag Georgia into chaos and war. The head of state himself, in regard to Georgian statehood day, today appealed to all political forces to make the maximum effort to achieve unity and accord and not put narrow party interests ahead of state interests.
