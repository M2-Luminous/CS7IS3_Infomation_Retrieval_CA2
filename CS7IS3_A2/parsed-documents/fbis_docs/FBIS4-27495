On May 30 formations of Japan-based pursuit-assault planes and vtol assault planes held a surprise strike exercise against the North in the sky above Yongwol, Pyongchang and Asan Bay, South Korea, in coordination with fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes and reconnaissance planes of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea.
