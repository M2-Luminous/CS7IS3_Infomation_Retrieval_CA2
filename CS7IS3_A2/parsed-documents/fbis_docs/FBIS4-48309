The decision was taken in defiance of a call by the North-West premier, Mr. Popo Molefe, for them to act in a professional manner. The approximately 500 civil servants also expressed their anger at Mr. Molefe for slamming their demands for salary parity with white officials. A senior official said that before the elections Mr. Molefe had termed the demand as their right, now he referred to it as stupid.
