FBIS4-5687 "dreas071_c_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 North Korea Daily Claims Double Standard on Nuclear Issue Daily Claims Double Standard on Nuclear Issue SK1304050894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0458 GMT 13 Apr 94 SK1304050894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Double Standard Must Not Be Allowed in Nuclear Issue" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Nuclear physicists of South Africa reportedly threatened recently that they would expose data related to nuclear arms development if the government did not pay them retirement allowances, and disclosed that research facilities had been provided by France and Britain. The nuclear arms development of Israel which has close relations with South Africa in this respect has been assisted by the United States. The U.S. is also cooperating in South Korea's nuclear arms development. NODONG SINMUN today views these facts as an eloquent proof of the United States, France and Britain being the masterminds of international proliferation of nuclear weapons. The news analyst says: It is noteworthy that these countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are applying a double standard in nuclear inspection. While turning an unseeing eye to South Africa, Japan and South Korea dangerously playing with nuclear material under the patronage of the United States, the IAEA is unreasonably taking issue with the DPRK in its peaceful nuclear activities. The recent publication of a "statement of the president" of the U.N. Security Council unreasonably urging the DPRK to accept additional inspections by the IAEA is a graphic expression of the double standard policy in the nuclear issue. This shows the U.N. Security Council is playing into the hands of the United States in the execution of its hostile policy of stifling the DPRK. Lack of impartiality and random application of a double standard in the nuclear issue are attributable to the arbitrariness of the United States, France and Britain, masterminds of the international proliferation of nuclear weapons, in the U.N. Security Council. It is abnormal that the countries that deserve sanctions are left alone and pressure is put on an innocent country. If the U.N. Security Council really has the intention to discharge its mission, it must take issue with the United States, which is obstructing the settlement of the nuclear issue and gravely threatening peace and security on the Korean peninsula with huge nuclear weapons, and the South Korean authorities, its servant. If the U.N. Security Council and the IAEA serve as tools for military and political purposes of a nuclear power, applying a double standard, the non-nuclear states and the Third World countries will no longer trust these international organisations. The double standard must no longer be allowed in the nuclear issue.
