He himself has just moved there. But how viable is that region as an ethnic state? Dirk Viljoen, a municipal and regional planner from Pretoria, recently delivered a lecture on the viability of the region as a homeland. An ethnic Afrikaner state can only succeed, according to Avstig's definition, in a region like the Northern Cape where the number of other peoples and groups is low, said Viljoen. Problems, however, are going to be legion. "Success will depend on whether enough Afrikaners will support it. I do not believe that this is currently the case. That will probably happen only long after a black government has come to power." Because whites only constitute 15.6 percent of the region's population while coloreds and blacks make up 58.5 and 25.7 percent, respectively, it will be some decades before Afrikaners become a majority or a significant element in the region. Cooperation with other peoples and groups is therefore necessary at the outset. This must be based on principles that have to be given thought in advance and that must never give rise to doubts among the Afrikaners and the other groups. "It must be clearly set forth that, after a period of time, Afrikaners are to reach an agreement with the other groups in regard to a geographic partitioning. Development must have partition between Afrikaners and coloreds as an important goal in the medium and long term. Absolute clarity must also exist from the outset in regard to autonomous activity." One of the greatest problems is the Northern Cape's very limited economic base. With the exception of Kimberley, Uppington, and De Aar, the economy is still in a primary phase where agriculture and mining predominate. Another problem is the very small populace of about 700,000 people. Rural population growth is low and only moderate urban growth is occurring. The "penetration" of blacks into the eastern subregion as a result of its proximity to Transkei, Qwaqwa, and Lesotho also threatens the ethnic state because these factors will exist in the future as well. The level of education is also very low. It will take a very long time to train the work force, of which 70 percent have completed the eighth form or less or have never attended school at all. The Northern Cape gets little rainfall and water is scarce. Its geographic situation and its climate will always restrict development. Some of these disadvantages can be overcome by proper development policy and strategies. The two most important river systems--the Orange and Olifants Rivers--flow only through the western subregion and the northern parts of the central and eastern subregions. The region has an extensive primary road network but the other road networks are only poorly developed. The northwestern part's major highway connections to the more developed eastern areas are limited. The system of major railway lines also has serious shortcomings. The rail line from Cape Town to the north and the one from Kimberley to Postmasburg, Sishen, and Hotazel are not interconnected and they are not operated as such. Few scheduled airline flights land in the region--even Kimberley does not have very regular service. A good deep sea port is lacking as well. The established urban concentrations are relatively small and do not constitute a strong base for development. It will cost a lot of money to develop the inadequate major infrastructure. The private sector can contribute, but the greatest responsibility will rest with the central and regional authorities. Viljoen said that more favorable geographical and physical conditions for development, such as exist in other parts of South Africa, would have resulted in more trained workers and entrepreneurs. In the Northern Cape, such migration will occur primarily due to other factors. "One such factor is, of course, the desire of Afrikaners to experience their freedom in an ethnic state. The question, of course, is at what pace will Afrikaners seek refuge in the region after the election of a majority government." It will probably take longer than a decade for Afrikaners to establish themselves in the Northern Cape. This will greatly affect the pace of development and it is for that reason that the region will have to be systematically marketed among Afrikaners. Success will depend greatly on the management of development efforts. A future regional government will not be able to accomplish that alone. The private sector, SABRA [South African Bureau of Racial Affairs], and other organizations with the same goals will have to actively participate. Organizations that represent ethnic state Afrikaners will have to become involved--politically and in other ways--in the regional government.
