Supporters of AAPO, who met yesterday to celebrate the second anniversary of the organization, also were heard to say that a nationality group capable of using its own language is a black frenge [Amharic for "white man"], the inference of which means a black as civilized as a white man. Observers said that the supporters of AAPO's anniversary meeting, presided over by its chairman Prof. Asrat, were at first preoccupied with singing the songs of war. Prof. Asrat said the day was the holiest of holidays and he wanted it to be celebrated that way every year, adding that his organization should wait for the outcome of the struggle beginning the day after the transitional government continues to rule by means of guns [as heard]. One of the points read out at the meeting says: We should hold our flag high once these racists who reduced our 3,000-year-old history to 100 years are annihilated.
