[Begin Rabin recording] The Syrians are demanding that Israel step forward and say what I allegedly told President Mubarak [that he is ready to effect a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights], and then negotiations would start at once. The negotiations are being withheld because we did not say such a thing either to the Syrians or to Mubarak. We agreed to a withdrawal, but we did not determine its final extent; we did not set the final border. Second, a timetable extending over several years. Third, a combination--the first phase of the withdrawal, which must be small, must be rewarded by full normalization. Fourth, security arrangements. [end recording] Rabin listed his priorities before the committee members: Jerusalem above everything, certain areas in Judaea and Samaria, the Golan Heights, and finally Gaza. There are certain areas in Judaea and Samaria that I consider more valuable from the security and historical point of view than the Golan Heights, he said. Turning to the Palestinian issue, he noted that there is as yet no dialogue on the next phase, although there is a commitment to this effect. You could say that in Gaza there was a withdrawal, while the term applying to other territories is redeployment, the prime minister remarked. [passage omitted] Replying to a question, the prime minister said that at this stage he sees no room for a visit to Jerusalem by 'Arafat, but that he could not make any commitments about what will happen in another two years. [passage omitted] Another issue raised in the session was the building of a dividing fence on Gaza's northern boundaries. Knesset Member Binyamin Netanyahu demanded that such a fence be built to create a security zone north of the autonomy. [passage omitted] The prime minister explained to the committee members that such a fence could not be built at this point due to budgetary constraints. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 31 May notes that "Prime Minister Rabin is quoted in the committee as confirming that Israel has been mapping out where the self-rule institutions in Jerusalem are located, but he also conceded that legally Israel may not be able to act and that new legislation may be necessary."]
