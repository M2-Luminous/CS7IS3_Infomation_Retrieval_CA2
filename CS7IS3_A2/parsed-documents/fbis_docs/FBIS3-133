With increasing restlessness among Bophuthatswana civil servants -- evident in the homeland this week -- there is every possibility that the public sector could soon be hit by a total strike, similar to that which crippled the Venda government. Late this week workers in the education, finance and audit departments threatened to join the industrial action as postal workers indicated that their strike would continue at least until mid-March. And as the collapse of the Bophuthatswana administration loomed dangerously close, it emerged that yet another meeting between ANC [African National Congress] president Nelson Mandela and homeland leader Lucas Mangope was in the offing. It is expected that reincorporation of the homeland and free political activity will be high up on the agenda of the meeting, which is scheduled for sometime this week. Although civil servants in Bophuthatswana have demanded the refund of their pensions, the restlessness seemed to be more a symptom of growing impatience among homeland residents with Mangope's resistance to reincorporation and participation in the Transitional Executive Council. Meanwhile, mediators in the Venda civil servants dispute over the multi-million pension fund scam were this week unable to find state officials to negotiate with as government offices remained deserted. Key government officials were said to have taken refuge in Johannesburg, hundreds of miles away from workers who want the millions of rands, handed out in pensions to senior government staff, to be repaid. The collapse of key sections of government administration in Venda was precipitated by last week's mass march after which civil servants occupied control centres of sections of the homeland's security forces. Communication links were disrupted and police refused to intervene to restore order. The civil service in both Ciskei and Transkei also seem to be gripped by uncertainty. "Everyone is panicking," said one Ciskei civil servant. In some offices everything from pens to computers are being stolen by civil servants desperate to make the most of the last few weeks. Officials seconded by South Africa to the homelands are worried about their positions -- there are about 360 in Ciskei alone. In Transkei, seconded officials were told this week that the South African government did not know what would happen to them. In Ciskei, new cars are allegedly still being handed out to bureaucrats who may no longer have top jobs in May. The Ciskei government recently confirmed the receipt of a fleet of 35 brand-new Ford Meteors and Lasers for government officials. At R[rand]35,000 apiece, that is a total of R1.2-million.
