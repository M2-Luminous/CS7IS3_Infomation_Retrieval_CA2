Three of those inside were elderly and the fourth was a 14-year-old, said Witwatersrand Police Spokesman Col Dave Bruce who added that they all showed signs of serious assault. He said when members of the flying squad attempted to enter the building, Lancet Hall, a man tried to prevent them from gaining access by pointing a firearm at them. One of the captives said he had been held since April 16. Col Bruce also said the ANC members had told police the captives were caught breaking into a vehicle and that they had planned to call them when the flying squad arrived. The ANC have not yet furnished comment. ANC spokesman Mr Ronnie Mamoepa said he was not aware of the details of the police report. "It is not the policy of the ANC to hold people against their will," he said, adding that a full statement would be issued later in the day.
