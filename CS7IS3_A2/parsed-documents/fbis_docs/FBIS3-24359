Had it only been plaques and bosses... Growing tired of spasmodic and senseless reforms, experienced officers are leaving--those who did not go around chasing "skinheads" but were doing serious work combating crime and espionage. To explain what is happening at Lubyanka, Federal Counterintelligence Service officers Sergey Bogdanov and Sergey Vorobyev visited the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA investigations department. Yu. Shchekochikhin, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA investigations department editor: What is really happening over there these days? S. Bogdanov, Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) officer: What is happening? The border troops are now an independent service subordinate directly to the president. The investigative department has been eliminated, as has the administration for investigations and corresponding units on the local level--in territorial administrations. These are probably the most significant among structural changes. Thanks to public pressure, so far rehabilitation work has remained with us. GULAG veterans were extremely concerned that corresponding units would be eliminated. So far this line of work remains ours. We now have about 75,000 staff members left. Yu. Shchekochikhin: Where do your officers go? S. Bogdanov: Staff reductions occurred mainly in the border troops and the investigative apparatus. Keeping in mind, however, that the former Ministry of Security [MB] was on average 20 percent understaffed, those who want to be in the service and pass the certification do not have any problem. O. Blotskiy, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special correspondent: What are the selection criteria? S. Bogdanov: We were informed that the main criteria are professional fitness and loyalty to the motherland. D. Molchanov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special correspondent: How does one determine professional fitness? S. Bogdanov: I am not a commission member and do not know how it is determined. D. Molchanov: Do you see in the latest actions regarding the MB an element of strengthening the president's personal power? S. Bogdanov: Theoretically--yes. In practice we will only be able to tell after we get specific assignments over a period of half a year. Yu. Shchekochikhin: According to our information, many state security functions have now been transferred to the president's Main Protection Administration. S. Bogdanov: In the past there was the KGB's Ninth Directorate. Part of the work of a number of units in the rest of the KGB was to support operational work of this directorate: operational information, operational investigations, and so on. In principle, the Ninth Directorate's task was physical protection of the president. As to operational work around protected objects, including protected routes, this was done, among others, by staff members of the Moscow Administration. When the Main Protection Directorate was created, this unit was transferred there as a whole. Those who did not want a transfer stayed in the Moscow Administration. Yu. Shchekochikhin: Where is the pay better--over there or with you? S. Vorobyev, FCS officer: Over there, of course. Yu. Shchekochikhin: Let us go back to politics. There have been many complaints about the MB in connection with the October 1993 events: The MB did not know what had been going on, they said. S. Vorobyev: An organization that does not know what is happening around it would not be a special service. The question is who is the consumer of this information and how is it used. We knew, and provided this information. S. Bogdanov: Materials of preliminary investigation on the basis of mass media reports regarding Barkashov were sent to the procuracy three times. But the latter did not find sufficient grounds to initiate criminal proceedings. Celestine Bohlen, NEW YORK TIMES correspondent: I would like to go back to the October events. Do you think that the MB reorganization is related to these events? S. Bogdanov: Probably yes. Going back to these events, I want to remind you that we knew about the plans, the concrete disposition of forces, up to how many combat detachments and commandos there were and which window bay or corridor they would be guarding. Therefore nobody can say it was an unexpected turn of events. The main issue is utilization of information. I can tell as an example how the information on Chernobyl was used. A year before the catastrophe, 76 documents were sent from KGB units to various officials saying that these industrial nuclear systems cannot be used for scientific purposes. Nobody listened to us. The same goes for the Bashkiria oil pipeline. While it was still under construction we were getting alarming information from foreign agents. S. Vorobyev: We were sent a lot of materials, even aerial photos taken from a helicopter. We showed those six bent pipes on television. And what happened? I believe there is still no decision on it. S. Bogdanov: This is all about the past; what about now? Have you even asked yourself how many times the initials of our institution have been changed over the past years? Do you know what this means? This means a change of leadership from top to bottom, not only the head of the organization, but all top officials. And from the day this all started, it still goes on. Tell me, how can a special service work under these circumstances? Yu. Shchekochikhin: Will the latest change in initials help to correct the situation you were talking about? S. Bogdanov: It depends on how long these initials stay. S. Vorobyev: By the way, many officers are not certain that things are not going to be reshuffled again. S. Bogdanov: Every time there are elections, there is change. S. Vorobyev: Today our officers formally separated from their work. This sitting and waiting, which has been going on for the second month already, results in people's skills as operatives gradually beginning to deteriorate. If this situation continues for any length of time, we cannot be sure that a mass exodus to the civilian sector will not begin. O. Blotskiy: Your investigative department is now being transferred to the procuracy. Cases have been transferred, but the personnel do not want to. What is happening to the investigative officers? S. Bogdanov: Right now most officers do not want a transfer. They will be found jobs in our organization. C. Bohlen: Why do they not want to transfer? S. Bogdanov: You know, it is the same as happened to the Vympel unit. People came to work specifically for state security. And they do not want to leave this organization. It has its own traditions, its own system of relations, its own perks after all. Yu. Shchekochikhin: How do you feel about the fact that investigations will now be carried out by the procuracy instead of the KGB? Some jurists have been pushing this for a long time, while others were against it... S. Bogdanov: Right now, for instance, one of the contraband cases has been transferred to the procuracy for investigation, and the man in charge of it has specialized in murders and rapes all his life. D. Molchanov: How do you feel about the old KGB times? From a professional standpoint. S. Bogdanov: I will give a most routine example. There was a Moscow Administration chief who could transfer his aide out of sight if the telephone in reception rang twice and nobody picked up the receiver. That is, on the third ring you knew for sure that you had just lost your year-end bonus. Now you can listen to the phone ringing for half an hour. D. Molchanov: Now you cannot get through at all. Nobody answers. Or you call, and they say that such and such is not in. Pardon me, I ask, who am I talking to? The person on the other end says: "I am just waiting here in the reception and answering the phone." (Laughter) Yu. Shchekochikhin: Seriously speaking, however. I am convinced that the current government cannot do without the special services for its personal needs. Whichever major Russian politician I talk to, they are all convinced that their telephones are tapped. Do our leaders not need today to have at least a personal special service? After all, they are all children of those times; they cannot do without it. S. Bogdanov: Any politicians needs to have a personal special service--regardless of whether he is an offspring of a communist or another state. I have no doubt about this. As to telephone tapping, today the respective FCS unit can simultaneously listen to 2,000 telephones across the entire country of Russia. For comparison: Switzerland has the capability of simultaneously listening to 10,000. P. Shirov, "Echo Moskvy": has there been a considerable personnel turnover, especially over the past two years? S. Bogdanov: We have come to the conclusion that the number of resignation letters submitted has fallen off considerably. Several years ago there were mass resignations. Every time our plaque is changed, the number of resignation requests immediately shoots up. Now, however, we have come to a point where, in my opinion, the people who are there are precisely the kind of people who should be working there. Yu. Shchekochikhin: What happened to the administration for combating organized crime and corruption? S. Bogdanov: It became the administration for combating smuggling and corruption. O. Blotskiy: What is the FCS reaction to the six-year sentence handed down in the case of a CIA agent who was arrested and indicted a couple of months ago? S. Bogdanov: The reaction to all these incidents and sentences now that there have been traitors among ourselves is--tiredness. But when traitors became heroes--after this to talk about the fact that somebody got six years... C. Bohlen: What about the Mirzayanov case? S. Bogdanov: There is currently a temporary list of items constituting state secrets, signed by the president. Therefore, in principle, part of the information disclosed by Mirzayanov may not fall under that list. If we look at the substance, however, it has been established that the information he made public constitutes a state secret, but it is not on the list. Again, who defines the level of secrecy? It is defined by the company doing this development. Not us. No. For us, it is very important to have a document that says that this or that is information that constitutes a state secret. A specific point. In the past the whole thing boiled down to a company or ministry classifying their work according to their list, at the request of a laboratory or department. Our duty was to protect these secrets. Now we are reaping very grave consequences of that system, because at the time it was never considered important to patent development work. We have concrete examples: Suddenly, for instance, the SS-20 missile is being manufactured in, shall we say, a certain large country in the east, and sold on foreign markets. We are beginning to investigate how it ended up there. It turns out that a foreign delegation visited a certain enterprise to sign a protocol of intentions. They promised mountains of gold. The director was deliriously happy. (By the way, amazingly, most of our directors, especially those of defense enterprises, turned out to be great altruists.) He is told: "You know, in order for us to figure things out better, we need one or two `samples.'" The SS-20 missile alone incorporates about 120 inventions. None of which, naturally, had been patented. Now, back to the Mirzayanov case. We signed an international treaty on not producing new chemical weapons (this is more or less what it is called). We violated the convention. But we do not have a single word anywhere in the law on anybody's culpability for violating an international treaty. On a global scale, Mirzayanov has performed a service for humanity. On the other hand, those who work on this problem are carrying out the task set for them by the state, because it is the state that finances them. Yu. Shchekochikhin: During Brezhnev's times and even afterwards, in order to conduct an operational action with respect to a secretary of a provincial party oblast committee, you needed the sanction of the party leadership. Now I know that the operational work of some high-level Moscow officials has been stopped at the very top. Is there a category of persons today who are better left alone? S. Bogdanov: Of course there is. Who is included in this category depends on many factors. And also, let me put it this way, on the professional and civic courage of the operative and his boss. "Immunity," by the way, also stems from imperfections in our legislation. Such new forms of corruption have appeared on the scene now that they absolutely do not fall under our criminal law. Sometimes, though, the court's terrible inertia also plays a role. K. Belyaninov: Representations of the former republics have now become embassies. But if there are embassies, it means there are also intelligence units. Have you caught, for instance, many Uzbek spies? I am quite serious. S. Bogdanov: Uzbek? I do not recall any. With some republics, treaties have been signed at the presidential level on not conducting intelligence activities against one another, interaction in matters of state security or information exchange, transfer of cases, joint investigation of major entities, combating drug trafficking, etc. One head of an Estonian district counterintelligence was detained when he was trying to break through in an "Ural" vehicle with five tonnes of copper from Pskov Oblast to his district. He stole the vehicle in the Pskov Paratroop Division, the copper--somewhere else, and made a fighting attempt to get across the border. By the way, many of our current friends who used to be enemies conduct intelligence operations from the territories of former USSR republics. Apprehending a spy or a foreign intelligence officer is not the highest-class work. Foreign intelligence officers are arrested in the event of political expediency. In any case, in the past this was the only reason. For instance, two of ours are expelled from Sweden--intelligence immediately runs to counterintelligence: Guys, who do you have in your sights? Our pleasure! As many as you need! In the Swedish Embassy alone a total of six diplomats. Shall we expel them all together or one at a time? A corresponding memorandum goes to the Politburo, signed by the KGB chairman. We get the appropriate memorandum from Gromyko. Relations with him were very difficult: Gentlemen, you are spoiling my peace-loving policy. When Shevardnadze was appointed minister of foreign affairs, things became easier. You may recall: They expel ours from England--we expel some, too; they expel more, we expel more. And on top of that we outwitted them, because some wives of British diplomats had diplomatic status. Therefore we selected husbands whose wives also were diplomats, but expelled only the husbands. As a result they had to recall more diplomats. The Americans expelled our people--we took away their service personnel: Wash your own dishes. At this point the fight was more or less on even ground. So, this is the political case. The other case is when the damage is already unavoidable. We knew, for instance, in the case of Tolkachev, that he was passing over material that would do irreparable damage. This means we have to take him. But if we take him, we take the American, too. Or, for instance, they take one of ours--we have to respond so they will not get away with it. So we take one, too. In short, the basic point is that you do this when you can no longer play operational games. Because the highest level in counterintelligence is operational games. S. Smirnov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special correspondent: Do you still use recruitment? S. Bogdanov: We do. S. Smirnov: I mean, through blackmail and... S. Bogdanov: In intelligence or counterintelligence? S. Smirnov: Both. S. Bogdanov: All right. Anyway, this goes for both intelligence and counterintelligence. When the MB was still there, a decision was made in keeping with the law on federal organs of state security that we could pay agents. The KGB paid agents only in rare instances. And rather small sums. Nevertheless, both we and intelligence can pay. Intelligence pays more, though. Still, we never had the kind of money to outdo, for instance, the CIA. When I was still going through training, one of our still-current intelligence officers shared his experience: "Guys, remember, the principle of our work is this (this was his personal opinion, one of the methods of recruitment). We look for a person who is not doing well, and make it even worse: turn him into a spy. Before, he merely embezzled or cheated on his wife; we make a spy out of him." Cynicism exists in every line of work. The most reliable agents (and this is recognized by all intelligence services in the world without exception) are those doing it for ideological and political reasons. For a CIA officer, for instance, there existed only two compromising points for which he could be dismissed from the service: homosexuality and drugs. That was all! Ours were recruited, or attempts were made to recruit them, on anything: drinking, women, video and audio equipment he may have bought somewhere at a discount, and so on, and so on. How are things in our counterintelligence? We have no money, trust me. Blackmail--on what? Theoretically, we can blackmail a person threatening to say that he is our agent. But why would we need him after we say this? And recruit him on this? It is laughable. O. Blotskiy: Russia has transparent borders with practically all states. Can the FCS work effectively in the current situation, where any citizen of any contiguous state can travel unimpeded wherever he wants? S. Bogdanov: To work effectively, we have to start not with borders. What we need is for the state--through the president, the Federal Assembly, the Security Council--to tell us what the national interests of Russia are and what it is we need to protect. Let the president set the task to put an end to organized crime. Within what timeframe? Half a year? Ten years? In the FRG, for instance, it is considered normal to work on a criminal group for five-10 years. Over there, however, both counterintelligence and police work on it. But then they take the entire group. With accounts in Bolivia, Switzerland, safe houses, dead drops, and so on, and so on. We are all worse off because we, in effect, do not have a concept of national security--one that is serious and comprehensive. [end Bogdanov] Yes, the former KGB has been destroyed... This is the truth. But not the whole truth. Read the opinion of Vadim Bakatin in an upcoming issue of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA.
