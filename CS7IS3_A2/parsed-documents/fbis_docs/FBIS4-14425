The Duma Agonizes Over the Budget"] [Text] The draft federal budget for 1994 did not reach the State Duma until the end of March. The budget message will first be studied in committees and commissions, after which the Duma committees will present their findings. Parliamentary hearings will take place 5 and 7 April, and on 13 April there will be a discussion on the first reading at a plenary session. The work of agreeing the budget will last for a further month to six weeks. How is the budget structured in general? Revenue is set at a level of 120 trillion rubles [R], expenditure at R182 trillion, with a planned deficit of 62 trillion. The Russian Finance Ministry's concept is formulated thus: No shock, but a tough credit and monetary policy and realistic collection of revenue. The revenue side of the budget will increase through a growth in the volume of indirect taxes, value-added tax, and excise duties. As for the expenditure side, there is nothing to rejoice about. Finance has been cut for practically everything. The biggest expenditure items of the budget are: defense -- R37 trillion; targeted support for sectors -- R33 trillion; aid to authorities at other levels -- 18 trillion; social and cultural programs -- 12.5 trillion. The Finance Ministry has maintained the level of expenditure on social needs at the 1993 volume. It is planned to cover the expenditure items by means of Central Bank credits, transactions involving securities, and foreign sources, but mostly by means of tougher financial discipline, first and foremost taxation discipline. It is predicted that inflation will fall to 15 and then 10 percent per month. Consumer prices will increase fivefold, and the decline in production will be 12 percent. These figures are contained in a forecast of Russia's socioeconomic development for 1994 which was discussed at a session of the Russian Federation Government Presidium. The document has been sent to parliament as an appendix to the draft federal budget.
