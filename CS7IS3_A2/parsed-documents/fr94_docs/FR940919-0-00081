FR940919-0-00081 FR940919-0-00016 The Agency is promulgating treatment standards for these wastes essentially as proposed with the additional requirement that underlying hazardous constituents be treated in nonwastewater forms of these wastes. Today's standards apply to all D012&hyph;D017 wastes managed in non-CWA/non-CWA-equivalent/non-Class I injection well waste management facilities. These are the toxic pesticide wastes which are identified as toxic following application of the TCLP. The TCLP is more sensitive than the EP analysis, possibly bringing more wastes into the toxicity characteristic category than did the EP. 1. Newly Identified Pesticide Nonwastewaters EPA is today regulating newly identified D012&hyph;D017 nonwastewaters plus D012&hyph;D017 nonwastewaters regulated earlier in the Third Third rule. Treatment standards for both sets of D012&hyph;D017 nonwastewaters include the UTS value for the TC constituents plus UTS values for underlying hazardous constituents. The changes between the Third Third standards and today's rule are that the numerical value of the toxaphene nonwastewater standard rises from 1.3 to 2.6 and the standard for D013, lindane, incorporates numbers for the four BHC isomers. (It should be noted that EPA determined that the amount of D012&hyph;D017 waste subject to the treatment standards is very small. 55 FR at 22634, 22646. Based on this determination, it is very unlikely that newly identified D012&hyph;D017 are being generated.) Today's rule also prohibits dilution of D012&hyph;D017 nonwastewaters injected into Class I deep injection wells. Consequently, these pesticide wastes must be treated to meet the treatment standards before they can permissibly be injected into such units, unless that unit has been granted a no-migration determination. Section VIII of this preamble discusses this and other deepwell injection issues presented in today's rule in more detail.

Pesticide Wastewaters EPA set treatment standards expressed as required methods of treatment for the EP toxic pesticide wastewaters in the Third Third final rule (55 FR 22554). Today's rule extends these treatment standards to those pesticide wastewaters covered in today's rule. (See 268.40) E. Exemptions for De Minimis Losses of Commercial Chemical Product or Chemical Intermediates That Exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic (TC), and for TC Laboratory Wastes Discharged to CWA Wastewater Treatment Systems In the Interim Final Rule published May 24, 1993, EPA established de minimis exemptions for commercial chemical product or chemical intermediates that are ignitable or corrosive hazardous wastes and that contained underlying hazardous constituents (58 FR 29875). The Agency proposed in Phase II to extend the exemptions in 40 CFR 268.1 to commercial chemical products or chemical intermediates that are TC organic wastes when disposed (58 FR 48118). Commenters expressed support for this approach. This action is necessary to avoid situations where minor leaks of organic TC commercial chemical products or chemical intermediates to a wastewater treatment system would potentially trigger all of the potential consequences of treating all underlying hazardous constituents that might be in the waste. As EPA noted in originally determining that the mixture rule should not apply in such situations, such small losses are as a practical matter unavoidable; responsible management involves channeling these minor losses to a centralized wastewater treatment system. In addition, there is a natural incentive to minimize the losses because the materials would otherwise be commercial chemical products or intermediates (46 FR 56583, Nov. 17, 1981). Moreover, allowing de minimis losses of TC materials to trigger all of the LDR treatment consequences would be anomalously stringent because de minimis losses of listed wastes (i.e., the commercial chemical products listed in §261.33), which tend to be more concentrated (see generally 58 FR at 29875), would not be regulated because of the exception to the mixture rule found at §261.3(a)(iv)(D). This same type of exception is needed for TC laboratory wastes that are commingled with other plant wastewaters under designated circumstances: TC laboratory wastes containing underlying hazardous constituents from laboratory operations, that are mixed with other plant wastewaters at facilities whose ultimate discharge is subject to regulation under the CWA (including wastewaters at facilities which have eliminated the discharge of wastewater), provided that the annualized flow of laboratory wastewater into the facility's headwork does not exceed one part per million (the same condition that applies to the existing exemption in §261.3(a)(2)(iv)(E)). Thus de minimis losses of commercial chemical product or chemical intermediates that are TC organic wastes, and TC organic laboratory wastes discharged to CWA wastewater treatment systems, are not subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 268. De minimis losses are those occurring from normal material handling, minor leaks of equipment tanks or containers, and similar small but, for practical purposes, unavoidable losses. See §261.3(a)(2)(iv)(D) and 268.1(e)(4) as promulgated at 58 FR 29884 (May 24, 1993). The definition of de minimis loss is the same as EPA used in the May 24, 1993 rule. This definition mirrors the parallel language in §261.3(a)(iv)(D) except that it also includes discharges from safety showers and rinsing and cleaning of personal safety equipment and rinsate from empty containers or from containers that are rendered empty by that rinsing. When the §268.1(e)(4) definition was originally promulgated in the May 24, 1993 rule, it seemed unlikely that ignitable or corrosive wastes would be generated from safety showers or rinsate. The Agency believes it is more likely that TC wastes could be generated in such a manner, therefore, the definition is being expanded to include this language in this rule. EPA also notes that the characteristic commercial chemical products exempted under this rule and the May, 1993 rule are not limited to products in which a particular chemical is ``the commercially pure grade of the chemical, any technical grades of the chemical, and all formulations in which the chemical is the sole active ingredient.'' (See §261.33(d) comment). Rather, the exemption extends to de minimis losses (as defined) of in-process materials such as intermediates and materials that would be products if they were not inadvertently discarded. 55 FR at 2869 (Jan. 31, 1991). The citation in the comment to §261.33(d), quoted above, is necessary to define the scope of the listing, but as just explained, does not apply to losses of characteristic materials.
