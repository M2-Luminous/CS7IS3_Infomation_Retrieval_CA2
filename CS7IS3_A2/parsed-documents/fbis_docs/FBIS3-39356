According to a study by the Economic Research Institute (Wifo), Austrian expenditures on projects in the East were even higher than investments in the European Union. Thus, the Austrians invested 3 billion schillings in the reform states in the first half of 1993 but only 2.7 billion in the European Union. Of Austria's total foreign investment of 59 billion schillings, about 25 percent went to East Europe. In 1990 the share was 10 percent. A total of 50 percent of direct Austrian investments abroad were made in the European Union, with Germany topping the list at 20 percent. The share of investments is 9 percent in the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] and 12 percent in the United States. Since 1989, investments in the EFTA countries have dropped by 50 percent. The significance of Austrian investments is generally increasing. They rose from 1.3 to 3 billion schillings in the first half of the 1980's to 11 billion schillings in 1989. In 1992 they reached a level of 21.5 billion schillings. According to the Wifo analysis, a decline occurred in 1993 because of the bad economic situation. Whereas the activities of Austrian companies abroad have increased strongly, the nation's attractiveness for foreign investors has declined. In the 1970's, a total of 0.8 percent of all foreign investments by OECD states were made in Austria; in the 1980's the share dropped to 0.4 percent. The Wifo cited the pending decision on Austrian membership in the European Union as the major reason. Thus, Austria was not able to participate in the investment boom in West Europe before the introduction of the single market. Overall investments by foreign companies in Austria are currently standing at 69 billion schillings. About 60 percent of the money comes from European Union states, with Germany accounting for two-thirds. EFTA states accounted for 20 percent of the investments, and the United States 7 to 8 percent. Direct investments by Eastern states (2 percent) are insignificant. The remaining 10 percent were invested by Japanese companies.
