The newspaper's opinion is that the draft budget plan is subject to an endorsement procedure which, according to expert estimates, may continue for several months. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (independent newspaper) carries an interview with Latvian Deputy Defence Minister Dainis Turlais, who particiates in the Russo-Latvian inter-state talks. Turlais visualises cooperation between Latvia and Russia only within the framework of civilised state relations. He pointed out as follows: "Some people both in Russia and Latvia try to substitute power politics for a normal relationship" or "try to play on national feelings. One should not rake up old grievances or look for some scheming in each other's policies. "At this difficult time, errors are inevitable on one and the other side. One must realise that we -- two neighbouring states -- can do a lot of useful things for each other." The Latvian deputy defence minister spoke about the development of national defence forces, military cooperation among the three Baltic countries, and the republic's participation in the partnership-for-peace programme. In NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, Konstantin Zatulin, a member of the State Duma and chairman of the committee for CIS affairs and relations with compatriots, recognises it necessary "now that the country is experiencing a hard political and economic crisis, to get agreement on politicial struggle conditions which the main political forces would agree not to break," and, for the sake of achieving national concord "to forget what divided these forces in the past." Zatulin sees a way out of the economic crisis first of all in changing the taxation system. The point is, without reducing the already dramatically slashed expenditure on social needs, to move from draconian taxes and a narrow taxation basis to sparing taxes and, accordingly, a broad basis of their application." "It is essential to reduce budget deficit through the placement of securities and to hold out until funds start to come in as a result of the expansion of the taxation basis and the tightening of tax discipline" In IZVESTIYA, prominent eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fedorov, who organised a highly profitable eye microsurgery joint-stock company, sees a way out of the current critical situation in the Russian economy primarily in the establishment of closed-type joint-stock companies where shares are distributed among producers depending on seniority and salary, and with a transfer of all means of production to the work collectives. Fedorov also points out the need to abolish a profit tax, freeze the export of raw materials and sell them to domestic producers at frozen prices lower than world ones, and exempt investments from taxes for several years until the producer becomes independent and repays the debts. IZVESTIYA on a "Coup Scenario No.2" anonymous message with a false fax number: "A `Coup Scenario No.2' Anonymous Message With a False Fax Number of Sender is Out and Reaches High Places" is the headline of an article by Vladimir Ivanidze, who comments on the second anonymous message the text of which reached the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA (COMMON NEWSPAPER) last Friday. Ivanidze is of the opinion that "the anonymous message writers not so much blew up the political situation in the country as added distinctiveness to the aberration afflicting our society". RABOSHAYA TRIBUNA runs a statement by Petr Romanov, member of the federation council. "Under conditions when the present constitutional justices are virtually jobless and do not engage in judicial activities, they could, impelled by civic motives, participate in the quest for national concord in society, and advise executive and legislative power bodies, without a reward in addition to the state-provided salary which they receive for inaction", the statement said. PRAVDA on non-application of amnesty to former Security Minister Viktor Barannikov. The newspaper asserts that the office of the Russian Federation prosecutor-general did not apply the amnesty to former Security Minister Viktor Barannikov, who remains under investigation. His defence lawyer D. Shteinberg believes that this can hardly be explained by arguments that "the person staying in hospital has been forgotten in the struggle which A. Kazannik waged with the presidential entourage, seeking to release Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov and their associates as soon as possible." The defence lawyer is convinced that Barannikov "has not been forgotten or pardoned." A certain role in this is played by the fact that the former minister "knows very much about Kremlin secrets."
