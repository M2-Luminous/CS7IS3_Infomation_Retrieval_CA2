Pay'edar: "Rabin in Moscow"] [Excerpts] The Zionist regime's prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, arrived in Moscow on 24 April on a 4-day visit. This is the first visit to Russia by a high-level official of the Zionist regime, ostensibly in response to Kozyrev's visit to Tel Aviv last week. During his visit, Kozyrev had reminded the Israeli officials that despite its support for the Middle East peace process and an end to longstanding animosity between the Arabs and Israel, he is not satisfied with the actions taken so far and the prevailing trend of the talks. Diplomatic sources resident in the Middle East state that Kozyrev had told Rabin during his visit to occupied Palestine that it is unacceptable to accord Russia a second-line role in the Middle East peace dealings. The same sources state that Kozyrev's unexpected behavior toward the Israeli officials was a result of the Zionist regime's cold reception to Russia's proposals regarding the future of peace in the Middle East. No official report has been released on the nature of these proposals, but Israeli sources state that Kozyrev had presented the following five recommendations to the Israeli officials in order to expedite the peace trend in the Middle East: 1. Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 2. Halting construction of settlements on the West Bank and Gaza Strip until the fate of these two areas becomes clear in the peace talks. 3. Continuation of the talks in Moscow. 4. Russian assistance in lobbying for recognition of Israel by Syria and in persuading the latter to join the peace talks. 5. Motivating the Syrian leaders to end what Kozyrev referred to as support for hardline factions and anti-Zionist resistance groups in the region. Even though Kozyrev's proposals were received with indifference by Israeli officials, Kozyrev asked Rabin to visit Moscow to deepen bilateral relations and for a better understanding of Russia's stance. The importance of Tel Aviv-Moscow relations is worth assessing from two aspects: First, the relations and their inherent importance; and second, viewed in the context of the Middle East crisis. [passage omitted] Israel has realized, for better or worse, that without taking Russia's viewpoint into account, no kind of peace process will be successful. Regardless of whether Tel Aviv has reached this conclusion in view of Syria's role in the Arab Middle East or because of the traditional role of the Russians in the Middle East, the Zionist regime's leaders have been motivated to accept changes in view of developments in the region that will in turn make them give certain concessions to the other side. What the privileges will be and whether it is possible to end the current impasse in the Middle East, only time will tell. Independent news sources in Moscow have reported that in the course of his talks with the Russian president and prime minister, Rabin said that if Moscow does not revise its military treaty with Syria, withdrawal from the Golan Heights is out of the question. By supporting the anti-Israeli groups, Syria has proved that it is not serious about the peace talks. The newspaper MA'ARIV, the mouthpiece of the Zionist regime's foreign ministry, referring to the above issue commented that Tel Aviv believes that the sale of Russian weapons to Syria has had a negative effect on the peace talks. [passage omitted] For Russia to halt arms sales to Syria merely at Israel's behest or for it to place all its eggs in the U.S. basket without any major concessions would be an act of political naivete that seems quite unlikely. It seems certain that this will be a complicated and prolonged process and a test for Russian diplomacy in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is why Rabin's trip to Moscow has not causes any concern among the Damascus leadership. Hafiz al-Asad is quite confident that Russia will not bestow any major privileges on Israel at the expense of its own interests or leave Syria at the mercy of a turbulence-ridden peace. [passage omitted] Thus, Rabin's visit to Moscow may not herald any major changes in the current trend of Middle East talks. Besides, changes are not foreseeable. What is certain is that the anti-Zionist resistance and opposition to the growth of U.S. influence in the region will have a remarkable effect on the current treacherous trend. This opposition and resistance will not be limited to Damascus' perspective or viewpoint; even the Zionist regime's officials have admitted this. They have acknowledged that despite its influence among the Lebanese and Palestinian groups, Syria does not have tight control over their actions. It is a fact that the green light from Russia and other regional countries to Israel will not terminate the resistance. One should concede that in view of the expansionist nature of Israel, which overtly conflicts with the people of the region who have been disillusioned by the contemptuous attitude of the United States, the Middle East will witness a new wave of violence and insecurity in the future.
