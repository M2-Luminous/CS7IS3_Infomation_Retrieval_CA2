The Apache, a French version of the cruise missile, employs stealth technology and flies at a low altitude. Moreover, the Apache is equipped with navigation systems that allow exceptional precision targeting. The version ordered by the Luftwaffe and which is being developed in the framework of a 2.2-billion French franc [Fr] contract (with Fr600 million for adapting the missile) is the "antiship submunitions dispenser." The objective is to equip the 180 German Tornado planes with those missiles within the framework of a modernization program. The final contracts could then involve several billion French francs. The development of the Apache, which was initiated in 1989, has reached the stage of in-flight testing. The French version, intended to be used by the Mirage 2000 D first and then by the Rafale, will be operational in 1997. Right now, Matra is planning to propose an even more effective version.
