These events are amusing enough to call for sorrow and are tragic enough to call for amusement. Perhaps the visit by a U.S. congressional delegation to the region to search for the corpses of Israeli soldiers is one of these events which calls for sorrow, amusement, denunciation, and much contempt. Indeed, such action by representatives of the American people should receive the aforementioned reaction and should be denounced by the Americans themselves. What we know is that those who are searching for corpses did not come to the region to investigate the reasons behind the bombing of the ship "Liberty" and did not open an investigation into this Zionist crime to show their voters Israel's responsibility for an Israeli crime committed against U.S. soldiers. Although we already know that U.S. policy is not based on even a minimum level of ethics and does not care about values and principles, this act by members of the U.S. Congress makes us panic over this level of ethical collapse. This act by those members is no more than cheap political hypocrisy. If they were real representatives of the American people, then they would have been horrified by what is happening in Yugoslavia. They also would have questioned the crime against tens of thousands of Iraqi children and sick Iraqis who were martyred because of a shortage of food and medicine thanks to the Washington government and the administrations of Presidents Bush and Clinton. The behavior of the U.S. Congress members puts us in a state of panic in terms of what is awaiting the human family under the new world order. While those members of Congress are busy searching for the corpses of Israeli killers who slaughtered thousands of people in Lebanon, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Tunis, and other countries, they do not pause at the scores of U.S. crimes which continue to be committed against humanity every minute. They also do not deem it important to say a word of truth in light of the human tragedies which continue to result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of people each day without moving the conscience of one Congress member or have him ask: Why is our country killing all those people? Everything that is happening is cause for sorrow and means the United States is a country which possesses so many capabilities but only employs them to kill people and deprive them of security and tranquility and of food and medicine. Then its representatives come to our region to search for the corpses of killers whose Israeli military mechanism did not stop its wars against the Arabs for more than four decades under a Western racist sponsorship. The ranks of this Western racist sponsorship are headed by a Washington that has the mentality of a cowboy who is rancorous over anything that deals with good, security, and peace.
