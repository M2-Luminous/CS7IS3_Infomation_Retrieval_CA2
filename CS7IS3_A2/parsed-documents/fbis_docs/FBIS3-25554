The commander of Nigerian troops in the disputed Bakassi peninsula, General Wotomi Diriyai, said the Cameroonian gendarmes have killed or injured many Nigerians and seized their fishing boats and nets, the official NAN news agency reported Tuesday [22 February]. But defence spokesman General Fred Chijuka on Tuesday stressed that "Nigeria is not in a state of war, neither is the country for now thinking of a war, with Cameroon." Diriyai told journalists in Calabar, capital of the southeastern Cross River state, that property estimated at hundreds of millions of naira belonging to fishermen and traders, in an address on Monday. Chijuka said that diplomatic discussions were under way at highest level between the two countries over the disputed peninsula, which is rich in fish and oil, making plans for a war "unnecessary." He also denied that Nigeria has placed its soldiers stationed in the area "on a state of alert for war" and expressed the hope that the differences could still be resolved peacefully. Nigeria has no "expansionist ambition," but if negotiations failed, the government "may have to study other alternatives," Chijuka said, refusing to disclose what these were. The Nigerian troops in the area would remain there "until the intentions of Cameroonians are properly put in place", Chijuka said. He denied reports that Nigerian troops were the first to attack Cameroonian security forces last weekend. "Nigerian soldiers were on routine patrol before they were attacked by Camerounian gendarmes who shot at our patrol boats", he said. The Nigerian soldiers, who have been instructed not to attack, merely turned back and reported the incident to their headquarters, he said. Cameroon last Sunday stated that Nigerian soldiers attacked its forces, and that its troops immediately repulsed the attack. Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Baba Gana Kingibe said late Monday in the federal capital Abuja that "if there were any skirmishes, these must have been on provocation from the Cameroonian side and our troops must have responded in self-defence". Diriyai's statements were the first time since 1981 that official Nigerian comment has been made on reported human and material losses sustained as a result of raids by Cameroonian security forces. Seven Nigerians died in 1981 following an attack by Cameroonian gendarmes on Nigerians living in fishing villages in the disputed area, an incident which angered public opinion. For the first time since the dispute began, the military authorities gave journalists a map they said delineated the border between the two nations. The demarcation, drawn above Rio-del-River in the south, ceded the disputed peninsula to the Nigerian side. Since late December, when the Nigerian authorities sent 500 soldiers to the disputed area, the government has kept largely quiet about its handling of the matter. The editor of a local newspaper who reported last Wednesday that Nigeria sent about 1,000 additional troops to the disputed area was called in by the army and "warned seriously" against publishing such news in future because of its security implications, a top military officer told AFP.
