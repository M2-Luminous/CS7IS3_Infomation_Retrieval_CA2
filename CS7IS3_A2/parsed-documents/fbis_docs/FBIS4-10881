FBIS4-10881 "drlat075_o_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Colombia Pastrana Discusses Candidacy, Running Mate Pastrana Discusses Candidacy, Running Mate PA1804213394 PA1804213394 BFN [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish on 10 April carried a 1,200-word interview on page 8a with Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate for the Colombian Conservative Party, by El TIEMPO editor Jorge Gonzalez, conducted on the slopes of Sierra Nevada, in the area between Santa Marta and Cienega. Commenting on the results of a poll taken by EL TIEMPO in which Liberal Party, PL, presidential candidate Ernesto Samper is leading, Pastrana feels that was to be expected right after the PL convention and notes the situation will change in the days to come because the presidential campaign has gotten under way. When Gonzalez notes that the selection of his running mate may have hurt his campaign, Pastrana begins by saying he had asked current Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin to accept the nomination, but she declined. "People are beginning to realize," he adds, that Luis Fernando Ramirez is a good choice "because he embodies the results of the struggle of the people from rural areas." Gonzalez mentions the possibility of Samper reaching an understanding with Antonio Navarro Wolff of the April 19 Movement, but in Pastrana's opinion the M-19 has clear ideological differences with Samper. Pastrana then adds he has received the endorsement of Gustavo Rojas, son of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla and "true representative of the Anepo [National Popular Alliance] interests." "What we have sought from the PL is the everyday citizens, the civic and business leaders, the new man. That also applies to independent conservatives. The specific strength of a candidacy can hardly be gauged by the number of endorsements," he remarks. When asked if there was no coincidence that he set himself apart from the conservative congressional candidates, Pastrana replies: "What I wanted was to maintain total independence with regard to past elections. I want to act in line with my supraparty candidacy. I did not endorse those liberals who were elected to the Congress and are now supporting my candidacy." He adds the situation changed after the elections. "That is why I created a multiparty political committee, representing the PL, Conservative Party, and National Salvation Movement, which will be tasked with a large part of the political organization, together with the National Conservative Directorate." In answering a question as to whether he has gone from a multiparty candidate to the candidate of one party, Pastrana states that those who have tried to label him a conservative have failed "because my actions are those of an open-minded, democratic, multiparty man." "There is room for liberals, conservatives, and independents in a national government," he adds.
