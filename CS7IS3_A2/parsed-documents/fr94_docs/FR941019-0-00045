FR941019-0-00045 FR941019-0-00006 14 CFR Part 25 [Docket No. NM&hyph;99; Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;89] Special Conditions: Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 Airplanes, High Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final special conditions; request for comments. SUMMARY: These special conditions are issued for Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 airplanes manufactured by Fokker Aircraft B.V. of Schiphol the Netherlands. These airplanes are equipped with electrical and electronic systems (such as the digital electronic flight instrument system (EFIS)), which perform critical functions. The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). These special conditions provide the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to ensure that the critical functions performed by these systems are maintained when the airplane is exposed to HIRF. DATES: The effective date of these special conditions is October 6, 1994; Comments must be received on or before December 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on these final special conditions; request for comments, may be mailed in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Transport Airplane Directorate (ANM&hyph;100), Docket No. NM&hyph;99, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; or delivered in triplicate to the Transport Standards Staff at the above address. Comments must be marked ``Docket No. NM&hyph;99.'' Comments may be inspected in the Rules Docket weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 7:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tim Dulin, FAA, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2141. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited The FAA has determined that good cause exists for making these special conditions effective upon issuance; however, interested persons are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the regulatory docket and special conditions number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the Administrator. These special conditions may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments submitted will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this request must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. NM&hyph;99.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Background On September 17, 1993, Fokker Aircraft B.V. of Schiphol the Netherlands, applied for an amendment to Type Certificate A20EU to incorporate the Model F28 Mark 0070. This airplane is a derivative of the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100, approved April 21, 1989. The changes include: removal of two plug sections forward and aft of the wing to decrease overall length by 182 inches; two cargo doors in lieu of three; modifications of the aft cargo door due to space constraints associated with the shorter fuselage; one pair of Type III overwing exists in lieu of two pair, and a new nose wheel tire chine. Both the Model F28 Mark 0070 and new production of the Model F28 Mark 0100 will incorporate a hydraulic stick pusher in lieu of a pneumatic stick pusher, new stabilizer control unit, and a new interior. The Model F28 Mark 0070 will have a maximum seating capacity of 79 passengers. Amended Type Certification Basis Under the provisions of §21.101 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Fokker must show that the Model F28 Mark 0070 meets the applicable provisions of the regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A20EU, or the applicable regulations in effect on the date of application for the Model F28 Mark 0070. The regulations incorporated by reference in the type certificate are commonly referred to as the ``original type certification basis.'' The regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A20EU for the Model F28 Mark 0070 are part 25 of the FAR, as amended by Amendment 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;60 with certain exceptions which are not relevant to these special conditions. In addition, Fokker has elected to show compliance with certain later requirements which are also not relevant to these special conditions. These special conditions will form an additional part of the certification basis. If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of §21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with §11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by §§11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with §21.101(b)(2).
