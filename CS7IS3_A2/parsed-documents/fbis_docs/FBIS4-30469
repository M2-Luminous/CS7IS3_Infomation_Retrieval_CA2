"Mr. Nuon Sam-an, deputy director of the NBC's Private Bank Inspection Department, has said that the private banks have all agreed to set aside a part of their banking capital as loans to the farmers." All 30 private commercial banks in Cambodia know that Cambodia's national economy relies mainly on the agriculture. They are waiting for the NBC to issue a law as a guarantee for their loans. Asked when the farmers will get the loans from private banks, the deputy director said that the NBC is arranging this law. "He added, however, that the fund to be set aside will not exceed 20 percent of each commercial bank's capital." A term will be stated in this law that any private bank not willing to deal directly with the farmers may give the loan to the NBC by charging interest at the international rate. Discussion is being carried out on whether 10 or 20 prcent of the capital should be set aside. The NBC will be responsible for the repayment if the loan is given through it. Nuon Sam-an also said that the discussion on this law was stalled when it came to the question on who should be responsible for the repayment if the farmers fail to keep their pledge. It is still not known when this law will be finalized.
