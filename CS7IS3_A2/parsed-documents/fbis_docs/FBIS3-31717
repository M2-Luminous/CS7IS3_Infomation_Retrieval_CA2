The CSBS agrees with compensation in advance from the Czech Republic's funds; however, it thinks that the Federal Republic of Germany should pay the final compensation. It emphasizes that the matter must be dealt with quickly in view of the advanced age of the resistance fighters. Representatives from the CSBS and the Association of Freed Political Prisoners have stated that the sums proposed do not correspond to the sums paid in other countries (5,000 German marks per person per year of imprisonment). At present, this concerns some 8,200 people. It is a fundamental issue of international relations. "We are still the only state that has not been compensated," said Union Deputy Chairman Jan Paroutek. In 1973, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany was willing to pay compensation to Czech political prisoners according to the same principles as for other European countries. Its goodwill, however, did not meet with a proper response because the German side insisted on payment in German marks targeted on individuals, while our government demanded an overall sum that it would distribute in accordance with its own rules. The German Government did not accede to this solution. Association of Domestic Resistance Chairman Slavomir Klaban has briefed reporters on an open letter to the chairman of the Czech Republic Supreme Court in which he called upon Otakar Motejl to resign immediately. In March 1970, Motejl rescinded the acquittal of nine citizens sentenced in a political trial in 1954 for alleged treason.
