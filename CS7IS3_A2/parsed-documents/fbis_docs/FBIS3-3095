The State Council has issued a circular announcing its decision to strengthen the supervision and examination of prices of people's everyday necessities and services. The aim is to meet the needs of establishing a socialist market economic system but to standardize price behavior and to ensure stable living conditions for people, the circular said. The goods and services referred to are those basic ones whose price changes would greatly affect ordinary people's living standards. According to the circular, the intention is to supervise trends of prices through a price adjustment record system, to examine some of the price adjustments and to intervene only when necessary. The goods and services whose price adjustment will be subject to supervision and examination cover 20 varieties, including flour, rice, edible vegetable oil, pork, beef and mutton, eggs, milk, salt, sugar, soybean sauce, detergents, coal for household heating and cooking, gas, rent, running water, tuition and assorted fees, nursery charges, health care expenses and urban transport fares. Local governments will decide what items to supervise or examine in line with local conditions, the circular said. They must report any price adjustment to higher administrative departments for the record. The circular pointed out that the means of adjustment and control must be strengthened and improved. It said that a storage system should be established for important goods, including grain, cooking oil and meat. Grain risk funds should quickly be established at central and provincial levels and the fund system for price adjustments of non-staple food should be improved and popularized as soon as possible. Price administration departments should set guide prices for some major goods to give enterprises a reference in pricing, or demand that the enterprises adhere to the prices when necessary, according to the circular. Price administration departments may carry out temporary price control measures when prices of the basic necessities change too much, the circular said. The departments must regularly check the prices of the listed commodities and services.
