The Work of the Inquiry Board The Inquiry Board met from January 28 to February 14, working in four phases as explained by J.P. Herteman: "First, try to imagine all possible causes of the anomalies observed; compare these causes with all Flight 63 production, control and acceptance files as well as the flight's telemetry data; decide on their degree of probability, i.e., classify these causes into proven or established categories; finally, put forward recommendations based on this analysis." The Board thus sent out, in particular, 113 inquiry or action requests to the manufacturers involved. No nonconformity with quality requirements and processes was found in any of the production, assembly, control, testing and preparation operations on Flight 63's third-stage engine. The work basically focused on analyzing the initial causes of an imbalance noted in the functioning of the immersed bearing of the HM7 engine's LOX turbopump between 8 seconds (at engine ignition) and 60 seconds after second-stage separation. Conclusion The Inquiry Board did not establish a "unique and proven cause" for the Flight 63 failure. However, it concluded that the engine shutdown was probably due to the conjunction of a late precooling of the LOX pump bearing and a series of aggravating factors, probable or possible. In fact, Flight 63 telemetry data indicate unusually slow precooling of the bearing itself, while the cooling at the turbo pump inlet was normal, even slightly early. This anomaly was never observed on previous flights. As regards aggravating factors considered by the Inquiry Board, Jean-Paul Herteman mentioned a possible penetration of humidity during the opening of the oxygen drain valve on the ground and/or the trapping of purging gas inside the bearing cavity; certain pump components may have particular characteristics which could possibly lead to a higher level of energy or greater friction loads than usual. The Board also asked for further analysis of the Clevite seal (see photo on page 4), which was part of a new batch. Recommendations The Inquiry Board put forward 15 recommendations, based on three complementary phases: first, to prevent the risks of late precooling of the LOX pump bearing cavity; second, reduce the risk of the appearance of aggravating factors which probably or possibly contributed to the failure; third, and more generally, reduce the bearing's sensitivity to functional disturbances. Corrective Measures Plan Claude Quievre stressed the fact that the corrective measures plan adopted by Arianespace to implement the Board's 15 recommendations will further improve Ariane 4's reliability, which remains at a high level after Flight 63. This program aims at "improving the cooling circuit of the oxygen immersed bearing to make this function more independent of external conditions, and reinforcing the capacity of the bearing to stand the inevitable dispersions of functional parameters." The measures adopted can be grouped in two categories: those concerning the thermal behavior of the oxygen pump, and those concerning its mechanical behavior. Thermal Behavior A more thorough analysis of the precooling anomaly on Flight 63 was undertaken to ensure that all possible causes were taken into account. The team involved has already been at work for the past few weeks and has contributed to drawing up the corrective measures plan. To improve precooling of the bearing and ensure reproducibility, a purge line for the oxygen bearing cavity will be designed and qualified by SEP. This line will allow a controlled flow of the fluids during the purge of the oxygen circuit, during the precooling of the bearing and during engine operation. It should minimize overheating due to the highly leaktight Sealol and Clevite seals. Improvement of the onboard and ground helium flushing of the purge line is also planned, to prevent any possible penetration of moisture in the circuit. Mechanical Behavior To improve the robustness of the oxygen immersed bearing, it was decided, starting with Flight 64, to use a bearing whose ball races, and cage surfaces are fitted with a self-lubricating coating of molybdene disulfide, and that has increased cooling flow. This modification should make it possible to bear much higher axial loads. Tests and Qualifications These two modifications will naturally be qualified with respect to Ariane specifications. The qualification program includes tests on the engine stand at Vernon and on the bearing test bench at Liege University (Belgium). The tests will allow an experimental check of the self-lubricated oxygen bearing's resistance to extreme conditions of various functional parameters. The purge line will also be checked during engine tests. Other Measures Recommendations aimed at improving models will naturally be respected. The thermal model of the bearing used by the Inquiry Board to establish its scenario will be completed. Along with limit tests, it should contribute to finally establishing the causes of Flight 63's late precooling. Finally, as recommended by the Inquiry Board, redundant turbopump assembly checks will be carried out. The Situation is "Well in Hand" Charles Bigot explained that this type of incident -- though extremely serious because of its consequences -- was not unusual at all in launcher operations. It will be handled as all incidents which arise during equipment production, checking and acceptance tests or pre-launch operations. "We have the situation well in hand," he emphasized, thanks to "the perfect cohesion, total concertation, devotion and enthusiasm" of Ariane industrial teams, and thanks to the extensive data available to the company, "the result of considerable work and knowledge acquired, on the part of the industry, research organizations and laboratories." For Charles Bigot, the two modifications are indeed "effective means to increase our system's reliability": the first because it provides a global solution to all possible causes of insufficient precooling, and the second, already well known, was already in the process of qualification. Quality First However, Arianespace's corrective measures plan is quite complicated. Introducing beneficial modifications is not enough; it is also essential to ensure that any possible secondary effects are innocuous. Modifications will be qualified in accordance with the tradition of rigor and vigilance of the Ariane program, which "forces us to respect not only the well-established formal sequences, including critical review, qualification board, etc., but also a fundamental methodology." Arianespace will naturally continue to give top priority to quality and security: "We owe it to our customers and we will not compromise on this point," said Charles Bigot. Technical Details Overheating Some cases of overheating of the LOX turbopump immersed bearing were observed prior to Flight 63. There are three types of overheating: small, very short peaks of low amplitude (approximately 1 degree), frequently recorded; show non-dispersed drifts, changing at less than one-tenth of a degree per second, observed on seven flights from L07 to V62; rapid drifts, never seen in flight before V63; six cases, however, were recorded during ground tests or checks. These observations led to a series of measures: a hardening of criteria and conditions for the acceptance of HM7 engines; the setting-up of test benches in universities to analyze bearing behavior with a fine tooth comb; development of digital simulation of bearing behavior; finally, the study of a modification to reduce sensitivity of the bearing to thermal imbalance. Humidity Among possible aggravating factors, the Inquiry Board analyzed a possible penetration of moisture during the ground opening of the oxygen purge valve. This problem never occurred before. On Flight 63, a minute amount of humidity may have been deposited on the cooling circuit filters. This humidity may have, not obstructed the filters, but slightly modified the oxygen flow during the precooling phase. Circuits are purged by helium flushing and compression/expansion cycles. Corrective measures decided after Flight 63 -- installing a purge line and improving the on-board and ground helium flushing -- will ensure improved purging of the circuits. The Cost of Corrective Measures Major expenses will of course be borne by the launcher operator. The interruption of flights, equipment disassembly and transportation, new acceptance tests, engine re-assembly, launch campaign resumption, additional transportation, air transportation of the third-stage engine over several months, etc. -- all this will be very expensive. This is why Arianespace regularly sets aside provisions and reserves. Naturally, responsibilities are also shared with the industry, and this is provided for by multiple contracts. Towards Flight Resumption The time required by the corrective measures plan will be "well used." The Inquiry Board set the example by releasing a very comprehensive report only three weeks after Flight 63. As for the industrial teams, they have committed themselves to work without stinting on their time or effort. "We know that our customers suffer, and will suffer, from this necessary delay. I would like them to rest assured that our only goal is to provide them with a regular, reliable service." The date of the next flight cannot be set now, as it obviously depends on the state of progress of the different phases of the program, some of which affect subsequent ones. However, Arianespace decided to complete all corrective actions within a reasonable timeframe, currently estimated at three months. This would allow launch resumption towards the end of May. From Flight 64 onwards, every possible effort will be made to catch up on the flight schedule, through a substantial increase in the launch rate. Arianespace is therefore re-adjusting operational procedures -- but not modifying them -- to "carry out in three weeks, with the same quality and the same rigor what we carried out in four weeks up to now." The Launch Manifest Arianespace's basic rule is to give priority to customers whose satellites could not be placed into orbit. This will therefore apply to two customers involved: Eutelsat and Aerospatiale on behalf of Turksat.
