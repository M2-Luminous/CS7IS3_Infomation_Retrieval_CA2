A further 10,000 students took to the streets in other cities across France, several hours before the official start of France's first unified trade union protest in more than 25 years. In Paris, expected to see the biggest student-worker turnout, the protest is due to begin at 3:00 p.m. (1400 GMT). For the first time since the student-worker riots of May 1968, the country's trade union confederations have buried their differences and agreed to stage a joint march against Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's scheme to let employers hire young people below the minimum wage. The government, facing 11.3 percent unemployment, a post-war record, says the scheme aims to slash rocketing youth unemployment. One out of four French people under 25 years old in unemployed, which the French say is five times higher than in neighbouring Germany. In southeastern Lyon, students waved banners saying "No to slavery" and "May 68 is not over." Near the town of Montbeliard, also in the southeast, some 2,500 students blocked the A-36 freeway between Beaune and Mulhouse. In eastern France, some 1,500 turned out in Belfort and 2,500 protested near Vesoul. In the south, several hundred students blocked access to the city of Toulon while protests of about 1,000 youngsters were rrported in Montpellier, Nimes and Avignon. Trade unions in most cities have called later in the day for a "day of decentralised action" against Balladur's Job Access Contract (CIP). The demonstrations will be the fourth challenge by the unions to government policy in less than a fortnight and come at a bad time for the prime minister, facing his first test of electoral support in nearlky a year at the helm in local elections next Sunday. Thursday's protests are backed by the communist-led CGT [General Confederation of Labor], the socialist CFDT [French Democratic Confederation of Labor], the moderate Force Ouvriere, the Christian-inspired CFTC [French Confederation of Christian Labor], the student UNEF [National Union of French Students] movement, the teachers' unions FSU and FEN [Normal Schools Federation] and the FCPE a parents' association. The row over the CIP erupted in February when Balladur gave employers the green light to hire students leaving higher education at as little as 80 percent of the minimum wage of 5,900 francs (roughly 1,000 dollars) a month.
