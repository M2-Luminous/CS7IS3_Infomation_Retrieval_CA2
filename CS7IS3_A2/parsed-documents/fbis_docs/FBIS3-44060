The announcement of the suspension of the PAC's national director of publicity, Mr. Waters Toboti, the regional secretary of central Transkei, Mr. Mfanelo Skwatsh, and a member of the Azanian National Youth League, Mr. (Chargin Mabaso), was made by the PAC's secretary general, Mr. Benny Alexander. The decision to suspend them was taken at the organization's national working committee in Johannesburg today. Mr. Alexander said they were suspended for making media statements challenging the national working committee's position to place a moratorium on the armed struggle. He said certain sections of the media strived to project divisions within the PAC in the run-up to the election, but failed to communicate the overwhelming support for the moratorium on the armed struggle.
