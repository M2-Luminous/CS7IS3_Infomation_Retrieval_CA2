He said soldiers are not businessmen and therefore do not have barter skills. The army commander's frank remark reflects a problem between the military and the government. That problem is lack of good coordination, which has created a gap of understanding and brought on reports about the military's anxiety over the government's policy. Frankly, the cabinet's decision on arms barter is worthy of support. Apparently, there is flexibility in the policy's principle. It is unlikely that the policy requires that a billion baht worth of rice is to be bartered straight for an aircraft of the same value. It probably means that the government selling the plane should facilitate the purchase of our agricultural products. A recent example comes to mind. The Air Force wants to buy Italian G-222 transport planes and the Italian side is coming here to pursue the matter. The government should inform the Air Force that Italy has enjoyed considerable trade surplus with us and has set a very high standard for import of agricultural products. This virtually negates any chance for any Thai imports. Now that the Air Force wants Italian planes, the Thai Government should be able to bargain with the Italian Government to open its market for Thai agricultural products. This is a principle in negotiating arms barter. The issue is coordination between the government, comprising the officials concerned -- the commerce, agriculture, foreign and defense ministers -- and the military services. Therefore, the government should send its representatives to meet with the armed forces to explain the government's principle. The absence of such meeting has created an issue, as reflected in the remarks by the supreme commander and the army commander. Coordination is important and the government must quickly bring it about. Without it there will be misunderstanding, as is in the case of the arms barter issue. The absence of coordination will lead to skepticism and confusion even in purchase of small amount of arms, such as whether barter is to be applied in purchase of artillery shells. A consultation will eliminate misunderstandings. The absence of coordination is what caused the military officials to express their skepticism.
