As initiator and chair of the Cairns Group, which drew together a lobby of like-minded traders to raise a more influential voice among the giants of world trade, Australia has been diligent, consistent, and tenacious in its advocacy for the new regime. The doubting and protectionist nations have not been vanquished: they remain formidable and will continue to attempt unilateral, managed trade where it suits them. Some of the sectors incorporated into the GATT have still to be determined properly, and while fears of a world broken into exclusionary trading blocs have lessened, that threat has not disappeared. It remains to be seen how committed regional associations such as the European Community and the North American Free Trade Agreement will be to giving precedence to the multilateral GATT. But for all its faults the GATT, to come into effect next year through a permanent governing body, the World Trade Organization [WTO], is a powerful instrument for global enrichment. Fairly employed, it is capable of benefiting every signatory nation and could increase the value of export production by $325 billion [currency not specified] a year. To give one illustration, French consumers who last year watched their nation's farmers do their destructive best to thwart the deal will enjoy a cheaper and wider range of goods on their supermarket shelves, courtesy of a reduction in subsidies and enhanced competition emanating from trade freedoms. Despite the failure to achieve as much as the free traders had sought during the seven years of hard bargaining that constituted the Uruguay Round, Australia and its fellow groupers can claim a significant triumph out of this week's ceremonies in Marrakesh. Our representative at the 125-nation conference is the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan. But among all the Australians who deserve personal credit and recognition for their long-term roles in the negotiations two especially stand out: former trade minister Mr John Dawkins and senior negotiator Mr Peter Field. Next month the Cairns Group will assemble to consider its future. There have been occasional rifts - in the latest, Australia is quite rightly threatening to take one of its fellow members, Canada, to the WTO because Canada has improperly increased trade barriers on some farm products. But the group has generally held together very well indeed and been a highly effective alliance. The new GATT, which member nations are expected to pass into domestic legislation before it takes effect from next January, will remove or lower trade tariffs and progressively free global trade in services, agriculture, textiles, and government procurement. Specific liberalization in some of these sectors has yet to be agreed, but for the first time they have been brought into the framework of rules, disciplines, and international disputes procedures. The next big step will be to resolve these outstanding points and negotiate the entry of the financial services and telecommunications sectors. Some rich nations are also pressing for uniform labor standards to be incorporated into these trading arrangements. That issue, which has understandably been condemned as protectionist by developing nations, should not proceed without careful study and debate. Rather, the priority now should be to extend the GATT's inclusiveness by enrolling China. Beijing has been pressing for membership since 1986. Its application has rightly been supported by Australia and this week obtained conditional backing from the United States, the EU, Japan, and Canada. China stands to have the world's biggest economy by early next century. It is unthinkable it should continue to be isolated from the world economy. It would be a natural and auspicious beginning for the new world trade order to be inaugurated with the admission of what may become its biggest member.
