Ruehe had said: "We will not send our troops to Rwanda." The Foreign Ministry said that if the defense minister, who is the minister responsible for such missions, finds that the use of German troops is out of the question, the foreign minister can only agree to that view. A week ago, the United Nations had asked Bonn via the German Mission in New York whether it would be prepared to send a medical unit of 100 soldiers, a field hospital, and 50 vehicles, as well as an air transport unit to Rwanda. In a paper assessing the matter, the Foreign Office says that this was a "deviation from general practice." Usually, such requests are made orally and on all the members of the community. In the case of Rwanda, Germany was approached direct and in writing. This shows the urgency with which the matter is being treated and the pressure that the Security Council is putting behind the request. Irrespective of this request, a Bundeswehr Transall aircraft is to take drugs and food to Rwanda. Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said that the cabinet is "clearly willing" to meet a relevant request by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. But first it must be clarified whether the situation is secure enough for such a mission. The Transall plane is to operate as a shuttle taking drugs and food from Nairobi to the Rwandan capital Kigali. The request from New York for the deployment of medical troops has not yet been officially decided in Bonn. Ruehe said that the security situation in Rwanda has to be clarified first and the conflicting parties must agree to the mission. Also, irritations must be avoided prior to the Federal Constitutional Court passing its judgment on international Bundeswehr missions. The Foreign Ministry said that there is absolute chaos in Rwanda. The security of German medical troops would not be safeguarded. Kinkel is torn between two opinions in the Rwanda question. On the one hand he said that Germany must not stand aside when there is a genocide happening. On the other hand, he said that no European country is currently prepared to send troops to the African country. Kinkel and Ruehe had already discussed the UN request on Wednesday [18 May]. In this discussion, Kinkel was especially responsive to the argument of danger to German troops. The decision to provide the Transall was made in a talk between Kinkel, Ruehe, and Friedrich Bohl, the minister in the Chancellor's Office.
