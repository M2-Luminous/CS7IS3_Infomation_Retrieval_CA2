Julius Toth, deputy prime minister and finance minister, said at a meeting of the government's economic council that the Cabinet had to tackle some problems and release some finances at the end of the year. Expenses in health service and education had risen considerably, and this resulted in an increase of the overall budget deficit. With regard to the unfavourable result of 1993 payments with the Czech Republic, Julius Toth said that Slovakia's negative balance was caused by pre-Christmas imports from the Czech Republic.
