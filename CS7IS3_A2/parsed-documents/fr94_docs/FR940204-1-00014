FR940204-1-00014 FR940204-1-00001 PART 474_ELECTRIC AND HYBRID VEHICLE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM; EQUIVALENT PETROLEUM-BASED FUEL ECONOMY CALCULATION 1. The authority citation for part 474 continues to read as follows: Authority: Section 503(a)(3) Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, Pub. L. 94&hyph;163 (15 U.S.C. 2003(a)(3)), as added by Section 18, Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, Pub. L. 96&hyph;185; Department of Energy Organization Act, Pub. L. 95&hyph;91. 2. Section 474.2 is amended by removing the definitions for ``Steady- speed electrical efficiency value'' and ``Stop-and-go electrical efficiency value'' and adding the following definitions in alphabetical order: §474.2 Definitions. * * * * * Highway fuel economy test procedure driving schedule electrical efficiency value means the average number of kilowatt-hours of electrical energy required for an electric vehicle to travel 1 mile of the highway fuel economy test procedure driving schedule, as determined in accordance with §474.3(c). * * * * * Urban driving schedule electrical efficiency value means the average number of kilowatt-hours of electrical energy required for an electric vehicle to travel one mile of the urban driving schedule, as determined in accordance with §474.3(b). 3. Section 474.3 is revised to read as follows: §474.3 Test procedures. (a) The conditions and equipment in the Electric Vehicle Energy Consumption and Range Test Procedure_J1634 of the Society of Automotive Engineers shall be used for conducting the test procedures set forth in this section. (b) The energy consumption test procedures prescribed in Society of Automotive Engineers procedure J1634, Section 6, using the Environmental Protection Agency Urban Driving Schedule, shall be used for generation of the urban driving schedule electrical efficiency value. (c) The energy consumption test procedures prescribed in Society of Automotive Engineers procedure J1634, Section 6, using the Highway Fuel Economy Test Procedure Driving Schedule, shall be used for generation of the highway fuel economy test procedure driving schedule electrical efficiency value. 4. Section 474.4 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b) and (e) to read as follows: §474.4 Equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy calculation. (a) Calculate the equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy of an electric vehicle as follows: (1) Determine the urban driving schedule electrical efficiency value, according to §474.3(b). (2) Determine the highway driving schedule electrical efficiency value, according to §474.3(c). (b) Calculate the electrical energy efficiency value by: (1) Multiplying the urban driving schedule electrical efficiency value by 0.55; and (2) Multiplying the highway fuel economy test procedure driving schedule electrical efficiency value by 0.45; and (3) Adding the resulting two figures, rounding to the nearest 0.01 kWh/mile. * * * * * (e) Calculate the equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy value in miles per gallon by multiplying the electric energy efficiency value by one of the three petroleum equivalency factor values which reflect the three production volume/accessory combinations specified in §474.4(d): (i) 2.32; (ii) 2.09; or (iii) 1.88.
