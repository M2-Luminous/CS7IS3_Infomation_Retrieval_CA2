According to a long Russian tradition, the sobering with regard to the United States is beginning to boil over. Now it is not only Zhirinovskiy's supporters, but those who have fairly recently been moderate intellectuals that accuse the United States of planning to "exterminate the friendly Serb people" and of harboring intentions to impose a new "Pax Americana," and urge Russia to fence off NATO so as to counter the bloc with "an independent center of strength" in the form of the CIS. These sentiments have not seriously affected Russia's official policies so far. Moscow's recent departure from its initial stance of unquestionably following in Washington's steps rather reflects its desire to balance relations with the United States. Still, it was not without heeding these sentiments that Moscow recently put off indefinitely its accession to the "Partnership for Peace" program, and it reminds the Americans on every occasion that "Russia is a great power;" and Andrey Kozyrev keeps talking, insistently so, about Russian plans "aggressively to defend its interests," thus awakening reminiscences in the West about Cold War terminology. Of course, Russia currently lacks either the strength, capabilities, or even the desire to set itself against America. The goings-on, however, are fairly dangerous. Under certain conditions, Russia's desperate -- but still unsuccessful -- search for its role on the world scene instead of the one it has lost may result in the return to a fairly familiar, nearly genetic anti-Americanism. In this case it will be more show than real, more posturing than policy, but even this posture can do great damage to Russian interests. All the more so because a counter-tide is mounting in the United States itself. It has not given rise to anti-Russian actions yet, but the shagreen leather of restraint is shrinking fast. Passages about "Russia's neoimperial ambitions" have already become a commonplace in the statements of U.S. high-ranking officials. The fact that the United States is providing Russia with moderate financial assistance gives the Americans additional reasons constantly to remind it that as of today the United States is the sole superpower in the world. And also to give Moscow instructions as to what deals it may conclude with India or Iran, how it should behave itself in the Middle East or in its disputes with the Baltic states. "There should be no anti-Americanism, but neither should there be pan-Americanism," believes a high-ranking official of the Yeltsin administration, who appears to be expressing the general viewpoint of our government bureaucracy. This is an understandable wish, albeit one that can scarcely be fulfilled completely: Any powerful system -- and the United States is precisely one -- seeks to become a monopoly. Still, this should not give rise to yet another surge of anti-Americanism, but serve as a reason to work out a counterpolicy that would make it possible to maintain constructive relations with the United States and at the same time enable Russia to defend its legitimate interests. This symbiosis is realistic for two reasons: First, the United States -- as shown by its failures in Somalia and Haiti, not too strong positions in trade wars with Japan, and continuous overtures to China despite Beijing's human rights violations of all possible sorts -- is far from omnipotent. Second, it needs Russia for objective reasons -- insofar as it uses, not rejects, Russia's remaining possibilities to influence international processes. The evolution of the situation around Bosnia is a case in point. If President Clinton were certain that the strategy of bomb strikes is bound to succeed, he would not have called Boris Yeltsin on the phone last week, nor would Warren Christopher have met with Andrey Kozyrev in Geneva. The course events took after Russia's diplomatic defeat in Gorazde only emphasized that it is still one of the key players on the Balkan scene against which both the United States and NATO prefer to measure their actions. The West needs Russia to an even greater degree to control the course of events on the territory of the former USSR. Although in the United States scenarios of playing "the Ukrainian card" are being contemplated with a determination worthy of a better purpose, in reality the United States is unable actually to oppose Russia in that space. Anti-Americanism is flawed at least because it attributes to the United States the possibilities it does not have. Moreover, there is no better way of giving a strong boost to anti-Americanism than to project the image of a Russia hostile to the United States and the West. On the contrary, it should act accurately and carefully as it takes part in numerous international games -- from the Bosnian one to the partnership with NATO -- and prudently use its influence on a case-by-case basis either on the American side or in favor of emerging alternatives. Neither pro-Americanism, which is fraught with its unbridled antithesis in Russia, nor anti-Americanism, which is rolling our country back to what is has left behind with such difficulties are acceptable for it. Russia should stop measuring itself against this leading, but not omnipotent pole of world politics. Only by so doing will it be able to overcome its historical inferiority complex with regard to the United States, to come to the balanced realization of its national interests, and to help diffuse the American influence if and when it runs counter to its needs.
