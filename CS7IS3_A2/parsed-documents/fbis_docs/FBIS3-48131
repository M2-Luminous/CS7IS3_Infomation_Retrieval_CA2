SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a meeting with labor leaders Monday that he received an informal call for a summit between him and Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). In the meeting, Murayama indicated that the SDP alone cannot strike a compromise over the matter noting the party is one of seven partners in the coalition, SDP officials said. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori earlier proposed holding talks between Kono and Murayama. The MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported Monday that Kono and Murayama should have summit talks and agree to consider legislating an antigraft law separate from election reform bills. The national daily said if the country's two largest parties agree on placing priority on anticorruption measures, it will have a significant impact in resolving the impasse over political reform. Last week, the House of Councillors voted down a package of four government-sponsored political reform bills which had passed the House of Representatives in November. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his ruling coalition are seeking to establish a joint panel of the two houses in a last-ditch effort to achieve political reform by Saturday, when the current session of the Diet ends. The political reform package is designed to introduce a combination of single-seat and proportional representation seats for lower house general elections, replacing the current multiseat district system, as well as stepping up controls on political fund-raising activities.
