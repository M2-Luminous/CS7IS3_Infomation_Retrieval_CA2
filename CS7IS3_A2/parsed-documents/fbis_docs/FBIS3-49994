He informed the representatives of the military police about the current military situation, and the peace negotiations. Edin Muhic reports. [Muhic] Dzevad Radzo, commander of the military police battalion, briefed Dr. Ganic about the activities of the members of this battalion. He emphasized the high morale of his fighters, whose average age is about 25. Radzo also stressed the excellent cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, particularly in fighting crime. The fighters of the military police battalion are also involved in combat operations together with the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Speaking about the latest round of the Geneva talks, Dr. Ganic stressed that the Serbian-Croatian coalition from Karadjordjevo [location of Milosevic-Tudjman talks in 1991 on the carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina] was again at work. [Ganic] However, we will continue to fight. We will wait for the convention of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats, wait to hear their views on the [word indistinct] that they will support a unified Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that they will not support this Karadjordjevo concept. [words indistinct] some other coalitions are possible, coalitions that no one has ever under any circumstances envisaged. [Muhic] Addressing the partition of the country, the carve-up of Bosnia between Serbia and Croatia, Ganic said: [Ganic] Tudjman and Milosevic cannot carve up Bosnia. They cannot even with the help of some circles in Europe, because that would extend the Bosnia-Herzegovina war into new regions. No one has ever counted on that. You have heard that we have been offered Peljesac, that is, a part of Peljesac to build a port, so [we have been offered] a part of another country, somebody else's territory. I would like to remind you that we have built one port on somebody else's territory, the port of Ploce. Now they want us to build another one. Why should we [word indistinct], when we have our own coast [in and around Neum], and we can build the port there, on the territory over which we have sovereignty, and that is some 24 kilometers of coast. [Muhic] The international community during the Geneva talks has abandoned the principles set at the London conference, Ganic stressed. [Ganic] We have to return to them. Whether by the Security Council or some other [word indistinct] conference, a Balkan one or a London one, whatever, the principles have to be set again and then, based on those principles, we can search for a political solution. [Muhic] Some of the solutions have to be found in Bosnia-Herzegovina itself, Ganic said. First of all we have to bolster the army. There are still reserves, both in the internal organization of the military and civilian authorities, and in involving our people abroad. Just the things that we have done inside Bosnia-Herzegovina have yielded results. What, in the view of Presidency member Ejup Ganic, is needed for the war to be ended? [Ganic] It will be over when both Serbia and Croatia understand that they cannot carve up Bosnia, that they cannot carve up Bosnia in the way set out in Karadjordjevo. They cannot restrict the Bosniak people to a few enclaves in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Muhic] At the end of his visit to the military police battalion, Dr. Ejup Ganic said: [Ganic] We here are defending certain values that do not belong to Bosnia-Herzegovina alone, but to all civilization. Because of that, our fighters make one of the best armies ever formed in Europe. [Muhic] Dzevad Radzo, commander of the military police battalion, expressed his gratitude to Presidency member Ejup Ganic for the information, and concluded that the military police -- regardless of the political solutions -- will carry out its tasks for as along as needed.
