During the 45-minute meeting held at Alfonsin's Barrio Norter apartment, Angeloz -- one of the few Radical leaders to win the April 10 Constituent Assembly elections in his province -- confirmed that his delegates will attend Friday's National Committee meeting in Vicente Lopez. The body is scheduled to receive a final report from Alfonsin on the balloting, in which the Radicals trailed the ruling Justicialist Party by nearly 20 percentage points. Alfonsin needs the support of the pro-Angeloz delegates at the plenary meeting to face off the opposition of the so-called Group of 44 Radicals, who oppose the constitutional reform pact signed by Alfonsin and President Carlos Menem and are expected to question Alfonsin's leadership. One of the anti-reform camp leaders, Senator Fernando de la Rua, told Radio 9.90 that he was "waiting for a change in the party's leadership." Commenting on the Angeloz-Alfonsin summit -- originally scheduled to take place last week -- the senator said: "The most important result of the talks is that the reorganization of the party was discussed." Another anti-reform Radical, Deputy Federico Storani, told a local news agency that he was "optimistic" that the meeting "will unlock" the internal conflict. Angeloz, in turn, said that Alfonsin will continue as Radical head until the end of the Constituent Assembly, which will open in Parana and Santa Fe on May 25. The governor announced that he will head a committee of "political action" which will start a round of talks with all the party's internal sectors. Angeloz also met yesterday with the heads of the Radical Lower and Upper House caucuses, Deputy Raul Galvan and Senator Jose Genoud, in what is seen as the start of an attempt to resolve the party's internal crisis. Angeloz admitted that he had a difficult task ahead and announced that he will remain in the Federal Capital to continue talks "to united and strengthen the party." De la Rua meanwhile confirmed that he still hoped to be the party's presidential candidate in 1995. But he underlined that "it is not time yet to formally launch the candidacy." In related news, the Radical Party Youth yesterday issued a statement demanding the resignation of the National Committee led by Alfonsin and holding it responsible for the April 10 defeat.
