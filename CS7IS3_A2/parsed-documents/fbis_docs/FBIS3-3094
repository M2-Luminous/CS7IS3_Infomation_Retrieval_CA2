Liu Huaqing, Standing Committee member [of the Political Bureau] of the CPC Central Committee and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission [CMC], as well as CMC Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen and CMC members Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyu met with the delegates during the meeting. Liu Huaqing said: Considerable results have been achieved in work related to military laws, but arduous tasks still lie ahead. I hope that all of you will continue to work hard. He stressed the work to strengthen the enactment and enforcement of military laws to bring about the administration of the military by the law. State Councillor Chi Haotian, national defense minister and CMC member, attended and addressed the meeting today. He said: Administering the military by the law is an important component of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building during the new period. We should give the in-depth study and implementation of this thought the most prominent place in legal construction throughout the military and integrate them with the study and implementation of the gists of CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin's relevant instructions. The in-depth implementation of the CMC policy of administering the military by the law is a reliable guarantee for upholding the party's absolute leadership over the military under the new circumstances, an objective demand of adapting to the establishment of a socialist market economic system, a pressing need of strengthening national defense and military modernizations during the new period, as well as a fundamental measure for safeguarding state interests and service members' legitimate rights. Military legal construction for the period ahead consists mainly of tasks in six areas: We must conscientiously give military legal construction a prominent place in the overall perspective of national defense and military construction and bring about the synchronized development of such construction and the legal system by paying simultaneous attention to these two areas; we must draw up a complete set of military laws to cover every sector, aspect, and link in national defense and Army building; we must establish an operating mechanism which can guarantee the smooth implementation of military laws to give full play to the role of military laws as a guide, driving force, and safeguard for national defense and Army building; we must vigorously strengthen the supervision and inspection of justice, law enforcement, and laws to truly bring about a situation in which justice is administered in accordance with the law, all laws are enforced stringently, and every violation of the law is accounted for; we must carry out throughout the military extensive and deep-going propaganda and education on the legal system to lift the self-consciousness of the vast contingent of officers and men in observing and enforcing the law; and we must strengthen the building of legal organs and a contingent of cadres to prepare them for the tasks that their shoulders bear. Chi Haotian called for the conscientious strengthening of leadership to really satisfy the CMC requirements on military legal construction, including military legislation in the agenda of party committees, and to unite and organize forces, to make sure we achieve positive results; and he called for adherence to the proper principles of legislation to ensure the quality of work in drafting various military laws and regulations, and for the strengthening of the supervision and inspection of law enforcement to promote the implementation of various military laws and regulations. The all-Army work conference on the legal system which opened in Beijing on 3 March with the CMC's approval is the first-ever meeting of its kind. The meeting earnestly implemented the demands of the party Central Committee and the National People's Congress [NPC] on strengthening legislative work, as well as the CMC policy of administering the military by the law; and emphatically studied such issues as quickening the pace of military legislation and opening up new prospects for military legal construction under the circumstances of adapting to the establishment of a socialist market economic system and of Army building during the new period. Attending the meeting were responsible persons from the three general departments and other major Beijing-based units of the People's Liberation Army, as well as relevant departments under the headquarters of the Chinese People's Armed Police Force. Responsible comrades from legislative work departments under the CPC Central Committee, the NPC, and the State Council also attended the meeting.
