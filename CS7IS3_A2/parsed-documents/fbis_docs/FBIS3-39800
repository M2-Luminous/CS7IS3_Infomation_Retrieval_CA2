[Ruehe] Yes, the people of Sarajevo have won, because we all remember the terrible scenes. This was possible only through a mixture of diplomacy and the threat of military force. It seems that the vast majority [of Bosnian Serb artillery] has been withdrawn, or put under UN control. This is important progress. Now, similar living conditions have to be created in Bihac, Tuzla, Srebrenica, and elsewhere and progress has to be made at the peace negotiations. [Staisch] The great catchword, the historical catchword, which one thinks of is appeasement. A shell fell on Sarajevo market and suddenly the conscience of the world, the West, NATO, and the United Nations, or however you want to call this conscience, has finally stirred. Could this mixture of diplomacy and military threats that you described not have been thought of a lot earlier? [Ruehe] Yes, of course. There were proposals of this kind, but there was always a tense relationship between the countries who have troops on the ground and are giving humanitarian aid and the others who pursued a mixture of diplomacy and the threat of military strikes. Then things got so bad that an agreement was reached on this policy, thank goodness. However, it was also important that Russia joined in the diplomatic process. This is still not a solution to the conflict, of course, but a limited and important success, and this has to be continued. It is true that mistakes were made in the past, that the Europeans did not share the same political views and that there was conflict which meant that such conclusive action was not possible any earlier. [Staisch] So what can we learn from last Sunday night [20 February] to Monday morning for Bihac and Tuzla? [Ruehe] The situation in each of these towns is different, but one thing seems clear to me: It is not enough just to protect the UN troops. When we talk about safe areas, this should not mean safe areas for UN troops, but it should mean, as has been enforced in Sarajevo, safe areas for people. And these towns mentioned and a few others, I think, are such safe areas and the safety of people there must also be enforced. [Staisch] But this would mean that -- and we read yesterday and the day before yesterday in news agency reports that while the ultimatum was being met in Sarajevo, the bombing of Bihac and Tuzla had been stepped up -- basically the ultimatum strategy should be extended to the whole of Bosnia with the same determination as shown in Sarajevo. [Ruehe] We will have to see whether this will also be done using ultimatums. But it is true that it is good for the people of Sarajevo who have probably suffered most, or where at least this has been most visible to the international public. Television cannot reach all areas. Things cannot stay as they are. This mixture of diplomacy and military pressure must be continued. But this can only work ultimately if people learn to live together again and we need a peace treaty to bring this about. [Staisch] What is the significance of the return of the Russians to the diplomatic and also the military stage? There have never been blue helmets from the United States or from the Western powers and Russians under the same UN umbrella on the same spot. [Ruehe] This is also an important step for the Russians, because I remember the talks I had when they said we need our soldiers in the southern area of the former USSR. That was why they were kept in the background internationally. And finally NATO's decision-making powers made this change in Russian policy possible. [Staisch] There is a NATO council meeting tomorrow. What will be discussed? What will be analyzed? What will the future course be? What will NATO say: Good, we have been successful. But what will be the next diplomatic and military steps? What concrete demands will have to be made? [Ruehe] We will first take full stock of the results and will certainly come to the conclusion that this was the correct strategy. And then we will have to discuss how we can improve the situation in other areas but I cannot anticipate what that will entail at present. [passage omitted]
