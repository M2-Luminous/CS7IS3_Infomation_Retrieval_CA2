Kazakhstan's plans for a vast privatization program include the sale of the country's mining deposits worth up to 55 billion kronor [SKr]. "Taking over the mines will probably not involve large costs; the big money is needed for the investments to start the operations," Trelleborg Group CEO Kjell Nilsson said. Previously inaccessible markets are now being opened up. One of the reasons is that the authorities need foreign capital for the investments required by their projects. The long-discussed privatization plan has now been presented by the Kazakhstani authorities. It seems set to become the largest privatization operation ever in any of the former Soviet Republics. A Region Rich in Minerals The program involves 14 of the largest mining deposits in the richest mineral region in the world. Outside experts have estimated the deposits to be worth $7 billion. In other words, the value of these privatizations is five times higher than the estimated value of the Trelleborg-owned Falconbridge Company. These planned sales could thus have momentous consequences for the mining industry throughout the world. "But it is not necessarily a bad thing for interested parties from the private sector to get into the mining industry. It would make people start thinking in terms of profitability and kindle an awareness of unprofitable areas," Kjell Nilsson said. He pointed out that a lot remains to be done in the former Soviet mining industry before foreign investors begin lining up, not least a change in the laws to provide a clear definition of ownership. Many Different Projects "We are discussing a number of different projects, but there are no concrete talks about any projects in Kazakhstan," Kjell Nilsson said. Kazakhstan, however, is nothing new, because the Trelleborg group and its subsidiary, Boliden Contech, are in the process of building a precious-mineral processing plant for Balkhashmed. The Balkhashmed copper mine, with 13,000 employees, is one of the concerns earmarked for sale. Another project is the largest chrome deposit of the former Soviet Union, in Donskoy. "If one really gets one's teeth into a good one, there is an excellent chance of finding interesting morsels among these projects," Boliden Contech CEO Staffan Jaehkel said. Boliden Contech specializes in selling Swedish technical solutions abroad. This year's turnover appears set to reach SKr250 million, and news about the outcome of plans for a giant project for Norilsk on the Kola peninsula is expected soon. Boliden Contech, together with the Norwegian companies Elkem and Kvaerner, has submitted the best offer for a project that may be worth SKr2 billion over a four-year period. Some 5 km from the Norwegian border, the main task will be to stem the discharge of sulphate dioxide from the nickel-smelting plant. This plant discharges six times more sulphate dioxide than the whole of Sweden in a year.
