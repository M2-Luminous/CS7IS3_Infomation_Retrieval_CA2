The signing of this document will contribute to repressing this illegal activity, and will help speed up the process of returning stolen cars. The joint declaration was signed at the Foreign Ministry. It was the Uruguayan foreign minister's last official activity in Paraguay. Abreu is scheduled to return to his country this morning after a three-day official stay in our country. In the joint declaration the foreign ministers also recognized the increase in the consumption rate and illegal trade in narcotics, which constitutes a grave threat to our peoples' health and well-being and obligates all nations to share in the responsibility of repressing it. The ministers ratified the importance for the two countries--in the context of the Parana-Paraguay waterway--of the work to eliminate existing obstacles to the effective use of port facilities granted to Paraguay in Montevideo and Nueva Palmira. Port authorities and operators from the two countries will meet in Montevideo during the second half of July. The Uruguayan foreign minister returns to his country on a private plane at 0900 this morning.
