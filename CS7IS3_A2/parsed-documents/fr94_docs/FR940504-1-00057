Nature of Results A commonly expressed concern about CV is that it can produce results that are not sensitive to all relevant characteristics of the described natural resource injuries and methods of preventing or restoring the injured resources. NOAA has proposed a test to address this concern. The Department solicits comment on whether the same test should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering for its type B rule, is as follows: Nature of results. (A) Scope test. Controlling for attitudinal, demographic, perceptual, and other differences across respondents, the trustee(s) shall demonstrate statistically that the aggregate WTP across all respondents for the prevention or restoration program increases (decreases) as the scope of the environmental insult is expanded (contracted). The scope of the environmental insult is characterized by the severity of the natural resource injuries and the level of effectiveness and timing of the restoration or prevention program. The demonstration shall be conducted through the use of split samples. (B) Number of scenarios. The trustee(s) shall administer to split samples different survey instruments containing three variations of the scope of the environmental insult that respondents perceive as different unless the trustee(s) can provide a reasonable showing that the three-scenario test is infeasible due to considerations of cost or lack of plausibility of scenarios. Where three scenarios are feasible, the statistical test shall involve pairwise comparisons. In either case, the scenarios may vary along any of the margins of intensity, geography, and duration of damage and, for prevention scenarios, the probability of an event occurring. The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected variations of the scope of the environmental insult. In determining the descriptions to be used with the split samples, the trustee(s) shall use realistic injury scenarios and prevention or restoration programs that the respondents accept as credible. (C) Maximum amount of difference between scenarios. The trustee(s) shall develop scenarios for the total value test. Prior to the performance of the test, the trustee(s) shall demonstrate that not more than ninety-five percent of respondents in a pre-test or in focus groups indicate that there are meaningful value differences between the scenarios to be tested in any pairwise comparison. The demonstration shall be based on a minimum of sixty valid responses. The trustee(s) shall exclude from this demonstration any individuals who indicate in screening questions that they are not willing to pay anything for any size environmental cleanup or who would be willing to pay unrealistically large and invariant amounts for any size environmental cleanup. 59 FR 1183. If this test were included in the Department's type B rule, one important aspect would be the determination of the relevant dimensions of the scope of the environmental insult. The scope of an environmental insult such as a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance is multi-dimensional, where the dimensions are influenced by biological and social attributes. A discharge or release can affect all or part of an ecosystem. Its effects can be short- or long-lived, lethal or sublethal, geographically contained or widely dispersed. From the human perspective, the effects of a discharge or release may be directly visible and disturbing, or out of sight and perceived only indirectly once there is knowledge about the loss of natural resources. In the first phase of NOAA's proposed test, the relevant dimensions of the scope of the discharge or release under investigation would need to be identified. Once the trustee official had defined the relevant dimensions of scope, the trustee official would employ a split sampling technique where some respondents were provided with an alternative survey instrument. The trustee official would begin the analysis with the primary survey instrument that would be used to estimate the values lost due to the discharge or release in question. This instrument would be designated the base instrument. Trustee officials would pre-test and perform pilot tests on the instrument to ensure that the instrument met any design and development standards. Analyses performed using incompletely developed or tested preliminary instruments would not be considered evaluations of scope sensitivity because in these situations it would not be possible to distinguish the effects of variations in survey instrument design from the effects of changes in the scope of the injury or proposed prevention or restoration program. In designing a CV survey instrument, trustee officials would determine the dimensions of scope that were relevant to the discharge or release under investigation and decide whether there existed a subset of dimensions that were important to the values being measured or whether all of the dimensions were linked and therefore equally important. In cases where a subset were deemed important, trustee officials would choose whether to scale these dimensions up or down in relation to the levels described in the base instrument and by how much to scale the dimensions. If all relevant dimensions were to be scaled, trustee officials would still decide in which direction and magnitude to scale each dimension. After the trustee officials had decided on the dimensions to be scaled, in what direction and by how much, they would produce second and third instruments that differed from the base instrument only with respect to the scope dimensions. Trustee officials could choose to scale dimensions regarding the injury description, dimensions concerning the prevention or restoration programs offered to respondents, or both. Regardless, trustee officials must take care to ensure that the expected ordinal change in WTP remains unambiguous when simultaneously scaling different dimensions. The scope test would be designed to determine ordinal changes in the aggregate WTP estimates. The Department is considering a hierarchy of preferred scope tests. The first priority in this hierarchy would be to demonstrate the transitivity of aggregate WTP estimates with respect to the scope of the environmental insult. The second priority would be to demonstrate the sensitivity of aggregate WTP estimates to both an expansion and a contraction of the environmental insult. The most preferred test would involve two alternative instruments: One reflecting an expansion of the environmental insult from that described by the base instrument and the other reflecting a contraction of the environmental insult from that described by the base instrument. Joint pairwise comparisons would determine whether the three aggregate WTP estimates were transitive (i.e., A<B and B<C, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument). The Department recognizes that such a test may not be feasible all cases. It may not be feasible in some cases to design credible alternative instruments reflecting either an expansion or a contraction of the environmental insult. For those cases, the second most preferred test would involve two alternative instruments: Both reflecting either an expansion or a contraction of the environmental insult from that described by the base instrument. Regardless, joint pairwise comparisons would determine whether the three aggregate WTP estimates were transitive (e.g., A<C and C<B, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument). Alternatively, it may not be feasible in some cases to determine whether the three aggregate WTP estimates were transitive if different dimensions were scaled in the two alternative instruments. For those cases, the third most preferred test would involve separate pairwise comparisons to determine ordinal changes in the aggregate WTP estimates (e.g., A<B and C<B, where B is the aggregate WTP estimate of the base instrument).
