Meanwhile, the bilateral talks between the Israeli, Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian delegations continue in Washington. Our correspondent Natan Gutman reports from Washington: [Begin recording] [Gutman] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres arrived at his Washington hotel a short time ago. From what he told us, it appears that Mr. Peres is slightly less optimistic than Yasir 'Arafat concerning the chances of signing an agreement next week. I asked Shim'on Peres whether he shares 'Arafat's assessment that an agreement can be signed within a week: [Peres] I am participating in the negotiations, and that is enough for me. I hope we will reach an agreement, but I do not want to commit myself to a precise day or week. [Gutman] What will take place in Cairo next week? [Peres] We have to finalize several more issues, some of which relate to the contents of the agreement, others to the formulation of the issues on which agreement has been reached. [Gutman] Upon his arrival in Washington, Foreign Minister Peres confirmed that Yasir 'Arafat told him in Davos that the Palestinians are not interested in an independent Palestinian state at the present time. 'Arafat told Peres at the opening of their meeting: You are afraid we want to establish a Palestinian state right now, but in fact we have decided to proceed toward a confederation rather than a Palestinian state. This is what 'Arafat told Peres at the opening of their meeting in Davos. Foreign Minister Peres will meet Secretary of State Christopher in about three hours, and tomorrow he will meet Vice President Gore. The talks between the Israeli and Syrian delegations will open in about half an hour -- a breakthrough on this track is not expected to take place today. [end recording]
