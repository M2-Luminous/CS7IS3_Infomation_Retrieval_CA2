The reason is that the perception is spreading that Japanese political turmoil will preclude any progress in the expansion of domestic demand, decontrol of markets and correction of the Japan-U.S. trade imbalance. The perception of dollar surpluses associated with the need for large-scale purchases of yen and sales of dollars by export industries has also accelerated a high yen-cheap dollar situation. The view prevails that for the time being the yen will hover in the high range of 101-105 yen to the dollar. In response to the widening chasm associated with the selection of a successor prime minister by the coalition parties, the perspective is strengthening that "further delays will take place in the reopening of the suspended Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks." Prospects are that Foreign Minister Hata will attend the cabinet minister-level meetings of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Morocco to seek an agreement for resumption of the comprehensive talks, but the view prevails that "talks of a serious nature cannot be resumed until the appointment of a new government," and it appears that expectations of a high yen for the future will persist in the face of the political vacuum. The U.S. Government is expected to wait for the decision to be made on the next prime minister and to allow for additional time in the disposition of pending problems such as the comprehensive talks. However, repeated statements by C. Fred Bergsten, chief of the U.S. International Economic Research Center, currently visiting Japan, relative to tolerating a high yen have prompted market sources to comment that "They encourage speculative buying of the yen." A look at the supply and demand situation for the dollar in currency markets indicates that export-import firms have begun to establish this fiscal year's intra-company exchange rate at 105 yen for the dollar for accounting purposes. Accordingly, they show signs of steadily entering into currency futures contracts to sell the dollar whenever the yen falls in value to above 105 yen to the dollar. In reality, last weekend when news of Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation hit the markets, the yen dropped temporarily, but prompt selling of dollars by export-import firms prevented any persistent fall in the yen. Sources at Sumitomo Corporation interpret the situation in the currency markets as "Substantiating the perception of a surplus in dollars." Sources at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank point to frequent mention that structurally, "It will be difficult for a while to alter conditions which cause a monthly trade surplus of $10 billion." In view of this situation, unless institutional investors actively purchase foreign debentures, the excess dollar supply will continue and incremental selling of dollars will occur. Currency market sources state, "Although we will see near-term demand for purchase of dollars in connection with Brazilian bond purchases by Japanese banks, the basic trend reflecting a high yen-cheap dollar relationship will not change."
