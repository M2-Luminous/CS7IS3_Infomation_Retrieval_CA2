At a secret enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission (CMC) on December 18 and 19, the top brass also agreed to implement the long-stalled decision to demobilize up to half a million soldiers. Moreover, senior officers have taken steps to restore military relations with America by dispatching Executive Vice-Chief of Staff General Xu Huizi to the United States in the spring. Chinese sources said yesterday the personnel changes which began late last month were the most extensive since the reshuffle of the leadership of the seven military regions in 1990. They said, aside from rejuvenation and professionalisation, the CMC wanted to achieve a factional balance to ensure support for the post-Deng leadership with President Jiang Zemin as its "core." A number of officers believed to be close to disgraced chief political commissar General Yang Baibing have been purged. Commander of the crucial Beijing Military Region, General Wang Chengbin has retired in favour of one of his deputies, General Li Laizhu. Considered a modernisation-minded professional, General Li served in the Tianjin region before becoming vice-commander of the Beijing region in 1985. The most politically sensitive move took place in the Chengdu Military Region with the removal of Political Commissar General Zhang Gong, a crony of General Yang's. General Zhang, a spokesman for the Martial Law Command guarding Beijing in mid-1989, has been replaced by General Zhang Zhijian, another vice-commander of the Beijing Military Region. General Tao Bojun has been appointed a vice-commander of the Guangzhou Military Region, which will play a significant role in the stationing of troops in Hong Kong after 1997. A chief of staff of the regional command since 1992, General Tao is considered a rising star. He accompanies CMC Vice-Chairman General Liu Huaqing on his ongoing tour of Thailand and Indonesia. Other personnel movements in units including the Nanjing and Shenyang military regions are expected in the near future. Within PLA headquarters, the most thorough-going changes have hit the General Political Department, considered a power base of General Yang's. Two assistant directors, General Du Tiehuan and General Xu Caihou, have been promoted vice-directors. It is believed that prior to and after the fall of General Yang, a number of his colleagues, including the incumbent Director-General Yu Yongbo, have switched allegiance and professed loyalty to President Jiang. At the General Logistics Department, which is headed by Jiang loyalist Fu Quanyou, General Zhou Youliang has replaced the retiring vice-director General Li Lun. General Zhou has since 1988 been head of the Army's Department of Capital Construction and Barracks. An informed source said patriarch Mr Deng was anxious that the Army, led by Mr Jiang in his capacity as CMC chairman, would help the leadership defuse political "contradictions" that would arise in the course of radical market reforms in the mid-199Os. He said while Mr Deng had used his influence to prop up Mr Jiang, the patriarch had sought to keep a factional balance within the PLA. "The purge of the so-called Yang Clan has been less severe than expected," the source said. "Several officers who have gained promotions, including General Zhang Zhijian, a former head of the Beijing Municipal Garrison were once allies of General Yang." Another decision made at the CMC was to start the demobilisation of as many as half a million soldiers in 1994. While the decision to trim the 3.2 million-strong PLA was taken in 1991, only token numbers of divisions and personnel had been cut. Western military analysts said the CMC had this time bitten the bullet because of rising costs, difficulty in recruitment, as well as the improvement of ties with former adversaries including Russia, Vietnam and India. "Costs saved by demobilisation will be pumped into the armaments modernisation programme," a Western diplomat said. It is understood a sizeable portion of the demobilised soldiers would be absorbed by the para-military People's Armed Police, as well as new law-enforcement entities such as urban "patrol police" units and anti-riot squads. Meanwhile, the army leadership has decided to reciprocate overtures made by the American military by sending a high-level officer to the U.S. Sources close to the PLA said General Xu would probably make his trip after the Lunar New Year. A Vice-Chief of the General Staff Department since 1985, General Xu, an expert on training and equipment, has visited the U.S. before. Diplomatic sources said General Xu's visit was the result of a partial thaw in bilateral military ties achieved during a trip to Beijing last November by the Assistant Secretary of Defence, Charles Freeman. Aside from the resumption of top-level visits, Mr Freeman and his hosts discussed the setting up of a bilateral committee on military co-operation. It is understood an American Defence Department official will be visiting Beijing later this month to discuss the frame of reference of this committee. "The co-operation committee will steer clear of sensitive issues such as weapons sales or the transfer of military technology," a source said. "It is likely the American side will help the PLA in the transformation of military factories into facilities for producing civilian goods." The source said the top brass was hopeful that the Chinese Army might again tap U.S. expertise in modernising its weapons.
