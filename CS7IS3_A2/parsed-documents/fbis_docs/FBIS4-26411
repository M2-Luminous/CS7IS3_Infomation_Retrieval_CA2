The river flows through Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong and Hubei Provinces, and its valley covers 270,000 sq km. Both the population and cultivated land in the valley account for one eighth of the country's total. As a result of its geographic location in the transitional belt between southern and northern climates, the valley floods during torrential rains and suffers from severe drought if there is no rain. Soon after China's liberation in 1949 the central government mobilized farmers and invested 50 billion yuan to construct irrigation facilities. The people of the valley have dug 12 new river courses with a combined length of 1,400 km and built 5,300 reservoirs able to store 25 billion cu m of water and other irrigation facilities. Now the irrigated areas in the valley have expanded to 7.3 million ha, ten times more than in the period before liberation in 1949. The output of grain produced in the valley accounts for one sixth of the country's total, and that of cotton and oil-bearing crops for one fourth.
