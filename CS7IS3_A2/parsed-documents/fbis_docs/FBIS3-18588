As Mr. Peter Sutherland, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, observed in New York last week, that choice was not, in fact, made with the completion of the Uruguay Round last December. On the contrary, the United States believes that both can run in parallel. That is the significance of the revival by president Clinton of the "Super 301" trade provision. But he is mistaken. "Super 301" is not particularly significant in itself. Certainly, it does not have to be used in ways contrary to the GATT. Revival of "Super 301" may even reduce congressional pressure for immediate action, giving both the United States and Japan a breathing space during which to resolve their current conflict. After the failure of last month's summit between President Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, such a breathing space is highly desirable. It will also not be enough on its own, since Japan may use its time to determine on dangerous concessions. If, for example, Japan were to decide upon increased government management of the economy, it would damage itself. But it would also reinforce the general appeal of the concept of "managed trade," which is what Mr. Sutherland rightly labelled a "misguided and dangerous approach from all points of view." What is needed is not just a deep breath, but deep thought, on both sides. Why, for example, should the Bank of Japan stand idly by while the yen soars? It should be selling the yen, instead, which would restrain the external value of the currency and, more important, expand the money supply. Meanwhile, the United States needs to put forward a far better economic justification for its complaints about Japan's bilateral and overall trade surpluses than it has managed hitherto. It also needs to ask itself why its bilateral approach has been so roundly condemned. The concern is that a kind of Iynch law will undermine the credibility of the international rule of law. At present the United States is determined to act as prosecutor, jury, judge and executioner. What is needed instead, is an objective assessment of Japan's alleged failures, along with neutral arbitration of the disputes. Even where U.S. complaints do not fall under the current GATT, the latter could still be asked to provide both an objective assessment and arbitration. Such an approach would be far better than accepting the wish of the European Union to turn the debate from a bilateral into merely a trilateral one. The United States must be helped off the hook on which it has impaled itself. If the bilateral approach is continued, both its international relations and the multilateral system itself will be gravely damaged. The sensible alternative is to use the good offices of the central institution of the system, instead. That is the choice Mr. Clinton should now make.
