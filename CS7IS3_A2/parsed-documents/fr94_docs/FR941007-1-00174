FR941007-1-00174 FR941007-1-00009 (2) Eligibility for an outstanding rating. A small savings association that meets each of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and exceeds some or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of ``outstanding''. In assessing whether a small savings association's performance is ``outstanding'', the OTS shall consider the extent to which the savings association exceeds each of the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance in making qualified investments (as defined in §563e.23 of this part) and its performance in providing branches, ATMs or other services and delivery systems that enhance credit availability in its service area(s). (3) Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings. A small savings association also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to meet the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating. (e) Strategic plan assessment and rating. (1) Satisfactory goals. The OTS shall approve as ``satisfactory'' measurable goals that adequately help meet the credit needs of each of a savings association's service area(s). (2) Outstanding goals. If the plan identifies a separate group of measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,'' the OTS shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.'' (3) Rating. The OTS shall assess the performance of a savings association operating under an approved plan to determine if the savings association has met its plan goals: (i) If the savings association substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the OTS shall rate the savings association's performance under the plan as ``satisfactory.'' (ii) If the savings association exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the OTS shall rate the savings association's performance under the plan as ``outstanding''. (iii) If the savings association fails to substantially meet its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals, or if the savings association so elected at the time it first submitted its plan, it shall be rated under the lending, investment and service tests (as described in §§563e.22 through 563e.24 of this part), the community development test (as described in §563e.25 of this part), or the small savings association assessment standards (as described in §563e.26 of this part), as appropriate.
