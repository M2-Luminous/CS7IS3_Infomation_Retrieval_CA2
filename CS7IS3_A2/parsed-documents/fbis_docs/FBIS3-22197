Korovkin and V. Sidelnikov, identified by caption; figures in brackets denote broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds] [Text] [060846] [Korovkin over shot of industrial plant exterior] According to information from the Ministry of the Environment, one-half of Russians drink substandard water, while one-third are subjected to the effects of harmful waste from enterprises with a concentration of toxic substances 10 times higher than the acceptable limit. At the same time, identifying the sources of the pollution and, most importantly, defining its toxicity and measuring the quantity of harmful waste was, until recently, a highly complex and difficult technical task. This problem has been successfully solved in the analytical laboratory of Russia's Military Academy for Chemical Protection,. A unique method of monitoring the environment using lasers has been developed here. A. Zhitov: [Laboratory chief, identified by caption] The originality of this development resides in the fact that this is in point of fact the first time that it has been possible to obtain spectral forms of the biological and chemical composition of aerosols. And in this way, on the basis of the said method, it is possible to develop universal remote laser systems for monitoring air pollution. Korovkin: The military industry has already developed and indeed produces the remote chemical reconnaissance device ``Dal'' which, according to the designers themselves, can be employed for ecological monitoring purposes almost without any modifications or additions. Moreover, experts estimate that two ``Dal'' devices can monitor an area the size of Moscow. [Video shows scenes from laboratory, equipment, graphs, designs, ``Dal'' system] [061007]
