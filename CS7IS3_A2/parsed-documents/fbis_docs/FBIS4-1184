However, an East Rand police official earlier said seven people were killed according to someone who was on the scene of the 8.45 AM blast at the taxi rank on the corners of Odendaal and Simpson Streets. East Rand police spokesman Capt Wikus Weber said extensive structural damage was caused in the immediate vicinity of the blast and human remains could be seen from the nearby Trust Bank building. Four minibuses were severely damaged. An area about 100 m [meters] around the scene of the explosion was cordoned off. The injured were taken to the William Cruywagen, Boksburg/Benoni and Natalspruit hospitals. The type of explosives used was unknown, but experts on the scene were sifting though the debris for clues. No-one had claimed responsibility and police said they were not warned about the blast. Congress of SA Trade Unions [COSATU] Spokesman Neil Coleman said the Germiston blast took place "right outside" a COSATU sub-regional office in the East Rand city. The series of blasts which started with a huge car bomb in central Johannesburg on Sunday was clearly a co-odinated attack on the ANC and its allies in the run-up to the election, said Mr Coleman. He urged police to take immediate action to ensure the safety of people using or finding themselves near premises occupied by the ANC and its allies. "A start could be made by clearing all cars within a certain radius from buildings used by our allies," Mr Coleman said. Mr Coleman added information reaching COSATU indicated the Germiston blast was a car bomb. [Johannesburg SAPA in English at 0907 GMT on 25 April reports that "at least eight people died and 33 were injured in a bomb blast at a Germiston taxi rank on the East Rand on Monday morning, police confirmed."]
