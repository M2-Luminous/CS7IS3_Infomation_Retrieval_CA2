The Omani oil official added, in an interview with AL-HAYAH, that the tour is intended to urge both OPEC and non-OPEC producers to reduce their output, absorb the surplus oil supply, and reduce the international output ceiling by about 1.3 million b/d [barrels per day]. The following is the text of the interview: ['Abd-al-Ghani] The Omani petroleum and minerals minister has begun a tour to implement an initiative supported by the summit of the GCC countries. Do you believe that the Gulf summit's declaration of its readiness to lower the GCC countries' oil output will bolster the chances that the Omani initiative will succeed in persuading non-OPEC producers to lower their output to improve collapsing prices? [Sha'ban] Petroleum and Minerals Minister Sa'id Bin-Ahmad al-Shanfari is undertaking a tour to several non-OPEC oil producing countries within the context of the decisions arising from the GCC summit to salvage and stop the fall of oil prices. As is known, the GCC countries, like most other oil producers, depend entirely on oil revenues. Any drop in prices has an extreme effect on their development plans, revenue, and earnings. Therefore, the kings and heads of state of the GCC countries decided to invigorate the initiative to lower output undertaken by the sultanate, which had previously announced a five-percent drop in its output beginning in January 1994, in the hope that it would be emulated by producers inside and outside OPEC. Minister al-Shanfari's tour can be viewed primarily in this context. It is intended to urge the countries he is visiting to help stop the decline in oil prices and to consequently bring the OPEC countries themselves to take a similar position. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Is the Omani and Gulf initiative aiming for a specific output reduction with respect to a single country or all producer countries? [Sha'ban] There is no specific target, although the sultanate does have a specific view regarding a maximum drop in output. The sultanate hopes that the initiative will result in a reduction in output amounting to 1 million b/d or 1.3 million b/d. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some believe that the condition laid down by the GCC summit for carrying out its initiative is unrealistic or unfeasible because this has not happened in the past and because the North Sea oil producers (Britain and Norway) refuse to reduce their output or cooperate with OPEC. Do you agree with this view? [Sha'ban] I do not believe that this condition is unfeasible. The GCC summit is aware, as are others, that some producers that are benefiting from low prices have no interest in prices rising again and are unwilling to cut their output. The GCC countries know that, when they stipulated that producer countries reduce [their output] by specific quotas, the summit did not have in mind, in its decision, countries which have no interest in prices not rising. In calling upon all producer countries to reduce their output, the summit had in mind countries that share the Gulf countries' interest in joining together to salvage prices and the market. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do you believe that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the other GCC countries will join the sultanate in lowering output if most of the producer countries agree to reduce their output? [Sha'ban] First, the non-OPEC producers need to be consulted. Minister al-Shanfari's tour is a basic part of this consultation, inasmuch as it will include Yemen, Egypt, Syria, Russia, and even Norway and Britain. Contacts are also being held with a view toward non-OPEC ministers holding contacts with several non-OPEC oil producer countries to cover the base of non-OPEC producers. After that, we expect that there will be a good, positive response. After the results are sorted--and every event is subject to discussion--a decision will be made on a reduction in OPEC's output and the rate of the reduction. I believe that a general, positive tendency exists among all producer countries to cut output and improve prices. ['Abd-al-Ghani] You said that the initiative aims to reduce the international oil supply surplus by about 1.3 million b/d. Is there a deadline for achieving this target, such as by late winter or early fall 1994? [Sha'ban] I believe that if we obtain a positive outcome, we can leave the setting of a date or the timing of an announcement to cut output to the relevant parties. They will engineer the timing, declaration, effective date, and implementation of this policy. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Were the GCC countries led to support the Omani initiative by the economic difficulties and hardships they are experiencing because of the drop in oil prices? [Sha'ban] Without labelling, the GCC countries no doubt rely greatly on oil revenues, as do all producer countries, especially the developing countries among them. All of them share an interest in improving oil prices, because oil revenues finance their development plans. All of the GCC countries rely on oil revenues to finance all of their development programs and to meet their financial obligations. The drop in prices is having an adverse effect on these countries' economies. The GCC countries are not the only ones suffering from this problem and these hardships. But some of the GCC countries are perhaps more able and prepared than other oil producing countries inside and outside OPEC to endure and cope with this oil crisis, regardless of its intensity. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Will there be a meeting of the oil ministers or deputy oil ministers of the GCC countries after Minister al-Shanfari's current tour? [Sha'ban] I can say that there will be a meeting. I do not know at what level it will be. However, coordination and contacts among the GCC countries are certainly ongoing. And the GCC countries will be evaluating the results of the tour and the OPEC countries' position. ['Abd-al-Ghani] There have been recurring reports that Oman may call for meetings between OPEC producers and non-OPEC producers in the IPEC [Independent Petroleum Exporting Countries] group to study the position of the oil market after Minister al-Shanfari's tour. Are these reports correct? [Sha'ban] I cannot rule out such a possibility, but I cannot confirm it. It will depend greatly on the results of the tour. Thus, this subject could be studied by Oman together with its brothers in the GCC. ['Abd-al-Ghani] When do you expect the initiative to bear results and oil prices to improve? [Sha'ban] That depends on the producer countries' willingness to lower prices [as published]. No one can predict precisely when prices will improve, because a multiplicity of intermeshed factors underlies the current oil situation. Consequently, an improvement in prices depends on the elimination of all of these causes, or at least some of them.
