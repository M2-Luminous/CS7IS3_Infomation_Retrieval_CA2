LE MONDE has revealed that former Captain Barril, the former commander of the GIGN [National Gendarmerie Intervention Unit] is reported to have the black box from the Rwandan presidential plane. [passage omitted] The French foreign minister is not aware of the existence of this black box. This is what he said this evening to our colleagues at Europe Numero 1: [Begin Juppe recording] I do not know where the black box is. Like you, I read LE MONDE this evening, and I discovered this piece of news. You pointed out that the attack in which President Habyarimana lost his life took place on 6 April. On 7 April, that is, the following day, I ordered France's permanent representative at the United Nations to call for an international inquiry into the circumstances of President Habyarimana's death. On our initiative, the Security Council asked the UN secretary general to start an inquiry into the attack. The French Government was at no time informed of any private initiative to start an inquiry into the circumstances of this tragedy, nor, of course, was it informed about the results of such an inquiry. [end recording] To round off the story about this black box, it must be pointed out that the company which used to carry out the maintenance of the Rwandan president's plane have said that they never saw any black box on that plane in the course of yearly service.
