Today he had a talk with Foreign Minister Mock. According to the assessment of the two ministers, the relations between Austria and Iran are very good. After the talk, Foreign Minister Velayati gave a news conference and Elisa Wasch asked him about the human rights situation in Iran. [Wasch] Iran is not precisely regarded as the supreme guardian of human rights. The Iranian authorities persecute the opponents of the Islamic regime with great severity. Consequently, the UN Human Rights Commission has condemned Iran. The United Nations specifically objects to the large number of executions, the torture of prisoners, and the fact that defendants are often unable to defend themselves in court. Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati is simply denying that these human rights violations exist. [Velayati] This is certainly not the truth. If the Americans had solved their problems with us and if they had not had any problems with us, we would certainly not have had such problems as human rights violations and the Americans would not have mentioned human rights violations in Iran. Who does not know that very good U.S. allies in our region are committing the worst human rights violations, which, however, are not discussed -- for example, Israel? But this is not mentioned anywhere. [Wasch] Last year, the Iranian Government did not permit the UN special envoy for human rights to enter the country. Asked about the reason for this, Foreign Minister Velayati said: [Velayati] We are convinced that he is a henchman of these governments and that his position on this issue is not objective. [Wasch] Writer Salman Rushdie, who was sentenced to death in Iran for his allegedly heretic book Satanic Verses, will be honored in Austria in the near future. He will be awarded the Austrian State Prize for European literature. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati does not believe that this will put a strain on the relations between Austria and Iran. The Austrian Government has nothing to do with the decision of the jury that awarded the prize to Salman Rushdie, he said. However, according to Velayati, it is not possible to set aside the death sentence for Salman Rushdie. A religious sentence will always remain valid, he said.
