Kohl stated yesterday that he was taking an "extremely skeptical" position on this issue. Memories of World War II are particularly vivid in that part of Europe, which is why we "will have to discuss the question of help quietly." The chancellor spoke in favor of humanitarian and technical support for the reconstruction of Bosnia. Schaeuble, however, did not expressly rule out the involvement of German soldiers: "Basically one must say that Germany must make its contribution -- including in the military sphere -- to peace in the former Yugoslavia. Should peace be concluded, then the participation of German soldiers should not be ruled out on principle to secure and consolidate peace -- under one condition: All parties involved must agree to it." Government Spokesman Vogel said in this connection that he saw fundamentally "no differences" between the two leading CDU officials on the issue of international Bundeswehr missions. Both were basically in favor of such Bundeswehr missions, he said, without making any specific mention of Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]
