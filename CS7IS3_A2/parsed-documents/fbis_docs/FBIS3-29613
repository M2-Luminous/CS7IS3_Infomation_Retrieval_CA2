Saito told a regular press conference it remains "very difficult" to make the U.S. understand that the 6 trillion yen worth of tax cuts were not simply a one-time measure, so Japan will try again at the G-7 meeting in Frankfurt. He said explanations are especially difficult as Japan scrapped Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa's original plan for a permanent income tax cut to be offset three years later by replacing the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax." Saito reiterated that ruling coalition leaders agreed to enact comprehensive tax reform this year, which is to shift the taxation burden away from such direct levies as income taxes and toward direct taxation on consumption and the like. Over the weekend, Kosuke Nakahiro, vice finance minister for international affairs, tried to explain the tax scheme at a deputy- level meeting in Washington to prepare for the G-7 gathering. The U.S. has criticized Tokyo's recent stimulus measures as too little to boost the domestic economy and thus spur imports to curb Japan's huge trade surplus. President Bill Clinton has specifically cited finance and trade bureaucrats for the failure of recent U.S.- Japan trade talks. Although he and his fellow bureaucrats must "reflect" on such criticism, Saito said that compared to the explicit welfare tax, the current plan is not what his ministry wanted. "It's sad and painful," he lamented, adding that he cannot understand why the Finance Ministry is perceived as the "villain."
