It is an important measure for fulfilling the entire strategic plan for economic development of the whole province, and for attaining the target of small-scale prosperity. Proceeding from the high plane of reform, development and stability, and ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, the party committees and governments at all levels must fully understand the importance of developing a diversified economy. They must further enhance their sense of urgency. While stabilizing the development of the production of grain, cotton and edible oil, they must treat the diversified economy as a key undertaking in agriculture and the rural economy. They must grasp it as a strategic focal point for attaining small-scale prosperity in rural areas. They must make great efforts to organize the masses to make a breakthrough in the development of a diversified economy.

[passage omitted] The meeting clearly pointed out: It is necessary to fully understand the great strategic importance of developing a diversified economy, and to enhance our sense of urgency in making a breakthrough in the development of a diversified economy. Since reform and opening up, the diversified economy in our province has been greatly developed. However, the development was uneven in different localities, trades, and spheres. Compared with other advanced areas throughout the country, our pace of development is slow. As a whole, we have not yet assigned the diversified economy a proper position. Under such circumstances, our top-priority task is to guide our cadres and masses to enhance their understanding, and further realize that developing a diversified economy is an important breakthrough point for optimizing the agricultural structure; enhancing economic efficiency; and promoting the sustained, rapid and healthy development of the rural economy. It is an important channel for absorbing the surplus labor force, increasing peasants' income, and ensuring rural stability and social progress. It is also a hope for speeding up the development of town and township enterprises, promoting county and township finances, ensuring good results of collectives and villages, expanding exports, and earning more foreign exchange. The meeting urged a correct analysis of the new situation facing the rural areas, earnestly summing up new experiences achieved by various localities, and making still more clear the idea of developing a diversified economy. With regard to coordination work, we must persist in the principle of integrating the stable production of grain, cotton and edible oil with a breakthrough in the development of a diversified economy. With regard to the guideline for production, we must persist in integrating the stable development of major crops with the efforts to assail weak links. With regard to the decision on what kinds of crops to plant, we must persist in integrating market demand with the strong points of local natural resources. [passage omitted) The meeting emphasized: To speed up the development of a diversified economy, we must grasp the principal contradictions, mainly assail the weak links, and effect a breakthrough in terms of strategic measures. First, we must make a breakthrough in developing the market and enlivening the commodity flow. We must promote development through stimulating the commodity flow. Second, We must make a breakthrough in developing key processing industries so as to vigorously promote the industrialization process. Third, we must make a breakthrough in input. We must ensure the development of a diversified economy in terms of funds. Fourth, we must make a breakthrough in terms of science and technology so as to upgrade the level and increase the efficiency of our diversified economy. [passage omitted]
