Of this amount, DM330 million has been spent in Thuringia, Ruehe told correspondents in Erfurt today. In 1994, another DM140 million would be allocated there. This afternoon Ruehe attended a dedication ceremony for the first 128 Thuringian Bundeswehr apartments in Bad Frankenhausen (Artern district). According to Ruehe, 295 Bundeswehr apartments in eastern Germany are to be ready for occupancy this year. The overall plan at 44 sites amounts to approximately 7,800 apartments. From 1993 to 1995, DM275 million has been earmarked for this purpose. For the moment the German Government is helping build some 3,000 apartments at 29 sites in eastern Germany. Ruehe said that the Bundeswehr is regarded with growing trust in the east. A clear indication of this in Thuringia is, for example, the links between units stationed there and many local communities. Public swearing-in ceremonies are meeting with a "positive response." During the floods in April, 1,300 soldiers were deployed in Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. The minister stressed that the training level of the 11,000 east German Bundeswehr soldiers, including 3,000 officers and 5,000 noncommissioned officers, is "scarcely below" that of the west. They will achieve the same operational capability as in western Germany by 1995.
