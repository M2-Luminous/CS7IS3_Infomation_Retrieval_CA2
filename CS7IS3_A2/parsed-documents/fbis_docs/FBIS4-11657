Our correspondent in Cairo Arye Gus reports that under the agreement, an increased international force will be deployed in Hebron in exchange for the Palestinian consent to waive their demand for Palestinian police there. PLO officials said that about 160 observers from three countries -- Norway, Denmark, and Italy -- will be stationed in Hebron, and as said, there will be no Palestinian police there. The agreement has paved the way for the resumption of the Gaza and Jericho autonomy talks and for an early deployment of a Palestinian police force in Gaza.
