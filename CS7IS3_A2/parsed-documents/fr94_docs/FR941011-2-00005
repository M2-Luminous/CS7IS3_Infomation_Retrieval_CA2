FR941011-2-00005 FR941011-2-00002 USDA/OIG&hyph;7, ``Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Request Records, USDA/OIG,'' is a proposed new system covering requests from individuals, under either of the cited Acts, for OIG records. The volume of requests is such that some form of control system is needed. This proposal would benefit both the agency and the individual by providing a control mechanism for ensuring requests are acted upon and for determining the status of pending requests when necessary to respond to a followup inquiry from a requester. Accordingly, USDA hereby proposes to revise the full text of the OIG Systems of Records last published in full in 50 FR 50814, December 12, 1985, and amended in part in 54 FR 39552, September 27, 1989. A Privacy Act Systems Report relating to these changes, required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), has been sent to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget. Done at Washington, DC, this 28th of September 1994. Mike Espy, Secretary of Agriculture. USDA/OIG&hyph;1 System Name: Employee Records, USDA/OIG.
