Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Russian Council of Ministers, from the 9 June government session; from the "Novosti" newscast] [Excerpts] [Chernyshova] Russian enterprises' output between January and May this year was depressingly low. Production in real terms declined in comparison with the same period last year by 26 percent. One can only wonder what was then the general decline in production for the whole period of reforms, for example, since 1991. [Soskovets] In some enterprises production fell by up to 80 percent, in some by 50 percent. [Chernyshova] Out of 406 of the most important categories of products only 20 types have shown some progress. Production of the rest, which make up the other 94 percent, is badly declining by more than a third. The machine-building industry is the worst hit. Production here declined by 45 percent. Many enterprises stand still and their number increases every month. In May there were 5,500. [Passage omitted: Some of the problems are explained by the seeming unwillingness of the Russian manufacturers to improve their products so as to successfully compete with imported goods] [Soskovets] The positive discrimination against the imported machines does not make sense. We have somehow overlooked this important aspect of industrial relations during our reforms -- that is, discipline -- not only at the enterprises and in industry but in the government as well. I think the work should begin here.
