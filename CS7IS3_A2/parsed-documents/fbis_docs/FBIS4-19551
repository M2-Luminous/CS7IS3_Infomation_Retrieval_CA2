Yesterday, he picked up his racket bravely, although it visibly proved heavy in his hand. He joked about a recalcitrant microphone: "Nothing works here any more." But he failed to warm the atmosphere up. Then he accused [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi of a large number of unacceptable "about-faces." The first ball made it over the net: Occhetto pointed out that Forza Italia has already forgotten its promises of tax reductions. The second was not so lucky: "Berlusconi conducted his election campaign on the Right, and now he is making a beeline for the Center," said Occhetto. True, but this only shows Berlusconi's open-mindedness and rapidity while the Left is still at the stage of appeals to form a single parliamentary progressive group. Third ball: "Berlusconi is changing his mind on the electoral law; now he wants a straight single-vote system just to knock all the others out; he is turning against the two-tier system merely because it suits him," said Occhetto. True, but this is the very problem facing the Left: It is Berlusconi who is hitting the balls, it is his serve, and the most the Left can do is return it. That was the way it went during the election campaign, and so it continues now. "I have been watching television for two weeks," said the secretary of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], "And I have seen the shambles: Bossi's outbursts, Berlusconi's about-faces, and above all a spirit of inurement, the cessation of all criticism, as if this were political normality. I have watched Berlusconi say that the dream he sold the voters will be difficult to translate into reality, I have watched him tell us not to get excited because it is unlikely to come true. I have seen the telecracy, and I have seen that no one is rebelling." Thus Occhetto reacts to the long winter that is freezing the Left, pointing out that the spring experienced by others is a mere sham. But they are the same arguments that he used during the election campaign, and indeed the conclusion that they lead to is a return match to be won by the Left, scheduled for a date that does not depend on the Left: "When Italy wakes up from its dream, when it becomes aware of the deceit, it will know that we did not pull the wool over its eyes." Occhetto is fighting back, angrily and energetically. He denounces the "piecemeal, factious attacks on the judiciary, the RAI [Italian Radio and Television], and the Bank of Italy." He denounces the "proscription lists," he denounces the "lies," he denounces the intention to reduce fascism and antifascism to the level of simple, symmetrical "matters of opinion." He is fighting back as he himself and the Left as a whole have not done for a fortnight. But after its defeat, the Left still does not know what action to take. It does not know: Might it be suicidal to wait for the others to make mistakes? Would it be rash to change the names and faces in the party leadership? Is going in search of the voters lost at the polls a matter of necessity or demagogy? What about founding the democratic party? But at the present time this might be the umpteenth christening for an unborn party. The Left's long winter has set in, and neither attacks on Berlusconi nor the paper balls made of faxes bearing exhortations to "demonstrate together" that the Left is throwing into its little stove of self-consolation will be sufficient to keep it warm.
