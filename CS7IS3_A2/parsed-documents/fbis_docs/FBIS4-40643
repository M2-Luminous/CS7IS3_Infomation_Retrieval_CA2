Since the start of the year not a single combine has been produced by the "Rostselmash" Joint-Stock Company, the flagship of national agricultural machine-building. At the same time there are no crowds of unemployed people on the city streets. The reason is that the firm's directors are trying by every possible means to preserve jobs, thereby creating hidden unemployment, which has exceeded 5 percent in the city. At the same time official unemployment stands at less than half a percent. Of course, this policy prevents a social explosion, but at the same time it also hampers structural restructuring of the economy and the flow of cadres into spheres where they can be more profitably used. Many people believe that the reserves of this policy have been exhausted, and when the real bankruptcies of cumbersome monsters begin, the number of people wending their way to the employment service will increase by an order of magnitude. Are they ready for this? "We are ready," I was told at Rostov City Employment Center. "We have more than 150 specialists and all our work stations are computerized. Over 100 computers link Rostov City Employment Center with eight rayon employment centers, and with the imminent introduction of modems these will be linked in a single information network. This will make it easier for the unemployed to find work." A number of strong service departments have been formed within the center. The main one aims to facilitate job placement and employment support. Since the start of this year, half of the 5,000 people who have come to this department have found work. This is not a bad result in the present circumstances. Unemployment benefit is also issued here, and is received by approximately 1,500 people. But the most important aspect, the center believes, is the accelerated creation of new jobs and an active policy on the labor market. Over 2 billion rubles have already been earmarked for this since the start of the year. Of these, 100 million have been received by the "Bearing Plant" Joint-Stock Company, where they have started assembling KamAZ trucks using Volga components. They have already returned the money.
