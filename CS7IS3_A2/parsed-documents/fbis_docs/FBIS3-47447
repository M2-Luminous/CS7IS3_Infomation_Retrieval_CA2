Japan and the United States are scheduled to bring a conclusion to this issue by the time that the Japan-U.S. summit talks are held on 11 February. However, Japan-U.S. talks on this issue are still at odds. As it has done for other commercial sectors, the United States has been calling on Japan to establish a "numerical target" for opening up Japan's insurance market despite the Japanese Government's rejection of this. In addition, the U.S. Government has also called on Japan to delay its liberalization of some areas of Japan's insurance markets. In response, Japan has reacted strongly against the U.S. Government's call, stressing that the U.S. Government's call runs counter to the principle of talks that emphasize the "promotion of market opening." Therefore, such resistance by Japan has further increased the uncertainty of the future of the talks. Since the first talks in Hawaii in September 1993, Japan-U.S. negotiations on insurance have been held once a month. Originally, Japan and the United States were scheduled to reach certain agreements in the upcoming talks. However, "in the past negotiations, both the Japanese and the U.S. delegates have just repeatedly stressed their own positions, and thus no concrete progress has been made so far in the talks" (according to a Finance Ministry source). For that reason, it seems that working-level meetings will be held sometime this month. A Japanese official involved in the negotiations has said that it is still questionable why high priority is given to the negotiations on insurance together with government procurement and auto and auto parts among the nearly 20 sector-by-sector negotiations. A prevailing view is that, because it had been said that a draft bill on revising the law concerning the insurance sector would be submitted to the Diet as early as January 1994 by the Insurance Council, the United States tried to reflect its demands in the bill. However, the U.S. hopes have not been met so far because the council is falling behind in its work on drafting the bill. Underlying the delay in the negotiations on insurance is Japan's strong opposition to the U.S. calls for allowing foreign insurance companies to join an organization composed of Japanese insurance companies and delaying the liberalization of the Japanese insurance market in the areas where foreign-capital insurance companies occupy a dominant position. As one of its requests, the United States has called for freezing the liberalization of the so-called "third sector" of the insurance market -- which is coverage for casualty, disease, and nursing losses. In the third sector of the insurance market, foreign insurers, including U.S. insurers, account for a greater market share. But a report submitted by the Insurance Council in 1992 calls for allowing life insurers access the nonlife insurance market and nonlife insurers to make inroads into the life insurance market. Taking into consideration foreign insurance companies, the report also calls for liberalizing by stages the third sector of the insurance market. The United States, however, has called for freezing for about five years the liberalization of the third sector. The United States insists that, "because Japan's insurance market is closed to foreign firms, basic types of insurance such as fire insurance and auto insurance should be liberalized first. In this sense, it is not reasonable to single out the issue of liberalizing the third sector of the market." However, Japan intends to not change its stand of opposing the U.S. calls by saying that the United State's calls to shelve the liberalization of the third sector while calling for opening other areas of the market is an "opportunistic attitude." Of course, work on reviewing Japan's insurance system has been under way based on the requests of the United States. Currently, foreign-capital insurers are not allowed to obtain membership in the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of Japan, Inc. [MFIA], but the MFIA is working on revising its articles of association with the aim of permitting them to join the MFIA. Moreover, the Housing Loan Corporation, in paying attention to foreign-capital insurers, took measures last fall to give foreign-capital firms more chances to win fire insurance contracts.
