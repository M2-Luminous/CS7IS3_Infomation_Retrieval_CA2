More than 800 people were expected to arrive in Corfu today. These were the heads of the European socialist parties and their delegations that will participate in the European Socialist Party conference. More than 2,500 people are expected to arrive in the next few days. These are the delegations of the twelve European Union [EU] members, the four new members, Russia, and Cyprus. [Begin recording] [Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring] I hope there will be lots of agreements in Corfu. Also, I would like to congratulate the Greek presidency on the work it has done in the past six months. We have the signing of the agreements with the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries tomorrow, which is a major progress for the European Union. We also have the signing of the cooperation agreement with the Russian Federation, which is in everybody's interest in Europe. We obviously have the question of the succession of Jacques Delors. This matter will be discussed. I would hope we can make progress, but we will obviously know tomorrow afternoon or evening. [Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky] It is true that we ended up with a very good result at the Austrian referendum for a country joining the European Union. I think the explanation for the very good result was that the Austrian Federal Government and the so-called partners and the universities and many many others joined forces in showing to the Austrian people that joining the European Union is more or less a logical step for Austria, because it has been linked and integrated with the Twelve for so many years or even decades that it means more or less formalizing a logical step. Well, from my point of view, the Greek presidency actually deserves the respect of a country that negotiated its entry into the European Union taking into account that we finalized our negotiations under the Greek presidency and we finalized our negotiations especially from the point of view that we came through with our own interest, without being in conflict or controversy with the European Union and its members. So, the Greek Presidency served as a very important and efficient catalyst for our own negotiations. [end recording]
