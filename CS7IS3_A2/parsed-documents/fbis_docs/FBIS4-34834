Madrazo Cuellar will replace Manuel Camacho Solis, who resigned 16 June claiming that his work had been criticized by Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. "The government's purpose has been clear: to transform the armed conflict into a political dialogue, which will overcome differences," Salinas said upon announcing the appointment of Madrazo Cuellar, who will ask the Senate for a leave of absence to quit the CNDH. [passage omitted] Salinas said the measures adopted by the government, including an amnesty law, a cease-fire, and the creation of the post of peace commissioner in January, were to "try to resolve within the framework of the law" the demands for dialogue in San Cristobal, 780 km southeast of the Mexican capital. "It is not through violence that one achieves democratic progress, welfare, and justice. We are committed to having Mexico grow in peace, with more justice and sovereignty," the Mexican president stated. The government is determined to make additional efforts to maintain the dialogue and promote a political solution to the conflict, he said. He recognized that the political parties are committed to the advancement of democracy. Camacho Solis was appointed by Salinas on 10 January to find political solutions to the Indian insurrection that broke out on 1 January in Chiapas. Camacho Solis met with the rebels between 23 February and 3 March in San Cristobal de las Casas to offer solutions to their demands. Despite the cease-fire that has been in effect since 12 January, the conflict in Chiapas is at an impasse after the Zapatist guerrillas turned down the government's offer and ended their dialogue with the government.
