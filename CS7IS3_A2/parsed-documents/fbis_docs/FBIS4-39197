The Azerbaijani side used grenade launchers and various types of automatic weapons. As SNARK was informed in the Karabakh State Department of Information and Press, there had been no retaliate fire from the Karabakh side. No reports on the consequences. Despite such actions, the observers tend to think that the truce is kept, on the whole.
