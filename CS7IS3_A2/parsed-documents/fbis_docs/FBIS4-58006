The replacement was made in response to reports by international organizations and the U.S. media that Dominican soldiers were profiting from the contraband of fuel and other Haiti-bound merchandise from Dominican territory. In addition, Matos Villanueva revealed that 30 UN observers will come to the country soon to work alongside Dominican troops and verify compliance with the embargo. He explained these observers, many of whom are soldiers, will work in civilian clothes and several of them will man helicopters, speedboats, and other logistical equipment that will be used to prevent the smuggling of fuel and food. Matos Villanueva said the United Nations will supply this U.S.-made equipment. This will be done because the Dominican Navy does not have enough ships to patrol the Dominican coasts that border Haiti. These measures, Matos Villanueva added, were suggested by Alexander Martinovic, political official of the UN Security Council Sanction Committee, who visited the Dominican Republic early this week at the head of an observers mission. Meanwhile, Matos Villanueva concluded that the border has remained sealed off for the past three days and the movement of persons or vehicles between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is not allowed.
