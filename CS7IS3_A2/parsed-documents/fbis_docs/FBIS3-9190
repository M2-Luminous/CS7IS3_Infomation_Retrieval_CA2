Synonyms for this include maneuver, trick, device, ploy, strategy, and so on. President Walesa, of all the ruling circles from the countries involved, is demanding most emphatically equal membership in the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO). Warsaw knows from experience that friendly pacts with Russia under any Russian Government lead to thralldom. The representatives of the other countries, however, act as if they know nothing of this risk. The protest from Moscow, shortly after Yeltsin's agreement, against its former satellite states becoming affiliated with the Alliance was an ominous sign confirming Russia's tendency to regard these states as its zone of interest. This is not as binding as if Russia were assuming the right to determine what place the sovereign states in this geographic zone will hold in Europe and the world, as long as they do not cede this right to it. It is alarming, however, that the West is practicing a new policy of appeasement, called Partnership for Peace, to the detriment of the genuine endeavor for an independent democratic arrangement in Central Europe. Has nothing been learned from Munich and Yalta? In its incorrigible naivete, the West is staking everything on the "democrat" Yeltsin, the proponent of a market economy, long after he abandoned his former reform allies to their fate and began to seek compromises with the antidemocratic forces. No normal and sensible person can condone the threat of a nuclear conflict. The United States is rightly striving for nuclear disarmament, but it is not its job to exert pressure on Ukraine to surrender its nuclear weapons to Russia and thus clear a corridor for the Russian armies' hypothetical invasion of Central Europe. The tactic of "Russia First" is built on sand by inexperienced U.S. bureaucrats. After World War II, the Russian empire expanded within the limits tolerated by the West. Moscow did not dare cross this clearly marked demarcation line even when Soviet power was at its height. Following the Soviet collapse, there came an unexpected opportunity to extend the security arrangement of free states in the opposite direction, into a region where a strategic vacuum had evolved. A correction to the strategic map of Europe could anyhow only involve a minimum number of states--that is, those that embody civic maturity, domestic stability, successfully initiated economic development, and the will to defend individual freedom, and those that have a common border with today's NATO. The vacuum between the power-wielding camps never was viable in the long term. The affiliation of certain former satellite countries to the Alliance today would provoke protests from Moscow but no specific countermeasures because, at the moment, Russia is too polarized and weakened. Nevertheless, in a year or in a decade, after the installation of the next potential totalitarian regime over the masses whipped up by the idea of a Greater Russia, which can be envisaged, the West will not risk a conflict, even for the geographic expansion of democracy. In the event that the economic boom in Russia is unsuccessful and, thus, civil discontent increases, the new totalitarian power in Moscow will be compelled to conduct an aggressive policy in order to divert attention away from the real poverty at home. German strategists have calculated that, if NATO is not expanded eastward, the FRG will be the first bastion of defense in the event of Russian military aggression against Europe. It is possible, therefore, to anticipate that Germany, in its own interest, would welcome pushing NATO's borders toward the east. The rest of Western Europe is descending into a state of tired resignation and inability to defend itself against totalitarian aggression. In this century, it was the English-speaking world that derived sufficient vitality to defend individual freedom, not only by words, as became the habit in the other postindustrial democracies, but also by deeds. The situation in Russia is far from being clear-cut enough for us to be able to tell what combination of communists, ultranationalists, the KGB, the Army, and orthodox fundamentalists will prevail and when. Therefore, it could lead to a catastrophe if the United States, in the role of leading global democracy, were to continue the policy of appeasement. The Partnership for Peace is the exact opposite of a policy of strength. In an attempt not to provoke Moscow and, at the same time, to placate the nations that experienced the Russian grasp and are monitoring developments in Russia with horror, President Clinton is heralding the utopian Partnership for Peace instead of security guarantees. "Democracy as far as the Urals" or even "Democracy as far as Vladivostok" perhaps exists in Clinton's dreams, but it has nothing in common with realistic policy. The appeal to all members of the former Soviet empire to join the Partnership for Peace predetermines the division of Europe into the NATO sphere and also into certain internationally recognized neutral countries such as Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden, and, finally, into the remaining countries. No claim uttered smilingly to the opposite will change the fact that Clinton's naive delusion is actively driving the countries that have just gained their independence into an arrangement where Russia is assuming supremacy and the right of veto. Moreover, this plan, which, despite its name, is providing neither peace nor equal partnership, places the new democracies, and particularly the Czech Republic, on a par with entities that do not have a democratic tradition, do not respect human rights, and are socially and economically at the bottom. It is surprising that the Czech Government does not have a sufficient quantity of insight and the dynamism not to sign its own death warrant in the tradition of its predecessors. Rejecting the offensive nonsense called Partnership for Peace would be far less dangerous than signing it. This way, Prague would retain its freedom to negotiate unilaterally on joining NATO or to negotiate on mutual defense with certain select states. The Czech Republic's integration into the Western community would irritate Moscow, but it would accept it de facto because the Republic does not have a common border with the former Soviet Union. It is up to the Czech Government to persuade the West that, as opposed to the other former communist states, the Czech Republic qualifies as an equal partner. As an ally, it would be more reliable, more stable, and more respectful of human rights on its territory than many a full member of the Alliance.
