The report said their talks started in the city's airport building directly after Christopher's arrival and were expected to cover ways of dealing with the recent spy row between the two countries, former U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to Moscow, and how to build strategic partnership relations. They will also discuss a settlement of the Bosnian conflict and the peace process in the Middle East. Before leaving Moscow for Vladivostok Sunday [13 March] night, Kozyrev had said there were certain groups both in the United States and Russia opposed to cooperation between the two countries, especially if it assumes a strategic character. However, he told reporters at Moscow Airport that further development of Russian-U.S. relations should be based on the principles under the Moscow Declaration signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in January. After the talks, Kozyrev and Christopher are expected to hold a brief news conference.
