The presidential program for fighting crime will be effective only in conjunction with measures proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party. Apart from that, the LDPR leader expressed his opinion on the motives of Acting Procurator General Aleksey Ilyushenko, who has lodged an appeal with the Duma on stripping Zhirinovskiy of his parliamentary immunity and instituting criminal proceedings against him. [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] I view this as a political provocation. He is undermining the agreement on accord. He did not agree this issue with the country's president. I am the leader of the party that won the elections and head a deputies' faction in the State Duma. This is a special situation. Therefore this is his mistake and I think that after this he will lose his post as acting Russian procurator general. This will be our contribution -- quickly filling this post with a worthy lawyer from our country. [end recording] [Matskyavichus] Tomorrow the Duma council is to examine the appeal from Acting Procurator General Ilyushenko.
