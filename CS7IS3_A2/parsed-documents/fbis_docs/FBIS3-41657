The two journalists claim that, on the basis of documents, ``we know today that dioxin was actually produced in Seveso'' and that it was not the result of an accident there, as claimed by the responsible Swiss company, Hoffmann-La Roche. The 41 highly poisonous barrels were ``secretly'' shipped to France for provisional storage after the accident, from where they later disappeared. Several months after that, barrels were found in northern France and publicly incinerated in Basel, Switzerland. Sergio Angeletti, an official from Milan who was responsible for monitoring the removal of the barrels from Seveso at the time, has now ``broken his silence'' and said that the barrels that were incinerated in Basel were not those that contained the hazardous dioxin. Angeletti states that he and the ``special authorities'' knew even at the time that the barrels were to be shipped to ``a communist country in Eastern Europe,'' the GDR. The journalists state that documents that were made available to them prove that the dioxin-containing barrels were sent to the waste dump at Schoenberg, between Luebeck and Schwerin, in the GDR. Sieker and Blondiau note that a ``government commission in Milan is currently reexamining the inconsistencies of Seveso.'' A Schoenberg butcher, identified as Mr. Zander, tells the journalists that an ``absolutely trustworthy'' informer, who witnessed the arrival of the barrels at the Schoenberg dump, told him details of the burying of the barrels. Names of ``high-ranking'' officials of the Schoenberg dump are also mentioned. Another witness states that he knows the exact spot where the 41 barrels were buried at the Schoenberg dump. Responsible officials of the administration of the Schoenberg dump refused to comment on these charges and only produced documents that show that a request for dumping the Seveso barrels there was rejected. The journalists claim that all the documents passed on to Mecklenburg Western Pomeranian Environment Minister Frieder Jelen have been ``manipulated.'' Sieker and Blondiau conclude their report by stating that their investigations prove ``that what was incinerated in Basel in 1983 was not the ominous 41 barrels from Seveso but duplicates. The original barrels were taken to the refuse dump at Schoenberg, where they have probably remained to this today. Seveso is not over yet.'' In the ensuing live interview with the environment minister of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, Frieder Jelen, by Klaus Bednarz, the minister says that he will try to ``get in touch with the committee investigating the case in Lombardy.'' He adds that it will also be necessary to ``get access'' to all the documents that were made available to journalists Sieker and Blondiau. Scientists will have to examine whether one can dig out the barrels at Schoenberg. Jelen notes that it will ``not be possible'' to remove the barrels secretly from the dump now, because the case has been handed over to the state prosecutor and the Schwerin police authorities.
