The UN Security Council passes lofty resolutions, creates safe areas, on occasion makes threats, but on the ground the resources are lacking to even start with these tasks. It is enough to make a person despair, and clearly things have reached a point where they make even the general in charge feel unusual bitterness. In his first weeks on the ground, Briquemont thought that he had some power to stop the arbitrariness and madness. When Serbian militiamen shot at his troops in July, he threatened retaliation if it happened again. A day later that situation indeed arose and nothing could be heard from the tough general. When two weeks later NATO, which is after all not an unknown institution to a Belgian soldier, said it was in favour of possible bomb attacks on Serbian positions, Briquemont was a vehement opponent. The confusion is total, he said, and my soldiers are dispersed. In these circumstances bombing would solve nothing. Half a year later the confusion is still total and Briquemont's UN soldiers are part of it. Who still knows what the UN has come to Bosnia to do? To give food to the needy, who then fight on or are shot dead? To protect safe areas? To sponsor negotiations? To clean things up a bit? Or simply to wander around, a question of knowing what is going on? Therefore General Briquemont's demoralization is not surprising. He tried and then discovered that it did not lead to much. He thought that the persuasive power of the African discussion would produce some result. He hoped for an international community which could impose respect and had a clear objective. Of course that was not the case. The UN soldiers in Bosnia are taking part in terminal care and like indignant tourists watch ethnic cleansing and the destruction of a piece of European culture. And even that is not without risk. Every now and then a UN soldier dies. Recently a group of Canadian soldiers was kidnapped and mistreated by Serbian militiamen. The incident was noted and it was hoped that it would go no further. The West, the United States, and certainly Europe does not want a firm intervention. The policy is one of containment, the Bosnian conflict must remain limited, a local issue. Within these limits much, if not anything, can happen. So that less and less people still follow the news, so that Bosnia becomes folklore, the little local war which can provide striking images now and then, but ever less frequently. And further? Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes is very angry with the Serbians -- in any case he has been angry with them many times in the past -- and is threatening new sanctions to stop aggressive Serbian expansionism. As if sanctions have any effect here any more. A clearly outlined policy on this Serbian violence, with support to victims and neighbors and a clear message to Serbia, is a very different matter. But, as Claes of course knows, that presupposes some unanimity within the European Union on this conflict. What is involved here is not a large-scale military intervention, but an assessment of the situation. It seems that Europe is not able to even manage that. The general, who must sort things out on the ground in these circumstances, is becoming depressed. A perfectly understandable reaction.
