Ochoa Antich added that the Chamber of Deputies' Domestic Policy Commission should open a dialogue with the Foreign Ministry to discuss this subject. One of the 10 measures proposed by Ochoa Antich is to create a national office to coordinate state security agencies' intelligence services to preclude the need for mass repression operations. He also proposes to institutionalize regular meetings between the organized society and the country's security services, as well as to create a special fund whereby businessmen and citizens can contribute to the hiring of new police members who will be specifically assigned to their own areas. He also said that police villages should be built so they and their families can be protected while police are on duty. Another action would be to approve an agreement between universities and the Interior Relations Ministry whereby medical and psychology students provide periodic checkups for the police. It would be advisable to include human rights in the soldiers and police academies curriculum and to guarantee the allocation of budgets to build new kinds of jails to help counter the pernicious self-reproducing effect of crime in traditional prisons. Two of the most important points in the dozen proposed by Ochoa Antich deal with approving a special program to care for abandoned children and the discussion with television station owners on program violence and the possibility of stations refraining from airing programs specifically targeted for adults during daylight hours. Because all this involves disbursement, the deputy underlined the fact that while only one or two percent of the national budget is earmarked for public security in Venezuela, up to 10 percent of the national budget is earmarked for this purpose in other countries. For this reason, he said it is necessary to reshuffle the budget.
