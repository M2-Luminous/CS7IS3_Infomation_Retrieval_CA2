However, the count was still rather high, at 10,000 cases, Customs Guard Brigadier-General Balazs Novaky told the press in Budapest on Thursday. Most of the infringements were cases of trespassing, but there have also been examples [of] organized crime, such as smuggling people, weapons, and stolen cars, he added. Border guards say the most frequent violation on the eastern frontier sections was the presentation of false documents, while at the western border there were many tourists who had legally entered Hungary but tried to leave it via the "green frontier". Most of the trespassers were Romanians, followed by Turks, Ukrainians, and Bulgarians. Hungarian frontier guards siezed about 200 kg of narcotics and 1 kg of explosives this year, along with 13 hand grenades and over 30 hand arms. Brigadier-General Kalman Kiss summarized the experiences of frontier guards in enforcing the latest legal measures concerning foreigners, which became effective on May 1 of this year. He said that Hungarian frontier guards uncovered 37,000 violations in the first five months of 1994, and prevented 32,000 foreigners from entering Hungary. In addition, they have taken 1,200 foreign citizens to a public camp to put them up until they can be transported home. Frontier guards invariably take measures against travellers who do not possess adequate papers. They are also strict on people who do not have access to enough money to cover the costs of their stay, as such foreigners are likely to take black work or commit crimes, Kalman said.
