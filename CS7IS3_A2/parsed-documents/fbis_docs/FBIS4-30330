"I will resign with my cabinet en masse today," the premier said at a hurriedly convened news conference at his official residence. "It is an urgent task to form a stable government. We will entrust the formation of a new government to the will of the Diet," Hata said. The 58-year-old Hata said he decided to give up the premiership because he wished to avoid contesting a general poll for the House of Representatives and creating a political vacuum before this year's summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations. "If the lower house is dissolved, there will arise a political vacuum and it becomes impossible to tide over the yen's appreciation and other problems," he said. "I want to avoid a political vacuum by every means." Hata's two-month-old cabinet formally resigned en masse after the premier's announcement of his intention to step down, but Hata and his cabinet will stay on board until the Diet picks the next prime minister. Hata reached the decision to disband the minority coalition government shortly before the lower house was to convene a plenary session to vote on a no-confidence motion filed by the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The no-confidence motion was expected to clear the 511-member lower chamber after negotiations failed between the ruling coalition and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a former coalition member, to form a new government. The socialists, the largest contingent in the last Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government who walked out of the coalition in April, also had threatened to submit its own no-confidence motion. Hata acknowledged he thought it difficult for his minority government to vote down the motion and opted to disband his cabinet before the motion was put to a floor vote. During days of negotiations between the coalition and the SDP, the socialists sought as a prerequisite for their return to the ruling union the mass resignation of the Hata Cabinet on a voluntary basis. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said the development was what his party had demanded, adding it will seek to forge a third coalition government. Hata expressed hope the SDP will develop into a new party that takes responsible action in Japanese politics, not as a mere opposition party. Meanwhile, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori expressed hope his party will play a central role in a new government on the grounds that the LDP is the largest single party in the Diet. "As long as Hata said he will leave the issue of forming a new administration to the will of the Diet, we have to govern as the No. 1 party," Mori told reporters. The LDP lost power last summer for the first time in 38 years after failing to secure a majority in the lower house in a general election. Following Hata's resignation, the lower house decided to hold a plenary session at 1 p.m. Monday, where the next premier can be selected at the earliest. The current 150-day ordinary session of the Diet is scheduled to end next Wednesday.
