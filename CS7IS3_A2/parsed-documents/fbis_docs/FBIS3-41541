The largest industrial city in Shandong Province, Qingdao has experienced rising pollution along with its rapid economic development. To eliminate the pollution, the city has set up a leading organization headed by the mayor to guide environmental protection work, using a total of 160 million U.S. dollars loaned or donated by foreign governments and organizations in this field over the past five years, accounting for one-third of its total funds in the same period. At present, the city has completed construction of the third phase of gas supply facilities and a central heating project. It has transformed the Qingdao power generating plant technically and is building more anti-pollution projects. Included is the Tuandao waste water treatment plant with a daily capacity of 100,000 tons of waste water. Upon completion, a city official noted, these projects are expected to help improve urban environmental quality by reducing air and water pollution.
