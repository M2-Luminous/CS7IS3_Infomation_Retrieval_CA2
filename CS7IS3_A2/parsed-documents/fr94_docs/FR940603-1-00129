The Drawings and Specifications collectively, show the specifications of the material and equipment shown thereon, and include schedules of conduit, cable and other items not readily ascertained from the picture drawings. Such schedules show the quantities, sizes, types and other pertinent information; method of installation, and construction details are indicated clearly. The drawings and specifications in the attached List of Drawings are made a part of these contract Specifications. Section 4. Description of Construction Units. Each Construction Unit consists of a complete installation of the designated portion of a substation or switching station as specified on the drawings, together with connections to associated equipment. Each Construction Unit represents all labor and material including necessary accessories completely installed and tested in satisfactory operation. Full identification of each Construction Unit and all necessary specifications of the installation shall be shown on the drawings. Items of material in each Construction Unit shall be of the designated size, rating, type, voltage, or other specification in accordance with the drawings. The bill of material drawing for each station should contain adequate identification of the Construction Units under which the material is to be installed and should show what items of material may be partly or entirely found in the lists of owner-furnished materials. All items of equipment, unless otherwise specified, are mounted on a structure which shall be a Construction Unit of Group A. Each Construction Unit shall be designated by the letter of the Group to which it belongs and an identifying number. The same item of equipment shall carry the same Construction Unit designation in all the stations. Items of equipment designated by the same Construction Unit in one station shall be of only one kind as to voltage, type and other specifications. The bid sheet for each station shall be prepared separately from other stations and shall contain all unit prices for Construction Units contained in the station. It is intended that in all cases the ``Name and Description of Construction Unit'' column of the Bid Sheets shall contain sufficient information to identify the Construction Unit. Additional description to one or more of the Groups may be provided by the Engineer if deemed necessary to clarify the intent of these Specifications for Construction. Group A. Structures.
