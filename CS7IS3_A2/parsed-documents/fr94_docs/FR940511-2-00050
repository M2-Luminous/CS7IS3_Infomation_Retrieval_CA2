Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America [Docket No. CP94&hyph;377&hyph;000] Take notice that on April 26, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard, Illinois, 60148, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;377&hyph;000 an abbreviated application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, as amended, and §§157.7 and 157.18 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) regulations thereunder, for permission to abandon certain natural gas facilities by transfer to Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (Chevron), all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Natural states that it proposes to abandon (1) a 75% interest in two 1,100 horsepower compressor units located on an offshore platform owned by Chevron; (2) a 40% interest in two 1,100 horsepower compressor units located on another offshore platform owned by Chevron; and (3) approximately 1.96 miles of 8-inch pipeline that connect Chevron's West Cameron Block 564 ``CA'' platform to its West Cameron Block 564 ``A'' platform, offshore Louisiana. Natural further states that Chevron currently owns the other percentage interests in the subject compressors. Natural indicates that in consideration for this transfer of facilities to Chevron, Chevron will agree to indemnify Natural and hold it harmless with respect to any and all future liabilities that may arise associated with said facilities, commencing on the date of the facilities transfer. Natural further indicates that it will reimburse Chevron for 50% of the retirement costs prudently incurred by Chevron when the facilities are retired but in no event shall Natural pay more than $100,000 in total. Natural states that the facilities are no longer useful to it, nor are Natural's customers served by the facilities. Comment date: May 24, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 2. K N Gas Gathering, Inc. [Docket No. CP94&hyph;397&hyph;000] Take notice that on April 29, 1994, K N Gas Gathering, Inc. (KNGG), P.O. Box 281304, Lakewood, Colorado 80228&hyph;8304, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94&hyph;397&hyph;000, requesting that the Commission declare that facilities to be acquired from its affiliate, K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co. (KNI), are gathering facilities exempt from Commission jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. KNGG states that it has agreed to purchase from KNI the Bowdoin Gathering System located in Phillips and Valley Counties, Montana. KNGG states that the Bowdoin facilities are separated into four distinct segments delivering gas into the facilities of Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. (Williston). It is indicated that none of the facilities is attached to the rest of KNI's system. It is also indicated that KNI has sought authorization to abandon these facilities in Docket No. CP94&hyph;430&hyph;000. KNGG states that, by applying the modified primary function test as set forth in Amerada Hess, 52 FERC ¶ 61,268 (1990), the facilities to be acquired from KNI qualify as gathering facilities exempt from Commission jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. In support of its claim that the facilities are gathering, KNGG indicates that the subject facilities are short in length, small in diameter, web-like in configuration, and located entirely within the production area. It is also indicated that the facilities operate at a range of between 100 and 180 psig and are attached to approximately 700 wells throughout the system. KNGG also states that the gas gathered in the system is delivered into four small field compressors which boost the pressure of the gas sufficiently to enter Williston's facilities. In addition, KNGG states that the dehydration plants located in the system perform dehydration required to meet Williston's quality requirements. Comment date: May 24, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.
