The statement issued by the General Steering Committee of this party, which was read by Bashkim Zeneli, considered the trial against Fatos Nano as a trumped-up trial that was finalized with an unjust decision. The statement said that this decision was a logical result of an antidemocratic mentality of the present power and a consequence of the total submission of the judicial power to the political one. Signed by members of the PS General Steering Committee, the statement considers Fatos Nano being locked in jail as an open wound in the body of Albania. The more it stays so, the statement ends, the worse it will be for Albania and the future of democracy. Further on, they passed onto questions posed to the trio Pellumbi-Dokle-Zeneli, who addressed the conference. Asked whether the Council of Europe representatives expressed interest on Nano's trial and the Nano question in general, Mr. Dokle answered that their interest was very special, but he did not prefer to give details of this stance maintained at a meeting that a group of socialist deputies held today with the Council of Europe envoys. Answering another question, Dokle said that we will follow the judicial course of the Nano question, such as the appeal and the supreme court's verdict, though according to him, they do not cherish any special hope regarding the latter. Asked whether Nano will remain the PS chairman and whether it is possible for him to lead the party from prison, the deputy chairman of the socialists, Servet Pellumbi, said that it is not a preoccupation whether Fatos Nano should be substituted or not. However, the trial showed that he has not besmirched his figure and the party he leads. That is why, Pellumbi continued, we see no reason to substitute him in the high post appointed by the congress. He continued saying that the PS has no rigid concept of management by only one person, but in a collegial way. According to Pellumbi, friends have taken it upon themselves to compensate for Nano's absence. Asked where the PS sees political elements in the Nano's trial, at a time when the indictment, summation, and verdict showed clearly the misappropriation of large sums and the falsification of official documents by Fatos Nano, Namik Dokle answered in a laconic way: The Nano question is a judicial attempt to eliminate the opposition. In continuation, Pellumbi, Dokle, and Zeneli answered a series of questions from the audience that were related to early elections, the new political steps that the PS will undertake after the conviction of its chairman, its stance toward Albania's acceptance into the Council of Europe, and the existence of factions in the PS. Regarding the latter, Pellumbi answered that this cannot happen in the PS, because this party has been formulated as a real democratic party with free opinions and different stances.
