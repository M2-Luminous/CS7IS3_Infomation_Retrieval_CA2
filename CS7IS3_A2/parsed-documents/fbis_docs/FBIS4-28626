"The U.N. Security Council is expected to begin debate on the nuclear issue beginning this week," Kim said. "I am sure our goal would be met satisfactorily step by step." While meeting with the visiting Japanese members of the Korea- Japan Parliament Union led by Kazuya Ishibashi, the president said the existing cooperative system among South Korea, the United States and Japan is essential to thwarting North Korea's nuclear program. Discussing his recent visit to Russia, Kim said Russian President Boris Yeltsin promised him not to sell weapons to North Korea. "The Korean war-related documents Russia handed to us during my visit contain so fresh information that some school text books on the Korean war would have to be rewritten," the president said.
