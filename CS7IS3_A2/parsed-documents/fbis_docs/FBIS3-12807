Western Intentions in Bosnia Doubted GOVERNMENT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS In its 24 February issue, the opposition AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH publishes on page 7 an approximately 1,500-word report by 'Ala' Tawfiq on human rights violations in Egypt, which the writer says "cannot be worse." Against pictures of a bearded Islamist behind bars and defendants being led to court, the report cites several human rights activists on torture of detainees, forced confessions, application of emergency laws, and degradation of man's humanity. Najad al-Bura'i, secretary general of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization, refutes government allegations that human rights groups defend criminals and ignore the rights of victims. He says: "We defend and urge protection of defendants as humans. We do not seek to prevent their trial or punishment, nor do we want to affect trials. We demand protection of defendants as human beings; we want to protect their human and legal rights." Asked whether Egypt observes human rights in a satisfactory manner, al-Bura'i -- according to the writer -- "was content with only a sarcastic smile." Muhsin 'Awad, assistant secretary of the Arab Human Rights Organization, notes violation of rights such as arrest and torture of workers on strike and the existence of laws conflicting with international conventions. He concludes: "I tell those who say that human rights in Egypt are observed well that they are illusioned, tendentious, and deviants from the truth." Dr. Ahmad al-Majdub, of the National Center for Criminal Research, urges fair trials in civilian courts, "not by a military judge who takes orders." Challenging official statements on respect for human rights, al-Majdub rhetorically asks: "Do attacking houses without strong incriminating evidence, referring cases to military courts, preventing defense lawyers from seeing documents, denying defendants the right to appear before civilian judges, and applying the emergency law for many years indicate respect for, or even presence of, human rights?" --In a separate 1,000-word column on the same page, the paper publishes "examples of torture victims," giving names and cases of a number of people who were tortured in police centers, some of whom died as a result. The paper cites official forensic medicine reports to substantiate its claims. --In a related 200-word news report on page 1, the paper says security campaigns in the southern governorate of Asyut have been seeing "brutal practices and serious excesses against women, old men, and children." The paper says raids on houses are carried out at random, with police breaking down doors and forcing young men to leave their houses and take off their clothes amid floods of harassment and oaths to force them to give information. The report says that in their raids, police forces arrest hundreds of innocent people and detain them in camps in Asyut without giving reasons. The police reportedly seize private passenger vehicles to use in their campaigns. The report cites a National Democratic Party official in Asyut as warning against the repercussions of these security campaigns, noting that they make people sympathetic to the Islamic Group's violence. "The barbaric police acts have only increased violence," the official is quoted as saying. --Another 100-word news report on page 1 says security forces raided a girls' high school last week to force veiled students to remove their veils despite a court decision allowing the practice. The report notes that the education minister had objected to the court decision and decided to appeal. RECOGNITION OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD URGED A 300-word article by Mahmud Yasir Ramadan, the newspaper's board chairman, urges that the Muslim Brotherhood be included in the national dialogue due to take place in April because the group, whether the government likes it or not, "is an influential political force" in the country. Noting that all opposition parties recognize the Muslim Brotherhood as a political force, not as a charity or service society, Ramadan says it is high time the ruling National Democratic Party did the same. "If we want the dialogue to succeed and effectively achieve results to save the homeland and its citizens from the negative consequences of extremist ideas, then we must accept moderate political forces, no matter what their inclinations," he writes. To support his call, Ramadan maintains that "failure to grant the Muslim Brotherhood official or semi- official recognition is the primary reason for the emergence of the political violence groups, which we call terrorist or extremist groups." ISLAMISTS WIN, CONTEST TRADE UNION ELECTIONS; WRITER COMMENTS On page 9, which is devoted to news of trade unions and professional associations, the paper reports a "major victory" for the Islamic trend in the election of the Agronomists Association. It says that for the first time in the history of the association, the Islamic trend won the majority of seats in the mid-term renewal elections in most of the country's governorates. The paper comments: "The big victory reflects the people's genuine longing for the Islamic solution." It claims that the victory was achieved despite administrative pressure from Agriculture Ministry officials and threats to supporters of the Islamic trend. --Other reports say that the Islamic trend will lead the Lawyers Association elections in Cairo and al-Jizah on 17 March, and will contest the Pharmacists mid-term renewal elections on 29 March. --An approximately 800-word article by Dr. Faruq 'Abd-al-Salam on page 4 comments on the Islamic trend's successes in trade union elections. He notes the failure of the government's effort to curb these successes when it introduced a professional associations election law "that was especially designed to combat the Muslim Brotherhood trend" under the pretext of serving the general interest. 'Abd-al-Salam argues: "Today, the Islamic trend sticks in the throat of the ruling regime. The Islamic trend is exposing the regime's claims of democracy, and the ruling party's claim that it enjoys a majority." "It is futile, ridiculous, and surprising," the writer adds, "for the ruling party to claim any majority of any kind when it cannot, no matter what influence and deviant methods it uses, win one-tenth of what the Islamists win in the professional associations." The writer sees irony in the fact that while the regime is claiming democracy, "the trend enjoying true majority in these sensitive positions is the only trend denied the right to form a political party." WRITER NOTES PLANS TO IMPROVE TIES WITH ISRAEL An approximately 1,500-word article by Fathi al-Mansuri on page 7 discusses prospects of Egypt's Middle East policies in the near future as concluded from articles published in government newspapers. The writer particularly summarizes or gives excerpts from two lengthy articles by AL-AHRAM Chief Editor Ibrahim Nafi' on 11 and 18 February calling for joint projects and warmer relations with Israel to serve Egypt's interests. The writer, making little comment, says such articles normally reflect official policy and pave the way for certain future measures. He says Nafi' articles stress that "what was being discussed as merely a possibility and speculation--normalization with Israel, removal of the boycott, and the Jewish entity playing its role, especially through economic Middle Eastern projects--is virtually becoming true." CONSPIRACY AGAINST ISLAMIC EDUCATION An approximately 1,000-word report by Hani al-Makkawi reviews what the writer terms a "conspiracy against education" to obliterate Islamic identity and entrench Western culture. The report also contains tables showing the percentage of Islamic material deleted from textbooks. It cites an al-Azhar educational official as saying that "under the current education minister, everything related to Islamic, Arab, and national eras has been deleted from textbooks." He gives examples of several deletions from Islamic and pan-Arab subjects to show that the purpose is "to open the door wide to the Americans and Jews." An Islamic history professor is also cited on attempts "to distort Islamic history under the pretext of modernization" of the educational curricula. AL-GHAZALI URGES ISLAMIC UPBRINGING A 2,500-word report by Yasir al-Dukkani on page 8 discusses a seminar on Islamic culture attended by Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali and several other Islamic scholars. The report cites Shaykh al-Ghazali as stressing the importance of Islamic upbringing to solve the Islamic nation's problems and stop its defeats. Al-Ghazali also stresses that Islam must not be viewed narrowly where marginal differences and minor details not affecting the essence of Islam are highlighted. Al-Ghazali is cited as saying: "I used to fight on two fronts: communism and stagnation, and today I am also fighting on two fronts, secularism and extremism." He adds: "This nation must return to its origins and first culture. Islam does not know nationalities or imported ideas. Anyone taking Islam or the return to it lightly is an apostate." WRITERS REFUTE SECULARISTS CLAIMS Two articles of about 1,500-words each on page 8 react to "slanders" by secularist writers and their accusations that the Islamic culture is closed-minded. The first article, by Yasir al-Rikani, cites some Islamist thinkers as defending Islamic thought, its openness to other cultures, and its call for using the mind. At the end of the second article, in which writer Dr. Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahman refutes a claim by secular writer Dr. Fu'ad Zakariya that the principles of Islam conflict with the causality theory, the writer says: "We know for sure that Western media will not stop their attacks on Muslims until they abandon Islam and embrace the infidel materialistic philosophy, thus losing their intellectual independence and distinguished identity and becoming submissive slaves to the West, like the Red Indians." WRITER URGES CONFORMITY BETWEEN LAWS AND SHARI'AH A 500-word article entitled "The Citizen and the Law" by Dr. al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Miliji on page 4 notes that citizens are living in fear most of the time because they wonder whether things they do violate some law or another. This is a result of much harassment and accusations, he says. "We hope that the laws, legislated in dark ages to oppress and frighten citizens into becoming tools in the hand of rulers, will be realigned," he writes. He adds: "There is hope that the laws will be put in harmony with our [Islamic] creed so that there will be no conflict between what we believe and what is imposed on us under the so-called laws." ISLAM AND THE FAMILY Page 3 features a report and two columns on the Muslim family and the importance of keeping it cohesive. Writers maintain that Islam protects women's rights and safeguards their status in society. The approximately 3,000-word report by Hisham Khadr laments the fact that Egyptian men are allowing their wives or daughters to travel abroad for work. It cites experts and specialists as saying that this helps in the collapse of families and other social problems. Contending that Islam does not allow women to travel abroad unaccompanied by a male member of the family, the writer wonders how men could possibly allow their wives, sisters, or daughters to travel abroad on their own: "Where is dignity, gallantry, manhood, religion?" he bitterly asks. WESTERN INTENTIONS IN BOSNIA DOUBTED A 500-word article by Muhammad Jamal 'Arafah on page 5 argues that the Western intervention in Bosnia is aimed at stopping the successes that the Muslim Bosnians have recently been making. The writer says the NATO threat basically aimed at preventing Muslims from using their main weapon--heavy artillery--while only collecting the Serbs' heavy weapons in certain places where they can be used against Muslims in other Bosnian cities. In another 600-word article on page 10, Chief Editor Mahmud 'Atiyah also casts doubts on Western intentions in Bosnia but mainly assails the position of Russia, which he says wanted to revive its lost glory "at the expense of the cheap Muslim blood." He also attacks the UN secretary general's position on Bosnia and urges Muslim peoples to give donations for their Muslim brothers in Bosnia.
