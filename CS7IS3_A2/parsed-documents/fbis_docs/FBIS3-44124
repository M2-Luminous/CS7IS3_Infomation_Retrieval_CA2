MEDIAFAX reports that the four NGO's come from the United Kingdom, the United States, Denmark, and Norway. Those organizations believe they have good reason to believe that some Unomoz soldiers are sexually exploiting children. Those organizations also noted that if such behavior is proven, then it is in violation of Article 34 of the Child Rights Convention. Those organizations have called on UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello to take measures to investigate the matter and act to protect the children.
