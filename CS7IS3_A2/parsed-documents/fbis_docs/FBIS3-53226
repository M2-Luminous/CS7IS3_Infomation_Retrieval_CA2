Most of the observers are unanimous on two points: --The United States is planning for the future and the current uncoordinated policies are part of that planning. --The Democrats as well as the people of the United States have made a mistake in electing Clinton as their President. In any case, in 1993 the United States passed through a period in which it experienced problems inherited from the Republicans, including the events in Somalia and the ambivalence toward Russia. However, in the Middle East the United States was successful in implementing a compromise more controversial and more treasonous than the Camp David accord. When 'Arafat--stripped of his gunbelt--shook hands with Rabin on the White House grounds, there were many who banged their heads against the wall in sheer fury. Some were not even Palestinians but had realized that the days of the Cold War had actually come to an end and most of the terms of that era had lost their true meaning. In the early days of 1994, the U.S. President will have two very important meetings: with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva and with Russian President Yeltsin in Moscow. The Geneva meeting is of vital importance to the United States. If Hafiz al-Asad joins the trend of compromise, the Gaza-Jericho accord will be insured. In addition, if Israel makes peace with Syria, it will be able to enter the Middle East markets and the longstanding dream of the Zionists will materialize. However, if Hafiz al-Asad insists on his former stance, the Gaza-Jericho accord will meet with the same fate as the Camp David accord. It will become the unsuccessful and isolated plan of an individual named 'Arafat who has neither legitimacy nor popularity. Clinton will also have to empathize with Yeltsin and at the same time beware of someone such as Zhirinovskiy as the trend of events in Russia seems to be uncontrollable and unpredictable. The Russians need billions of dollars of assistance and the United States cannot hope to have such capital returned, especially since it does not know what to do about the vacuum created by the disbanding of the Warsaw pact in Eastern Europe. Thus, it appears that the United States has difficult days ahead in 1994, especially since a united Europe is economically stronger than the United States. Even though it is not endowed with the U.S. political strength, it has very strong industries and considers rivalry in trade and commerce of greater importance than politics. The United States is aware that if it is hesitant in its approach toward countries such as the PRC and if it takes political considerations into account in its bilateral relations, Europe will immediately sign numerous agreements and will conquer the markets. All these circumstances are not completely subservient to the wishes, needs, and capabilities of the Democrat administration in the United States, as Washington's cohorts and competitors have gauged the conditions prevailing in the world and have unconditionally demanded their rights. Therefore, Clinton will not be able to see all his dreams come true in 1994.
