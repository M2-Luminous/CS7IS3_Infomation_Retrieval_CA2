The date and place of the interview are not given; Kebich speaks in Russian. The prime minister begins by responding to accusations by former legislative speaker Stanislaw Shushkevich and Popular Front Chairman Zyanon Paznyak who claim that the treaty "endangers the Republic's sovereignty." Popular Front deputies have sent a motion to the General Prosecutor's Office demanding that the signing of the treaty "receive a legal assessment." Kebich concentrates on the economic advantages of the treaty. According to him, Belarus will begin receiving duty-free products from Russia as of 1 May. Customs fees currently make up 30 to 40 percent of prices for products imported from Russia. Kebich points out that following the enactment of the treaty, Belarusian goods will be granted unhampered access to the Russian market, which will lower production costs. He says that "Belarusian goods will conquer the Russian market again and, as a final result, may bring about the reduction of retail prices." Kebich points out that the reaction of certain political groups in the Republic to the signing of the treaty came as no surprise: "I used to tell government officials and members of the Council of Ministers Presidium that the signing of the treaty would give rise to hysterical screams by those who would claim that we betrayed our sovereignty. I categorically reject these kinds of claims." Kebich adds that the first deputy general prosecutor had telephoned him and requested access to documents necessary for conducting an investigation initiated by the deputies' motion. Kebich underlines: "I know I did not violate the Constitution because I only signed that part of the treaty that lies within the government's competence. Article 5 was not signed by the National Bank because of existing reservations. Everything that refers to a change in the monetary system is under the bank's auspices and the bank voiced its reservations. Besides, I want to point out that the treaty has not come into effect because, just like any other treaty, it can be enacted only after all of its provisions are brought in line with our legislation. Thus, one way or another, there will be conflicts with some laws and we will have to amend them. I only did the Supreme Soviet's will. When the Supreme Soviet ratified the agreement on the introduction of monetary systems [as heard] government officials, including me, said that after the treaty is signed some legal acts will have to be amended and brought in line with the treaty. Every treaty in general -- why are we dwelling on the treaty with Russia? -- every treaty should be submitted to ratification by the legislature." Asked by the reporter what measures he would suggest to resolve the dispute if the legislature declines to ratify the treaty, Kebich says: "I would propose seeking advice from the people. There are various ways to do this -- an opinion poll, polls in separate territories, and other forms. This should not necessarily be a referendum. Please, do not say that Kebich suggested holding a referendum on the day of presidential elections. These are futile fabrications of all those who want to trip me as a candidate for president. One should not think that Kebich worked here alone -- the entire government did. I am not a naive person, and I know perfectly well that it would not be quite ethical and correct to tamper with the Constitution days after its adoption. That is why, having signed the treaty and having made it the groundwork for further negotiations, we did everything not to violate the Constitution. At the recent CIS summit, both I and Mechyslaw Hryb talked to Boris Yeltsin and asked him to do everything not to make us meddle in the Constitution." Commenting on the future effects of the treaty, Kebich says: "The exchange of 200,000 Belarusian rubles in cash and 1,000,000 in bank savings accounts is a one-time thing," and underlines the more permanent effects. He points out that even if the treaty fails to bring about a reduction in retail prices it would be a "tangible victory" if further increases in prices were prevented while wages continued to grow: "To increase wages, our enterprises have to start working. To do this they need a free flow of products. The treaty facilitates free shipment of every producer's goods to the Russian market. We are not working because we have been flooded with products that were once manufactured and could not be sold because of their high cost. Every citizen knows that he will work a full week now, his wage will be constantly growing, and his living standard improving. Through some reason, both journalists and our opponents decline to discuss this aspect of the treaty." Kebich insists that the issue has been artificially laded with political sense on the eve of presidential elections. The prime minister then answers questions regarding public transportation problems in Minsk and an increase in prices for postal services. Asked about his impressions from the CIS summit in Moscow, Kebich says: "I went to Moscow with a hope that a supranational economic committee would be created to step up economic integration among CIS states. However to my regret, this body's status was downgraded. It was formed within the framework of the Consultative Committee and of course it will be unable to perform the full scope of its functions. I am disappointed, but I do believe that the CIS should continue to function."
