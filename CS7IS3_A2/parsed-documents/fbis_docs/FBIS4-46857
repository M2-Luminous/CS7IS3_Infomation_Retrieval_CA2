Security Council Deputy Secretary Vladimir Rubanov Comments on the President's Edict `On Urgent Measures for the Implementation of the Russian Federation Federal Program To Reinforce the Fight Against Crime for 1994-1995'"] [Text] The edict ratifies the Federal Program for the Fight Against Crime and determines measures to implement it, and this is possibly the most important thing in the document. In itself, the edict, which was adopted at the level of the highest Russian executive power, determines the status of the federal program. Furthermore, it is important that the edict solves a financial problem. At the same time, specific instructions are being given to the government and responsibility for implementation is placed upon ministries and departments. And it must not be forgotten that this is an instruction from the president. It is also important that the Security Council -- one of the initiators and elaborators of the program -- is the structure which is effecting the implementation of the program. Despite the fact that the implementation of the program is calculated to take two years, specific measures to fight crime by means of what are known as organizational actions are already being outlined now. Furthermore, the program is a federal one and settles problems at federal level. But this does not mean that the organs of local authority should sit and wait for the results of its implementation. The president's edict provides a possibility of adopting regional programs for the fight against crime, taking into consideration criminal factors which occur in a particular region. Every component of the Federation has the possibility to reinforce measures aimed at the fight against crime at their own level and using their own resources. And the program shows how this can be done. Apart from the set of legislative acts adopted at State Duma level, the edict stipulates the adoption of measures at government level too. That is, questions of child neglect and crimes committed by minors can already be settled at the level of existing legislation. The edict makes it possible to maneuver the manpower and resources at the disposal of the executive organs of power, and settle a number of problems concerning the improvement of the material-technical conditions of the activity of the law enforcement organs and other structures involved in the fight against crime. Apart from that, these measures may be adopted in a practical and efficient way before legislative initiatives appear. And in this case, it is a question of involving citizens, the public, in the fight against crime -- in the formation of subunits which used to be called the people's patrol. The Foreign Ministry has been called upon to deal with the problems of the uncontrolled migration of the population, which has become more complex in recent years. The Foreign Ministry is to reinforce monitoring of these processes. The edict changes the situation which prevails in judicial-expert institutions, which are currently in a terrible state and are equal to academic scientific institutes in terms of payment. At the same time they work hand in hand with specialists from the "power" structures, which are in a different situation. All this could not fail to affect the cadres of these institutions: Specialists have moved to other structures of law enforcement organs or left altogether. The loss of specialists of that class could not fail to have an effect on the work of the law enforcement organs. This question has been resolved by the edict. A number of measures still require legalization by legislation. Thus, forgery is currently rife. This has basically occurred because of the emergence of color photocopiers. The edict envisages the strict monitoring of this type of duplicating machinery. Ministries and departments were instructed to prepare a number of legislative acts to be published in this federal program. In particular, instructions were also given on the questions on which the organs of internal affairs themselves deemed it necessary to make amendments to existing legislation. They have drawn up their proposals, which have been reflected in the edict. The president's edict also makes it possible for appeals to be made to the legislative power in a legally correct form to legalize the rights which the organs of internal affairs need in order to intensify the fight against crime. The fact that the subunits and special troops involved in the fight against crime have increased by 52,000 men should be noted as an important thing in the edict. As we know, the Army is only used to repel an enemy, but we also know that a lot of situations have arisen in the past few years and are still arising when military support and special troops are needed. The edict also envisages measures to strengthen security at ports, stations, and airports. Special subunits are now being created which will accompany trains, both on suburban and interurban routes; this has been brought about by the increasing danger on railroads. The customs services have not been forgotten either. Within the framework of the conversion program, installations, military camps, and resources (which do not require a burden on the budget) which are being freed up by military units are being transferred to the structures involved in the fight against crime. These are just some of the important aspects which it will be possible to settle thanks to the issuing of this edict.
