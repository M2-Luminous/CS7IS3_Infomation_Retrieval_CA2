Business leaders say the territory will benefit as Vietnam enters a new era of opportunity and prosperity. Hong Kong is already the second-biggest investor in Vietnam, while many U.S. and other foreign firms investing there will use Hong Kong as a springboard. U.S. President Bill Clinton announced the end of the embargo yesterday. It was imposed in 1975 when U.S.-backed South Vietnam fell to the communist North. Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey said the lifting of the embargo would show the 27,000 Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong that "their future lies in Vietnam, not in a detention camp in Hong Kong. It will help get home the message that the Vietnam they left perhaps four, five years ago is different to the Vietnam today," he said. Mr. Asprey said he expected more Vietnamese to volunteer to go home, but cautioned it could still take two years before all were repatriated. Since 1988, Hong Kong has given refugee status to only the 15 percent who could prove a justified fear of persecution. The rest are kept in closed camps and given cash incentives to go home. More than 41,000 boat people have volunteered to return home from Hong Kong. Nearly 13,000 more have been forcibly repatriated. Meanwhile, Hong Kong traders were advised to move fast as the country opened up. Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), executive director Francis Lo said: "Now is the time for Hong Kong companies to position themselves in that market so they can be ready to take full advantage of the lifting of the embargo." He said consumer products were especially in demand. Mr. Lo said it would mean a new and important era of opportunity and prosperity in Vietnam. Despite the fact competition was bound to become more intense, Mr. Lo said the outlook for Hong Kong companies was encouraging. He stressed that the territory must move quickly in Vietnam to stay ahead of competitors from other Asian countries. Hong Kong is Vietnam's biggest source of investment after Taiwan, after rising 51 percent to $296.4 million in 1992. Hong Kong's domestic exports to Vietnam increased another 14 percent in the first 11 months of 1993 to reach $319.8 million. The Vietnamese trade representative in Hong Kong, Dao Tran Nhan, said Hong Kong would benefit from an end to the embargo because many American firms already had their regional headquarters here. He said the Hanoi government was drafting laws to protect foreign investors. Foreign companies would use Hong Kong as a springboard, though some would invest directly, Mr. Nhan said. Mr. Nhan also said Hong Kong entrepreneurs who had already invested in Vietnam would not lose out because of competition from the Americans. He said most Hong Kong investments were in the tourism industry. The Hanoi government hailed the decision yesterday and vowed to keep cooperating with efforts to account for Americans missing in action (MIA) from the war. Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai also said Vietnam accepted Mr. Clinton's proposal that the two countries exchange liaison offices, but stressed that Hanoi still sought full diplomatic relations with Washington. He said the opening of liaison offices should come soon, but he would not guess how long it would take to normalize diplomatic relations. "That depends on the goodwill of the two sides," he said, adding that Vietnam wanted "normalization without preconditions". But Mr. Mai bristled at Mr. Clinton's comment that his decision was not irreversible, saying that trade embargoes violated international law and so did threats to reimpose them. He would not be drawn on his personal reaction to the news: "I think the Vietnam issue is a very emotional one in the United States. We, the Vietnamese, are less emotional about it."
