The announcement was made at his meeting with former U.S. President Richard Nixon who is in Moscow on a private visit. Shokhin said that the adoption of the budget is a key element in the activity of the government, stressing that the government's "moral status will depend" on the results of the debates on the draft budget in the State Duma. Shokhin noted that monthly inflation in February was below ten per cent, the record low in the last 2.5 years. "We promised to the IMF to reach this level only by the end of the year," Shokhin said.
