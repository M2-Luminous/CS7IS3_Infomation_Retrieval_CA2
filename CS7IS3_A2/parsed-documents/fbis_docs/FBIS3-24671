Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-22FEB94-DPRK-U.S.-IAEA Pyongyang Ties Inspections to U.S. Action on Exercise, Talks SUMMARY In the clearest expression to date of its readiness to allow resumption of international inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, Pyongyang has indicated that an "early inspection" by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be realized once Washington announces cancellation of Team Spirit and the date for reconvening DPRK-U.S. high-level talks. END SUMMARY Using an authoritative Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on 21 February, Pyongyang indirectly confirmed earlier Western reporting of an IAEA-North Korean agreement on the imminent resumption of nuclear inspections. The statement referred to an unspecified "agreement between us and the agency" and acknowledged that Pyongyang is in "the action phase" of implementing that agreement (Pyongyang radio, 21 February). The statement, made ostensibly in an answer to a question by a KCNA reporter, made a series of assertions: + It again claimed that Washington and the IAEA have redefined the scope of nuclear inspections they are demanding and that the only remaining issue now standing in the way of carrying out the agreement with the IAEA is the "simultaneous" action that the spokesman claimed Washington had previously agreed to take. + It maintained that a DPRK-U.S. agreement reached at a bilateral contact in New York on 29 December specifies a U.S. declaration of the discontinuation of the Team Spirit joint ROK-U.S. maneuvers and a joint DPRK-U.S. announcement of the date for the next round of high-level bilateral talks. The statement also included a clear plea to avoid further complications in resolving the nuclear inspection issue, warning that if Washington "again" sets "unjustifiable conditions" for cancelling Team Spirit or otherwise "applies pressure," the DPRK- IAEA agreement cannot be implemented. The present "hard-won" opportunity will be lost, the statement went on, and there will not be "another opportunity" to reach a compromise solution. Inter-Korean Talks Indicating that Pyongyang is also ready to fulfill the other prerequisite for the resumption of DPRK-U.S. talks, the 21 February statement for the first time claimed that Pyongyang had also agreed at the 29 December meeting to "affirmatively examine" any South Korean proposal for exchanging special envoys. In another indication that Pyongyang is moving toward resumption of inter-Korean dialogue, Pyongyang on 18 February issued a Foreign Ministry memorandum--a vehicle Pyongyang sometimes uses to map out its initial negotiating posture--that purported to document South Korea's "clandestine program" to develop "nuclear weapons" (18 February). Serving notice that there will be hard bargaining ahead, the memorandum stressed that South Korea's heavy water reactors should be replaced by ones based on light water technology. Earlier, the North had declared its intention to replace its graphite- moderated reactors with light-water reactors. Implications The 21 February statement is the strongest indication to date of North Korean readiness to take major steps toward resolving the nuclear issue. However, in warning that there may not be "another opportunity" for reaching a compromise solution, the statement may be implicitly signaling that pragmatists in the North Korean leadership are under pressure to deliver tangible proof of Washington's good faith.
