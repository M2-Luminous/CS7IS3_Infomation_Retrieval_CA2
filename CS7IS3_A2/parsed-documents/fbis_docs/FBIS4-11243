Roosen outlined what he thinks should be done to extricate the financial sector from its current difficulties. [Begin recording] [Roosen] I believe that a current of opinion is forming on the crisis and that people are very willing to generate ideas and solutions to confront the emergency. Such efforts should result in a program that can be announced to the country in the near future. [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] [Roosen] I presume the economy minister will have that responsibility. [Reporter] But there has to be a way to get the financial sector out of its current crisis based on [words indistinct]? [Roosen] Based precisely on that, of course. [Reporter] Based on what? [Roosen] Based on the fact that the banks' account portfolios will suffer progressive deterioration with the current high interest rates. I believe that 1) the financial sector totally agrees that this is the situation; 2) the intermediate margins between the active and passive rates are too high and have to be reduced so that an appropriate remuneration for the activity can be obtained; 3) the banks, which have been financially aided, require major surgery and a reorganization program that will allow their privatization as soon as possible; and 4) the financial aid mechanism that is [word indistinct] directly to the banks and is managed more efficiently must be reformed because those banks end up putting their money in zero coupons because they cannot find clients. A solution for survival has to be found to reverse the cycle that has been established. Those are the four points on which we have to reach a consensus in the coming days to effectively stop the financial crisis, return the country to financial order, and restore its payment system. We must see economic growth more clearly. Thus, government policies regarding economic growth also have to be established. [end recording]
