It is not to say that any other government would have done better or anything different given the political illiteracy of most of the political parties about the fundamentals of India and its economy and its serious incompatibility with the Western assumptions. Added to this is the unfortunate drift in the debate in India on the Dunkel formulation. The real issue is not whether the Dunkel Treaty is good or bad for India--there is no doubt that it is bad. It is not just an issue of India vs the rest or producers vs consumers, as some would like us to believe. It is far deeper and fundamental. It raises a far reaching question: whether all that is Western is to be accepted as the modern, and whether the Western view of life should have universal application and therefore acceptance. The Dunkel Regime is the continuation of the Western assumptions about the superiority of its thoughts, view of life-systems and institutions. It aims at homogenisation of the world based on Western experience. The experience of 10 per cent is being experimented on the rest by Dunkel. The Indian debate so far on Dunkel has missed precisely this point. It is the failure of intellectuals and intellectualism in India. On the practical side, the Dunkel Regime seeks to instal a world government in trade, technology and services with its attendant bureaucracy and bureaucratisation. A world government in trade without a world currency, but dependent on the currencies of Group 7 nations, will be at the speculators' mercy. The Dunkel Regime is guaranteed to fail as any global level hegemony is bound to whether powered by a single nation, or a cartel of them or a multilateral system. The Indian government and the political parties have failed to explore the possibility of bilateral arrangements as an alternative for the multilateral Dunkel Regime where, given the players and deciders, India was genuinely a nobody and was rightly treated as such. So because of incompetence, the Indian political system has imposed the Dunkel Regime on India. The Dunkel Regime castrates the government of India but cannot bind the people of India. The Dunkel Regime can be turned into a blessing in disguise. The people of India can be awakened to realise a real alternative lifestyle which is their true inheritance. For instance, Yoga, Ayurveda and Herbs can substantially dislodge antibiotics; [word missing] can keep away stress, heart breaks and psychiatrists. By social initiative we can revive our independent mind which will blend the modern with the traditional and discriminate between what we need from what the West offers. The nation needs to revive this swadeshi approach which will be symbolically a resistance against Colgates, Cokes and Pepsies and substantially a re-instatement of a native alternative as the substance and the Western as the additive, instead of the Western as the substance and the native an additive.
