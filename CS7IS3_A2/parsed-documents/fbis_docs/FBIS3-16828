"I spent approximately a week in Russia -- everyone knows that after the elections, its position with regard to Ukraine and other neighbors became more tough and aggressive," Nixon said. "I do not mean that the majority of the leaders in Russia now support the position of Zhirinovskiy and others, but in the future, there could certainly be precedents when the [United] States will have to choose whether to look to Russia or Ukraine. ``Here I will express my personal opinion: Both the United States and the Ukrainian people must be interested in Russia's economic and political progress. If economic conditions improve in Russia, this will mean a worsening of the positions of extremist forces such as Zhirinovskiy, who pursues an aggressive policy toward Ukraine. Russia is a great state, but it is not in its best interest to bite off more than it can chew: It has quite enough domestic problems, and I consider economic imperialism just as unacceptable as military imperialism." Leonid Kravchuk pointed out that Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has twice violated Ukrainian legislation with his edict on holding a referendum. "It is not a normal democratic and peaceful process to start one's activity by violating the law and the constitution," Kravchuk said. "If President Meshkov resorts to a confrontation, this will be on his conscience." Richard Nixon added that he considers the 19th-century Crimean War the most stupid war in history. One such war is quite sufficient.
