The whole proceedings of the two uncomplicated cases involving petty payoffs -- from being indicted to being pronounced innocent, from a pronouncement of not guilty to conviction -- may be described as a process of rigorous law enforcement whereby the sanctity of the law was safeguarded. In addition to throwing a sidelight on the difficulty and complexity involved in law enforcement, the two cases also reflect a problem in regard to law enforcement that must never be overlooked; that is, laws are still being implemented sluggishly. Both cases -- the first involving the court reversing its erroneous ruling following an appeal filed by the procuratorate; the second involving the procuratorate amending a mistake of its own -- reflect the spirit of strict law enforcement. Being faithful to the law, to the facts, and to the people is a principle to be adhered to by all judicial organs and personnel. This principle is manifested only through scrupulous enforcement of the law; only when this is done can they win the people's confidence and be worthy of the honorable title of the people's judicial organs. Strict enforcement of law requires administering fitting punishment in strict accordance with the criminal law and the supplementary provisions adopted by the National People's Congress; it also requires that criminal proceedings be carried out correctly in strict accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law. Neither of the two is dispensable. Handling cases in strict accordance with provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law is a legal principle to be closely observed by judicial organs. If cases are not handled in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law or punishment is not administered in accordance with the criminal law, then we will not be able to assert the sanctity of law enforcement and we are liable to render unjust verdicts. In both cases, the defendants were pronounced not guilty on the grounds that they both refused to admit guilt, in obvious violation of Article 35 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which stipulates that emphasis should be placed on reliable evidence of the facts of a crime. Such erroneous judgments must be reversed according to law. What is thought-provoking about the cases is that while the facts of the crimes remained unchanged, Wei Guofan (defendant in one of the cases) was pronounced not guilty in disregard of the procedures prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Law; in the second case, a decision that placed the interests of a locality or a department above state laws was made, whereby Yan Changchun -- the defendant -- was absolved of any guilt and the case was publicized in the press. It is indeed worrisome and puzzling. As China's legal system is being amplified and refined day by day, law-breakers should not entertain the idea that they can get away with their crimes. The only way out for them is to admit guilt, submit themselves to the law, sincerely amend their ways, and turn over a new leaf. To strictly enforce the law, we must correctly understand the scientific implications of "conducive to three causes." When looked upon from the partial interests of a locality or department, some of the cases are not harmful at all; they are rather beneficial. An offense, if it is not judged by state laws but rather judged from the viewpoint of local or departmental protectionism, would not be viewed as an offense but a merit. When looked upon from the viewpoint of national interests and from the efforts to improve party workstyle and build honest government, we can see that such conduct hurts the interests of other regions or sectors, corrupts the ranks of cadres, and severely tarnishes the image of the party and government. When viewed from the angle of facilitating the development of the national economy and consolidating the government of the people's democratic dictatorship in China, it would become clear that the true meaning of "conducive to three causes" lies in strict enforcement of state laws and scrupulous prosecution of such cases. In the ongoing anticorruption struggle, judicial organs are dutybound to strictly enforce the law and relentlessly prosecute crimes. The people's procuratorates must give full rein to their role in supervising law enforcement, while the people's courts must pay more attention to supervising its administration of justice -- this is the only way to ensure correct law enforcement and safeguard the authority and sanctity of the law. In particular, we must uphold the principle that every wrong should be righted. Amendment should be made either when an innocent person is wrongly convicted or a guilty party is mistakenly acquitted. This would directly reflect the CPC Central Committee's resolve to crack down on corruption and have a direct impact in terms of the people's confidence in the anticorruption struggle. Whatever the cases, the judicial organs must take facts as the basis and law as the criterion, administer justice fairly and impartially, right every wrong that is made, and see to it that every case they have handled can stand the test of history. When this is done, they will be able to win the people's confidence, arouse the people's fervor for fighting corruption, and fully implement the CPC Central Committee's anticorruption plans.
