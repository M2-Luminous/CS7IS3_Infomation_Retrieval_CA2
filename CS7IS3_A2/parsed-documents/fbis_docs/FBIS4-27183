Security Council [UNSC] "strongly" urging North Korea to suspend the unmonitored exchange of spent fuel rods at a 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon. "The Japanese Government supports the contents of this statement by the president of the Security Council," said a Foreign Ministry statement read by deputy spokesman Kishichiro Amae. Japan also expresses concern "about the course of events and strongly urges North Korea to immediately stop this operation and make consultations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," Amae said. The Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted at an unofficial emergency session the presidential statement warning "further Security Council consideration" should North Korea continue to bar the IAEA from examining the discharged rods. The 15-member council, acting at the request of the United States after receiving a letter by U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus- Ghali from IAEA chief Hans Blix, said it is "gravely concerned" about the IAEA's assessment. It did not, however, directly refer to sanctions. Amae said Japan is making "various types of diplomatic efforts," such as urging related countries, including the U.S., South Korea and China, to exert their influence in dissuading North Korea from going nuclear. But he declined to elaborate.
