Nery Barrios of UASP said that "without a doubt, we want the people to judge and issue their own opinions, but there are certain facts causing us to fear possible data manipulation [parcializacion] in violation of the law, for example, electoral fraud. Because of this, we reaffirm our stand of urging the population to abstain from participating in the 30 January referendum," Barrios added. CD Representative Ricardo Cifuentes yesterday said that "the referendum only promotes permanent corruption and fraud by the designated President Ramiro De Leon. The Computation Department of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) was eliminated and a private company was hired for the elections. This leads us to think that there will be fraud and irregularities in the 30 January referendum," Cifuentes added. Government Refutes the Claims President Ramiro De Leon criticized the position of popular groups for confusing the general public. "There is no fraud and will be no fraud in the 30 January referendum," De Leon added. The leader said that the people should vote and participate and not allow others to interfere with their constitutional right. He pointed out that he is urging people to vote yes because he thinks that this constitutes the legal solution to the crisis that has been facing the country's institutions since 25 May 1993.
