In an interview with THE GUARDIAN, Mr Sutherland said that the package cemented the extension of the market economy and would prevent the interests of developing countries from being marginalised. Claiming that there would only be winners from the opening up of trade, he said: "It's notable that the strongest proponents of the multilateral system have been the developing countries, and the worst elements of protectionism have been in the developed world." Mr Sutherland said that he understood the sense of grievance held by many developing countries who felt that the fate of the Uruguay Round had been determined in Washington and Brussels. He was critical of the attempts by the United States and France to raise the question of labour rights in the last few weeks. "Profound anxiety has been expressed by a large number of developing countries about this particular issue," he said. Mr Sutherland said that no preparatory work had been completed on introducing social clauses into the GATT agreement, and that there was widespread fear among the poorer nations that "protectionism lurked behind it." The GATT director general, who was appointed last summer to rescue the talks from potential collapse, said he believed that the eighth and most bitterly divisive of the GATT rounds would be the last. Future negotiations would be conducted on an issue-by-issue basis by the new World Trade Organisation [WTO], even though Mr Sutherland is unlikely still to be at the helm. "I do not see a long-term career as an international civil servant," he said. He brushed aside fears that the poorer nations, particularly in Africa, would lose out as a result of the deal. "There are no losers and the biggest winners will be those who would be in danger of being marginalised." Like Sir Leon Brittan, the chief European Union [EU] negotiator, Mr Sutherland considered that one of the great achievements of the round had been the acceptance by the United States that trade disputes should be settled through the WTO rather than unilaterally imposing sanctions via America's Super 301 powers. Sir Leon, in a separate interview, said Washington realised that the WTO would "severely constrain the way it can have recourse to Super 301." He said: "It could only be used in those circumstances that are not convered by the Uruguay Round, and there are not many of those." The European Commission vice president, widely praised for his deft handling of the bilateral talks with the United States, said that Brussels was pleased with the final package. "We have secured a major reduction in tariffs reinforced intellectual property rights, and created the WTO, which has substituted the rule of law for the law of the jungle," he said. "In addition, we have secured a deal on agriculture that reinforces reform of the common agricultural policy but is still something everybody could live with." Sir Leon remains hopeful that the kudos gained from helping to broker the GATT deal will win him support when the EU heads of state choose a successor to Jacques Delors in June. To that extent he has been trying to woo friends in all parts of the Union. He has been providing limited backing for the French over the social clauses, yet accused Paris of "cutting off its nose to spite its face" when it threatened to refuse to sign the lucrative deal with the United States on public procurement unless the Germans dropped its case at the European Court over restrictions on importing bananas. He also made it clear that the UK should understand the determination among its EU partners to press ahead with monetary union, adding that a single currency was still a possibility for a "critical mass" of countries by 1999. Unlike Mr Sutherland, who said: "I have no ambition and nor am I a candidate for any other position," Sir Leon said that he wanted the top job in Brussels. He said that he had no regrets about leaving British domestic politics. "At the time, I was uncertain about whether to take the job (as a European commissioner). Now it's difficult to imagine I could have been," he said.
