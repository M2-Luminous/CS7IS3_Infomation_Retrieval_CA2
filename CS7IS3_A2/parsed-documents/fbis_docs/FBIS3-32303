This was Pizarro's reaction to a report from the Libertad Institute. [Begin recording] [Reporter Marcela Torrejon] Jorge Pizarro, deputy for the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, has stated that the Libertad Institute's claim that relations between Chile and Peru are risky is unreasonable. The Institute, which has ties with the opposition National Renewal Party, released a document stating that Chilean-Peruvian relations were risky because the Peruvian Constituent Congress does not want to ratify the Lima Convention which the Aylwin and Fujimori administrations had signed to resolve certain matters that the 1929 peace and friendship treaty had left pending. Deputy Pizarro believes that the relations between Peru and Chile are good and pose no political or commercial risks. He emphasized certain landmarks in the process of rapprochement, such as Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's visit to Chile and the fact that he will also attend President-elect Eduardo Frei's inauguration in March. Pizarro acknowledged that after the plebiscite and in light of the approaching elections, the discussion of the Lima Convention has awakened nationalistic predjudices which deserve respect because in Chile too there are people who have this kind of prejudice. He stressed, however, that in Chile this issue has always been left in the hands of the state. [Pizarro] The important thing is to strengthen the role of the state in setting the course for Chile's foreign policy toward its neighbors. In this context the report of the Libertad Institute could be misinterpreted. [Torrejon] Deputy Pizarro explained that the Chilean Congress believes that the Lima Convention should be ratified. This is not the case with the Peruvian Constituent Congress, where the majority opposes the ratification of the convention. [Pizarro] We do not believe that it is appropriate for Congress, be it Peruvian or Chilean, to revise or amend an agreement which has already been signed by the foreign ministers of both countries. Thus, I disagree with the proposal of Mr. Victor Joy Way, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Peruvian Constituent Congress, because I feel that he has taken the wrong approach to the matter which is delaying ratification of the agreement, and is sending signals that contradict President Fujimori's stated will to get the convention approved. [Torrejon] According to Deputy Pizarro, the explanations wielded by the Peruvian Constituent Congress in its attempt to deny approval for the convention which the Aylwin and Fujimori administrations have already signed are improper.
