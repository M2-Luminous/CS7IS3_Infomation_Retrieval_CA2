FR940217-1-00082 FR940217-1-00014 A violation of these provisions by a third-party servicer would constitute grounds for the termination of the participation of an institution under whose contract the servicer committed the violation, if the institution knew or should have known of the causes for suspension or debarment. The violation, of course, would also constitute grounds for the termination of the eligibility of the servicer to administer any aspect of the institution's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary invites comment on how to apply this requirement to owners and persons holding critical management positions at an institution or servicer. In the final regulations, the Secretary may modify these proposed regulations to address specifically their application to those persons. These changes are needed to establish appropriate safeguards to protect the Title IV, HEA programs when serious questions are raised about the honesty and lawfulness of the conduct of an institution's or servicer's owners, officers, employees, associates, or contracted help whose duties involve the administration of or influence over the Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary holds an institution to the highest standard of care and diligence required of a fiduciary. The use of a third-party servicer confers that same standard on the servicer. However, the Secretary wishes to emphasize that the use of a third-party servicer does not in any way reduce the institution's responsibility to ensure compliance with Title IV, HEA program requirements. The Secretary also proposes technical changes to this section to remove provisions governing lender participation in the FFEL programs that belong in 34 CFR part 682 and to incorporate provisions in 34 CFR part 682 concerning the consequences of a debarment or suspension on lender participation. Section 668.83␣Emergency action. The Secretary proposes to provide that an emergency action may be imposed on an institution or third-party servicer if the initiating official receives reliable information that a third-party servicer, acting under contract with the institution, is violating a Title IV, HEA program requirement. In an emergency action proceeding against a servicer, the official would also be required to notify each institution that contracts with the servicer of the emergency action. The Secretary believes that an institution that contracts with a third-party servicer should be kept informed of any administrative actions taken by the Department of Education against that servicer that might affect the administration of the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. To the examples of violations that may lead to an emergency action, the Secretary proposes to add a third-party servicer's lack of administrative ability to make appropriate refunds if students do not complete educational programs or periods of enrollment. Any of these violations would be grounds for emergency action against a third-party servicer under this subpart. However, because an institution is always responsible for the actions of the institution's servicers, the Secretary believes that emergency action against the institution also may be necessary to prevent the likely loss of Title IV, HEA program funds. The Secretary also proposes to include fraud committed by an institution or a third-party servicer as a specific example of a possible basis for emergency action. The Secretary proposes to provide an additional list of specific examples of fraud to emphasize the seriousness of these violations. Emergency actions based upon fraud are fully appropriate under existing regulations. The examples involve falsification of documents related to the Title IV, HEA programs, including_ (1) Documents pertaining to a student's eligibility; (2) Documents submitted to the Department of Education, a guaranty agency, an independent auditor, a third-party servicer, or an institution by a third-party servicer; (3) Documents pertaining to an institution's legal authorization to provide postsecondary education or to the accreditation or preaccreditation of the institution, the institution's educational programs, or the institution's additional campuses; and (4) Documents pertaining to a servicer's loan collection activities (for example, due diligence activities), including activities that are not specifically required by the HEA or applicable program regulations. Sections 668.84␣Fine proceedings, 668.85 Suspension proceedings, and 668.86␣Limitation or termination proceedings. The Secretary proposes to include, as a specific basis for any of these proceedings against an institution or a third-party servicer, a substantial misrepresentation of the institution's educational program, financial charges, or employability of the institution's graduates by an institution or servicer under contract with an institution, as applicable. The Secretary believes that substantial misrepresentation represents a clear indication of a deliberate intent to misuse Title IV, HEA program funds by deceptively encouraging enrollment, thus abusing the purpose of Title IV, HEA program funds, which is to provide equal access to a quality education for recipients of these funds. The Secretary is proposing to employ the full range of sanctions at the Secretary's disposal against this possible misrepresentation to preserve the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs and to ensure the accountability of those who administer the programs. The Secretary proposes to amend these sections to provide for the imposition of a fine against an institution or third-party servicer or the limitation, suspension, or termination of the institution's participation or the servicer's eligibility to contract with an institution to administer any aspect of that institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs if the institution's servicer, acting under contract with the institution, violates a Title IV, HEA program requirement. Under §§668.84, 668.85 and 668.86, if the Secretary begins a fine, suspension, limitation, or termination proceeding against a third-party servicer, the Secretary may also begin a fine, limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding against any institution under whose contract a third-party commits a violation. These technical changes are needed to conform to the changes proposed to the scope of this subpart.
