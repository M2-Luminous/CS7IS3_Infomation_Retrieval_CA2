Instead of burning fires in the streets, the people in the southeast preferred to mark Nevruz by staying at home. One of the rare Nevruz fires in Diyarbakir was lighted by Unal Erkan, the regional governor. Our correspondent Metin Corabatir reports on Nevruz celebrations in southeastern Anatolia. [Begin Corabatir recording] The Nevruz holiday is being (?marked) without incident but also (?without enthusiasm) [brief break in transmission]. At present, the smoke from Nevruz fires is rising in various quarters of the city. The first Nevruz fires in Diyarbakir were lit in the outlying quarters in the morning. The people were again caught in the middle as the government encouraged this year's Nevruz celebrations under specific conditions and the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] called on the people to mark it in their homes. That the people were caught in the middle was clear from the fact that instead of dancing around the few fires, the people closed their shops and stayed at home. Unal Erkan exerted enormous effort to put his own cosmetic touch on Nevruz celebrations in Diyarbakir, where two PKK militants were killed in a morning attack on a hideout. He first visited the newspapers and informed them that the holiday was passing peacefully and without incident throughout the region. He then visited the central market accompanied by a large group of reporters. He shook hands and listened to people's problems. He then left for Sehitlik Street, which he described as his own street, and distributed candies to hundreds of children who surrounded him. He danced with them. The fire lighted by Erkan was one of the rare city fires around which people danced. [end recording]
