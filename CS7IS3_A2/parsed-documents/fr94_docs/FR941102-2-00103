FR941102-2-00103 FR941102-2-00071 4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or a majority of its disinterested Trustee, that a material irreconcilable conflict exists, the relevant insurance companies shall, at their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable (as determined by a majority of the disinterested trustees), take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material conflict, up to and including: (1) Withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the separate accounts from the Fund or any portfolio and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium, including another portfolio of the Fund, or submitting the question whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners and as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (i.e., annuity contract owners, life insurance contract owners, or variable contract owners of one or more participating insurance companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contract owners the option of making such a change; and (2) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of an insurer's decision to disregard contract owner voting instructions and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the insurer may be required, at the Fund's election, to withdraw its separate account's investment in the fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of an irreconcilable material conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their agreements governing participation in the Fund. For purposes of this condition 4, a majority of the disinterested members of the Board shall determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any irreconcilable material conflicts, but in no event will the Fund or InterCapital be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. No participating insurance company shall be required by this condition 4 to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if an offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of contract owners materially adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict. 5. The Board's determination of the existence of an irreconcilable material conflict and its implications shall be made known promptly to all participating insurance companies.
