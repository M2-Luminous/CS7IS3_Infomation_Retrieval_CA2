"Early in the morning, these officials return to their offices in Bujumbura to perform their duties", the ZAIRE NEWS AGENCY (AZAP) correspondent reported from Uvira Friday [17 June]. The influx of Burundian refugees to the small town near Lake Tanganyika has created an acute shortage of accommodation. Hotels of the area are overbooked, said the local correspondent of AZAP who also spoke of insecurity problems arising from the presence of the top Burundi Government officials in Uvira. Reports indicate that up to 10,000 Rwandan refugees and 70,000 from Burundi have flocked into South Kivu so far.
