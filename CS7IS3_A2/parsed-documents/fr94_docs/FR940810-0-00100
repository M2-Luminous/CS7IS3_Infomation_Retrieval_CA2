FR940810-0-00100 FR940810-0-00021 Some other studies of floor removals entered into the record showed higher exposure levels of ``structures'' as detected by TEM, and defined by EPA. As noted above, counts of structures are not comparable to fiber counts, and OSHA believes that most ``structure'' counts result in significantly higher fiber counts than would be counted by PCM. A related issue is whether flooring material should be analyzed by TEM, rather than by PCM. As pointed out by BCTD and other participants, floor tile tends to generate smaller fibers which often cannot be detected under PCM; and TEM detects these shorter asbestos fibers (and the thinner asbestos fibers, which PCM cannot distinguish [Ex. 143, p. 147 citing Tr. 3468; Tr 3751, Tr. 3279, Tr. 473&hyph;474]. In the 1986 rulemaking OSHA considered the issue of the relative toxicity of short asbestos fibers, which were not required to be counted under the OSHA definition of ``fiber.'' Then, the Agency stated that ``*␣*␣* animal studies *␣*␣* in particular the recent work by Dr. Davis, point to a clear relationship between fiber dimension and disease potential. The finding in these studies that thin fibers, (having an aspect ratio of at least 3:1) greater than 5 μm in length are associated with elevated incidence of cancer and lung fibrosis is also consistent with current knowledge regarding lung clearance mechanisms, i.e., that shorter fibers are easily phagocytized and removed from lung tissue'' (51 FR at 22613). Dosages used in OSHA's risk assessment extrapolated from studies of human exposure, attempted to transform or reconstruct fiber counts to correlate with fiber counts using current conventions of counting fibers only longer than 5 μm, using PCM. Similar to the conclusions reached by OSHA in the preamble to its 1986 asbestos rule, the HEI report of 1991 found that ``experimental results described in this review indicate that short fiber preparations have a lower toxicity than long fiber preparations, but do not exclude their contribution to the lesions caused by the smaller number of long fibers in the tail of the fiber length distribution *␣*␣* individual fibers shorter than approximately 5 μm appear to possess much less toxicity than those longer than 5 μm'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 6&hyph;76). The HEI Report also noted that the exposure-response relationship reported in the literature which served as the basis for estimation of risk had exposure expressed in terms of fibers greater than 5 μm in length ( Ex. 1&hyph;344). These aspects of OSHA's risk assessment, and counting protocols were not challenged in the litigation following the 1986 rules, therefore were not remanded to OSHA for reconsideration in the Court of Appeal's 1988 decision. The only study submitted in its entirety, (see Freed et al, Ex. 143 at Att. B), is of limited relevance; it is a case study, which was undertaken to show that asbestos fiber may produce DIP (desquamative interstitial pneumonia) as well as asbestosis. The authors note that ``although over 90% of the 820 million fibers of wet lung tissue were 3 μm or less in length, sufficient numbers of fibers greater than 5 μm in length were present, which could also account for the tissue response'' (Ex. 143, Att B at 332). Resolution of whether short or long fibers are counted is not necessary for the purposes of this revised standard, because OSHA finds that work practices and controls are needed when working on floors regardless of the measurement method used. OSHA does not change its conclusion and retains the provisions that airborne asbestos measurements taken during flooring operations shall use the same methodology as in the 1986 standard.
