FR940711-0-00069 FR940711-0-00019 Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to solicit the written concurrence of the Administrator of EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq. ). None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its rules pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;857). 4. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), the Director provided the proposed amendment to the SHPO and the ACHP for comment. Neither the SHPO nor the ACHP provided any comments to OSM. V. Director's Decision Based on the above findings, the Director approves, with an additional requirement, the proposed amendment that Utah submitted on August 2, 1993, as subsequently revised on January 7, 1994. As discussed in finding Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the Director approves Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760, 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310; 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661; 641&hyph;112; 645&hyph;100&hyph;500; and 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110. As discussed in finding No. 6, the Director approves Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200 but requires Utah to revise it to provide that coal exploration permit application information may not be kept confidential unless it concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to the competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration. The Director approves the rules as proposed by Utah with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 944, codifying decisions concerning the Utah program, are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. VI. Procedural Determinations 1. Executive Order 12866 This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12886 (Regulatory Planning and Review). 2. Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.
