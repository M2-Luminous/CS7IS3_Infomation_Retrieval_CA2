FR940505-2-00082 FR940505-2-00054 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Docket No. AB&hyph;32 (Sub-No. 67X)] Boston and Maine Corporation_Discontinuance of Trackage Rights Exemption_Hampden County, MA Boston and Maine Corporation (B&M), has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_Exempt Abandonments and Discontinuances of Trackage Rights to discontinue trackage rights over approximately 0.52 miles of rail line owned by Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) between milepost 98.02 and milepost 98.54, in Springfield, Hampden County, MA. 1 Conrail will continue to provide rail service on the line. 1 Under 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2), the railroad must file a verified notice with the Commission at least 50 days before the abandonment or discontinuance is to be consummated. B&M's verified notice indicated a proposed consummation date of June 1, 1994. Because the verified notice was not filed until April 15, 1994, consummation should not have been proposed to take place prior to June 6, 1994. B&M's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after June 6, 1994. B&M has certified with respect to the trackage rights involved here that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) Any overhead traffic on the line has been rerouted over other lines; (3) No formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a state or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) The requirements at 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. 2 2 Because under 49 CFR 1105.6(b)(3) no environmental assessment will be prepared for discontinuances of trackage rights where the affected line will continue to be operated, environmental or historical documentation is not required here. 49 CFR 1105.6(c)(6) and 49 CFR 1105.8. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the discontinuance shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on June 4, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay must be filed by May 16, 1994. Petitions to reopen must be filed by May 25, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 3 3 Because this is only a discontinuance proceeding and Conrail will continue to provide service over the line, the routine provisions for trail use/rail banking or public use conditions provided for in abandonment proceedings are not appropriate here. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: John R. Nadolny, Iron Horse Park, North Billerica, MA 01862. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Decided: April 22, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10797 Filed 5&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
