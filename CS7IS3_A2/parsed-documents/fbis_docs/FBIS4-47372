I. Gershenzon, M. B. Gokhberg, Unified Institute of Earth Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 550.385.46:550.343] [Abstract] Variations of the geomagnetic field at 0.01-10 Hz recorded at the epicenter of the Loma Prieta earthquake (M = 7.1) may be explained by a set of electric dipoles which appear due to a change in the pore liquid pressure near faults 0.1-10 m in size. It is sufficient for these sources to arise in a narrow water-bearing stratum (about 10 m) near the surface (10-100 m deep). The magnitude of the effect depends heavily on the size of faults, frequency, and the depth of bedding of the layer, and to a lesser extent, on the expanse of the layer, conductivity, and the number of faults. Anomalies were recorded more than a month before the earthquake, but the most powerful anomalies began three hours before the earthquake in the 0.01-0.4 Hz range and exceeded the background by two orders of magnitude. The model presented here is based on pulse processes of fault formation in the Earth's crust, which cause disturbances in a wide range of frequencies, including he ULF range. In this range electrokinetic and piezomagnetic effects are predominant. However, the piezomagnetic field does not match observations in magnitude or frequency. Electrokinetic effects agree satisfactorily with experimental data. The model presented here can determine parameters of the fault formation process, the size distribution of faults, and the rate of appearance.
