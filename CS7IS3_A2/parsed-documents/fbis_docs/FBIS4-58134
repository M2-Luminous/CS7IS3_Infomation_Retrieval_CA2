The Syrian rejection of partial and separate settlements and secret negotiations and deals emphasizes the fact that peace is an indivisible whole and cannot be achieved in bits and pieces by dividing withdrawal and scheduling stages. The land-for-peace principle cannot, under any other name, stipulate giving back part of the territory in exchange for peace; full peace entails full withdrawal, giving each party its rights, and uprooting the causes of tension and conflict. The Israeli concept, which takes after the shylock model of barter, wants to give back the occupied Arab territories in pieces. In return, it wants to exact the full price of peace all at once. Such exposed maneuvers and names such as "Majdal-Shams First," like Gaza-Jericho First, will not deceive the other Arab fronts, which do not accept half solutions and only seek comprehensive and just peace in return for withdrawal from the occupied territories -- all of the occupied territories -- without any division, bargaining, or flexibility. The Oslo accord was concluded under special circumstances and considerations that have to do with the reality and considerations of the Palestine question and the Palestinian people under occupation. It was also the outcome of political circumstances and the suffering of a people under an unjust military rule. This accord, however, does not constitute a formula that can be promoted on the other Arab fronts. Just as Israel withdrew fully from Sinai under the peace agreement with Egypt, the solution of the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese tracks cannot depart from this framework in all its political details and facts. The three Arab parties are determined to reject half solutions and peace in pieces in adherence with the land-for-peace principle. They believe that peace does not stand a chance of survival if it is not a comprehensive peace in return for a comprehensive withdrawal from all the Arab territories, without exception. Such a comprehensive Arab strategy, stressed by His Majesty King Husayn and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Amman a few days ago, constitutes a basis for the Arab negotiator in his quest for a just and comprehensive peace. Therefore, the U.S. role in advancing the peace process should not be limited to conveying and propagating Israeli ideas; it should correct the course of these ideas and reject any attempt to circumvent the land-for-peace principle and the Madrid framework, which is based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The U.S. initiative that launched the peace process almost three years ago was originally based on these principles.
