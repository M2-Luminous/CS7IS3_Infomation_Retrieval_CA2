FR941117-0-00195 FR941117-0-00013 The amendments have been modified to respond to these comments. The phrase ``pertinent'' has been deleted from the reference to operating information and the word ``data'' is used to emphasize the intended quantitative nature of the information. Operating data is included as a subset of annual financial information, and the operating data to be provided annually also is determined by reference to the type of operating data presented in the final official statement. Thus, the parties will determine at the outset, presumably with the assistance of applicable industry guidelines, what operating data will be provided both initially and on an ongoing basis. For example, in a conduit health care financing, under current industry practice, an official statement typically provides information relating to the obligated party_the hospital_in an appendix. In addition to a discussion describing the hospital, its administration and management, economic base and service area, and capital plan, operating statistics such as bed utilization, admissions and type, patient days, and payor utilization often is provided. Under the amendments, in this type of transaction, parties at the outset of a transaction will determine which operating data will be included in the hospital appendix; such information, in turn, will be the type of ``operating data'' to be provided annually. Some commenters expressed concern that the Proposed Amendments were not sufficiently flexible to permit parties to address changing conditions because the undertaking would have to describe the financial and pertinent operating information to be provided in the future. 113 Nonetheless, the requirement that the undertaking specify in reasonable detail the type of data that will be provided on an ongoing basis, including the identity of the persons (or category of persons) about which the information will relate has been retained. As is the case with financial information, the intent of the amendments is to give investors and market participants the ability to evaluate the security through comparisons of the quantitative operating data provided. Contrary to the suggestion of some commenters, the undertaking would be meaningless if issuers and obligated persons could unilaterally determine that certain types of information were no longer necessary or meaningful to investors. 113 See, e.g., Letter of Chapman and Cutler; Joint Response; Letter of Kutak Rock. Because the amendments require that the undertaking specify only the general type of information to be supplied, there should be sufficient flexibility to accommodate subsequent developments that may require adjustments in the financial information and operating data that should be provided annually. Of course, nothing in the undertaking will prevent a party from providing additional information, particularly where such disclosure may be necessary to avoid liability under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Similarly, the amendments make specific provision for adjusting the persons about which information is provided. As required in the case of pooled financings, parties may identify the persons covered by reference to objective selection criteria that will be applied on a consistent basis between the offering statements and with regard to annual financial information. Moreover, the party providing the undertaking need not continue to provide information concerning persons that are no longer obligated persons with respect to the municipal securities. A new provision has been added to the amendments which permits the written agreement or contract to have a termination provision with respect to any obligated person that is no longer directly or indirectly liable for repayment of any of the obligations on the municipal securities. 114 Once an obligated person no longer has any liability for repayment of the municipal securities, whether through termination or expiration of its commitment to support payment, or as a result of a defeasance of the municipal securities with no remaining liability, then the obligation to provide annual financial information and notices of events may terminate. 114 See Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(iii). 2. Notice of Material Events Commenters generally agreed that issuers and obligors should be subject to an undertaking to provide event information to the market. 115 Brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers supported these provisions of the Proposed Amendments, because the use of a list provides guidance as to what events should be covered. 116 Other commenters, however, felt that the list should be deleted from the rule and that the concept of materiality should be relied upon to determine what events should be the subject of notices. 117 Some commenters believed that the list of eleven events should be expanded to include a provision that would cover any other event that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the holders of the bonds. 118 115 See paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of the Proposed Amendments. See also, Letter of A.G. Edwards; Letter of Chemical Securities; Letter of J.J. Kenny Co., Inc. (``J.J. Kenny Co.''); Letter of MSRB. 116 See, e.g., Letter of Chemical Securities; Letter of Goldman Sachs; Letter of George K. Baum; Letter of PSA. 117 See, e.g., Letter of CDFA; Letter of Gust & Rosenfeld; Joint Response; Letter of Municipal Treasurers Association; Letter of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc.; Letter of Standish Ayer & Wood, Inc. 118 See, e.g., Letter of Chemical Securities; Letter of Edward D. Jones & Co.; Letter of Finance Authority of Maine; Letter of Ferris Baker Watts; Letter of Norwest Investment Services, Inc.; Letter of Prudential Investment Corp. The list of eleven events has been retained in the amendments. 119 As indicated in the Proposing Release, the list of eleven events was proposed in response to requests for guidance to issuers and other participants in the municipal securities markets as to those events that normally would reflect on the credit supporting the municipal securities, as well as on the terms of the securities that they issue, and thus normally would be considered material. Under the amendments, only the occurrence of one of the specified events will, if material, create an obligation to send a notice to the repository. 119 The introduction to the list also has been clarified to indicate that the events relate specifically to the securities being offered. See Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(i)(C). The determination of whether other events also should be the subject of notification pursuant to the information undertaking is left to the parties. For example, some commenters requested that the list of events be expanded to address circumstances when the notified events have been cured or rectified, as well as other favorable developments. 120 The parties would be free to add such matters to the undertaking. Issuers also may wish to send information regarding material developments to the repositories, to ensure equal access to that information by all investors and participants in the market, regardless of whether the particular development is subject to the undertaking. 121 120 See, e.g., Letter of NAST; Letter of the Treasurer of State of California. 121 Several commenters have expressed concern that statements by various elected officials made in a political context relating to an issuer must now be included in information provided to a repository. The amendments contain no such requirement. Moreover, these concerns appear to be based upon a misunderstanding of the reminder to issuers in the Interpretive Release that investors may rely on a variety of formal and informal sources for continuing information on municipal issuers, including public statements and press releases concerning an entity's fiscal affairs made by municipal officials, particularly in the absence of a more standardized mechanism for disseminating information about the municipal issuer to the market as a whole. The caution contained in the Interpretive Release that the antifraud provisions may apply to releases of information to the public reasonably expected to reach investors and the trading market does not mean, as some commenters inferred, that such statements are per se material; nor do the amendments require that such statements, even where material, be provided to the repositories.
