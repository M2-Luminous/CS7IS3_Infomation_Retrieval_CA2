Since a province-wide anti-corruption campaign was mounted last May Anhui has discovered that public funds have been misappropriated to the tune of 826 million yuan, of which 774 million yuan has been recovered, according to the local authorities. Over the years some government cadres in Anhui routinely embezzled public money and deposited it in their bank accounts. They also used public money to offer high-interest loans, build private houses, buy high-class furniture, gamble and visit prostitutes. These corrupt practices have sparked widespread public resentment, which led to a government-orchestrated clampdown. The number of officials involved in the spending of public funds on the education of their offspring and relatives totalled more than 300,000, including hundreds of government functionaries at bureau and county levels. The campaign also uncovered some cases dating back to as early as the 1950s. This revealed flaws in the system of management of public funds, said a provincial official. The investigations further revealed financial and accounting problems at the village level, which had resulted in the peasants' mistrust of the government. A provincial official said that thousands of offenders have been detained and prosecuted. The resolute actions of the government have restored the confidence of the public and advanced the goal of building a clean government, he noted.
