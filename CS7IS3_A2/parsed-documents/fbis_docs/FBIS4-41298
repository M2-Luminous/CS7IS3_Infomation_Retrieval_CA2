Lithuania should support the positions of Latvia and Estonia in two separate and not linked issues: a speedy and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops and a citizenship law, Vytautas Landsbergis notes. As is known, the Presidents of the United States and the Baltic states are to meet in Riga 6 July. In Landsbergis's opinion, at this meeting Lithuania should ensure support for its government's stand, which is supported by the Seimas opposition, that Russia's demands to conclude a bilateral military transit treaty with Lithuania are political and should be rejected as contrary to the provisions of the Lithuanian Constitution and Lithuania's national interests. According to Vytautas Landsbergis, it is also very important to know whether the principles of equal rights and opportunities in the relations of states with NATO are still being adhered to, or whether the West will be drawn into an Orwellian world where one NATO partner is (?more equal) than the others.
