FR940304-0-00123 FR940304-0-00021 5. Section 279.10(g)(5)_Used Oil Captured by the Refinery's Hydrocarbon Recovery System or Wastewater Treatment System and Inserted Into Petroleum Refining Process Section 279.10(g)(5) of today's rule exempts from the part 279 standards used oil that incidentally enters and is recovered from a petroleum refining facility's hydrocarbon recovery system or its wastewater treatment system (e.g., process sewer, storm sewer, or wastewater treatment units), if the recovered used oil is subsequently inserted into the petroleum refining process. Oil (that may contain small amounts of used oil) that has been recovered from a refining facility's hydrocarbon recovery or wastewater treatment system is typically used as a feedstock in petroleum refining to produce more petroleum products. EPA understands that used oil, generated from routine refinery process operations and that incidentally enters a refinery's recovery or wastewater treatment system (e.g., drips, leaks, and spills from compressors, valves, and pumps), represents a small portion of the total oil that enters (and is then recovered from) the recovery or wastewater treatment system. Thus, the oil recovered from the system is more properly characterized as crude feedstock than used oil. Provided the used oil is inserted into the petroleum refining process, EPA believes that regulation under part 279 standards is unwarranted. This exemption from the part 279 standards does not extend to used oil which is intentionally introduced into a petroleum refinery's recovery or wastewater treatment system (e.g., pouring collected used oil into any part of the hydrocarbon recovery system, storm or process sewer system or into wastewater treatment units). Used oil may not be introduced to the refinery's hydrocarbon recovery or wastewater treatment system as a way to avoid meeting the conditions specified in §279.10(g)(4). For the purposes of the exemption in today's rule, the examples cited in the existing de minimis wastewater exclusion (§279.10(f)) provide guidance on what types of releases to a refinery's hydrocarbon recovery or wastewater treatment system would be considered ``routine'' or ``incidental''. The exemption is intended to cover losses from drippage, minor spillage, etc., that cannot be reasonably avoided. For example, used oil that has been collected from equipment or vehicle maintenance activities and intentionally introduced into a refinery's wastewater treatment system would not be exempt under §279.1(g)(5) from the part 279 standards once recovered. Similarly, used oil that is generated off-site and is brought to the refinery may not be added to any portion of the refinery's wastewater treatment system (i.e., process sewer, storm sewer, or wastewater treatment units), and still be exempt under §279.10(g)(5) once recovered; such oil is clearly not ``incidentally captured'' by the refinery's wastewater treatment system. In fact, unless specifically exempted under §279.10(g)(2) or §279.10(g)(3) of today's rule, this type of activity would meet the definition of used oil processing under the existing used oil management standards (see 40 CFR 279.1). Today's rule does not preclude intentional introduction of used oil in to the facility's recovered oil tanks. EPA is aware that used oil from both on- and off-site is often added directly to the petroleum refining facility's recovered oil tanks. Mixtures of used oil and recovered oil that contain greater than 1% used oil are regulated as used oil. Mixtures of used oil and recovered oil that contain less than 1% used oil and are inserted into the petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking are exempt from the part 279 used oil management standards under §279.10(g)(2). Mixtures of used oil and recovered oil that contain less than 1% used oil and are inserted into the petroleum refining process after crude distillation or catalytic cracking are exempt from the part 279 standards (under §279.10(g)(4)) only if the used oil meets the used oil specification prior to mixing with recovered oil. 6. Section 279.10(g)(6)_Stock Tank Bottoms Section 279.10(g)(6) of today's rule exempts tank bottoms from stock tanks containing exempt mixtures of used oil and crude oil from the part 279 standards. Like the actual mixtures of used oil and crude oil, the bottoms from these mixtures are expected to contain insignificant amounts of used oil. Therefore, the Agency does not believe that the bottoms from tanks (or other units) containing mixtures of used oil and crude oil should be subject to the used oil management standards. The tank bottoms are subject to all other applicable requirements, i.e., the §262.11 requirement to determine if they are hazardous waste. D. Used Oil Transportation Section 279.1_Definition of Transfer Facility Today's rule revises the definition of transfer facility to allow used oil to be held at a location (i.e., a transfer facility) temporarily prior to activities that are not subject to the processor standards as a result of today's rulemaking. In the September 10, 1992 final rule, a transfer facility was defined as a transportation-related facility where shipments of used oil are held for more than 24 hours but less than 35 days during the normal course of transportation. Today's rule expands that definition to allow used oil to be held for more than 24 hours but less than 35 days during the normal course of transportation or prior to an activity performed pursuant to §279.20(b)(2). Under the amended definition, as discussed below in section F of this preamble, a site to which used oil from oil-bearing electrical transformers is transported for filtering prior to reuse would be considered a transfer facility under today's definition.
