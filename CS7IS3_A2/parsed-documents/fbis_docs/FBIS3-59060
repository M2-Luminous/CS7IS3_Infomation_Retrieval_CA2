The 7 May 1993 asylum treaty with Poland had already been settled, when the Federal Export Office (BAFA) performed its duty: It raised objections. The supply of night vision devices to Poland's Border Guard was a violation of the export ban on industrial goods that can be used for either civilian or military purposes ("dual use"). A German manufacturer of optical and electronic sensors started producing civilian rather than military goods ("conversion"). Instead of guidance systems, the optical sensors now guide probes used in medical endoscopy. His exports are a success. Israel is also a customer. However, German officials are placing massive obstacles in the way of delivering spare parts to Israel: The sensor technology could be converted to military use in the recipient country. Nothing but theory? German foreign economic policy knows better since German firms industrial equipment for the Libyan chemical weapons plant at Al-Rabitah. "Auschwitz in the desert," were the comments that William Safire, the NEW YORK TIMES columnist, made. Al-Rabitah and "civilian" German goods supplied to Iraq have led to controls on all "dual-use" exports to suspicious countries. The United States has deemed the effort "exemplary." Nevertheless, Bonn is not happy. Industry is using the economic crisis as a means of attacking excessive controls. They have resulted in "massive international competitive handicaps." That has drawn a positive reaction from the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag group. The main advocate of a relaxation of controls is the spokesman on foreign policy, Karl Lamers. What has now given a new lease of life to the debate is the tug of war in the European Union (EU) regarding uniform export regulations for "dual use" goods. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, FDP [Free Democratic Party], has doggedly been demanding that the strict German law should be recognized as being a national exception under EU law. The CDU/CSU is opposed, and the Federal Chancellery is vacillating. Lamer's parliamentary colleague, Andreas Schockenhoff says: "What is at stake is the ability of German industry to cooperate on joint projects with EU and NATO partners." In plain English: This does, of course, apply to what are solely defense projects. There are more and more reports from the aerospace and marine industries that German partners are no longer being approached by West European partners. To provide one example: England sells Tornadoes with German electronic technology to Saudi Arabia. The manufacturer is to repair a guidance system for the customer: It can be repaired within 27 days. However, BAFA must give its approval and that takes between two and five months. That becomes known. Recently, however, customers all over the world now want "package approvals" from the German authorities. That has not been permitted until now. Others say that offers from Germany do not make any sense "as long as German export policy remains unpredictable." The competition from England, France, and the United States is not asleep. Their representatives go knocking on doors with the German law under their arm, and they have some good advice to offer: "Don't buy German." [preceding words in English].
