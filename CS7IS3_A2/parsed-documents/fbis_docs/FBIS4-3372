FBIS4-3372 "drchi076_u_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 PRC MEDIA ON TAIWAN AFFAIRS XINHUA Report on Taiwan's Reaction to Boat Incident XINHUA Report on Taiwan's Reaction to Boat Incident OW1904114994 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 0714 GMT 19 Apr 94 OW1904114994 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service Chinese BFN [Text] Beijing, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- The concerned departments of the Taiwan authorities recently used the "Qiandao Lake incident" as a pretext to announce the "temporarily halting" of cultural exchange activities between the two sides of the Strait and "boycott" travel to the mainland and economic exchanges between the two sides. The actions taken by the Taiwan authorities have cast a shadow over relations and contacts between the two sides and have made more and more people on the island worried and dissatisfied. People of many trades and professions hold that the Taiwan authorities' actions are not appropriate and that the suspension of exchanges and contacts with the mainland will hurt Taiwan the most. Taiwan's tourist business will suffer seriously due to "boycotting travel to the mainland." Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs Commission" decided to boycott travel to the mainland by the people starting 1 May and the tourist services would have to assume economic losses due to the decision. People of related trades pointed out that travel to the mainland account for a big proportion of Taiwan's tourist business. In Taibei [Taipei] City alone, there are some 100 travel services handling travels to the mainland. April and May are peak months for travel to the mainland with 15,000 to 18,000 travelers each month. The travel services will suffer at least 100 million New Taiwan dollars' economic losses due to the halt of travel to the mainland. People of Taiwan's tourist business pointed out that in the past seven years, Taiwanese visited the mainland some 6 million times. The number is unprecedented and the people's visits are practical exchanges between the two sides. Travel and contacts between the two sides of the strait must not stop because of this singular "Qiandao Lake incident." People in business circles also hold that the two sides of the strait have already established close contacts and that the retrogression of economic exchanges and trade between the two sides will bring very big harm and loss to Taiwan's businessmen. Huang Zhaofu [Huang Chao-fu], secretary general of Taiwan's "Industrial Association for Relations Between the Two Sides of the Strait," said: Many Taiwan businessmen told the association that economic and trade activities must not be influenced by the "Qiandao Lake incident." Taiwan businessmen's interests are mixed together with the mainland's interests, and we should make no distinction between what are one's own and what are other people's interests. Using the "Qiandao Lake incident" to create a big display will only hurt the interests of Taiwan's businessmen and cannot stop the tide of Taiwan businessmen's investment on the mainland and economic exchanges and trade between the two sides of the strait. The temporary halt of cultural exchanges was also opposed by people of cultural circles. Many people of the cultural circles pointed out that cultural exchanges between the two sides of the strait are favorable to Taiwan's absorbing the mainland's advantages in culture, science and technology and are conducive to Taiwan's cultural development. To stop cultural exchanges between the two sides because of this singular incident will hurt understanding and link established gradually through cultural exchanges. Taiwan's news media also pointed out that some people on the island are using the "Qiandao Lake incident" to instigate Taiwan compatriots' anti-mainland sentiments and advocate "Taiwan independence." They are both inadvisable. The Taiwan authorities' "boycotting measures" are to seize on an incident to exaggerate matters and will hurt both sides, especially the people in Taiwan.
