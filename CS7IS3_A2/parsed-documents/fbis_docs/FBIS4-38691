This was stated here today to an ITAR-TASS correspondent by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Besides talks with Russian diplomatic head Andrey Kozyrev the program for the Greek minister's visit has also included a meeting with Aleksiy II, the patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. Touching on the importance of the efforts of the Russian Orthodox Church in the Balkans, Papoulias said: "We support such initiatives because they are aimed at defending peace. These are humane initiatives helping to settle many issues with due consideration for the historic role the Orthodox Church plays in the south of Europe." One should not forget the common Orthodox roots existing between our peoples, the Greek minister continued. He noted that during their talks Kozyrev expressed anxiety over "the unpleasant incidents and provocations against the Universal Istanbul Patriarchic," which there had been in Istanbul. The Russian foreign political department and the Russian Orthodox Church are in constant contact, Kozyrev told an ITAR-TASS correspondent. We highly appreciate the peace-making efforts of Patriarch Aleksiy II. One should note that in our relationship with Greece and a number of other countries religion serves as "a firm spiritual foundation that imbues it with a cordial character". The Russian minister cited specific examples related to Murmansk oblast from which he was elected a State Duma deputy. An Orthodox church is now being restored in Murmansk. Unfortunately, Kozyrev said, after 70 years of militant atheism it is being done practically from scratch and mainly through the efforts of parishioners and the public. At present at our request and with the most active participation of the Russian Orthodox Church our Greek co-religionists render help in creating an iconoclastic for this church. Besides making use of the hospitality of Orthodox co-religionists, we send children from Russia's northern areas for rest and treatment in Greece which is famous for its heavenly climate. In the near future a trip to Greece by a group from Archangel is being prepared. To tell the truth, Irina Kozyreva, the minister's wife, could obviously tell about this in more detail as she heads the Russia's Care charitable foundation to help children on a voluntary basis.
