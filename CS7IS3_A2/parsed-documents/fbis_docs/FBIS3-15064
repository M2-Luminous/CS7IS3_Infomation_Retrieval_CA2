As you may remember, the CIA officer Aldrich Ames was arrested in the United States last week on charges of spying, first for the former Soviet Union and then for Russia. When the official representative of the Russian external intelligence in Moscow, Aleksandr Lysenko, was declared persona non grata, Moscow took a retaliatory step against his American counterpart in Moscow, Mr. James Morris. Many in Moscow keep wondering what the reason is for such a sharp response by the United States to the Ames case, although such incidents have been quite frequent in the world of intelligence gathering. Further to this, Mr. Ames's guilt is still to be proven in court and that will be no easy task. Also, Russia and the United States have never concluded an agreement to cease intelligence operations against each other. Moscow understands perfectly well that the United States' desire is to learn about what is going on in Russia, but Washington too must respond with understanding to Moscow's intention to know what trends in relations with Moscow prevail in United States political circles. What is the real reason for the hue and cry about the Ames case? Observers believe that this inadequate response to events -- that do constitute a psychological drama for the U.S. secret services, no denying that -- has a political background. They are not ruling out that it may be linked with the success of Russian diplomats in their efforts to settle the Bosnian crisis. On the other hand, it is quite possible that certain circles in the United States would prefer to make a pause in relations with Russia and to wait and see what turn the march of events in Russia will take in the near future. President Clinton seems to be under pressure from his political opponents, who have jumped at the opportunity to use the Ames affair in their own interests. However, the Russian side cannot help wonder why a problem that falls within the area of competence of United States and Russian security services has received a highly politicized interpretation. This kind of attitude disagrees with the principle of partnership between the Russian and United States intelligence services, which not only seek cooperation and wider contacts but already cooperate in such fields as the struggle against drug trafficking, terrorism, and organized crime. In any case, the Russian side would like that cooperation be continued. It hopes that if the United States is reserved enough, the Ames affair would remain what it should be -- a minor episode in relations between our two countries.
