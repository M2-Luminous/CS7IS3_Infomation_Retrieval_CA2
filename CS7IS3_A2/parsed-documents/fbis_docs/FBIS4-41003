Bondarenko, identified by caption] Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Boris Gromov had a meeting today with representatives of the sub-committee for disarmament and arms control of the FRG Bundestag. Questions of arms reduction -- primarily nuclear and chemical -- in Europe were discussed. This process is important and essential but every one of us is worried lest it become a one-way street. Might it not end up with us, alone, destroying our arsenal, while the West actively assists us, leaving its own untouched? [Begin Gromov recording] Parity in disarmament is maintained in line with signed agreements and treaties. We, naturally, could not have a situation where we would sign a treaty concerning, for example, the elimination of chemical weapons, that was detrimental to us and our defense capability.
