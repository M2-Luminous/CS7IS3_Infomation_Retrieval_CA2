This is politically and morally unacceptable. We hope that the Security Council will hasten to issue a resolution implementing the rules of the Fourth Geneva Convention in order to provide international protection for the Palestinians, disarm the settlers, and dismantle the settlements. We believe that this massacre has had a profound effect on the peace process. We wish to preserve the peace process. If you look at paragraph six of the resolution before you, it says that the two countries sponsoring the peace conference will urge earnest action to ensure the success of the peace efforts by halting Israeli procrastination. Regrettably, Israel's procrastination has gone on too long and is intolerable. Therefore, it is necessary to point out how dangerous this procrastination is. Doubtlessly, the whole world welcomed the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September 1993. The Arab League regarded it as an important step on the path to peace, but we later heard Israeli Prime Minister Rabin say that some of the deadlines in the declaration are not sacred. Of course, you have heard these remarks. The first step in the agreement should have been implemented on 13 December; now we are approaching the 13 April deadline, the date set for the troops' evacuation and the establishment of autonomy. Will anything be implemented on this date or is 13 April also not a sacred date? If nothing is sacred why is it mentioned in the agreement? I am surprised at this. There is no need to specify dates if we are then going to say they are not sacred. Of course, I drew attention to this point today. I asked the ambassadors and envoys of the 15 Security Council members to inform their governments of all this. I believe they will do so today in view of the fact that the Security Council is due to meet again on Monday morning. We still have ample time for contacts because of the six or seven-hour time difference between Cairo and New York. Over there they have not yet woke up today. This gives us enough time to make contacts and enable the envoys to call up their capitals, who can contact UN headquarters. We hope that when this happens a resolution will be adopted very quickly.
