According to an appropriate presidential decree, released in Tashkent on Saturday, the new body will "promote economic reform, guarantee privatization, and encourage free enterprise in the republic." The president gave the cabinet two weeks to form the council and one month to work out a privatization program to transform restricted joint stock companies into private businesses where all citizens can buy shares. According to the document, shops and public services with the land they stand on can be bought by local residents and foreigners without declaring their source of income. The decree lifts restrictions on the amount of hard currency and CIS money allowed for local citizens and foreigners to bring in and out of Uzbekistan. Joint ventures producing consumer goods will no longer be taxed on their profits in convertible currency, if foreign investments in their statute fund do not exceed 50%. Custom duties on all imports will be totally lifted by July 1, 1995. The decree also lists administrative bodies authorized to permit the setting up of businesses and fix temporary custom duties on exports to CIS and other countries. It also lists commodities prohibited for export to CIS and other states. The prohibition applies to flour, meat, butter, tea, sugar, and artifacts of significant value. As Finance Minister Bakhtiyar, a deputy prime minister, has reported, in the first half of this year the republic intends to introduce the "sum" - a national monetary unit that will replace the temporary coupons, now in circulation. Speaking at an international seminar on banking in Tashkent, he declared that the main task for Uzbekistan in credit policy today was to attract more investment in key projects, primarily in the fuel and energy complex and in gold-mining. He admitted that although the republic annually mined up to 50 tons of gold and nearly 90 tons of uranium, it had no policy of managing gold and currency reserves and securities.
