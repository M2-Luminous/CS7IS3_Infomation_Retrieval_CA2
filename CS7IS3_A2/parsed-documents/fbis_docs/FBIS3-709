More than one thousand displaced people have arrived here daily since Sunday [6 March] for fear of further attacks, aid personnel in the town, 90 kilometres (56 miles) southeast of Monrovia, told AFP. Guerrillas of the Liberia Peace Council (LPC) militia on Sunday launched a "brief, violent attack" on civilians in the Compound 2 region, 20 kilometres (13 miles) north of Buchanan, killing several, a refugee said. "They opened fire right among the people," he said. "They began to throw grenades everywhere. Everybody ran. We left our home to go to the bush." The dead included a Liberian worker for the charity Medecins sans Frontieres [MSF] (Doctors Without Borders), he added. Available information indicated that the attacks had stopped, but this had not prevented some 7,000 people from joining 20,000 other displaced persons already sheltered in Buchanan schools. They had fled fighting between the LPC and the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), which controls the area and was one of three signatories to a peace pact last year, before the LPC was formed in September. The attack came a day before the installation of a transitional State Council, or collegiate presidency, and the official start to the disarming of Liberia's armed factions under the July peace accord. But disarmament by troops of a multinational African peacekeeping force under the supervision of UN monitors was Thursday only a dream here, where five lorries carrying mainly women and children arrived in less than two hours. Most of the displaced people were dressed in rags and were visibly exhausted, often with nothing but a small bag of possessions. After receiving a food card, they went to a makeshift reception centre where an elderly woman was handing out small rations of rice. In the classrooms, benches and tables were pushed into a corner to make space for the new arrivals. Mats were laid on the floor for them to sleep on. For the present, the relief agencies were coping, Christine Muller of MSF declared. "It's not over," she said. "We are expecting more than 7,000 new arrivals in the coming days."
