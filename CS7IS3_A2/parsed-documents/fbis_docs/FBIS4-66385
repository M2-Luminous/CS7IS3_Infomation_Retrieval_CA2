Three Research Centers established last year were the ``Liquid State Machine and Compression Engine Engineering Research Center'' of the Xian Jiaotong University, the Ministry of Energy's ``Clean Coal Combustion for the Power Plants Engineering Research Center'' of Xian Thermal Power Research Institute, and the ``Telecommunication Exchange and Software Support System Engineering Research Center'' of the Tenth Research Institute of Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The engineering research centers aim at conducting engineering research and systematic integration of research institutes' important S&T achievements with great market value, and then transform these results into large-scale industrialized production. In order to accelerate the conversion of these results, speed up development of China's industrial production technology, and promote international competition, the engineering research centers are also exloring effective models and new operation guidelines to be adopted by Chinese government in the future.
