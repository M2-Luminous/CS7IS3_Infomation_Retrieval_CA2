In a document that has just been handed to the news desk of La Voix du Zaire, General Eluki Monga Awundu says that Zairian territory does not serve and will not serve as a base for the incursion of foreign troops to settle an internal problem that does not concern Zaire. The problems between the SPLA and the Sudanese Armed Forces are purely internal to the Sudanese people, the document added. It concluded: The Zairian Armed Forces do not intend to support either of the two forces and urge the Sudanese to settle their problems like brothers.
