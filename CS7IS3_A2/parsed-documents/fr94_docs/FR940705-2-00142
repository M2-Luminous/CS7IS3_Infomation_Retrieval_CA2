FR940705-2-00142 FR940705-2-00090 Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-c. Decontamination and Inactivation (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-c-(1). Experimental organisms shall be rendered biologically inactive by appropriate methods before disposal outside of the greenhouse facility. Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-c-(2). Decontamination of run-off water is not necessarily required. If part of the greenhouse is composed of gravel or similar material, appropriate treatments should be made periodically to eliminate, or render inactive, any organisms potentially entrapped by the gravel. Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-d. Control of Undesired Species and Motile Macroorganisms (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-d-(1). A program shall be implemented to control undesired species (e.g., weed, rodent, or arthropod pests and pathogens) by methods appropriate to the organisms and in accordance with applicable state and Federal laws. Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-d-(2). Arthropods and other motile macroorganisms shall be housed in appropriate cages. If macroorganisms (e.g., flying arthropods or nematodes) are released within the greenhouse, precautions shall be taken to minimize escape from the greenhouse facility. Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-e. Concurrent Experiments Conducted in the Greenhouse (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-e-(1). Experiments involving other organisms that require a containment level lower than BL2&hyph;P may be conducted in the greenhouse concurrently with experiments that require BL2&hyph;P containment provided that all work is conducted in accordance with BL2&hyph;P greenhouse practices. Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-f. Signs (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-f-(1). A sign shall be posted indicating that a restricted experiment is in progress. The sign shall indicate the following: (i) the name of the responsible individual, (ii) The plants in use, and (iii) any special requirements for using the area. Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-f-(2). If organisms are used that have a recognized potential for causing serious detrimental impacts on managed or natural ecosystems, their presence shall be indicated on a sign posted on the greenhouse access doors. Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-f-(3). If there is a risk to human health, a sign shall be posted incorporating the universal biosafety symbol. Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-g. Transfer of Materials (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-g-(1). Materials containing experimental microorganisms, which are brought into or removed from the greenhouse facility in a viable or intact state, shall be transferred in a closed non-breakable container. Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-h. Greenhouse Practices Manual (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P-II-B&hyph;1-h-(1). A greenhouse practices manual shall be prepared or adopted. This manual shall: (i) Advise personnel of the potential consequences if such practices are not followed, and (ii) outline contingency plans to be implemented in the event of the unintentional release of organisms. Appendix P-II-B&hyph;2. Facilities (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P-II-B&hyph;2-a. Definitions (BL2&hyph;P) Appendix P-II-B&hyph;2-a-(1). The term `greenhouse' refers to a structure with walls, a roof, and a floor designed and used principally for growing plants in a controlled and protected environment. The walls and roof are usually constructed of transparent or translucent material to allow passage of sunlight for plant growth.
