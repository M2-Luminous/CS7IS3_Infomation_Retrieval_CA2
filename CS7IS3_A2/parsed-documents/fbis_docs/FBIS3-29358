Arriving here after completing a visit to Canada, Han said, "Since our purpose related to the North Korean nuclear problem is to see to it that North Korea does not develop or own a nuclear weapon, even if it had diverted nuclear matter it is not desirable to impose sanctions unconditionally on Pyongyang for its past behavior. Instead, we should receive a guarantee from North Korea that it will not divert nuclear matter any more and make Pyongyang dismantle its nuclear weapons if it has already made one or more." Han expected that it would take at least four to five more years for North Korea to reach the point where it can actually use nuclear weapons even if it makes them without any outside checks. "We need to adopt a prudent attitude in taking measures risking a war in case North Korea turned out to have already used nuclear matter (for making weapons)," he said. Concerning North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections, he judged that the dispute has passed one critical point, but that many more critical points must be surmounted in the future. "As far as I know, the IAEA's [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspection team will be sent to North Korea early next week," he added. He predicted that Pyongyang would agree to resuming inter-Korean dialogue. "Of course, it is up to North Korea. But since it wants to hold a third round of high-level talks with the United States, I think it will agree to resumption of inter-Korean dialogue," he said. He added that deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea would be decided according to strategic and tactical military needs, apart from the North Korean nuclear problem. The U.S. Congress and press have often taken a hard line against North Korea, but the Clinton administration's policies can be judged to have maintained consistency, according to Han. "The recent controversy over sanctions in the United States is only part of the picture as far as consistency. The South Korean and U.S. Governments share the recognition that they should try to solve the nuclear problem through dialogue as long as the continuity of nuclear safeguards is maintained." But if North Korea refuses to accept special inspections by the IAEA and the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks is not held, the process that was employed last year will not be followed, he said. "Then it is quite possible that a resolution seeking sanctions against North Korea would be passed at the United Nations Security Council," he said. Meanwhile, a scheduled visit to Pyongyang by Rep. Ronald Dellums, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, was canceled because North Korea agreed to inspections by the IAEA, Han said.
