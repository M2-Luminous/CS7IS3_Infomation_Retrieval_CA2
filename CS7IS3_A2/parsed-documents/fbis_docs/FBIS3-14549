Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar was told that the six were Fatah members who this afternoon attended a march in the al-Shaykh Radwan neighborhood of Gaza commemorating a Fatah Hawks fugitive who was killed last year. The six were apparently driving back from the march wearing uniforms. Army sources told our correspondent that the six were riding in two cars, and they appeared suspicious to the troops. Our military correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] undercover unit ordered them to stop, and they refused. The soldiers opened fire, killed six, and wounded a passerby. Severe riots broke out in the Jabalyah refugee camp, and the IDF considered imposing a curfew there. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 28 March reports: "Curfew was clamped on Nabulus this afternoon after two locals were injured by soldiers who fired at rioters. The IDF intend to lift the curfew later this evening. A driver of military truck was injured this afternoon by stones thrown at his car in Janin." [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 28 March adds that in the clash in Jabalyah, "two locals were injured." The report goes on to say that "the restrictions imposed on Nabulus this evening have been lifted."]
