[Peres] We carried out a difficult task. We had two main difficulties: one, the matter itself; two, getting to know the partner. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, I reached the conclusion that my partner is not what I thought he would be -- for better or for worse. He is absolutely different. At the same time, I found that the matters under discussion are much more difficult than we first estimated. Considering that we reached an agreement without the pressure of war or acts of terror, I believe this is a fine achievement. I am very sober, and I believe we have been negotiating with ourselves. The Palestinians do not really have much to give us. We, on the other hand, can free ourselves of the need to rule another nation, police its life. There is no point to negotiate otherwise. This was not a give-and-take negotiating process. It was more a process of "liberate yourself, and gain your truth." [Peri] Who exactly signed the agreement for the other side? Do you believe the PLO indeed represents the Palestinians today? [Peres] This is a good question. I would like to say something from my political experience. Sometimes I ask myself what is a leader. Some say a leader should be strong or talented. I believe a leader should have one talent: to represent his people. I believe that to a large extent Yasir 'Arafat does represent the condition of the Palestinian people. I accept him as one, and I believe that, from his point of view, he is very devoted to his role. The negotiations, therefore, were held with the Palestinian people and its representatives. [Peri] What did you learn about 'Arafat and his associates during the negotiations? [Peres] Primarily, I learned how difficult it is for them to reach decisions. The image that we have that everything is organized, that clear cut decisions.... [Peri] For example? [Peres] On almost every issue. I saw their hesitations, I saw that I was sitting with undecided people. That is, there is a great difference between their rhetoric and reality. The rhetoric is unequivocal, while making a decision is a very complex process, which for them is not at all simple. It was very hard on them. They hold diversified views. Even 'Arafat had a hard time. In addition, they are really suspicious and fearful. [Peri] Do they suspect us or themselves? [Peres] They suspect us, and they fear their people reactions. [Peri] Who matters most to 'Arafat -- those who surround him or the residents of the territories? [Peres] What matters to him most are his own views and hunches. He has to ask himself first of all what the residents of the territories will accept and what they will reject. And the answer is not simple. I have noticed that he usually listens to what others are saying, and he hesitates a lot when making decisions. That is contrary to all I have ever believed. [Peri] Those who followed the negotiations could not fail to notice that people crop up next to 'Arafat, and then they disappear. We started the negotiations with Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], and yet he was absent at the signing ceremony this week. [Peres] Theirs is not a state organization. It is a political organization, a coalition founded on accords and discords, unlike us, with people being elected to the Knesset and the government in an orderly fashion. [Peri] Although only a short time has passed since the signing, we can guess that criticism will be leveled at 'Arafat from within the PLO. [Peres] Criticism is always leveled after each change. People do not like changes, and this one is very significant. I think if we failed, God forbid, the disappointment in Israel, in the PLO, and the entire world would be great and total. We have in fact coped with extremely complex issues. [Peri] How did it work? Can you describe the obstacles you had to overcome before the agreement was signed? [Peres] I told 'Arafat in our first meeting: You tell your delegation and I will tell ours to conduct genuine negotiations. When they feel they are drawing closer to each other, they do not have to go back to us. When they feel they are drawing apart, they should avoid reaching an unbridgeable point. It is better for them to summon us before they become too entrenched in their stands. [Peri] How many times were you summoned in the course of the negotiations? [Peres] A great many times. The delegates wanted to consult all the time, but I also had to be in touch with home, with the prime minister, on the most vital issues. Then the Egyptians approached me and then the Palestinians. I only intervened in cases which I feared would become insurmountable obstacles. I think it is the right time to say a word about our team: We would not have reached an agreement without them. They did an excellent job, they worked together as a team. [Peri] What was the toughest moment in these negotiations? [Peres] Almost everything was tough. There were a few times when various issues were raised during one single day, and almost each one of these issues was dynamite. The last issue -- border crossing control -- was the toughest. This issue was formulated in two drafts -- an Israeli and a Palestinian -- and people who read both might have thought there was no way they could be bridged. And yet we did it. [Peri] You have said that in this matter we achieved more than we had hoped. [Peres] We achieved an unequivocal Palestinian acceptance of our full responsibility -- security and administration -- for the crossings. This issue was ambiguous for a long period. [Peri] Did the difficulty lie in the Palestinian adherence to symbols expressing their yearning for a state? [Peres] The Palestinians were unable to distinguish red lines from imaginary lines. One of our difficulties stemmed from the fact that many unauthorized Israelis gave the Palestinians all kinds of messages that should have never been delivered. [Peri] Such as? [Peres] Such as that Israel would give them 140 square kilometers (instead of 54). They made an invalid promise. [Peri] Who are these Israelis? [Peres] I do not want to mention names. These are unauthorized Israelis who traveled to Tunis and made pilgrimages to 'Arafat. Who authorized them? I must say, there is a lot of unwarranted talk in Israel. [Peri] What else did they promise 'Arafat? [Peres] Almost everything. They let the Palestinians understand that if they as much as asked or demanded, they would get it. I am not acquainted with all of them. I got feedbacks from the Palestinians. They presented demands based on the "pledges" they had received. [Peri] And what was your reply in these cases? [Peres] I told the truth. I said these people had no authority. [Peri] Who exactly is our Palestinian partner? [Peres] At one point 'Arafat told me: Do you want to turn me into the head of a small village or al-Nabi Musa's shaykh? I told him: Don't forget that when Israel was established in 1948 only 650,000 lived there. Today you are the leader of almost one million Palestinians. Our main partner is the one million Palestinians living in Gaza and the Jericho area. [Peri] What do you think about the fact that not all members of 'Arafat's entourage plan to reside in the territories? [Peres] I don't want to deal with the personal aspect. I think they still do not fully comprehend what has really happened here. Life in exile, generally speaking, has many elements of make-believe: It is life in a realm of uniforms, symbols, words, and declarations. There is no government, no state, no budget. [Peri] 'Arafat seems to be a man of symbols, words, and declarations. [Peres] He is a survivor. It is an undeniable fact that so far he has remained the man who represents the Palestinians more than any other. To date there is nobody as acceptable to them as 'Arafat. I did not encounter any problems in negotiating with him. Contrary to all the rumors, I did not find him to be edgy, but he is very tense. I have to admit, however, that I found him different from what I thought. At the same time it has to be noted that I met him only on certain occasions, during negotiations, when he has to consider everything carefully and evince great responsibility. I even felt that he was somewhat concerned lest he fails to grasp the full meaning of the issues under discussion. Altogether I did not find it difficult to conduct negotiations with him. [Peri] How did you find him different? [Peres] On the basis of newspaper reports I thought he is a man who loses his patience and who jumps to conclusions very quickly. [Peri] The most important question is what will happen if it transpires that 'Arafat does not want to or cannot honor the agreement? [Peres] The answer is simple: The Israeli public must decide what kind of relations it wants to have with the Palestinians, and whether the Palestinians want peace as much as we do. I believe most of them do. They are tired of war and terrorism. I believe the Palestinian people have the same biological dynamics as all people: They see a world abounding with opportunities for the younger generation. This week I visited the Cairo book fair. It was interesting to discover what people read there: scientific and nonfiction books. A new, modern era has opened and everybody is trying to adjust to it. [Peri] What did we achieve in this agreement? [Peres] We overcame many difficult problems without compromising our security, because we made no compromises on security issues. What we accomplished there can be summed up in one expression: Anti-Bosnia. [Peri] In his speech after the signing ceremony 'Arafat emphasized the economic issue. He is concerned about this. [Peres] I am happy about this, because this is the issue about which I spoke with 'Arafat more than anything else. I told him the test in the territories will mainly be at the personal-economic level. People in the territories want to know whether they will finally be able to bring home more than $1,000 a year. This is the ultimate test. I think that a happy neighbor is a good neighbor, whereas a dejected neighbor is a bad neighbor. [Peri] What will happen if their economic expectations are not met? [Peres] I don't see any reason why it shouldn't succeed. We too have to help, and there is also a lot of international goodwill in this issue. Besides, judging by the critics of the agreement you would think our present situation in Gaza is excellent. We must remember that our starting point is not all that good. We will always be able to preserve what we have now. [Peri] Could you dispel the fog surrounding the negotiations? Who actually led them on their side? [Peres] 'Arafat, no doubt about it. He listened, he was not always knowledgeable about the issue at hand, but he was the leader. No decision was made without him, and he occasionally caused problems. The man is a symbol. He is not coming to the territories with psychological baggage. He kept the Palestinian cause in the international and Arab public eye for 25 years. [Peri] And this agreement places him on the way to a Palestinian state. [Peres] They want a Palestinian state, but there is no mention of it in the agreement. In the official meeting between myself and 'Arafat in Davos, in the presence of our delegation, he said: You think I do not know the difference between autonomy and a state, but I would like to tell you that I do. I realize we are not talking about a state, and we would rather have a confederation with Jordan. This statement is also binding on Hawatimah and Jibril. I do not think 'Arafat was saying that in confidence. He did not need to convince my five aides. [Peri] Is the fact that there is no Palestinian state on the way supposed to appease us? [Peres] No, such a possibility has not been eliminated. Moreover, there is no such thing as appeasing situations. Life is dynamic, and whatever is said today could change tomorrow. [Peri] What will happen on 13 April? [Peres] According to the agreement, we must effect the withdrawal four months after the signing of the agreement. We are not committed to 13 April. At the same time, I believe we will all make a genuine effort to meet the tight schedule. Our people, too, want to be sure we made a feasible agreement. [Peri] How did you communicate with the prime minister during the negotiations? [Peres] We coordinated our positions and held consultations throughout. Our consultations were matter-of-fact. The fact is that he ultimately approved the agreement. [Peri] It has been three nights you have not slept because of the negotiations. You have actually been doing the dirty work. [Peres] That does not matter to me. If the life of one child is spared as a result of my work, it is all worth to me. I know exactly what my position is. Nobody can take away from me what I have done in my life, neither the mistakes nor the successes. Nobody can add to or detract from them. I know exactly where I stand. [Peri] You did hard and ungrateful work to achieve this agreement. [Peres] I do not think important achievements can be attained without hard work. There are no miracles. [Peri] What sort of nation will we be after the agreement? [Peres] We will be free of something we could not continue to endure: ruling over another nation in a very narrow strip of land currently inhabited by over 4 million Jews and 3 million non-Jews. Such a situation can easily turn into a tragedy if there are no statesmen who can exactly envision the dangers and risks. Besides, I truly believe we are en route to the 21st century, in which the sources of power and wealth will not be measured in material dimensions but in spiritual and intellectual ones. [Peri] Could you describe for us a specific moment symbolizing the entire negotiating process? [Peres] We were arguing about the criteria to be applied in the border crossings, whether a man who was a terrorist would be allowed in. 'Arafat said: If that is the case, I will not be allowed to cross. I told him: Do not brag. You used to be a terrorist. Today you are an ex-terrorist. At first he was taken aback, but then he realized what I meant. I told him: We are not the only ones who changed their attitude toward you. You also changed.
