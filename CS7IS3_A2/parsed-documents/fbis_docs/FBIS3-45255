During 1993, mainland-Taiwan relations continued to relax, contacts and exchanges continued to increase rapidly in various fields, two-way exchanges broadened, economic contacts and trade continued to maintain the momentum of rapid development, and the need "to intensify complementary and reciprocal cross-strait economic exchange" became an understanding shared by the two sides. Meanwhile, people at home and abroad were greatly concerned with the repeated disputes on the island surrounding the so-called "two sovereign states" and the moves for "returning to the United Nations." The "Wang-Gu meeting" certainly was the most noticeable event in the development of mainland-Taiwan relations in 1993. Thanks to the efforts exerted by the two sides, including ARATS and the SEF, the meeting eventually took place in Singapore at the end of April after 18 months of preparations. Even though it was described as nongovernmental, this first formal meeting of high-level personnel of the two sides in more than 40 years was a highly significant meeting. The four accords signed at the meeting set the principle that the two sides should intensify their complementary and reciprocal economic exchanges and formally established the channels for cross-strait contacts, thereby providing guidance for future cross-strait consultations and enabling the two sides to take an important, historic step forward in developing their relations. After the accords reached at the "Wang-Gu meeting" became effective at the end of May, the use of notarization documents and inquiry of relevant issues proceeded smoothly, and the quantity of cross-strait registered mail increased rapidly, greatly facilitating family contacts and various other exchange activities between people of the two sides. In order to fully implement the accords, ARATS and Taiwan's SEF had three working meetings -- held respectively in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taibei [Taipei] -- during the second half of 1993. In addition to discussing and exchanging views on the issues prescribed in the "Common Agreement of the Wang-Gu Meeting," the two sides, because of actual needs, also agreed to discuss the issue about "repatriation of plane hijackers." With the understanding and support from people of all walks of life in Taiwan for the ARATS representatives' first visit to Taiwan for consultations, ARATS-SEF contacts and cooperation continued to develop, and nongovernmental cross-strait consultations continued to deepen. The successful "Wang-Gu meeting" has instilled new vitality into cross-strait contacts and exchange. In 1993, two-way exchanges broadened and there were contacts of personnel of higher levels. It has been estimated that over five million countrymen in Taiwan will have visited the mainland over the years, including the 1.5 million in 1993. Among those countrymen visiting the mainland for various exchange programs, there was noticeably a greater number of well- known personages including "national assemblymen," "legislators," members of the Kuomintang [KMT] Central Committee, and principal leaders of other parties. Mainland personnel have also made new headway in visiting Taiwan for various exchange programs. The number of groups organized by scientific-technological, art, sports, and journalistic circles to visit Taiwan for exchange programs was noticeably higher than previous years. According to statistics released by relevant authorities, during the period from January to 15 December, 3,140 persons were approved to visit Taiwan for 481 exchange projects. The broadening and deepening of two-way exchange have powerfully promoted the understanding between countrymen of the two sides. The strong momentum in the development of cross-strait economic contacts and trade has continued. According to statistics, indirect cross-strait trade via Hong Kong exceeded $6.3 billion during the January-September period, and the trade volume in 1993 was estimated at more than $10 billion. Taiwan countrymen's craze for investing their money on the mainland continued. In fact, the craze heated up as a result of the "Wang-Gu meeting." By the end of June 1993, over 15,100 Taiwan-funded businesses with a total negotiated investment of $13.6 billion had been approved. More large businesses and consortia in Taiwan came to the mainland to study investment possibilities. In early May, the first group of bankers from 15 nongovernmental banks in Taiwan came to visit the mainland. At stockholders' meetings in Taiwan in mid-July, 38 percent of the 270 listed Taiwan corporations authorized the corporations' boards of directors to directly handle their mainland's investment businesses, which involved NT$42.7 [new Taiwan dollars] billion. Although Taiwan's banking business and the listed corporations were unable to realize their mainland investment plans owing to the Taiwan authorities' obstruction, their attempts indicated the significant trend for cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation. To expedite cross-strait economic cooperation and trade, an executive meeting of the State Council adopted the "PRC Law for Protecting Taiwan Countrymen's Investment." This law, which was submitted to the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee on 20 December for its deliberations, shows the mainland has made substantial progress in standardizing and institutionalizing cross-strait economic relations and trade. Another major event relevant to mainland-Taiwan relations in 1993 was the publication of the Chinese Government white paper entitled "The Taiwan Issue and China's Reunification," which has aroused enthusiastic response among people at home and abroad. This programmatic document bearing on the motherland's peaceful reunification has fully and comprehensively expounded the Chinese Government's Taiwan policy and the origin and nature of the Taiwan issue, and it has summed up all the general and specific policies drawn up since the NPC published its "Message to Countrymen in Taiwan" in 1979. The white paper has firmly safeguarded China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and denounced the fallacies and activities of "Taiwan independence." It also points out that "Taiwan countrymen's wishes to be the masters of their own house are fair, reasonable, and legitimate. These wishes are different from `Taiwan independence,' and these countrymen are totally different from those who insist on following the course of `Taiwan independence.'" By stating this, the white paper has pointed out the way of knowing Taiwan's real public opinion. In the past year, there have been fluctuations in the progress of cross-strait relations, and some new variables have appeared. Taiwan authorities have relaxed somewhat their policy on cross-strait exchanges. At the end of 1993, Taiwan's SEF proposed, on its own accord, that its third working meeting with ARATS be held in Taibei. Consequently, a meeting concerning cross-strait general affairs was held on the island for the first time. On the other hand, Taiwan authorities have in the past year spread various inappropriate remarks on the principle of one China, including repeating the statement on "giving priority to Taiwan" within the island, and spreading the comments that "political entities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are on an equal footing." Immediately after the "Wang-Gu meeting," Taiwan authorities played up the view that "the meeting has demonstrated the fact that both sides of the strait are on an equal footing, split, and under separate jurisdictions." During the three follow-up meetings aimed at implementing accords reached at the "Wang-Gu meeting," the Taiwan side also repeatedly stressed the so-called "sovereign, administrative, and judicial powers," attempting to use cross-strait routine meetings to fulfill its objective of playing up the allegation that Taiwan is the so-called "political entity on an equal footing." In the middle of 1993, the "National Unification Conference" held by Taiwan authorities "redefined the meaning" of the principle of one China. Additionally, at the end of 1993, officials -- sent by Taiwan authorities to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Seattle -- publicly announced they would implement the "policy of two China's as a phase [jie duan xing de liang ge zhong guo zheng ce 7132 3008 4104 0257 0020 0022 0948 2398 4595]." Meanwhile, the Taiwan authorities' campaign to "expand their international space" has gone astray. Before, during, and after the United Nations General Assembly's sessions in 1993, Taiwan authorities sent many personnel to launch activities in various localities in the international community, clamoring "to reenter (or termed as join) the United Nations." The Taiwan authorities' regression on their one-China position has provoked strong opposition from people on both sides of the strait, and from the broad masses of Chinese overseas. Domestic and international public opinion have pointed out: There is only one China in the world. The position of Taiwan as a part of China is definite and unchangeable. Any plots attempting to create "two China's," "one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan independence" are doomed to failure. When reviewing the progress of cross-strait relations in 1993, we notice: Enhancing cross-strait relations and expeditiously increasing further bilateral exchanges and visits suit the interests of people on both sides of the strait. Therefore, the broad masses of people support such activities. On the contrary, all attempts -- obstructing the progress of cross-strait relations and hampering further cross-strait exchanges and visits -- will definitely fail because of the people's opposition. When looking forward in 1994, we believe: With high expectations and joint efforts from people on both sides of the strait, cross-strait exchanges and visits will increase further. When judging the progress of cross-strait relations, people will focus their attention on the outcome of meetings concerning cross-strait general affairs. Nevertheless, we should also notice: A very small number of people, inside and outside Taiwan, who are unwilling to see a reunited China, will continually change their methods; will create trouble under various pretexts; and will promote their plots of attempting to create "two China's," "one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan independence." We must remain highly vigilant and mete out resolute blows to such moves.
