FR940817-2-00016 FR940817-2-00013 Department of the Air Force Public Scoping Meeting for Disposal and Reuse of Gentile AFS, OH The United States Air Force (AF) will conduct a public scoping meeting to provide a forum for public officials and the community to provide information and comments concerning the disposal and reuse of portions of Gentile AFS, OH. The meeting will be held September 14, 1994 beginning at 7 p.m. at the Kettering City Hall, 3600 Shroyer Road, Kettering, Ohio. The purpose of this meeting is to identify the environmental issues and concerns that should be analyzed to support base disposal and reuse, and solicit potential disposal and reuse alternatives for consideration in developing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In soliciting disposal and reuse alternatives, the AF will consider all reasonable alternatives offered by any federal, state, or local government agency, and any federally-sponsored or private entity or individual. The resulting EIS will be considered in making disposal decisions that will be documented in the Air Force's Final Disposal Plan and Record of Decision for Gentile AFS. To ensure sufficient time to adequately consider public comments concerning environmental issues and disposal alternatives to be included in the EIS, the AF recommends that comments and reuse proposals be presented at the upcoming meeting or forwarded to the address below by December 1, 1994. The AF will, however, accept additional comments at any time during the environmental impact analysis process. Please direct written comments or requests for further information concerning the base disposal and reuse EIS to: William Myers, 8106 Chennault Road, Brooks AFB TX 78235&hyph;5318, (210) 536&hyph;3860.
