Thanks to the energetic ideological and theoretical activities of the dear leader, the treasurehouse of the chuche idea has been further developed and enriched and this idea has become the only correct guiding idea of the era of independence. And the people have made all their efforts to accomplish the cause of socialism with the faith and belief that when they are guided by the chuche idea, they will be able to complete the cause of independence. The dear leader has raised it as the main point to strengthen the party and enhance its leadership role in the whole course of leading the cause of socialism, put forward a policy of party building for modelling the whole party on the chuche idea and directed the efforts for its thorough implementation. He has set forth outstanding strategies and tactics and proper slogans in each period of our developing revolution and vigorously encouraged our people to carry out the party's line and policies and bring about world-startling miracles and innovations one after another in socialist economic and cultural construction. Under his energetic guidance, our country has become a powerful socialist country with political independence and a mighty independent national economy and self-defence military power. The dear leader has shaped magnanimous politics embracing all our people to achieve singlehearted unity of the society in which the entire people are united closely around the leader in the same thought and purpose and on the basis of morality and faithfulness.
