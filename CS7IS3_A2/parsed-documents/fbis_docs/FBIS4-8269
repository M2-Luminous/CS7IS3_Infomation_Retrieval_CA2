This stems from the fact that "the activity of government representatives is very important and interesting from viewers' point of view" and "in a number of important political, economic, and social issues no independent experts and observers exist," states the report, which was submitted to the parliament this week. Therefore, their role is taken by government officials or even ministers, the report adds. Further causes are that recently most opposition parties have been dealing with internal problems and that controversial views exist even within the coalition, the report states. "The RCT does not consider the current state to be optimal," the report says. However, it is possible to say that objectivity in news coverage has increased, while the occurrence of concealed commentaries within the news reports has declined. The work of foreign correspondents has improved as well, the report says. CT holds a unique position in the production of original dramatic programs for adults, the report notes. "For long years to come, no private TV company will be able to produce what the CT can make in a single year," the report says, specifying that the CT has produced 63 premieres of feature films, shown seven theater performances, and 11 serials. CT shows were watched by 85 percent of the Czech Republic's population, the report says. Virtually every adult person watched CT, while the largest interest focused on CT 1 channel (79 percent of viewers). Forty-nine percent watched CT 2, and 11 percent CT 3. People aged 50-59 watch the most CT. The decline in watching CT recorded in 1992 stopped in the second half of 1993, while the degree of satisfaction with broadcast shows has increased, the report says.
