Grain and cooking oil prices have gradually gone up since late March. In particular, there has been a relatively big fluctuation in grain and cooking oil prices recently. Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen pointed out: The current price fluctuation on grain and cooking oil markets have primarily resulted from the price increase in other provinces and from the state's hiked grain procurement prices. It is by no means caused by the lack of grain and processing capacity. There is an extremely ample supply of grain and a good assortment of grains in the province. By the end of March, the province has laid up 24.5 billion jin of grain. This amount of stored grain is capable of meeting the demands for two years or so, if calculated according to the province's consumption in a normal year. Of this, the stored soybean is 3 billion jin, that can produce 450 million jin of soya-bean oil, also capable of meeting the province's consumption of more than 2 years. Therefore, the provincial government hopes that the vast numbers of grain producers, dealers, and consumers will clear their minds of doubt, have a correct understanding of the grain and cooking oil markets situation, and overcome the abnormal mentality. Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen demanded: All localities in the province should strengthen market management, resolutely check the rising trend of prices of grain and cooking oil, and stabilize prices. All localities should give full play to the role of state grain departments as the main channel to ensure the supply of grain. Grain and cooking oil processing enterprises should ensure the quality of finished grain products and cooking oil products in line with market demands and should ensure the timely supply. All grain shops should improve grain dealing business. Efforts should be made to ensure the supply of grain and cooking oil to large- and medium-sized cities, to industrial and mining areas, and to poverty-stricken areas. Continued efforts should be made to ensure the supply of grain and cooking oil to colleges, universities, and secondary specialized schools as well as to the troops. New methods should be carried out in terms of grain and cooking oil prices. The provincial government has decided to comprehensively set the market supply prices by giving consideration to the necessary factors of all counties and cities. All grain departments and all other units and individuals dealing grain and cooking oil must follow the grain and cooking oil prices set by local governments and must hang out their shingles to sell grain and cooking oil. At the same time, the grain and cooking oil prices in all localities should not be higher than the 4 April local price levels of other varieties. In addition, all departments should coordinate with one another to resolutely and severely deal with all price violation behaviors. All localities should strengthen leadership and establish strict responsibility system to successfully stabilize the grain and cooking oil prices.
