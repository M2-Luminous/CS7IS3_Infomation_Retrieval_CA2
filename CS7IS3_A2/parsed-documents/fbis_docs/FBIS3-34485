There is constant activity along the border by both Israel and the terrorist elements, in particular Hizballah, he said. Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay said the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is operating inside the security zone and outside it according to the policy decided on by the political echelon. He noted that the understandings with Syria worked out in the wake of Operation Accountability are still in effect. The Israeli side of the northern border is not being shelled. It is difficult to act against Hizballah when its members operate in built-up areas populated by civilians, he said. Gen. Mordekhay said that the IDF is carrying out initiated actions because were it not doing so, the situation on the ground would be worse. The general added that the IDF has drawn lessons from Monday's [7 February] firefight in the al-Rayhan area in which four soldiers were killed. Gen. Mordekhay made these remarks to our army affairs correspondent, Karmela Menashe.
