Thirty-six seismologists and diplomats in charge of the CTB negotiations from such nations as Australia, China, France, India, Russia and the United States gathered for an unofficial meeting at the ministry, the officials said. The participants mainly discussed seismological methods of detecting nuclear tests, including their effectiveness, cost and operation, they said. Since it was the first time seismologists and CTB negotiators have held such a meeting, the two sides exchanged general views and did not attempt to reach a particular agreement, they said. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the seismologists will visit the Meteorological Agency to study Japanese systems to monitor earthquakes, they said. Nuclear tests have been conducted only underground since 1984, based on the 1963 partial nuclear test ban treaty. Artificial earthquakes caused by nuclear explosions are registered at seismological observatories in each country. Scientific experts set up a group in 1976 to discuss ways to create a system to monitor nuclear tests using seismological methods.
