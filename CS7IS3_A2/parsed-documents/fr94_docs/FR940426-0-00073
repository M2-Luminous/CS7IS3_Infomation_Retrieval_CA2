FR940426-0-00073 FR940426-0-00016 7. Section 1842.270 is revised to read as follows: 1842.270 Contracting officer technical representative (COTR) delegations. (a) A contracting officer may appoint another Government employee to act as the contracting officer's authorized technical representative in managing the technical aspects of a particular contract. If necessary, the contracting officer may appoint an alternate COTR to act during short absences of the COTR; the policies and procedures for COTRs also shall apply to alternate COTRs. Technical organizations are responsible for ensuring that the individual they recommend to the contracting officer possesses training, qualifications and experience commensurate with the duties and responsibilities to be delegated and the nature of the contract. The contracting officer shall ensure that the duties and responsibilities delegated do not exceed the limitations at 1801.670(b). (b) COTRs shall be designated by name and position title (see the 1801.670(b) prohibition against delegating COTR duties solely to a position rather than to a named individual). Each COTR appointment shall be in writing and shall clearly define the purpose and limitations of the COTR's authorities, duties and responsibilities. NASA Form 1634, Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) Delegation, shall be used to appoint COTRs. The COTR delegation shall be signed by the cognizant contracting officer, or at any level above that contracting officer (see 1801.670(b)), and shall state that the duties and responsibilities may not be redelegated by the COTR and that the COTR may be held personally liable for unauthorized acts. (However, this does not prohibit the COTR from receiving assistance for the purpose of monitoring contractor progress and gathering information.) When an individual is appointed as a COTR on more than one contract, separate delegations shall be issued for each contract. A separate NASA Form 1634 will be used to appoint an alternate COTR; alternates may act only during official absences of the COTR, such as leave, TDY or other special assignments. The delegated duties and responsibilities of the alternate may not exceed those of the COTR. (c) A COTR delegation remains in effect throughout the life of the contract unless cancelled in writing by the cognizant contracting officer or at any level above that contracting officer. The contracting officer may modify the delegation only by issuance of a new delegation cancelling and superseding the existing delegation. (d) A COTR shall not be authorized to initiate procurement actions by use of purchase orders, or to place calls or delivery orders under indefinite-delivery contracts or basic ordering agreements, or in any way cause a change to the contract or increase the Government's financial obligations. A COTR shall not be authorized to award, agree to, or sign any contract or modification or in any way obligate the payment of money by the Government. The COTR is not authorized to issue technical direction unless the clause at 1852.242&hyph;70, Technical Direction, prescribed in 1842.7001, is included in the contract and the authorization is specifically listed in paragraph 3(m) of the COTR delegation letter (NASA Form 1634). However, delegations may be made to construction contract COTRs to sign emergency change orders with an estimated value not to exceed the value specified in writing by the contracting officer in the NASA Form 1634 but in no event to exceed $25,000, on-site at construction sites, if sufficient funds have been previously certified to cover the emergency change. After issuing an emergency change order, the COTR shall notify the contracting officer as soon as possible, in person or telephonically, and subsequently provide a written determination supporting the need for the action. (e) The contracting officer shall send the original and one copy of the COTR delegation letter to each COTR, who shall acknowledge receipt and accept the delegation by signing the original and returning it to the contracting officer. The original of the COTR delegation letter shall be filed in the applicable contract file. Copies of the signed COTR delegation letter shall be distributed to the contractor and to each cognizant contract administration office. Acknowledgement and distribution for terminations of COTR delegations and COTR delegations which revise authority, duties and responsibilities shall follow the same rules.
