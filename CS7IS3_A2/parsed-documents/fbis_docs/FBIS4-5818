FBIS4-5818 "dreas072_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 North Korea Discusses U.S. Talks, Ties Discusses U.S. Talks, Ties SK1304153394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1524 GMT 13 Apr 94 SK1304153394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly [SPA] of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, at the talks held here today between officials of the SPA Reunification Policy Committee and former heads of state and government and politicians of different countries, informed the guests of the situation of Korea and the DPRK's stand toward national reunification and the DPRK-U.S. relations and its foreign policy. "Our singlehearted unity of the whole society is the most valuable wealth of ours and nothing can break it," he said. Noting that a powerful independent national economy had been built in the DPRK, he said: "Some people are now threatening to impose `economic blockade' on us. But it does not work with us." "Powerful self-defence capacities have been built up with the chuche idea applied in the field of national defence," he said, and added: "The nature of our-style socialism centred on the popular masses in which the chuche idea has been applied is peace. But, it is ready to cope with the situation when our sovereignty is violated or the supreme interests of the country encroached on. "It is attributable entirely to the great ideology and the great leadership that everything is going well in our country. "The leader devotes himself to the popular masses and the latter remains faithful to the former. So, it is natural that everything is going well. It is the steel-like faith of our people that they will surely win as they are guided by Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander." Kim Yong-sun continued: "We constantly maintain that the question of national reunification should be solved independently and peacefully on the principle of great national unity. "If the national reunification question is to be resolved, many issues must be solved. First of all, peace must be ensured on the Korean peninsula. To this end, disarmament must be achieved and problems solved between the DPRK and the United States." Recalling that the United States had reversed the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. talks and the New York contacts and aggravated the situation in a bid to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the "nuclear suspicion," he said: "We want to solve the issue through negotiations with the United States with patience. If the United States persistently sought a solution with strength, however, we will be left with no other choice but to do our own way. "It will be favourable to the United States itself that it look squarely at the world tending toward diversification and the changing situation and act with discretion. "The basic idea of the foreign policy of our party and the DPRK Government is independence, peace and friendship. We will as ever consistently implement this policy." The talks proceeded in an atmosphere of mutual understanding.
