This has been a topic of discussion among the British people recently. Although the Britain of today cannot be compared with that of the past, the Major government is still doing its utmost to continue pursuing "three-circle diplomacy," that is, conducting activities within the three links of developing the Western European Union, maintaining the special relationship between Britain and the United States, and preserving the British Commonwealth, as proposed by Winston Churchill and first put into practice by Foreign Secretary Earnest Belvin. If we say that Churchill's pursuit of "three-circle diplomacy" was effected through a series of measures, we can also see that the times and situations have changed, and the Major government seems unable to pursue "three-circle diplomacy" as it wishes and finds it difficult to go any further. In developing its relationship with Europe, Britain seems to be hesitating and marking time. Although Prime Minister Major repeatedly claimed to place Britain in the "heart of Europe," it has always been regarded by the European Union as a half-hearted member. Since the end of World War II, Britain has taken a position toward European union which is different from most countries on the European Continent. With regard to the goals and orientation of building Europe, the mainstream faction of most governments of the EC members -- including France, Germany, and so on -- represented by Jean Monnet and Delors, has taken the building of an integrated European economic and political entity or a supranational European union as a basic goal, since the early years of European unification movement until the subsequent effort to build an integrated European community. Britain did not favor this proposition, however, and still has reservations on the goal of developing the EC into a union as proposed by the Maastricht Treaty. With regard to the presence of the United States in Europe, it maintains that the United States should remain in Europe to balance the strength there, but France and Germany hold that "Europe belongs to the Europeans." The United States supported the suggestion that Germany be admitted as an additional permanent member of the UN Security Council early last year, but Britain and France have reservations on this issue. With regard to the war flames that are spreading in the former Yugoslav regions, Britain, France, and Germany all have considerations of their own. The "special relationship between Britain and the United States," which has been maintained for many years, is not so "special" now. Before the gunsmoke of World War II had lifted, former British Prime Minister Churchill proposed establishing a "special British-U.S. relationship" in his speech in Fulton in the United States, hoping to use the United States to prop up its appearance of "might." During the Cold War period, the actions of the Western alliance were generally determined by unanimous agreement between the two countries. However, the two special allies have harbored ill feelings toward one another for some time recently. Prior to Christmas in 1992, President-elect Clinton made an excuse to avoid meeting the British prime minister who was visiting the United States at that time, which cast a dark shadow over British-U.S. relations. In February of the next year when Major once again visited the United States, he failed to repair the "special relationship," and differences between the two sides became even more prominent--they stuck to their own arguments on the issue of trade talks between Europe and the United States, had acute differences in their views on airdropping materials in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and engaged in a battle of words on the issue of Northern Ireland. The United States denounced British actions in Northern Ireland as "violations of human rights," and Britain criticized the U.S. intention to send a peace corps to inspect North Ireland as "interference in its internal affairs." It appears that people's views on the "special relationship" have changed under the situation of increasing friction and conflicts between the two sides economically and politically, although both consider it necessary to maintain such a "special relationship." Britain has made a comprehensive effort to maintain the increasingly weak British Commonwealth. With each member of the Commonwealth currently going its own way, however, the decisions made by the conference are not binding on the member countries. When the conference of the British Commonwealth was held in Cyprus last year, the newspapers in the host country stated that the "themes of the conference are irrelevant and pointless," and that the British Commonwealth was "no longer a major force in international politics." In Australia, an irresistible wave of republican sentiment is surging forward, and Australian Prime Minister Keating has repeatedly proposed that Australia should appear in the international arena as an "image of independence," should become a republic before the year 2000, and should change its national flag, which is similar in design to the British ensign, in due time. There are profound root causes for the challenges that the British "three-circle diplomacy" is facing. Britain was once very glorious, but this glory has become history. Economic statistics show that British industry has been in an accelerated decline, and its proportion in international manufacturing production, trade, and GNP have fallen sharply. Over the past few years, the country has been bogged down in a serious economic recession and so far has lacked the strength to recover. Just as the British magazine the ECONOMIST has stated, "Britain's real significance has been on the wane to a considerable extent." Economic reality has made people realize that "its position of strength of the past is gone forever." The radical changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the reunification of Germany, and the conclusion of the Cold War have fundamentally changed the international environment which Britain has relied upon to maneuver and carry out its foreign policies. First, the end of the Cold War noticeably weakened the British position and influence. Being a victorious nation in World War II and the second largest economic power in the capitalist world in early post-war years, and backed up by the "special British-U.S. relationship," Britain played an important role in the formation and development of the international political and economic order after World War II. With the lapse of the Cold War era, however, the importance of the military factor in the relations of the Western alliance have declined, while that of economic factors has risen remarkably. Thus, its political superiority -- based on its military capability and its role in the defense of the West -- has been deteriorating imperceptibly. Moreover, united Germany has grown to be the number one economic power in Europe and occupies an increasingly important position of leadership in the EC with every passing day. As a result, in foreign affairs the United States is leaning more toward Germany as the days go by. Second, U.S. foreign policy specialists maintain that the "future of the world lies in Asia." Asia's position in the U.S. global strategy has risen somewhat, and the relationship between the United States and the Western European countries, including Britain, is facing new readjustments. Although Britain's national strength is far from what it was in the past, the British Government has not redefined its position and policy goals according to the new international pattern. Conversely, it has continued to pursue Churchill's "three-circle diplomacy." This is a tough problem for British diplomacy. Therefore, the British press maintains that Britain's foreign policy goals are in urgent need of further readjustment." A senior British Government official also said a short time ago that Britain will lose its international influence -- which it still possesses -- unless it reevaluates its foreign policy goals and refrains from sticking its nose in everybody's business.
