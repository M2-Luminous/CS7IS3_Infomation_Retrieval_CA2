What is the nature of this action? Will you resort to another option other than the option of a political solution? 'Abbas: Struggle is an integral and indivisible whole. However, any action necessitates a reaction, especially when you see your people being slaughtered. You must then look for an appropriate action. We have not relinquished armed struggle. As an organization, we still believe that armed struggle is a major tool to attain our people's rights in Palestine. Developments are escalating, and they are all related to what has taken place. We have great hope that God will grant us success and help us wipe away the tears of the widows and console the children who have lost their fathers and brothers. [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Majid: The way you deal with the national Palestinian rights is to some extent similar to that of Hamas. Do you have contacts with this movement? 'Abbas: As an organization, we have carried out armed struggle for more than a quarter of a century in a continuous manner that has left its imprint in the national, Arab, and international arenas. We have never been negligent in this field. Our vision has always been clear and it will remain so. Hamas and other organizations have similar ideas. In one way or another, we have contacts with the Palestinian forces that work within the national framework, regardless of their political stands. The closer their stands become to ours, the closer we become to these Palestinian organizations. We view Hamas with special appreciation, and we have contacts with it. I say contacts and not an alliance. These contacts might be developed. This depends on how close our political stands become in the future regarding struggle in our homeland. 'Abd-al-Majid: But do not you see that there is a contradiction between armed struggle and political action within the PLO framework? 'Abbas: This is an integration, not a contradiction. We are represented in the PLO and the PLO Executive Committee. We have developed relations with factions and forces that are outside the PLO framework. We also have relations with factions that left the PLO or that have adopted a certain stand toward the PLO leadership such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Our concept of integration is based on our reading of the PLO's current situation. In our opinion, the PLO still constitutes the moral entity of the people. In other words, it is the state of the Palestinians. [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Majid: Do you have any advice for the PLO leadership? 'Abbas: Everyday carries new evidence of the blind and erroneous political course -- its uselessness, the extent of the harm it has inflicted on our people and cause, and the losses which could have been averted if the PLO had redressed its course, especially since there are no signs or indications regarding substantive Israeli concessions. There were huge national losses, and the Israeli and American demands are pushing the PLO toward making still further concessions. In addition to this, repressive and oppressive measures are still continuing, and they were crowned by the Hebron massacre. The only advice I have to the PLO leadership is to leave, unhesitatingly, this quagmire that it has led our people into, before the catastrophe becomes complete. [passage omitted]
