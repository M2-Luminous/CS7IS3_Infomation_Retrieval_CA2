The show of solidarity was to have begun with a rally addressed by ANC President Nelson Mandela and Namibian President Sam Nujoma in Windhoek on January 27, but Mr Mandela cancelled his visit. ANC spokesman Gill Marcus said the ANC President had other engagements. SWAPO Secretary-General Moses Garoeb said senior ANC and SWAPO officials would address meetings and rallies across Namibia to raise money for the ANC's election coffers. He said SWAPO's support for the ANC was part of the responsibility it felt towards South Africa. SWAPO was confident of, and hoped for an ANC landslide victory and felt a need to contribute in the same way the ANC had helped SWAPO to victory in the 1989 Namibian elections. Mr Garoeb said SWAPO believed the ANC, with its "pragmatic and experienced leadership", was the party best structured to manage a post-election South Africa and keep southern Africa stable. Money would be raised at SWAPO branch and regional level in cooperation with the National Union of Namibian Workers. Mr Garoeb appealed to all South Africans living in Namibia to register and vote for the ANC on April 27. In an editorial on Monday, the Windhoek Advertiser warned that SWAPO's support for the ANC risked drawing Namibia into a partisan role in a potential future civil war. "In the event of a troubled South Africa plunging into civil strife of proportions where factions go over to guerrilla war and unrestricted sabotage, Namibia will not be spared. Our allegiance with the ANC will under such circumstances be on the debit side of Namibia's interests," wrote editor Hannes Smith. Mr Garoeb dismissed Mr Smith's comment as the "cry-baby attitude and professional negativism from a confirmed pessimist" who could not see anything good about the SWAPO government.
