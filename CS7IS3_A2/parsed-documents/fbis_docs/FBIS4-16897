It lasted 18 months, and two contenders came forward just a day before the offer to tender expired. This despite the fact that a presentation about the tender had been given in the United States. There was essentially no choice. The winner was a consortium of foreign companies, represented by the Swiss firm of "IMEG Management SA." The contenders had proposed conducting a full range of work with hydrocarbons over a territory of 2,870 square kilometers. Just what will the Russian side get in return? If a certain level of extraction is achieved, the oblast's social support fund will receive $6 million. The minimum expenditure on the work over the course of five years is being put at 46 million [currency unspecified]. There is another side to things as well. Also taking part in the project will be the "Tomskneft" Joint-Stock Company and the "Tomskneftegazgeologiya" State Geological Enterprise, both of which have been in a difficult economic position. This will allow them to step up their search for hydrocarbons and to create new jobs. The comprehensive prospecting for oil and gas on a contractual basis will make it possible to effectively implement the oblast's gas program. The Russian side will receive several hundred million dollars in proceeds from the project as a whole. And all this through foreign investment, without any spending by us. The license agreement should be signed by 1 July this year. It is also necessary to elaborate the economic basis of the contract in more detail. Then it may be possible to start counting our oil "chickens." The results of the first offer to tender have also shown that foreigners are in no great hurry to invest in the shaky Russian economy. The hopes that the tendering commission would be inundated with envelopes bearing the logos of the big guns of the international oil business were not at all borne out.
