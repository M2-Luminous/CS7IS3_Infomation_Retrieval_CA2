That was made possible by two massive campaigns in the past four decades to harness the Huaihe River, the fourth longest river in China. The campaigns involved an investment of 27.3 billion yuan jointly by the central government and local governments in the valley, including 184 counties and cities within the jurisdiction of central China's Henan, east China's Shandong, Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces. The first campaign was launched in 1950 by the late Chairman Mao Zedong shortly after the Huaihe River overflowed in the summer of the year, causing heavy casualties. The second one was waged by the central government in 1991 following devastating floods in the valley which killed at least 1,000 people and caused 32.7 billion yuan of direct losses. China has decided on a plan to spend about 12 billion yuan during 1991-2000 on improving the valley's flood control ability as part of its efforts to harness the river. As part of the campaigns, 5,300 reservoirs have been built, new rivers for the passage of flood water into the sea dug and many other flood control and irrigation facilities, such as pumping stations, set up. The large-scale water conservancy construction has brought about fundamental changes to the region's agricultural production. Water control and irrigation facilities have been improved for 65 percent of the region's total cultivated land, or nearly eight million ha [hectares], which used to be vulnerable to water-logging. The yearly grain output for the valley exceeds 60 million tons, or an average of 428 kg per head of the 140 million people of the region, more than the region's total consumption. So the region each year supplies about 16 million tons of grain to other parts of the country or for industrial purposes. The northern Jiangsu plain within the valley -- 60 percent of Jiangsu Province's farmland, 2.93 million ha -- used to be a corridor for flood water, and floods occurred in the past in nine out of every ten years. The frequent floods led to hunger and even massive uprisings in the region's history. As a result of the establishment of the flood controls, irrigation systems and other water conservancy projects in the plain, the per unit yield in the plain doubled and the per capita grain output tripled. The improved flood-control and irrigation capacity has also boosted the production of fruit, tea and fresh-water aquatic products.
