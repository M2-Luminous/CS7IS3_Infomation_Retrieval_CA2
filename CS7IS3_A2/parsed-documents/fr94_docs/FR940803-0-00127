FR940803-0-00127 FR940803-0-00040 ( 1 ) The lower range values shall be determined by multiplying the city and highway estimates by 0.85, then rounding to the next lower integer value. ( 2 ) The upper range values shall be determined by multiplying the city and highway estimates by 1.15 and rounding to the next higher integer value. (iii)(A) A statement: ``For comparison shopping, all [vehicles/trucks] classified as [insert category as determined in §600.315] have been issued mileage ratings ranging from XXX to XXX mpg city and XXX to XXX mpg highway.'' (The range values are those determined in accordance with §600.311.); or, when applicable, (B) A statement: ``A range of fuel economy values for other [vehicles/trucks] classified as [insert category as determined in §600.315] is not available at this time.'' or by the statement: ``Not available.'' (iv)(A) The statement: ``Estimated Annual Fuel Cost:'' followed by the appropriate value calculated in accordance with paragraph (g) or (h) of this section. The estimated annual fuel cost value for alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel vehicles to appear on the fuel economy label shall be that calculated based on operating the vehicle on gasoline or diesel fuel as determined in §600.307(g) and (h). At the manufacturers option, the label may also contain the estimated annual fuel cost value based on operating the vehicle on the alternative fuel. (B) At the manufacturers option, it may include the fuel cost and the annual mileage interval used to determine the annual fuel cost. (v) For the 1986 model year only, the statement: ``Under EPA's previous fuel economy program, used prior to the 1985 model year, this [vehicle/truck] would have received a single estimate of [insert unadjusted city value rounded to the nearest whole mpg, as determined in §600.207(b)] mpg.'' (vi)(A) The Gas Guzzler statement, when applicable (see paragraph (f) of this section), must be centered on a separate line between the bottom border and the Estimated Annual Fuel Cost statements. The words ``Gas Guzzler'' shall be highlighted. (B) The type size shall be at least as large as the largest type size in the bottom 50 percent of the label. (vii)(A) For alcohol-fueled, and natural gas-fueled automobiles, the statement: ``*This vehicle operates on [insert appropriate fuel(s)] only.'' shall appear above the bottom border. The phrase shall be in lower case in a medium condensed type except for the fuels listed which shall be capitalized in a bold condensed type no smaller than 12 points in size. (B) For natural gas-fueled automobiles, the statements: ``All fuel economy values on this label pertain to gasoline equivalent fuel economy. To convert these values into units of miles per 100 cubic feet of natural gas, multiply by 0.823.'' At the manufacturers option, the statement ``To convert these values into units of miles per 100 cubic feet of natural gas, multiply by 0.823.'' may be replaced by the statement ``The fuel economy in units of miles per (insert units used in retail) is estimated to be (insert city fuel economy value) in the city, and (insert highway fuel economy value) on the highway. (C) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles, the statement: ``This vehicle operates on [insert gasoline or diesel as appropriate] and [insert other fuel(s) as appropriate].'' shall appear above the bottom border. The phrase shall be in lower case in a medium condensed type except for the words ``gasoline'' or ``diesel'' (as appropriate) and the other fuels listed, which shall be capitalized in a bold condensed type no smaller than 12 points in size. (viii) For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel automobiles, the statement: ``All fuel economy values on this label pertain to [insert gasoline or diesel as appropriate] fuel usage. [insert other fuel(s) as appropriate] fuel(s) usage will yield different values. See the FREE FUEL ECONOMY GUIDE for information on [insert other fuel(s)] .'' At the manufacturers option, the above statements may be replaced by the statement ``The fuel economy while using [insert appropriate fuel (example ``M85)] is estimated to be [insert city fuel economy value and appropriate units] in the city and [insert highway fuel economy value and appropriate units] on the highway. See the FREE FUEL ECONOMY GUIDE for other information on [insert appropriate fuel]. (4) The maximum type size for the statements located in the lower 50 percent of the label shall not exceed 10 points in size, except as provided for in paragraphs (a)(3)(vii)(A) and (B) of this section. (b)(1) The city mpg number shall be displayed on the left and the highway mpg number displayed on the right. (2)(i) Except for the digit ``one,'' each mpg digit shall measure at least 0.35 inches by 0.6 inches (9x15mm) in width and height respectively. (ii) The digit ``one,'' shall measure at least 0.2 inches by 0.6 inches (5x15mm) in width and height respectively. (3) The strike width of each mpg digit shall be at least 0.075 inches (1.9mm). (4)(i) MPG digits not printed as a single character shall be made of a matrix of smaller characters. This matrix shall be at least four characters wide by five characters high (with the exception of three characters wide for the numerical character denoting ``one''.) (ii) The small characters shall be made of successive overstrikes to form a reasonably dark and continuous line that approximates a single large character. (5)(i) If manufacturer chooses to enlarge the label from that depicted in Appendix VIII of this part, the logo and the fuel economy label values, including the titles ``CITY MPG'' and ``HIGHWAY MPG,'' must be increased in the same proportion. (ii) The area bounded by the bottom of the fuel pump logo to the top of the border must continue to represent at least 50 percent of the available label area. (c) The vehicle description on general labels will be as follows: (1) Model year;
