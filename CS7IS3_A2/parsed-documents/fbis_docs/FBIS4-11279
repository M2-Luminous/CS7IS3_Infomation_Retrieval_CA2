FBIS4-11279 "drlat080_a_94010" FBIS-LAT-94-080 Daily Report 26 April 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Poll Shows 65 Percent of Public Optimistic Poll Shows 65 Percent of Public Optimistic FL2504204194 FL2504204194 BFN [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1600 GMT on 25 April carries its "Straight Talk" program with host Osvaldo Rodriguez and his guest, reporter Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine. The topic of the discussion is: What country do we live in today? Rodriguez and Sexto point out that Cuba is overcoming the economic crisis. Although there are pessimists who believe that all is lost, Sexto points out that Cuba is poised on the runway, ready for takeoff. Rodriguez focuses on two words used by Sexto in his arguments: ignorance and pessimism. Rodriguez says that those who cannot see the progress are more ignorant than pessimistic. He believes that many people will have to see progress in their own homes before they can believe. Sexto points out that Cuba has developed its infrastructure during the past 30 years. He says: "Nowadays there is a trend toward denying all that has been accomplished in Cuba during the past 30 years. In other words, we are in these circumstances and what we did in the past is no longer good. Of course, they do not realize that external factors are greatly influencing the internal reality of Cuba." Sexto goes on to say that there are many signs of recovery: "Every time a factory goes into operation, Cuba advances a millimeter down the runway for its takeoff. A few months back, we put the cardboard factory in Santa Cruz del Norte into operation. That is good news. We believe the current sugar harvest will be a bit better than the past harvest. If we produce 1,000 tons more, than we will have grown another millimeter in our situation. We will have produced more than last year." Rodriguez points out that there have been other achievements: "Now that you are talking about accomplishments, I should remind you that in the first quarter 305,000 tons of oil were extracted from Cuban soil. This represents a 12-percent growth in relation to the goal for that quarter. It also represents an increase in comparison to last year." Regarding this, Sexto replies: "That is a record high figure. In other words, during the month of January, oil workers worked very hard. There are some who say that no one works in this country. Nevertheless, the oil workers have rejected that superficial and incomplete vision that is circulating." With regard to the tobacco, pharmaceuticals, and oil industries, Sexto points out: "In the past, the tobacco crops suffered some deterioration. I believe there has been a recovery in this area. This year we have had a good harvest. "I also understand that the income from biotechnological and biopharmaceutical products is increasing. We also know that our nickel is selling well. It is even being marketed, if I am not mistaken, in more than 20 countries and its price has increased. "As you mentioned just seconds ago, oil extraction has increased. The possibility of finding better oil and in greater quantities may not be an off-the-wall possibility. It may be a very serious possibility. Some people have said that those are real possibilities. In other words, we have foreign companies which have invested a large sum of money in this country and I believe that no one invests money blindly and foolishly. I believe there must be a certainty, a certain guarantee that what is being invested will not be lost." Regarding the economy and public opinion, Sexto says: "There is a poll that indicates that 65 percent of the those questioned believe that with the gradual application of measures that will be adopted in the next few months, our economy will benefit." Rodriguez remarks: "That same survey points out that only 1.4 percent of those questioned believe that there is no need for measures." Sexto concludes by saying: "That 65 percent believes that the economic measures that will be adopted in the next few months will gradually help improve the country indicates that there is a tendency toward optimism. Workers truly trust in the strategy that our country has followed to overcome this difficult situation." "Straight Talk" ends at 1615 GMT.
