Rice: Delsoin pointed out that it is important not only to supply the local market with quality rice in sufficient amounts but also to protect and encourage national production while assuring a reasonable retail price. To help bring down the retail price of imported rice, the commerce minister suggests luring traditional importers into ordering in groups and urging them to apply to the Finance Ministry for customs rights on an inclusive basis of 12.50 gourdes per sack instead of the ad valorem tax of 40 percent currently in effect. Sugar: One of the Commerce Ministry's major difficulties in regulating this market lies in the 6 December 1990 decree that created CONASUC, the National Sugar Council, thereby granting the sugar factories a de facto monopoly on sugar imports. While continuing to allow importers and nonmanufacturers to import sugar, the minister announced that he would meet the concerned parties in the coming days to discuss restructuring and would then proceed to price revisions. Asked about the Jonassaint government's real commercial and industrial priorities, Delsoin said he will attack the nongovernmental organizations [NGO] first in order to control their actions. [Delsoin] "The NGOs are not obliged to trade, by definition. We notice nowadays, however, that they control businesses. Three ministers have committed themselves to the struggle for strict control of those NGOs. Press releases have been issued, so everyone knows that the government is studying the matter. Using someone else's words: We are serious about this. ``There is a third area that we are very concerned about, but confidentiality is required.'' [Jean] Another confidential area involves fuel controls. He said he refrained from making public statements so as not to annoy some friends: [Delsoin] "Given the current circumstances, the Ministry -- meaning [word indistinct] of oil embargo -- the Ministry lost its authority in this area. Officially, we do not receive oil. Officially, we do not have oil. Thus, it is impossible for a state institution to have any control over this area. It would be like denouncing friends. In brief, I think the state is unable to intervene directly in this area."
