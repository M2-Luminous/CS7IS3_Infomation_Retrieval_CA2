In this winter's conscription, there were some 12.6 million applicants, with some 800,000 allowed to have health checks in the wake of their initial examinations. The number of new recruits who went underwent political examination and health checks with final recruitment approval was some 375,000, of which, young people from large and medium-sized cities accounted for 47 percent (greatly exceeding the original quota of 13 percent), young people from townships and towns accounted for 29 percent, those with a high school education or equivalent accounted for 62 percent, those with a cadre family background accounted for 16 percent, and those who were communists or Communist Youth League members themselves accounted for 38 percent. According to the "Internal Newsletter," conscription work this year has been the smoothest in eight years. In the seven preceding years, conscription quotas in urban areas were fulfilled only twice, in 1988 and 1992, but the quota was basically not fulfilled in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, and 1991. In 1987 and 1991 particularly, only 78 percent of the quota was fulfilled. Although the quota was fulfilled in 1988, the cultural quality was not up to requirements. In addition, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Liaoning, and Hubei were criticized in a circular for their poor conscription work. This year, however, conscription work has been comparatively smooth in those provinces and cities enjoying comparatively fast economic development and higher living standards and cultural levels, such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Hubei, Shandong, Shanghai and Beijing, and young people were competing to submit their applications. The number of young people in employment or at school applying to military institutions even doubled that of 1985, the highest for a decade. "Craze for Doing Business" Pounds At "Craze for Joining the Army" Why has conscription work been so smooth this year? Liu Huaqing, a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee and concurrently Central Military Commission vice chairman, said: "We have done conscription work this winter by observing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building and running the Army, based on China's national conditions as well as the progress of the times, and the principle of combining political propaganda, ideological education, treatment in pay and benefits as well as job arrangements. Facts evidence that such practice is correct. That is the success of reform in conscription work." He made the above statement at a seminar on modern warfare sponsored by the Air Force Advanced Military Institute on 18 December. A well-informed source said that young people in mainland China used to have a sense of honor as well as superiority when enlisting in the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's, and they would enjoy a brighter future. When their enlistment expired, they might continue to serve in the Army as cadres, with higher average wages than ordinary staffers and workers and even cadres in localities. Even when they were demobilized, generally better job arrangements were made for them, and those who originally came from rural areas might transfer their residence registration to urban areas. That being the case, young people vied to be enlisted. Some of them even managed to join the Army through their connections or the back door, and the "craze for joining the Army" could be found everywhere in mainland China. However, with the deepening of reform and opening up in the 1980's and 1990's, especially the development of the market economy, there has been a repetition of the "craze for doing business"; many young people have made profits in business and have greatly improved their living standards. They have seen that those who joined the Army did not enjoy a brighter future than those who remained civilians; naturally, they changed their concepts and no longer believed that joining the Army was the best choice for the future. In addition, some young people learned that in recent years, the wage income of military cadres had gradually fallen behind staffers, workers and cadres in localities, and even their dependents working in coastal areas, special economic zones, and economically developed areas. Furthermore, if they were stationed at frontier posts characterized by hardship and remoteness, they could suffer psychological imbalance resulted from material differences in addition to possibly sacrificing their lives at any time, and they flinched from joining the Army. In short, the "craze for doing business" buffeted the "craze for joining the Army," and conscription work was impeded. Remove Anxieties For One's Future After Enlistment Aiming at such conditions while dealing with the needs of the Army subject to the overall situation of aggregate national construction at a Central Military Commission discussion meeting on 1 November 1984, Deng Xiaoping indicated: "Training people for both military and civilian jobs is also in the general interest. Our Army has been doing a good job in this respect and has much to its credit. That's fine. The Army trains these people in the interests of national development, and local authorities will warmly welcome the trainees. Such training will make it easier for demobilized cadres and soldiers to be transferred to civilian jobs." Not long ago, when Deng Xiaoping learned about the difficulties in conscription work, he said: "Reform is also called for in conscription work; first, quality should be insured, and second, it is necessary to a good job of making arrangements for the livelihood, jobs, and housing of new recruits as well as officers and men in active service after demobilization." In line with Deng Xiaoping's instruction, the Central Military Commission conducted reform of conscription work, and set out the aforesaid "principle of combining political propaganda, ideological education, treatment in pay and benefits as well as work arrangements." The spirit of this principle lies in the demand that it is necessary to do political and ideological work in conscription work, as well as resolve practical problems. "Treatment in pay and benefits" means a new recruit during his enlistment will continue to enjoy his original pay and benefits along with subsidies, and readjustments in wages and promotion will also be conducted according to his original work unit. "Work arrangements" means that when those demobilized servicemen return to work in the city, their wages will be set one grade higher than those of staffers and workers during that period, and an outstanding demobilized serviceman or one with a record of meritorious service may enjoy wages two grades higher, and all units that have conditions should give priority to them in the distribution of housing. Regarding demobilized servicemen who return to rural areas, prefectural and county governments should give priority to them in making arrangements for them to work in local government organizations, enterprises, and institutions according to their performance during their enlistment, their speciality, and educational background. Their wages should be determined with reference to the length of enlistment, and an additional 20 percent of the area's average annual income per capita would be considered appropriate; in addition, their relocation allowance should generally not be lower than 5,000 yuan. The aforesaid reform has succeeded in relieving young people's anxieties for the future after enlistment. Furthermore, over the past few years, units have universally attached importance to bringing up people for both military and civilian jobs in various forms, including training people on the job, transferring them to new posts, self-study through correspondence courses, and building bases for concentrated training in rotation, thus creating better conditions for the broad officers and men seeking knowledge and becoming qualified people as well as employment after demobilization. Consequently, resistance to conscription work has been greatly reduced over the past two years. Worrying About "Defeating Oneself" The well-informed source added that, despite a basic solution to conscription work difficulties, the Army's political quality had became a conspicuous issue. Since the beginning of this year, senior commanders such as Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and the director of Deng Xiaoping's office, Wang Ruilin, have made inspections and fact-finding tours of various military regions, and they all found that how the Army should bring forward the fine traditions and maintain the true colors of the old Red Army under the new situation of developing the socialist market economy was a serious issue. Old generals, including Yang Dezhi, Yang Chengwu, and Xiao Ke have also written to Deng Xiaoping and the Central Military Commission indicating that are many problems among the troops, especially that there was no time to lose in resolving problems with the Army's political quality. That being the case, the Central Military Commission and the General Political Department convoked a "Discussion Meeting on Army Ideological and Political Work" in Guangzhou in mid-May. In its wake, Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, the two vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission, signed an important article in the 26 July issue of RENMIN RIBAO, on the eve of the 66th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], to discuss the extreme importance of the Army bringing forward its fine traditions under the new situation. The understanding of the Army shared by the CPC top echelon is that the Army is facing a new test while China enters a period of peacetime construction with building the socialist market economic structure as the goal. With the development of the market economy, officers and men will gradually enhance their concepts of competition, effect [xiao yi 2400 4135], time, and the legal system; all this is conducive to Army modernization. Nevertheless, in the wake of expanding opening up, some decadent ideas and lifestyles will seize their opportunity to infiltrate the Army. These things, together with some remnants of feudal ideas left over from Chinese history, will shape into money worship, hedonism, and ultra-individualism, which will corrupt and erode the ideals and faith of the officers and men. There have been many examples in Chinese and foreign history where armies became lordly, luxury- loving, lax, and idle, indulged in pleasure, and lost their combat effectiveness under a peaceful environment, which was shrouded in an atmosphere of singing and dancing to extol the good times, with civil officials indolent and military officials frivolous. Consequently these armies were defeated by peace, and themselves. We must draw lessons from this to avoid the repetition of such a tragedy. In actual fact, Deng Xiaoping advised the military top echelons on the eve of the 14th CPC Congress in October 1992 that the Army must bring forth its fine traditions and maintain the Red Army's true color. In the wake of the 14th CPC Congress, Chairman Jiang Zemin of the Central Military Commission gave a systematic discussion on the PLA's fine traditions, which he generalized into 10 aspects. However, the value concepts of officers and men vary today; under conditions where the spirit of hard struggle and selfless devotion is being eroded, it is difficult to continue education in tradition. Western strategists are expressing doubt about the combat effectiveness of the PLA, which is now "looking forward to money," and believe that should such a trend continue, worse than that could happen. It has been learned that the Central Military Commission has already set forth that "arming the thinking of the broad officers and men" with Deng Xiaoping's ideological theory is the basic task of political work in the Army; at the same time, the improvement of conditions and administration will be supplemented so that officers and men might establish the correct outlook on life, values, and ethical concepts. Nevertheless, some military cadres who have a good inside knowledge of the military have expressed their doubts about the effectiveness of such an approach on the grounds that corrupt phenomena have already become far too serious!
