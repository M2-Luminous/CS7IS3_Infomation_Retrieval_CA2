FR940922-1-00031 FR940922-1-00008 Section 110(k)(5) provides that EPA may issue a SIP call whenever it finds a SIP for an area to be substantially inadequate to attain or maintain the NAAQS, to mitigate adequately interstate transport under sections 176A or 184, or to otherwise comply with any requirement of the Act. EPA is proposing to interpret section 110(k)(5) to mean that it may issue a SIP call based on a finding that a SIP does not comply with the requirement of the section 110(a)(2)(D) to address adequately the effect of pollution transport on downwind attainment and maintenance. EPA may require that the states revise their SIPs to include any particular measure that is necessary to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D). EPA believes that the ``necessary'' standard requires the Agency to evaluate the emissions reductions needed, and then whether reasonable and practicable alternative measures could be adopted instead of the OTC LEV program to achieve the needed reductions. The role of ``alternatives'' in EPA's analysis has often been confused in the course of EPA's hearings and round-table proceedings. EPA believes two distinct kinds of alternatives are relevant to necessity. First, an alternative program to achieve the same emissions reductions from the same emissions sources may render the OTC LEV program unnecessary. An example is useful to illustrate this point. If EPA or the states were (hypothetically) to mandate that all new motor vehicles be ZEVs, then an OTC LEV program would not be necessary_it would not make sense (and would be unnecessary) to mandate OTC LEV tailpipe standards for a new vehicle fleet consisting entirely of cars without tailpipes. This would be true regardless of what emissions reductions are needed overall and what other measures are available to achieve the needed reductions. It is in this sense that EPA believes that OTC LEV would be unnecessary if there were another program available to achieve emissions reductions from new motor vehicles comparable to, or greater than, those from OTC LEV. Under this aspect of the analysis, the ability of the alternative to achieve reductions sufficient to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D) is not relevant. EPA is aware of alternative programs that currently are under discussion by various interested parties. EPA believes that some alternative programs could be preferable to simply approving the petition. Such alternatives focus on a 49-state approach, whereby auto manufacturers would commit to produce cars with a cleaner internal combustion engine (compared to current federal standards) nationwide. Incentives for advanced technology and zero emission vehicles are also part of the discussion. As these alternatives are developed and modeling of associated benefits is undertaken, EPA will add the analyses to the docket and publish a notice of data availability in the Federal Register . EPA believes that a 49-state low emission vehicle approach could be better than the OTC LEV program in a number of respects. First, EPA believes that a 49-state program could have significant environmental benefits as compared to the OTC LEV program. A 49-state approach could benefit the OTR by reducing incoming pollution from other states_both transported air pollution and pollution from the migration of non-OTR vehicles into the state (as a result both of tourism and relocation). A 49-state approach would also help non-OTR states by providing NO X and VOC reductions and other air quality benefits. EPA also believes that an alternative could provide equal or greater impetus to development of advanced technology. Second, the auto industry would benefit from uniform markets. See discussion in Section IV.A.2.(d) for a discussion of the benefits of uniform markets. The auto industry plays a vital role in our economy. Reducing the economic impacts of EPA's actions, without reducing environmental benefits are matters of concern to the Agency. Once these 49-state alternatives are further developed, EPA intends to complete a qualitative and quantitative comparison of their environmental benefits relative to the OTC LEV program. The Agency will then publish, as soon as possible, a Federal Register notice setting forth the alternative and taking comment on issues it raises.
