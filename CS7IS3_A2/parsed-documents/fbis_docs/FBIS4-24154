Good evening to both of you. Dr. Hartzenberg, if I could start with you, what exactly is your objection to the Volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] Council? [Hartzenberg] Good evening, Freek. I think we have to look first at what our ideal is -- our objective, our mission. What are we striving for? Let me sum it up like this: The Afrikaner nation may be the nation with the strongest desire for freedom in the world -- not at the cost of others, but to be itself, to be free in its own fatherland, to coexist and live in harmony with other nations in South Africa -- in other words, to have political sovereignty, to have its own territorial security, and to be able to work with all other nations economically and in all other spheres. Our objection to the Volkstaat Council is both the constitution and the accord; these limit the Volkstaat Council and exclude that possibility because.... [Robinson, interrupting] I'm not sure about that. In any case, I have that constitutional principle here before me, and I can't see those aspects being excluded, perhaps not exactly in the way that you would want. So perhaps you must define exactly how you want it. [Hartzenberg] I say, a sovereign state....[pauses] We also made proposals at Kempton Park, where we proposed that there should be a confederal order in South Africa so that those nations that want full self-determination can get it, and others that want other forms can also get them, so that all can cooperate in a confederation. But we want political sovereignty, and economic and other forms of cooperation. The constitutional principle there is one of 34. All the other 33 constitutional principles are compulsory. They stipulate that this and that will be like this. The very first one says South Africa must be one single sovereign state. In other words, that principle already excludes self-determination in the context that we want it -- complete freedom. It excludes that. That same constitutional principle also says that while South Africa's population as a whole must have self-determination, there can also be self-determination for any community or nation. [Robinson] That does not rule out the possibility that on the basis of culture and language there could very well be a region, whether inside South Africa or in any other recognized way -- another recognized way.... [Hartzenberg, interrupting] The point is, that region and that self-determination -- the farthest you can go with it is to create a 10th province, in other words, a province which will not have complete freedom and complete self-determination. It will still be under a central government with a tremendous amount of power, which will determine the education policy and the economic policy; which will dominate in all aspects; in other words, that is the most you can get. [Robinson] Did you discuss that with President Mandela when you saw him on the three occasions; and does he agree with the fact that there is no way possible for you to establish an independent state? [Hartzenberg] I discussed this thing with President Mandela, even long before the election, and he knows exactly what are the aspirations of our nation. The example which I cited is: If the Swazi people can be free and independent, and can live with everybody in South Africa in harmony and cooperation, then it is also a right to which the Afrikaner nation is entitled. [Robinson] What was his reaction? [Hartzenberg] He said he understands what we mean. But you have heard that several speakers in the ANC say no self-determination, no volkstaat for the Afrikaner, and that is exactly the problem. And that is why we did not support that constitutional principle in Parliament, as it does not make provision for full freedom and self- determination. That is why we did not sign the accord; that is why we did not participate in the election. [Robinson] Can we just ask General Viljoen in Cape Town -- do you also see this principle and the Volkstaat Council's function limited, as Dr. Hartzenberg sees it, that you do not have the option -- even if you wanted -- to have an independent state? [Viljoen] I want to start by differing with you, Freek, when you said that there was a deep-rooted difference of opinion. I think there are only differences regarding the way to achieve it, but what Dr. Hartzenberg has just explained about the striving for freedom, I agree with that. The striving for freedom is something that we all agree on, and the ultimate objective that we are striving for is definitely also the same. I personally did negotiate, and I tried several times to. There is probably nobody else who tried harder to negotiate for a more positive constitutional principle than number 34. We would very much have liked this principle, as Dr. Hartzenberg also mentioned....[pauses] Now we come to the question: Is it still relevant or not? The fact is, as I see it, that the only way -- other than war -- that one can pursue to get a volkstaat is to use the constitutionally-provided system for that purpose. [Robinson] I understand that, General. But can we clarify this point? Do you believe that this principle is so limiting that you cannot really become fully independent, even if you wanted to? [Viljoen] I think the difference between this principle and the previous ones lies in the fact that the previous ones all dealt with negotiated aspects, formulated, and that is why they use the word "will." Because -- in the limited time that we had available -- we could not finalize this issue of a volkstaat concept through negotiations with the different parties, the word "will" was not used, but instead the word "can." If we can reach such an agreement, I believe it is quite possible to be able to resolve this matter. The council says very clearly that different forms of self- determination -- and in my opinion that does not exclude the full negotiated approval of all the various parties.... [Robinson, interrupting] But what is your personal point of view? Reading between the lines, it seems you are not personally in favor of a totally independent homeland? [Viljoen] I wouldn't put it that way. Let's look at the economy. A totally independent homeland would imply that you would also be economically independent. And what about foreign affairs? In our talks with the ANC, we have discussed the issue, and even when we were still in the National Front, we felt that foreign affairs was a function which the homeland would most probably delegate to the central government. So in these two areas it becomes clear that it would be very difficult to create such a fully independent homeland immediately. If there was an area in South Africa where it was obvious that we had a majority, where it was almost a mere formality to draw borders, it would be easy. But we still have to form a homeland, and it will depend on the Afrikaners themselves, so it may be necessary to promote their independent homeland in phases. That is why it is important to me that we now stand together to try to get started on these phases. [Robinson] Your response, Dr. Hartzenberg? [Hartzenberg] Freek, I also believe that we may achieve our freedom in stages, and not in our first attempt. But what is important is that one should not accept the first phase as the final phase and then enter into agreements which bind one to decisions taken, and surrender the right to eventual sovereignty. [Robinson] It seems that the difference between you and Gen. Viljoen is that you stand firm on the issue of an independent state. [Hartzenberg] Look, that is our goal and we will not rest until we have achieved it. I am not prepared to surrender that goal. The Palestinians have now reached a settlement with the Israelis, but they do not have full sovereignty. They accept the settlement; they say it is not their final goal, but that they will press on. The unfortunate thing in our case is that the agreements and the constitution say the Volkstaat Council can undertake research and gather information and give advise, but that the Constitutional Assembly will make the final decision. It is the same as if you and I agree to a sale, and agree that when I have bought the article, I will decide what price to pay. If I then offer to pay you one cent for the article, you will not be able to claim that you were depending on my being reasonable. You will have to accept what we agreed upon. That is why we say if we bind ourselves to these agreements under the constitution, we will leave the right to sovereignty in the hands of the ANC or whoever is governing this country. We say we will never surrender the ideal of a free Afrikaner nation living in harmony with other nations. There will be no solution in South Africa unless the various nations have been accommodated according to their wishes. [Robinson] Dr. Hartzenberg, you have established a People's Republic Committee. One assumes that the goal of the committee is the same as that of the Volkstaat Council, except that independence must come first? [Hartzenberg] The function of the Republic Working Committee is to make recommendations, investigate, determine strategies in the constitutional, economic, social, security, education, local government, and other areas, and begin with the practical implementation of certain strategies; and to continue until we achieve our goal of a free Afrikaner nation in a free republic. [Robinson] It seems logical to me that one would expect this committee of yours and the Volkstaat Council to liaise in some way. [Hartzenberg] We would want that to be supplementary. We will have to ensure that our relationship is not confrontational. What is important is that we are operating outside the parliamentary system, and we have an important function to carry out. Remember, the ANC had never been in the parliamentary system. They only entered the parliamentary system when they took power. For years the Democratic Party [DP] propagated certain things, but they came nowhere, achieved nothing, until Dr. Van Zyl Slabbert and Alex Boraine left the system and started operating from outside. And they achieved more than the DP had intended.... [Robinson, interrupting] But there was also the matter of violence, and you said so in public. [Hartzenberg] No, no. It is for that reason that, on the day after the inauguration of the state president, I called his office and asked for a meeting, because I believe it is possible to resolve this issue without violence. [Robinson] Gen. Viljoen, how do you think these two committees or councils will liaise? How will they work together? [Viljoen] Let me begin by saying that the achievement of our ideal of a homeland, of self-determination for the Afrikaner within a homeland, is a matter so closely linked to the future constitution of South Africa that the two cannot easily be separated. Afrikaners should realize that while we are one nation, we have three fairly large parties, and then there are many more smaller parties. So we have to find a mechanism which will allow us to speak with a single voice on the issue of self-determination. If we cannot get that right, we have big problems. We must establish a nonpolitical body. I believe the various political parties should now remain in the background so that we can forget about the contentious political issues and continue with the scientific aspects, the feasibility of the homeland. [Robinson] But there are two bodies, General. How are they going to be reconciled with each other? [Viljoen] No, no, I will come to that. In my opinion this means that we should use the Volkstaat Council as such a body. It is up to the Volkstaat Council to make scientific studies and to present the whole matter. Then from the political side -- I have recently made such a proposition to Dr. Hartzenberg -- we can form a political plenary committee from among the different parties. These ideas, as they are developed by the Volkstaat Council, will be analyzed and will give direction. [Robinson] Doctor, what do you say about that? [Hartzenberg] Freek, the Volkstaat Council has this limitation: It is limited by the constitution and accords to only get as far as a province. And we must be satisfied with that, because if we do not accept it, then we must break the contract. Then we will be taken to court, and the court will find the constitutional body to be right: We have accepted and signed a contract, a contract which we would be breaking. We would then be defying a court decision. If those limitations were eliminated and the Volkstaat Council given an open agenda -- so that it could go as far as full sovereignty -- then we would consider the thing. At the moment, however, the Volkstaat Council is limited. It cannot go past a 10th province, which will be just like the other provinces. [Robinson] Now what are you going to do in the future? [Hartzenberg] Through our national Republic Working Committee we are going to negotiate.... [Robinson, interrupting] With the government? [Hartzenberg] I have discussed the matter with the state president. We are going to make proposals. We are going to make it known in an agenda -- if you will give us that chance -- on all fronts.... [Robinson, interrupting] Directly to him, not through the Volkstaat Council? [Hartzenberg] No, because if we go through the Volkstaat Council, then we accept the limitations that we can only go as far as a province, and our point of departure is: Everybody must know -- including the ANC and the whole world -- our ultimate goal is and remains sovereignty, and if we achieve something along the way, then it will only be a step. It will not be left in the hands of the constitutional body to finally decide on our behalf. If they give us something, we will decide whether that brings us closer to our goal. But we will not abandon out goal along the way. [Robinson] In conclusion, General Viljoen, just briefly on one issue we have not yet touched: Should there be another form of voting just to determine whether there is going to be a homeland? [Viljoen] The interesting part is this -- as I have just said -- we have three fairly big parties. Let us say the proven support at the moment of 640,000 on the provincial level for the Freedom Front is sufficient proven support. If one should add to that the stayaway votes of the Conservative Party, then it becomes majority support, and if we further accept.... [Robinson, interrupting] But that support has to be demonstrated. [Viljoen] But that is the problem. At the moment 640,000 is already sufficient proven support. The point I am making is that if one considers that there are also others, and if one considers that within the National Party there is considerable enthusiasm for the same idea at the grassroots level, then we do not only have proven support but majority support. But what is very important, Freek -- something that we have to realize -- is that there are no limitations on the goal of a homeland. The limitations apply only to the process of negotiation. But then such constitutional limitations will be exactly the same as when one works directly with the ANC. Whether you are negotiating inside or outside Parliament, the limitations -- if there are any, and I don't think there are -- will be the same. [Robinson] Thank you very much, General. Thank you, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg. It seems there will still be some wrestling in the future to solve this problem. Thank you for your participation.
