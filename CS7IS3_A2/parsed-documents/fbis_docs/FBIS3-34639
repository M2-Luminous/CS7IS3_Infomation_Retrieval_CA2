Sha'th pointed out that the final size of the Jericho area will remain frozen until 'Arafat and Rabin meet. He noted that the Palestinian side signed the map relating to the Jericho area but expressed reservations about it. It is worth noting that Palestinian President 'Arafat balked for a few moments when he was asked to sign one of the maps pertinent to Jericho. He did not want to sign it but then signed it with reservation. Official Palestinian sources in the negotiating delegation said that the Palestinian party's basic objection to the crossings document, which delayed the official signing for more than three hours, focused on the paragraph relating to the administration of the crossing points. These sources said that they tried to get the best conditions under the general Declaration of Principles agreement, which gives Israel the right to be in charge of external security but emphasizes national Palestinian sovereignty. Palestinian sources pointed out that the administration of the crossing points gives Israel the right to have a general director with a Palestinian and an Israeli deputy director. They stressed that the Palestinian party managed to obtain a confirmation of total Palestinian authority over the crossing points, side roads [turuq 'aradiyah], and the settlements [wa akkadat anna al-janib al-filastini istata'a al-husul 'ala ta'kid bi al-sultah al-filastiniyah bil kamil sawa' bi al-nisbah lil ma'abir aw al-turuq al-'aradiyah aw al-mustawtanat]. Noting that the emphasis on Palestinian authority was important, they said that the Palestinian side gave Israel the right to be in charge of external security, including recognition of what the Declaration of Principles agreement outlined on external security. These sources said that according to the agreement, the Palestinian party has the right to coordinate security on the crossing points, side roads, and the settlements. They said that the Palestinian party also obtained the zones outlined in the document under the title "yellow areas," which are the Palestinian areas excluded from the Israeli settlements. Israel has a certain authority over these areas but the Palestinian party has full authority over them.
