Later, a Foreign Office spokesman told reporters that the talks, which lasted for about two hours, were held in a cordial atmosphere. President Kim Il-song said that his country supports the inalienable right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. He said we still adhere to the stand we had taken on the Kashmir issue during the visit of the late Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to the DPRK in 1976. Benazir Bhutto apprised the DPRK president of the Indian policy of brutal repression in Kashmir and occupied Kashmir. She also informed him of the background of the foreign secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan due to be held on Sunday. She emphasized that India should give categorical assurance that state terrorism will be stopped in occupied Kashmir, the siege of the Hazratbal Shrine will be lifted, the number of Indian troops in the occupied valley will be reduced, and the political prisoners in occupied Kashmir will be released. She expressed the hope that India will forsake intransigence and adopt a reasonable attitude. The prime minister also apprised the DPRK leader of Pakistan's stand on nuclear nonproliferation and said that Pakistan is ready to accept restrictions on the proliferation of nuclear weapons at the international and regional levels. In this context, she referred to Pakistan's proposal for a five-nation conference on nuclear nonproliferation, which has been supported by the Chinese Government. She said Pakistan supports the DPRK president's view that after the end of the Cold War, all countries should observe the UN Charter. Bhutto added that Pakistan opposes any country's hegemony or domination over another. In the past, Pakistan and the DPRK have resisted political and economic hegemony and the two countries should hold mutual consultations in this regard in the future as well. Concerning the reunification of the two Koreas, Benazir Bhutto said the people of Korea should settle this issue themselves without any outside interference. The prime minister assured President Kim Il-song that Pakistan is ready to assist in removing differences between the DPRK and the United States on the nuclear issue. President Kim Il-song endorsed the Pakistani prime minister's view that a new global economic system should be evolved through negotiations among the poor countries. He also underscored the need for an exchange of visits of delegations from the two countries to promote cooperation in various fields. The prime minister said Pakistan can benefit from the experience of the DPRK in the social sector because the DPRK has succeeded in alleviating poverty and solving housing problem. She said the two countries will further increase cooperation in the fields of irrigation and hydroelectric schemes. The prime minister invited President Kim Il-song and the DPRK prime minister to visit Pakistan, which was accepted. [passage omitted on Bhutto engagements in Pyongyang and her departure]
