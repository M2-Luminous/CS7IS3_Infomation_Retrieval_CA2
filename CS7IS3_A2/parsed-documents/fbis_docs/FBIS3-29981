Such consortia would have competitive advantages in Asia when they put to use Korea's knowhow in the fields of the construction and operation of nuclear power plants in combination with core technologies of U.S. corporations, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said yesterday. Cooperation in nuclear energy in third countries will be one of the most important agenda items at a bilateral conference on energy and environment scheduled for tomorrow and Saturday, the ministry said. Korea is self-reliant for 93 percent of technology required for the construction of nuclear power plant, the ministry said. The Korean delegation headed by Kim Tae-kon, assistant minister for energy and resources, will also propose the import of energy-saving and recycling technology from the United States and the dispatch of energy experts to Korea, it said. The United States will be represented by John Riggs, principal deputy assistant secretary for policy, planning and program evaluation at the Department of Energy.
