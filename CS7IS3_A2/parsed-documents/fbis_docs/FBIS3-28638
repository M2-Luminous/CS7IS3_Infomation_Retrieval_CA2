FBIS3-28638 "dreas027_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 South Korea `Crucial' Telecom Talks Set With U.S., PRC SK0102030094 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 1 Feb 94 p 3 SK0102030094 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] South Korea will hold crucial bilateral meetings on telecommunications issues with China and the United States, the first since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). On one hand, the meeting with China could broaden South Korea's participation in the modernization of its telecommunications network while that with the U.S. could signal the beginning of pressure for greater domestic market opening. Communications Ministry officials said one of the critical aspects of the meetings is that they are both being held on foreign soil, tomorrow and Thursday and Thursday and Friday in Beijing and Washington respectively. The officials said yesterday that the working level meeting with China will place primary emphasis on the trial operation of Korean-made TDX-10 (time division exchange-10) switching systems in China. China's Ministry of Telecommunications and Posts has yet to approve the testing of the TDX systems in the modernization of their telecommunications network and the meeting is expected to iron out outstanding issues, the officials said. The Chinese telecommunications market represents one of the most lucrative in the world and a number of Korean companies are already operating there in joint ventures to produce switching machines. Led by No Hui-to, the ministry's director of telecommunications promotion, the meeting is mainly a follow up on last year's ministerial meetings in Beijing and Seoul and will also include talks on the agenda for the next high level meeting. Among other issues to be put on the table in Beijing later this week are the scope and timing for joint research and conditions for engaging in joint investments, the officials explained. In Washington, the primary concern will be on examining the two countries' conformance to the record of understanding (ROU) concluded in February 1992 which outlined the liberalization of the Korean market to American companies. As a direct result of the stipulations of the ROU, AT&T qualified to bid in the government's open procurement bidding last August and took home over 17 percent of the switching systems to be installed this year. The meeting, the fourth to be held since the conclusion of the ROU, will be represented by Yim Chong-sin, head of the ministry's telecommunications cooperation commission, and Peter Collins, deputy assistant U.S. trade representative. The ministry officials said the basic purpose of the meeting is to evaluate the extent to which the two sides have been abiding by the contents of the ROU but could prove to be a forum for the U.S. to exert pressure for further and accelerated opening of the Korean market. In the previous meeting in Seoul last October, the U.S. representatives expressed strong interested in the participation of U.S. companies in the lucrative second cellular telephone project, the license for which is due to be awarded sometime in the first half of this year.
