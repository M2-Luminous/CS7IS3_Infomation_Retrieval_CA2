Russian President Boris Yeltsin made this statement today before starting talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The Russian opposition has been saying that "Germany will turn away from Russia completely after the withdrawal of Russian troops and will not help with its reforms, as it had been doing very actively in recent years under the leadership of Helmut Kohl." Answering this opposition, Yeltsin said: "I trust Helmut Kohl--his high moral standards, his decency, and his great political experience. An era of national reconciliation between two countries and two peoples--of Russia and Germany--will begin." The Russian leader stressed that Russia wanted to be a full member of all European organizations. He reminded that Germany would be chair of the leading bodies of the European Union beginning 1 July 1994. "And, of course, we hope for support from Germany for Russia's participation in all of the European and international organizations," Yeltsin said. He especially stressed the importance of Russia as a European state. "Russia is a European country, and one should not forget this fact," the president said. "During the course of today's hopefully peaceful, normal, human, but, of course, political and principled talks, I am sure that we will achieve together with my friend Helmut Kohl a full understanding and will settle the problems that we are facing today. They are there, and it is futile to make a secret of them," the president noted.
