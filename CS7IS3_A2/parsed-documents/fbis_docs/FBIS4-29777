A large-scale outdoor rally seeking to block ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement is slated for Yoido Plaza at 3 P.M. Saturday, with some 20,000 people including members of the National Alliance for Democracy and Unification, Chongukyonhap, and collegians attending. The ralliers are to stage a 5-km street march to the Yonsei University campus after the gathering, probably causing serious traffic jams in and around Mapo and Shinchon, western Seoul. Prior to the rally, some 7,000 students from seven Seoul universities, including Yonsei and Sogang, will march to Yoido Plaza in separate groups to demonstrate their determination to stop the National Assembly from ratifying the UR accord. Some 1,000 students affiliated with Namchongnyon, the Federation of Student Councils in Kwangju and South Cholla Province, gathered at Yongdungpo station to prepare for the rally.
