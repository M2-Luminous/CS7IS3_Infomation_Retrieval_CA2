SUMMARY: This proposed rule would add a new part 337 to title 44, Code of Federal Regulations, National Defense Executive Reserve Guidance. This part would provide guidance to Federal departments and agencies that sponsor reserve units and recruit and train unit members under the National Defense Executive Reserve. DATES: Comments are requested and should be submitted no later than January 27, 1995. ADDRESSES: Please submit written comments to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472, (facsimile) (202) 646&hyph;4536.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: New part 337 responds to Executive Order 12919 of June 8, 1994, 59 FR 29525, which delegates to the Director of FEMA the responsibility to provide for the appropriate guidance for the recruitment, training, and activation of National Defense Executive Reserve Units. This part would provide guidance for those Federal departments and agencies delegated authority under Executive Order 12919 of June 3, 1994 (59 FR 29525, June 7, 1994) to sponsor reserve units under the National Defense Executive Reserve and guidance for the recruitment and training of unit members. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review This proposed rule would not be a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866, as defined in §3(f) of that Executive Order. To the greatest extent practicable, FEMA would adhere to the principles of regulation set forth in §1(b) of the Executive Order. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the rule would not be expected (1) to affect adversely the availability of Federal benefits to small entities, (2) to have significant secondary or incidental effects on a substantial number of small entities, and (3) to create any additional burden on small entities. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis would not be prepared. Paper Work Reduction Act The information collection contained in this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C 3501 et seq. and assigned OMB control number 3067&hyph;0001. Public reporting burden for the information collection, FEMA Form 85&hyph;3, National Defense Executive Reserve Personal Qualifications Statement, is estimated to average 30 minutes per response. This includes the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the form. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspect of the form, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Information Collections Management, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (3067&hyph;1001), Washington, DC 20503. National Environmental Policy Act This rule would be categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental impact assessment has been prepared. Executive Order 12612, Federalism This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, dated October 26, 1987. Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.
