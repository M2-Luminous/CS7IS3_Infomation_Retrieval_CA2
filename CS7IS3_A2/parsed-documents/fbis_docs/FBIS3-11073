Two weeks before the elections of a new OAS secretary general, no diplomat dares make public his forecast of the election results. For the time being, the firm candidates are Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus Quesada and Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. The only clear indication is that the Colombian candidate has a heavyweight vote: that of the United States. Argentina had promised to support the Costa Rican foreign minister. But two months ago President Carlos Menem informed Gaviria over the phone that if he presented his candidacy he could count on Argentine support. Following this change of decision, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella had to make another phone call to explain to his Costa Rican counterpart the reasons for the change. According to Argentine ambassador to the OAS, Hernan Patino Mayer, Di Tella argued that the decision to support Gaviria's candidacy changed the whole panorama and forced a reconsideration of the former Argentine position. Argentina also toyed with the possibility of presenting an Argentine candidate: the former Radical Civic Union foreign minister, Dante Caputo. But Caputo's candidacy was never made official because the requisite was that he comply with his mission as UN and OAS mediator in restoring democracy in Haiti before the elections for secretary general. The Colombian president, whose four-year mandate expires in August, has the support of nearly all the Latin American countries, except for Venezuela and Chile. He also has the support of the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Venezuela has not promised its vote to any of these two firm candidates because it has not yet withdrawn the candidacy of its own foreign minister, Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas, the one with the least support so far. Most of the Central American and Caribbean countries have promised their support to the Costa Rican candidate. Costa Rican diplomacy has established the current dispute with the current Colombian president on the terms of a confrontation between regions, that is, between small and large countries. Costa Rica points out that since the OAS' foundation there has never been a Central American or Caribbean secretary general. The first OAS secretary general was Alberto Lleras Camargo from Colombia. He was followed by Carlos Davila from Chile, Jose Mora from Uruguay, Galo Plaza from Ecuador, Alejandro Orfila from Argentina, and Joao Baena Soares from Brazil, who has been secretary general since 1984. According to Ambassador Patino Mayer, the Costa Rican approach is incorrect because, he said, the secretary general is elected based on his background and never on the country he comes from. That is why, he added, Argentina favors President Gaviria, because he is a politician who has been very successful in the fight against drug trafficking with the arrest of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, he made progress in the field of human rights, and he is leaving the presidency following elections won by a candidate from his own political party. "We think we have enough votes to win the elections," Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin Rubio said on 15 March. This belief is shared by the Argentine Foreign Ministry.
