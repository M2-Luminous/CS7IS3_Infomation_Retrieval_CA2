In an interview with DPA in Stuttgart on Sunday [19 June] the Baden-Wuerttemberg economics minister said that the international financial markets are, on the whole, on a dangerous "crash course." "The visible sign of that is the dramatic increase in the capital market interests, which have gone up by more than 1.5 percentage points since the beginning of the year. This once again destroys the recovery of the development of investments, which had become visible over the past few months." In Spoeri's view, the clear line of the Bundesbank has been completely lost. For some time now periods of excessively long intervals between reductions of the interest rates have been alternating with inexplicably high reductions of the interest rates, such as in May. This has eliminated the leeway for a constant policy of interest rate reduction for months. Furthermore, the rigid fixation of the Bundesbank on the short-term development of the money supply is absolutely counterproductive for stability policy, the minister noted. The excessive expansion of the money supply has been caused by the Bundesbank itself. In addition, by dramatizing the development of the money supply the Bundesbank is fanning fear of inflation on the part of the actors on the financial markets, a fear that is actually unjustified in Germany at the moment. Spoeri says that for him it is still a secret how the Bundesbank wants to persuade the partners to the wage negotiations to come to wage contracts for 1995, too, which are compatible with stability, if it acts in this way. As a result of contradictory statements by leading Bundesbank members regarding further leeway for the reduction of the interest rates, Spoeri thinks that "not even the direction of monetary policy in Germany can be seen clearly anymore." He appealed to the Bundesbank to prevent a "crash scenario" on the financial markets by returning to the criteria of constancy and predictability in the indispensable policy of reducing interest rates.
