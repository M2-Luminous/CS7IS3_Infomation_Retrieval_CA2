FR940314-2-00047 FR940314-2-00024 Department of the Army Corps of Engineers Intent to Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in Conjunction With Proposed Maintenance Dredging of the Indiana Harbor and Canal, and the Construction of a Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) at East Chicago, in Lake County, IN AGENCY: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District, DOD. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The proposed project involves maintenance dredging of the Federal navigation channel in Indiana Harbor and Canal, and construction and operation of a confined disposal facility (CDF) for containment of contaminated sediments dredged from the harbor and canal. Approximately 4.7 million cubic yards of sediment could be dredged and confined during a 30-year maintenance period (1998 to 2027). Alternatives include (but are not limited to) dredging/disposal, no action, and innovative treatment technologies; alternative CDF locations include the ECI, J&hyph;Pit, and Inland Steel sites. Major features of the recommended plan include dredging the authorized Federal navigation channel and certain berthing areas/dockfaces adjacent to the channel, and construction of a CDF. The proposed CDF would be constructed at the site of the former Energy Cooperative, Inc. (ECI). The ECI site is located along the north bank of the Lake George Branch of the Indiana Harbor Canal, immediately west of Indianapolis Boulevard. ADDRESSES: U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Chicago District, 111 N. Canal St., Chicago, Illinois 60606&hyph;7206. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Keity Ryder, 312&hyph;353&hyph;7795. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. The project would provide both commercial navigation and environmental benefits. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is a cooperating agency. 2. Coordination regarding the assessment of impacts of the project is being undertaken with the concerned agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, and local communities. 3. Issues to be addressed in the DEIS will include impacts of dredging, impacts of CDF construction and operation, feasibility of innovative treatment technologies, protection of Lake Michigan water quality and fisheries, protection of groundwater, impacts on local communities and industry, and future use of the facility. 4. The scoping process has been undertaken as part of a program on-going public participation and interagency coordination begun in the late 1970s. A public meeting to discuss a previous draft EIS on Indiana Harbor and Canal was held in East Chicago on 18 March 1986. Interagency scoping meetings were held on 19 May 1986, 22 April 1987, and 25 October and 12 December 1988. 5. A public meeting will be held during the 90-day public review and comment period for the DEIS. 6. The DEIS is expected to be available to the public in late March or early April 1994. Kenneth L. Denton, Army Federal Register Liaison Officer. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5800 Filed 3&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3710&hyph;HN&hyph;M
