They are discussing the increased prices at workers' cafeterias, which will go into effect on 1 June. Rodriguez and Recio begin by talking about the excess currency on the streets. Rodriguez points out that at the end of March, there was 11.636 billion pesos of excess currency circulating on the streets. Recio notes that the meals offered at the cafeterias are very inexpensive. Rodriguez and Recio change the focus of their discussion to the lack of control at work centers. Recio points out: "We all know that in Cuba, there is a lack of control over resources in many -- too many -- economic enterprises. It would not be absurd, it would be logical that among those who work in the warehouses, or who handle and work with the foods that are later offered at the cafeterias, there could be symptoms of lack of control. Of course, whatever is misappropriated can graciously be tacked onto the prices, and that is not right. ``Therefore, I believe there should be strict control over all resources sent to workers' cafeterias and that efforts should be made to reduce costs. Earlier, you mentioned self-sufficiency. That is something that could help improve variety at the cafeterias without significantly increasing prices. Therefore, the work centers should link what they offer in their cafeterias with what is produced in the self-sufficiency gardens.'' Rodriguez mentions that there are some workers who expect to be paid to work on the self-sufficiency farms. Regarding this, Rodriguez says: "That comrade who goes to work on the self-sufficiency gardens has a salary, and his salary is often higher than that of a farmer." He later says: "In Camaguey, they are experimenting with methods whereby an industrial center can create a cooperative with industrial workers to supply the center's cafeteria with food." Recio goes on to say: "I believe all roads should lead toward efficiency. If a road does not lead toward efficiency, I believe it should be closed. That is how I see things." He notes that the workers parliaments demonstrated that Cuba must eliminate subsidies to work centers and to workers' cafeterias. He says: "I believe we all agree -- or most of us agree -- that the prices of the food served in the cafeterias should be increased, but I insist that the labor unions make sure administrations do not take shortcuts. The easiest thing is to solve economic problems with prices." He goes on to say: "There are many reasons for inefficiency at the workers' cafeterias. That inefficiency is not what I should receive. I should receive quality and above all, variety." Recio concludes by saying: "I believe we all agree on price increases and decreasing or eliminating subsidies to workers' cafeterias, but this must be related to a cost analysis, a practice that leans toward efficiency and a practice that leans toward quality. It is sad to see prices increase while quality decreases. Quality and price should be linked. Rodriguez concludes by saying: "I do not believe workers' cafeterias are always prepared to analyze this issue of cost. That is why I foresee many injustices being committed when this measure goes into effect on 1 June. I believe injustices will be committed in some places. We, therefore, alert our listeners, workers in general, labor union leaders, party leaders, and of course, the administrations, to be watchful so these types of injustices are not committed."
