The central bank plays a dominant role in the new financial system. Therefore, to gradually establish a strong central bank regulatory system and increase the capability of the central bank in exercising macroeconomic control is of primary importance in reforming the financial system. Reform of China's financial system began in the late 1970's. After 14 years of efforts from 1978 to 1992, a financial system with the central bank as the leading body and state-owned specialized banks as the dominant parts and with various diversified sectors co-existing and coordinating with each other has been basically formed. The financial system has developed considerably in terms of variety and quantity. Prior to 1978, there was only one People's Bank of China and several rural credit cooperatives in the country. As of now, in addition to the People's Bank of China, there are four specialized banks, namely the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Bank of China, the People's Construction Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China; and 10 nation-wide and regional commercial banks, namely the Bank of Communications, the Zhongxin Industrial Bank, the Everbright Bank of China, the Zhaoshang Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Guangdong Development Bank, the Fujian Development Bank, the Huaxia Bank, the Pudong Development Bank of Shanghai and the Zhejiang Commercial Bank. There are also over 80 securities companies and a large number of financial companies and modernized financing and leaseholding companies. In addition, there are many urban and rural credit cooperatives in various cities and towns. Since the approval of the first foreign-funded bank in Shenzhen, foreign financial institutions have set up more than 90 branches in China. As of now, China has basically changed the "large and consolidated" banking system to one of many financial institutions working side by side. This kind of reform and exploration are aimed at keeping abreast of the economic development in the past with emphasis on planned economy. The party's 14th National Congress explicitly put forward the need to establish a new system of socialist market economy. Apparently the financial system with emphasis on planned economy in the past is unable to keep pace with the new changes. Efforts must be made to change this economic system in accordance with the requirements of the socialist market economy. It is similar to the fact that people need to change their own clothes to keep pace with the climatic changes in spring, summer, autumn and winter. The first thing to be affected is the change of the functions of the people's bank so as to establish a strong central bank regulatory system. The central bank plays a leading role in the new financial system. Its major functions should be: lead and control all financial institutions in the country, scientifically formulate and implement financial and monetary policy, control the supply of currency and ensure the basic stability of currency value; and supervise and control financial institutions, ensure safe and effective operations in the financial system. Under the conditions of the socialist market economy, the People's Bank of China has always regarded the task of increasing efficiency in exercising macroeconomic control as its major goal. However, the dual target of achieving both economic growth and currency stability and that of accomplishing both overall control and structural readjustment constitutes the major reason for the weak macroeconomic control of the central bank. For a long period, China has always adopted monetary policies by ensuring both economic development and price stability. However, in practice, the governments in various localities, on the one hand, often attach more importance in economic development and sedulously work hard to seek high rates of economic growth. They often use investments with poor economic results to achieve their goal for economic growth, resulting in the excessive issuance of currency and causing inflation. On the other hand, due to lack of an efficient and flexible mechanism to regulate currency and credit, a tendency to restrain economic growth which causes economic decline often prevails in order to stabilize the currency value. This not only prevents the national economy from developing healthily, but also loses public support and causes economic instability. Since the implementation of the reform and opening up policy, the readjustment in 1981, the tightening of the money supply in 1985, the improvement and rectification campaign in 1989 and the strengthening of macroeconomic control in 1993 all fall into this category. Naturally the macroeconomic control this year is different than those in the past. It is not an overall retrenchment, but a kind of structural readjustment. Therefore, the central bank should undoubtedly regard the task of stabilizing the currency value as its major target, and promote economic growth while ensuring the stability of the currency. In a socialist market economy, it is an usual or even common phenomenon that the total social demand exceeds the social supply. Often the growth of the total social demand is quite strong. In view of this situation, the people's bank must change from attaching importance to both overall control and structural readjustment to placing emphasis on overall control in order to do a still better job in maintaining currency stability. That is to control the total amount of currency supplied by the whole banking system. Currency is created by banks in the form of loans. To place the total amount of loans under control is the key in controlling the supply of currency. The people's bank must issue or withdraw the basic currency according to the rise or fall of commodity prices, the rate of growth of the supply of currency and the amount of excess deposits. With the deepening of reform of the financial system, the people's bank should work hard to change from its direct control of the amount of loans to the use of economic, legal and administrative means by carrying out open market operations, keeping adequate reserve funds for deposits, determining the proper interest rates, loan ceilings and exchange rates. On the basis of the conditions in market development, it should gradually attach more importance to indirect control and eventually regard indirect control as its principal measure. The people's bank must strengthen the control of the basic currency, reduce the amount of uncovered advance and gradually give priority to selling and buying state bonds, financial bonds, using them as securities for loans and handling note discount businesses. Another major function of the central bank is to supervise and control the financial institutions, and ensure that the financial system is safe and sound in operation. All branches of the people's bank must pay full attention to supervising and controlling the financial system and conducting investigation and study. With the gradual establishment of the socialist market economy, the deepening of the reform of the financial system and the development of banking businesses, the number of regional financial institutions with the status of a legal person is increasing, and there are more and more banking business activities. As there is more competition among financial institutions in various districts and regions, contradictions among the financial institutions, between the financial institutions and the enterprises and among individuals have continued to emerge. On the other hand, the basic task of the commercial banks is to do financing, while their major target is to make maximum profit. However, there is a contradiction between profit-making and the need to ensure repayment. The risk of investments and loans with larger profits is often poor, while safe investments are always less profitable. Financial institutions must achieve balance and make the best choice among factors of safety, liquidity and profitability. Thus, the central bank and its branches must use various methods to exercise strict supervision and control over the business activities of various monetary institutions. Meanwhile, they must also keep their eyes on various unauthorized, illegal fund-raising and financing activities in all localities. First of all, a direct and effective measure is to strengthen the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities and the management of risks. The basic principle in strengthening the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities is as follows: 1) It is necessary to restrain the use of funds by means of the sources of assets. 2) It is essential to establish structural correspondence. That is, the utilization of long-term capital must correspond with the stable sources of such capital. 3) It is imperative to make the best use of funds. 4) It is necessary to divert risks. It should be stipulated that loans to any client should not exceed a certain percentage of the client's capital. Efforts must be made to avoid extending exorbitant loans to one enterprise only. The principal measure in strengthening management of risks for assets is to divide the bank's assets into different categories, estimate risks of such assets and adopt different forms of management for the assets of different risks. Working out a regulation on the rate of abundance of capital and determining the risks of assets are something fundamental in doing management of risks for assets. If it is said that the asset liability ratio management emphasizes quantitative control, the assets risk management is mainly aimed at exercising an overall qualitative control over the bank's assets and liabilities. The management of risks for assets is a complex system engineering project. Its entire process involves the forecast, prevention and diversion of risks. Next, to make the reform of the financial system a success, it is necessary to improve legislation on banking. While implementing a reform measure, it is essential to formulate a complete set of relevant laws, regulations, systems and methods. Right now, the state is working on the "Law of People's Bank of China," the "Banking Law of the People's Republic of China," "Insurance Law," and the "Law of Bills" and some relevant rules, regulations and measures. They are aimed at helping financial institutions carry out and manage their businesses, supervising and controlling them according to law, maintaining financial order and stability and ensuring the safety of the financial system. For example, in light of the interest rate war among some financial institutions in the province during the first quarter of this year, the branch of the People's Bank of China in Henan Province had enacted a 50-article regulation to strengthen the control of interest rates, stopped the war on interest rates and curbed the competition among various financial institutions in the province. During the period of transition from planned economy to socialist market economy, the situation is usually complicated in the realm of financial affairs. It often involves important issues of policy. Each reform measure must be formulated and implemented in close touch with reality. All kinds of contradictions and problems in economic and monetary affairs must be studied and analyzed timely, accurately and completely; and measures taken to resolve them. China is a vast country. Situations differ in thousands of ways in the eastern and western regions, special economic zones, the coastal and the inland areas, economically developed districts, and old liberated, minority, border and poverty-stricken regions. The task of the people's bank and its various branches in conducting investigation and study remains arduous. Only by doing a good job in conducting investigation and study, will it be possible for us to build a solid foundation for scientifically formulating and implementing the currency and credit policies and strengthening macroeconomic control. Meantime, we will be able to help the various localities to develop their economy, and assist enterprises and relevant departments to strengthen their management, become market-oriented and improve their economic efficiency. With the deepening of the financial structural reform, banks are playing an increasingly important role in the national economy and gradually becoming important sectors of the state in exercising macroeconomic control. As a leading department in the new financial system, the People's Bank of China must closely follow the guideline laid down in the "Decision" adopted by the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress, further change its functions, and genuinely shoulder the glorious duties and missions assigned it by the Party Central Committee and the State Council.
