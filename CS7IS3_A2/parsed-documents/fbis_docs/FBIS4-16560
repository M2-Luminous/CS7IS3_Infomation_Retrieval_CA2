The situation, however, gives rise to a number of legitimate questions. Answers to them may not be the most pleasant for the U.S. military establishment. First, about the pilots' professional level. Judging by their initial testimony, they mistook U.S.-made UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters for Iraqi Soviet-built Mi-8's. Indeed, outwardly they bear a remote resemblance, but with the slightest doubts, were the pilots not supposed to fly around what they saw as suspicious objects and make sure what it was, friend or foe? Moreover, were they not supposed to activate their Friend or Foe identification system? If none of this was done, the logical conclusion is: The fighters used the very first opportunity to show the Iraqis who is master in their airspace. The second question and the answer to it bears on the performance characteristics of U.S. combat aviation. If the F-15 pilots used the interrogator after all, did they therefore receive no confirmation that the targets were not friendly? In addition, as Lieutenant General Richard Keller, chief of staff of the U.S. Command Europe -- responsible for the military part of operation Provide Comfort-2 -- who was summoned to the Pentagon explained, at the time of the incident airspace to the north of the 36th parallel was monitored by AWACS aircraft. Their onboard radars and computers are designed precisely to detect and track air targets and guide the interceptors onto them. In other words, one cannot rule out a malfunction in the operation of these "super modern arms and equipment systems" which are so zealously promoted by the Americans. [passage omitted]
