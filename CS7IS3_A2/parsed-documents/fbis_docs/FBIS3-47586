FBIS3-47586 "dreas010_c_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-010 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Jan 1994 North Korea Daily Denounces Kim Yong-sam's Remarks on Labor SK1401045694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0439 GMT 14 Jan 94 SK1401045694 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN ["`Civilian' Fascist's Scheme To Suppress Labor Movement" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-sam the traitor told a new year's meeting of the "Economic Planning Board" on January 11 that precedence should be given to the "settlement of industrial peace" and "stabilization of payment" to "increase competitiveness" and that ministries and agencies concerned should promote "active cooperation and measures" to this end. Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says: It has become all the clearer that the "civilian" fascist, the "civilian" dictator who has pursued an anti- popular labour policy defending the privileged circles intends to totally stifle the labour movement this year by brandishing the fascist bayonet more desperately. The analyst further says: As for "industrial peace" cried for by Kim Yong-sam, it was invented by the traitor No Tae-u, the military fascist dictator of the "Sixth Republic," in a bid to stifle the labour movement by shifting the responsibility for the economic crisis of South Korea onto the workers. With this anti-popular slogan, the Kim Yong-sam group attempts to categorically turn down the vital demands of the workers and obliterate the labour movement itself, fooling people into believing that the economic catastrophe is attributable to the "labour- management dispute" and wage hike, as the preceding dictators did. Stripped bare is the fascist, anti-popular nature of Kim Yong-sam who is trying to suppress and stifle the struggle of the workers by adding new methods to all the fascist laws and means of suppression employed by the successive military dictatorial regimes. That day, Kim Yong-sam cried for "measures to control prices," saying the "vicious cycle of price hike must be checked" this year. This is really a shameless sophism. The traitors would be well advised to act with discretion, well aware of their position.
