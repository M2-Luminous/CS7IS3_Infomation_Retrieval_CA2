He was reacting to our fears, and those of Polish representatives, in particular (he had been to Warsaw the day before), that our countries are in the so-called gray zone--that is, in a security vacuum between West and East, and are almost defenseless. At the same time, he pointed to the project for prospective NATO membership, which has been joined by 17 East European countries, including former USSR republics. Russia, it is a well known fact, is considering joining the Partnership for Peace plan. However, if we set Talbott's assurances against the most recent statements by U.S. politicians and NATO representatives, according to which the Partnership for Peace does not provide direct guarantees for NATO to come to the aid of countries under threat, we have here, to put it mildly, a contradiction. Let us theorize. Despite the nervous statements by Hungarian chauvinists, the current situation in Central Europe does not give rise to worries about a possible confrontation. However, emotions are volatile, and, for two years now, we have seen merciless combat operations a few hundred kilometers south of our country. Not everything is without problems in the CIS, either. We can put this question in a different and a more specific way: Does the leading NATO country, the United States, have a firm foreign policy on Europe? Talbott said in Bratislava that Europe must integrate in terms of the economy and security and that the current situation was the most proper for it. Such a situation arises once in a hundred years (on this occasion, he appreciated our policy and orientation toward European integration). We ask this question because the foreign policy of the United States--on former Yugoslavia, for example, about which no one doubts that it belongs to Europe and not to the Islamic world--does not confirm this. U.S. generals said last week that they would not intervene in Bosnia. This encouraged the Serbs, but they were attacked by U.S. fighter planes on Sunday [10 April] and Monday [11 April]. The Muslims, who are the most active in the combat, are calling for more U.S. planes and even for ground forces. The Americans have some 15,000 troops in former Yugoslavia (in the UN peacekeeping forces), which is about 9,000 fewer then the number of "advisers" in Vietnam in 1965. Confusion in U.S. foreign policy also affects Moscow's position--not only President Yeltsin's but also that of the right and the left opposition, which are shouting that the United States did not consult with Russia on the bombing and that they reserve for themselves the right to be informed in the future. There is no better idea than the unification of Europe. It must be said, however, that people have wanted for a long time, but there was always someone to put a monkey wrench in the works. The Balkans are the biggest monkey wrench now. It is precisely in the Balkans that the situation should be sorted out in a peaceful manner. But not to the detriment of the Serbs or even the Croats.
