FBIS4-59717 "drnes095_m_94003" FBIS-NES-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 JORDAN Minister, PLO's Quray' View Economic Accord Minister, PLO's Quray' View Economic Accord JN1705081894 Amman Radio Jordan Network in Arabic 2000 GMT 16 May 94 JN1705081894 Amman Radio Jordan Network Arabic BFN [Text] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs and information minister, has said that the Council of Ministers has decided to form a delegation of competent ministers to hold talks with the Palestinian side. He added that the talks will deal with the issues that should be dealt with now to organize trade transactions between Jordan and Palestine in light of two basic facts -- namely, the economic cooperation agreement, signed between Jordan and the Palestinian side on 17 January, and the developments in the Palestinian territories in Jericho and the Gaza Strip where new Palestinian institutions are being set up. These statements came in a debate, aired within the Jordanian Television program "Topical Issues," which also included PLO Economic Department Chief Ahmad Quray' and economic expert Dr. Taysir 'Abd-al-Jabir. Al- 'Anani added: Therefore, it was necessary to lay down a flexible and dynamic working plan that could deal with the swift changes taking place in the Palestinian territory. Regarding Jordanian banks, trade exchange, and joint projects, Dr. al-'Anani said: The Palestinian side, led by Ahmad Quray', was positive because it wanted to go into the details after the stage in which principles were laid down, which we defined in the economic agreement. He added: We expect to agree on a mechanism through which people will be able to deal with each other. Al-'Anani said: We must quickly define the mechanisms and issues with which we must begin and pay attention to. He noted that the Jordanian dinar is still the main currency in circulation in the West Bank. The minister added: We agreed with the Palestinian side on the method of dealing with the Jordanian dinar so as to maintain its value and purchasing power. Ahmad Quray' touched on the dimensions of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, signed by the PLO and Israel in Paris recently. He said: This agreement deals with the major issues, such as currency, banks, trade, customs, direct and indirect taxes, tourism, insurance, agriculture, industry, and labor. He stressed that the choice of these topics was a Palestinian choice. Quray' said: The most important strategy of talks with Israel was the restoration of the strategic Arab dimension to Palestinian relations, particularly with Jordan. He noted that immediately following the signing of the Declaration of Principles an economic agreement was ratified with sisterly Jordan in which trade between Palestine and Jordan was considered domestic. In other words, he added, no obstacles or boundaries stand in the way of this trade in light of the historical unity between the two countries in various fields. Ahmad Quray' said the issue of banks and currency was dealt with in this agreement, adding that this agreement helped us a great deal in the talks. Dr. Taysir 'Abd-al-Jabir expressed his belief that the economic agreement between Jordan and Palestine would see great activity, even during the transitional period, adding that the size of trade exchange will reach 200 to 300 million dollars annually. Therefore, he said, the Palestinian self-rule area will have the largest trade transactions with Jordan. Dr. 'Abd-al-Jabir said: Now that Jordanian banks have been allowed to operate in the West Bank and Gaza, these banks will be the basis of the banking system there and the Jordanian dinar will continue to be the main currency in circulation. He added that there will be other areas of cooperation between Jordan and Palestine, such as tourism, the creation of a free zone in the Jordan Valley, oil, energy, electricity linkup, services, and construction.
