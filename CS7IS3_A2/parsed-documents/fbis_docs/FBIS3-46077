The meeting pointed out: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, with a focus on economic construction, there is a need to deepen reform, strengthen management, enliven human resources, improve services, comprehensively fulfill institutional reform, introduce the civil service system, and carry out wage system reform in order to make new contributions to Hunan's invigoration. Provincial party and government leaders, including [Vice Governor] Chu Bo and Luo Haifan, attended and addressed the meeting. Zhu Qiulin, director of the provincial personnel department, made a report entitled "Expediting the Pace of Reform, Strengthening Personnel Management, and Establishing a Personnel System in Conformity With the Socialist Market Economic Structure." In his speech, Chu Bo referred to the province's economic situation in 1993, stressed three major aspects of personnel reform for this year, and explained the new situation and new tasks facing organizational and personnel work. He said: The overall arrangements for institutional reform throughout the province were decided by the provincial party committee and government last year. These arrangements still remain unchanged. The province will strive to fulfill institutional reform this year. Before institutional reform is carried out, all localities should make the necessary preparations. Chu Bo said: Establishing and implementing a state civil service system is the focal point of speeding up personnel system reform. The provincial government's arrangements are as follows: Personnel system reform will be carried out according to state regulations, step by step and in a planned way in coordination with institutional reform and wage system reform. The personnel currently employed throughout the province will basically become state civil servants this year. In the course of implementing the civil service system, the relevant policy should be strictly observed. No one is allowed to introduce institutional expansion by taking advantage of this reform, to do a rush job of promoting cadres, to increase the number of posts for leaders without authorization, or to set up nonleadership posts willfully. Comrade Chu Bo also expressed his views on wage system reform in institutions and stressed the need to reform the social insurance system in institutions and enterprises and to establish talented personnel markets.
