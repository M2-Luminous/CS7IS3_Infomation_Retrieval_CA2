Throughout Monday and Tuesday, representatives of the government, employers, and trade unions [TU's] will jointly debate behind closed doors the strike demands put forward by Solidarity, and they will discuss the government's proposals regarding changes in the law on state-owned enterprises. They will also be speculating as to a justification for raising prices on energy carriers and how to improve the situation of budget-sector employees. The law on privatization of state-owned enterprises is the sixth and final part of a batch of laws comprising the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises. The Ministry of Ownership Transformations has suggested several changes to the document that had been agreed upon with the previous government. Among the proposals approved by the Council of Ministers' Economic Committee, the following are included: --A change in the principles of distribution of preferential employee shares of an enterprise being privatized, from 10 to 15 percent of the total number of shares. --The adoption of a principle that the initiative regarding transformation of an enterprise into a Treasury-owned joint-stock company is up to the organs of the enterprise in question. --A promise to come up with a "privatization map," which means defining economic areas and the methods through which the state will control those areas. The government intends to give up on a legal provision that speaks of emission of privatization coupons, and it is being planned that it is the chief of the Ownership Transformations Ministry who will decide on the particular privatization path an enterprise will follow. Still, enterprises would have a month in which to submit their vetoes of the privatization paths suggested for them, and the government's assurances are that the veto will prove efficient in practice. Representatives of the Solidarity trade union were critical of the changes in the governmental draft privatization law. The trade union wants the government to present its justification for withdrawing from the draft law a legal provision concerning the possibility of issuing privatization coupons. As NOWA EUROPA was told by Longin Komolowski, trade union representatives find unsatisfactory the proposal to raise the percentage of employee shares in a company being privatized from 10 to 15 percent. The All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] has suggested that details of the law be debated during the commission's sessions, instead of within a specific topic-oriented group, as provided for in the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises. Solidarity fears that a substantive discussion of the law will be transformed within the Trilateral Commission into an ideological debate concerning the vision of privatization. "The privatization law should be discussed by those trade unions that have signed the Agreement," Piotr Zak, press spokesman for Solidarity, told NOWA EUROPA. But OPZZ Deputy Chairman Maciej Manicki voiced the reservation that, if the debate takes place at three tables--for employers, for trade unions, and for Solidarity--the OPZZ will withdraw from the negotiations.
