He also stressed that because of security considerations, Taiwan will continue to employ the principle of handling separately the hijackers and the airplane concerned, and the repatriation of the hijacked airplane. Wu Po-hsiung said that the repeated hijackings of Communist China's civilian passenger planes to Taiwan has exposed Communist China's serious gaps in its security checks. He added that the fundamental way to solve the problem of hijackings lies in Communist China's strengthening its interior security measures. Meanwhile, Kao Kung-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council and its spokesman, said that because of the repeated occurrences of the hijacking of mainland airliners to Taiwan, he hoped that the mainland authorities will show sincerity, hold follow-up working-level talks as soon as possible, and sign an agreement on the repatriation of hijackers as quickly as possible so that mainland hijackers can be repatriated according to the stipulations of the agreement. Yesterday, the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], in addition to employing its channels for contacts with the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] and informing its counterpart about information concerning the hijacking, also called on the mainland authorities to adopt positive measures to effectively put a stop to hijackings. It also expressed the hope that the SEF-ARATS talks will quickly reach an agreement on the agenda concerning the repatriation of hijackers at the fourth working-level consultations meeting to be held in Beijing at the end of March.
