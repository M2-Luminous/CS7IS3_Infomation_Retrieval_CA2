Your visit is a very important event for Albania's cooperation with NATO. First, I want to greet you and Admiral Boorda personally for the successful operation in the skies of Bosnia, which will remain historic, as it marked the beginning of the functioning of NATO in a new role, President Berisha said to General Joulwan. I want to show you, President Berisha continued, that the Albanian Army feels deep admiration for NATO as a defender of democratic values, security, and peace. The Albanian military are persistently working to adopt the standards of this alliance. We were the first to request NATO membership and today we powerfully support the Partnership for Peace as a dynamic and natural process for achieving membership of this Alliance. Albania is determined to take part in all NATO structures defined by the Partnership for Peace and is ready to conduct joint maneuvers with countries or groups of countries which are members of NATO. Albania seeks NATO assistance to prepare peacekeeping troops or forces participants in humanitarian operations and it also reconfirms its readiness to ensure NATO access to all air and port facilities on the Albanian territory to accomplish the mission of the alliance. General Joulwan stressed that he admires Albania's great changes in these two years and considers that the work done for the deep transformation of Albania from a dictatorial into a democratic state was a patriotic deed. He pointed out that Albania has a broad and key strategic position for NATO, and in this framework, the alliance is open for cooperation with Albania. Regarding the situation in Bosnia, President Berisha said that we have supported the federation as a road that leads to peace, but we are worried because Serbia is refusing this solution. We think that it would help the peace if Russia could manage to convince the Bosnian Serbs to sign the Washington agreement, which presents a real option for the establishment of peace in Bosnia. This will complete the political solution to the crisis in the region. Regarding the situation in Kosova, it remains tense and on the eve of conflict. In this direction, the presence of U.S. forces in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and the increase of this presence in the region is very welcome. Albania, the president continued, is engaged to avoid the conflict, but every violent cleansing of Albanians implies regional conflict. On his part, General Joulwan offered the Alliance's support for Albania's active engagement in the Partnership for Peace framework and its gradual integration into all NATO structures and levels.
