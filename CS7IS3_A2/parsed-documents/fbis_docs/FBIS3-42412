Vasilyev, chief of Weapon Training and Combat Vehicle Driving Department of Ground Troops Main Combat Training Directorate, and Colonel V. Shevchuk, deputy department chief] [Text] Fire effectiveness often has a greater influence on the outcome of a battle than the number and outfitting of troops. Under difficult situational conditions fire often is not only the swiftest, but also the only means of altering a situation in one's favor. In connection with the increased role of fire in modern combined-arms battle, the importance of weapon training also is growing. Firm skills in functioning at the weapons, preempting the enemy in opening fire, and hitting the target with the first round are developed in the process of weapon training. In addition, commanders master the art of fire control in the most diverse situations which form on the battlefield. The existing level of weapon training today causes certain concern, since many specialists believe it does not meet the demands being placed on it. Over the past five years the state of personnel training in a number of units and formations has not exceeded the "satisfactory" mark, and problems which have built up during these years are being solved late and not always fully. The shortage of personnel in subunits, the increased number of details and fatigue duties, and the performance of other measures unusual for the army entailed a disruption of scheduled classes and drills, which of course was not slow in telling on the quality of the training process as a whole. Meanwhile, there is a way out even from that seemingly very complicated situation. In our view, thorough planning which takes into account practical reality, constant improvement in the quality of weapon training classes, their integration with other subjects, wide use of training equipment, and officers' high proficiency in weapon and methods consitute that very reserve by which it is possible to achieve a good subunit training level in short time periods. And this has been proven. For example, the subordinates of Captain V. Anufriyev (Volga Military District) performed an exercise for an outstanding grade in a performance evaluation class. Twelve of the 17 persons who fired received the highest mark. As noted in the critique, the thorough planning of weapon training served as a guarantee of quality performance of its tasks in the subunit. At the same time, although this planning does have certain features, it is not an independent process, but an inalienable part of the planning of combat training as a whole. Combat training experience shows that where commanders give serious attention to and take a personal part in planning, then classes are held in prescribed time periods and with appropriate quality. Just what must be done to improve planning quality? Inasmuch as inspection results in the troops show that some officers experience certain difficulties here, it makes sense to take a look at the commander's work in more detail. We should begin with a study of guidance documents. It is important to determine the time periods for familiarizing subordinates with them and make changes to commander training and combat training programs suggested by the leadership. Then we must answer a few questions, and specifically, when and to what extent to plan weapon drills and exercises in firing all kinds of weapons and throwing hand grenades; when to hold fire control drills; what questions should be included in the schedule of officer and NCO assemblies; when to hold methods conferences and meetings to exchange experience of the best gunnery specialists; what training films to show trainees; when to plan contests for title of best specialist, crew and platoon and when to hold classes for improving or confirming a class rating; in what time periods to organize training for mastering techniques and methods of employing all squad weapons in modern battle; what amount of combat training vehicles to allocate for performing gunnery exercises; how to distribute ammunition, simulation devices and vehicle resources and in what amounts; in what time periods to hold demonstration and instructional methods classes and on what topic; when to hold performance evaluation classes to determine the level of weapon proficiency; and what measures to provide for to ensure safety precautions in classes. And all these questions should be resolved taking account of trainee categories. Additionally the following are determined in the course of studying and clarifying initial data: The quality of program fulfillment; the status of weapon proficiency of officers and subunits, again by categories of servicemen taking into account data from the latest performance evaluation classes and the end-of-training-period performance evaluation; the training facility capabilities; and the tasking function and strength level of units and subunits. A graphically formalized decision reflecting the measures enumerated and the time periods in which they are to be accomplished should be the result of a commander's work of planning weapon training. In addition, the rehearsal of topics, conduct of weapon drills, and performance of gunnery and fire control exercises must be tied in closely in content and sequence with tactical training and with time periods for teamwork training of subunits. In our view, such a work sequence of a commander at any level will make it possible to take the fullest account of conditions under which classes will be held in subunits and will ensure quality performance of training tasks. Combat training programs of motorized rifle and tank subunits set aside 256 hours per year for the activities enumerated, consituting 25 percent of total training time. Of this, up to 10 percent is allocated for theoretical classes and 90 percent for weapon drills and firing. In following a methods sequence and systematic conduct of drills and firing, all this will permit maintaining and upgrading the level of servicemen's weapon proficiency if they are not used to perform any kind of activities to the detriment of combat training. It would appear that the contract system of Armed Forces manpower acquisition will require an increased number of training days and consequently also hours for weapon training. Training in combat units will be presented in the form of individual and group training. During individual training specialists improve personal skills in actions at the weapons and in conducting fire, and in group training they participate in squad (crew) and platoon teamwork training. Time periods of a particular kind of training must be precisely distributed in the programs. The following is the basis of individual training in the U.S. Army: Weapon training 216 hours (37.5 percent), physical training 128 hours, airborne training 108 hours. Subunit teamwork training includes performance of integrated training missions, where 192 hours are set aside for weapon training. It is common knowledge that weapon drills and firing exercises are the basic method of achieving high firing results. At ranges and in fighting vehicle gunnery training facilities the soldiers gain, reinforce and improve knowledge and skills in functioning at the weapons; reconnoitering targets; determining their nature, importance and distances; giving target designations; firing against different targets day and night by all methods; and remedying stoppages. Research here and abroad shows that the number and duration of drills and firings should be within certain limits. Thus, if they are conducted too often and for too long a time, people become fatigued and apathy appears as a result. Their further continuation is only a vain waste of material resources and time. The optimum, practically tested option is three weapon drills and firings per week (one of them at night) lasting no more than 3 hours. Thus, 12 weapon drills and firings may be held in a month, and it is advisable to rehearse the practice and test firing exercises day and night at least once. Consequently, the gap between practical classes should not exceed three days. But combat training programs provide that the cumulative number of weapon drills and firings is at least eight per month, with up to a four-day break allowed between them, and even longer for subunits working eight training days. Preparatory measures (before the beginning of winter and summer training periods) interrupt the training process by another one and one-half to two months, which of course has a very negative effect on preparedness of gun crew members. These measures are dictated above all by the existing manpower acquisition system and by the scope of administrative-economic functions assigned to each military unit. The Ground Troops Main Combat Training Directorate is forced simply to determine the minimum permissible number of weapon drills and firings to maintain the minimum skills necessary in soldiers' performance of functional duties. But with the transition to an 18-month term of service and to contract service, such an approach to determining the scope of servicemen's knowledge, abilities and skills will hardly prove acceptable. The procedure and content of personnel training in skillful, effective use of authorized weapons and hand grenades in battle are spelled out by the Gunnery Course. Motorized rifle and tank subunits have been guided for eight years in weapon training by the unified "Kurs strelb KS SO, BM i T SV-84" [1984 Ground Troops Small Arms, Fighting Vehicle and Tank Gunnery Course]. Of course, in these years it has become somewhat outdated and no longer fully meets the requirements for training servicemen. Recently the Ground Troops Main Combat Training Directorate together with academies and military schools began work on a Gunnery Course which takes account of changes in manpower acquisition and in the procedure for performance of duty, and also the conditions under which subunits will have to perform actual combat and training missions.[.sup]1[/] Officers from the troops often ask the question: why is so little ammunition issued for mastering gunnery? And they compare ammunition issue standards for combat training in armies of NATO countries and of Russia. We are speaking chiefly only about weapon training without taking into account ammunition expenditure in exercises. Unfortunately the comparisons in fact are clearly not in our favor. According to foreign press data, NATO armies allocate an average of 50-60 rounds per tank, 2-3 missiles per ATGM launcher, 4 grenades per antitank grenade launcher, and 60 cartridges per IFV per year. Moreover, the bulk of exercises are performed with all types of authorized ammunition in the vehicle's basic unit of fire. We cannot allow ourselves anything of the sort because of certain economic difficulties, and the training content has no exercises using all types of ammunition. There is no question that this is a substantial drawback in training tankers. At the same time, standards for issuing material resources for combat training also are being reduced in NATO armies. While up to 110 rounds were issued per tank per year back in the 1970's, their number now has been cut almost in half and the cost of ammunition has grown considerably. Several years ago the cost of one artillery round for the standardized 105-mm gun of M60A1, Leopard 1, AMX-30 and other tanks was figured at $200-300. One round from the Leopard 2 and M1 tanks costs taxpayers $1,200-2,000. Therefore a new criterion for evaluating training quality--cost-effectiveness--has moved to the foreground abroad. And the "range rounds" that are lacking are fully compensated for by the most modern simulators. Attaining high results in gunnery training using only costly combat and combat-training vehicles is unjustified. Training equipment capabilities must be fully used to train specialists in the troops and military educational institutions. It permits holding classes under field conditions and in training classrooms more clearly and understandably, monitoring subordinates' actions, identifying mistakes promptly, determining the reasons and seeing to their elimination. Supplementary simulator drills shorten breaks between practical classes and help preserve and improve acquired skills. In addition, with a limitation on fuel and lubricant deliveries and a reduction in numbers and size of training ranges, the training equipment relieves the acuteness of many problems. The troops have several types of training equipment as of today (Table 1). Unfortunately, some already are obsolete and need replacing with more modern models. Production of such articles has been stopped, and a new generation of simulators with their principle of operation based on personal computers has begun to come into units. But here, too, we observe a multitude of unresolved problems, about which, by the way, VOYENNYY VESTNIK carried on a detailed discussion last year and the year before last.

Boldface indicates training equipment removed from production. On the whole, however, the concept of developing and building a training equipment system for weapon training has changed substantially (Table 2). Only three types remain from the past diversity of simulators: Training equipment intended for basic training of gun crew members (mock fighting compartments of simulated vehicles with an automated training system); classroom simulators for improving skills in functioning at the weapons and in firing (TKNT-4U and TKNO-9 integrated tank and IFV commander and gunner simulators); and field simulators (Geofil, Konotop, Zaplatka) for performing Gunnery Course exercises.

Range equipment of troop firing ranges, moving-target gunnery ranges, and fighting vehicle gunnery training facilities support only individual training. This does not allow creating a varied target situation, let alone registering exercise parameters and trainee actions. For example, there are no laterally moving targets for firing a gun with a subcaliber tube. There also are none for firing the authorized round. Moving targets displace only at identical speed. It is possible to register hits only on four targets, and the time for firing each round is not noted. Group training of crew, squad and platoon is limited for these reasons and is insufficiently effective. During a training period there is one squad and platoon field firing in motorized rifle subunits and only a platoon field firing in tank companies. Such training practice does not produce the desired results in live-fire exercises because there is no system for group training in conducting fire as crews, squads and platoons in weapon training classes. On the other hand, in the majority of cases moving-target gunnery ranges, fighting vehicle gunnery training facilities and troop firing ranges are set up on unsuitable land, because of which it is impossible to take full advantage of all combat qualities of new models of weapons and equipment when they become operational. Another problem arises here--upkeep and servicing of training facility installations. For example, soldiers must be diverted on the eve of classes to clear moving-target roads and restore targets and equipment. But the fact is, we have begun shifting to contract service. It is apropos to ask who will perform the preparatory work. The question of tables of organization and technical outfitting of ranges, training fields and simulator complexes continues to be very problematical. It will become essentially impossible to use so-called non-TOE specialists from combat units to service training equipment. It is fully obvious that sooner or later it will be necessary to resolve this long-standing problem. It is no secret that whatever the level of officers' weapon proficiency, that is the quality of the personnel's weapon training. Therefore special attention must constantly be devoted to the training of officers, especially platoon and company commanders, for only a well trained commander is capable of really teaching his subordinates something. It must be admitted that here, too, not everything is well. Despite a sufficient amount of allocated ammunition, preparedness of platoon and company level officers leaves much to be desired. Evidently considering the experience gained in schools to be sufficient, some scorn preparatory exercises and, taking advantage of the connivance of senior officers, also often avoid performing practice and even test firings. And superiors in turn check officers' preparedness only occasionally and do not analyze their state of training. As a result, concern for professional suitability becomes the lot of the officers themselves. Requirements of prewar courses, where officer weapon training was placed at the proper level, are instructive in this respect. In particular, at that time it was prescribed that command personnel (up to and including the regimental commander) personally master weapons in the subunit and unit inventory. Each year all command personnel were graded in firing any model of small arm. The problem of officer professionalism probably lies deeper. We believe that military school programs do not provide necessary skills for graduates to train subordinates. The fact is, the basis of training always was considered to be the teacher's graphic example in performing a particular procedure, and the system of commanders' methods training that is in effect is aimed at upgrading their skills. But the question arises: What is there to upgrade if they do not have them? One would like to believe that the questions raised and suggestions expressed will be of certain interest to the readers, although, of course, they are not indisputable. Therefore we invite officers to express their opinions on the topic broached. Many problems have piled up and we all have to solve them. Footnotes 1. Dear readers!
