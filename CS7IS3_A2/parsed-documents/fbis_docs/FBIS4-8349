Last July he left the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], and 10 days later also left the Socialists' parliamentary group. The GOR has almost 800 local and 110 municipal organizations. [Tokin] Mr. Tomov, how do you assess the economic and political situation in Bulgaria at the moment? [Tomov] I think that the situation has become extremely heated at an awkward time, and the politicians are the main cause of this. Many people have lost their nerve who are striving at all costs to seize power. What is more, it is clear that some people have become scared that if we sign the agreement with the IMF and the banks of the London Club, this will happen without them and they will be unable to utilize the substantial sums that the world organizations are granting. I think this political gambling with margins is untimely and very harmful for the country. Unfortunately, the general situation at the moment is destructive. In Zlatograd recently someone said to me: "At one time Simeon Radev wrote `The Builders of Modern Bulgaria'; today someone around will probably write a book called `Destroyers of Modern Bulgaria.'" [Tokin] Have things really become as bad as that? [Tomov] Today very few people think about the consequences and the cost of the changes that they are demanding. Every spring, political schizophrenia breaks out in Bulgaria, and this is the fifth year in which it has happened. [Tokin] Did the president not add fuel to the flames by saying in London that the government is sick? Who would conclude the expected agreements with a sick government? [Tomov] To blacken the name of the state and the state institutions abroad harms Bulgaria, whatever the reasons are. In civilized countries, no one makes assessments of their government when abroad. If you want people to respect you abroad, you should say only nice things about Bulgaria. Accordingly, I do not think the president's statement in London was constructive. Second, I have always advised him to act as an arbiter and stand above the national parties and the situation at the time, above petty feuds and petty aims. This is the president's constitutional role, one that cannot be replaced, in view of the weakness of the institutions and the power vacuum. In his statements President Zhelev took sides, and when he has taken one side, he has always lost. If he does not do so, he will always win. [Tokin] How do you view the other statement he made in London, about the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces], NSD [New Alliance for Democracy], DPS [Rights and Freedoms Movement], and the independent members of parliament forming a government? [Tomov] The president probably does have some idea of this kind. However, first, it was not the right place to announce such a thesis; second, such a prospect is not very realistic. Offers of this kind are made when it is clear that they will be accepted. When a head of state makes such statements and it turns out that everything is hanging in the air and that those who are expected to form this government do not want to hear anything about it and make statements to the opposite effect, this naturally dooms such proposals to failure and does not increase the authority of the head of state. [Tokin] What kind of government does the GOR advocate? [Tomov] We will support any government that brings about the country's stabilization and solves the two great problems, namely signing the agreements with the IMF and the creditor banks. If this comes about, if the government guarantees relative stability for the lev and skillfully manages the scanty reserves at our disposal, then this would be of benefit. If, however, the country is thrown into chaos, the people who make the political provocations will have to take the responsibility. It is possible to achieve a political consensus on holding elections in the fall, but at the moment, when this outcome is being forced upon us by declaring that the government is useless, by holding rallies, and by launching attacks on the Bulgarian lev -- something that I regard as especially dangerous, all this leads to destructive tendencies. This is the scenario offered to us by the people who want elections as soon as possible. Here I would like to stress that GOR has no commitments to the present government. We can see its numerous weaknesses. Accordingly, if someone proposes replacing it by a better one, the GOR will support this idea. However, is there anyone who can make such an offer? If the government simply falls now, and the elections are not held until October or November, this will lead to five or six months of chaos, and we will find ourselves in a situation of spiralling inflation -- this is my solemn warning. [Tokin] Nevertheless, now that the president has withdrawn his confidence in the present government, which government will sign the agreements? [Tomov] Any legitimate government can do this, but not a caretaker government or one that has been toppled. If anyone topples Lyuben Berov's cabinet now and no new alternative cabinet is formed quickly, then it is possible that no agreements will be signed. The thesis that Ivan Kostov developed last week, that it is impossible to maintain the dollar at a reasonable level and at the same time sign the agreements, is actually a thesis against the agreements. However, as we saw, the next day following his statements the IMF slapped down this thesis by announcing that the issue will be examined before 11 April. I maintain that the lev can be saved if the agreements are signed and if we receive the first tranche by 15-20 April. [Tokin] In the meantime, there is talk about a "blue" [SDS] caretaker cabinet.... [Tomov] If Dr. Zhelev appoints a caretaker government, this government will probably have such a tinge, despite the fact that a balance should be maintained. The best thing would be for it to be composed of people who have no direct commitment as regards the elections and who will not be tempted to act in favor of one or another party. [Tokin] What do you think about applying value-added tax to newspapers? [Tomov] We cannot deviate from European standards. As I have said in parliament, it is ridiculous for us to have rates three or four times higher than the average European ones. I look at the issue purely pragmatically: The revenue that the budget receives from the press is insignificant. I say that the taxation policy proposed by Ivan Kostov is totally wrong. To me, it is a policy favored by tax collectors. [Tokin] Would you agree to lead a cabinet now, at this moment? [Tomov] I hardly have a moral right to do this within the term of the present National Assembly. Nonetheless, I will say that the problems facing a politician are now quite specific, that is, everything depends on the balance of forces inside parliament. I would associate myself with a government on one sole condition, namely if I feel that I have solid support behind me both in parliament and in the nation at large. I am especially interested in the latter. Moreover, I would want to be given a free rein to do what I want. Change must come about in Bulgaria. Bulgaria needs a new choice. [Tokin] Do you remain an optimist, despite everything you have said about concluding the agreements with the financial institutions? [Tomov] Yes. This is a chance for Bulgaria to escape from the present situation and join the family of civilized states. If we fail because of political machinations, the whole blame will fall on the shoulders of those "Bulgarian politicians" who cannot see any further than their own noses.
