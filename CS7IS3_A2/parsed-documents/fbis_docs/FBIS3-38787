On Friday Kanther said that he hopes that the FDP will "change its mind." The matter is important to him. Nevertheless, by presenting the article law, the coalition has proved that it is able and willing to act. Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) also paid tribute to the package of laws, which will improve "the instruments for combating crime while strictly adhering to rule-of-law principles." The coalition is striving to adopt the article law in the Bundestag before the summer recess. It will be discussed together with a draft law of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] group on internal security, which facilitates -- under certain conditions -- the monitoring of conversations in residences as well as, in case of sufficient suspicion, the seizure of illegal assets. Kanther rejected this SPD proposal as a violation of the Basic Law's guarantee of property. Deputy SPD Bundestag Group Chairwoman Fuchs criticized the coalition draft by saying that the "coalition, completely divided by internal quarrels" no longer has the strength to really combat organized crime. A number of different legal amendments on internal security have been brought together in the coalition's article law. The Federal Intelligence Office is to be given additional tasks; it is to be permitted to pass on to the criminal prosecution authorities information found abroad and obtained by "strategic" telephone monitoring. The regulation on turning state's evidence, which has so far been limited to terrorism, is to be extended to crimes committed within the framework of organized crime. The statutory punishment for bodily injury is to be raised. The use of signs of unconstitutional organizations -- such as symbols reminiscent of national socialist signs -- will be punishable by law. The penal regulations against inciting people and inciting racial hatred will be made stricter. Collection of profits is to be made easier in case of extortions of protection money. Criminal liability for money laundering is to be applied to additional crimes (property crimes, document crimes, and bribery). More attention is to be paid to the so-called perpetrator-victim settlement. Various detailed regulations in the law of criminal procedure are to accelerate criminal procedures; these include better preconditions for imposing detention pending trial as well as using the reason of danger of repetition to keep someone detained. Penal regulations against foreign drug dealers are tightened in order to be able to expel them from the country. By amending the Industrial Code private security companies are to be checked more thoroughly than has been the case thus far.
