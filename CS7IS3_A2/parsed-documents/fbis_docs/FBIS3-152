The discussions of specific principles and modalities of national reconciliation are still at an edge. The parties have not yet reached an agreement because of two issues, which we do not know because of news blackout. What we know is that the document under discussion has 16 points and an agreement has already been reached on 14 points. According to a source, the parties have yet to reach agreement on fundamental issues for national reconciliation. Other reports say agreements have already been reached on issues, such as administrative decentralization and the participation of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the country's administration.
