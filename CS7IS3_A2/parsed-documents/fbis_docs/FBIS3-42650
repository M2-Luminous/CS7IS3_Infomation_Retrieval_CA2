STRUGGLE FOR PEACE All wars end. So did this one. And peace came. And this peace was new, although its images strangely resembled something. At the beginning of summer, at the famous Chermen Circle border point, where Ossetians and Ingush come together for official meetings and quiet business negotiations, and where hostages and information are exchanged, representatives of the North Ossetian Ministry of Health transferred to the Ingush Ministry of Health under the supervision of specialists from the Russian Ministry of Health five patients from the republic psychiatric hospital. They were being transferred to, as they say, where they belong--all five were Ingush. It was a sunny day; the patients looked well cared for. "We took better care of them than of our own," said the chief physician from Vladikavkaz. The parties were clearly happy with each other, expressing a willingness for a new "dialogue." The general atmosphere of complacency was nearly spoiled by patient Magomed A. He cried, not wanting to leave behind his hospital roommates and the doctors he loved. How could Magomed A. know that the impossibility of shared habitation of Ossetian and Ingush mental patients was now codified in law by a special decree of the North Ossetian parliament? After all, the man is mentally ill. During the five-day Ossetian-Ingush war, the Chermen boarding house for the feeble-minded remained an island of wisdom in the crazy slaughter. When normal citizens left the village after shooting at each other for a while, the feeble-minded took their fate into their own hands, demonstrating an exemplary common sense and mutual aid. Dividing people by ethnic origin proved beyond what their feeble minds could grasp. That is how the Russian military found them upon entering Chermen--all together. There is a rumor that this boarding home also is to be disbanded--Ossetians to one side, Ingush to the other. And there was not a single person in good mind on that day who would look around and ask: What exactly are we all doing here? Only a deprived mind can grasp the peace that came. One Russian republic defeated by armed force another Russian republic. And Russia itself, as if the war was between Nicaragua and Guatemala, "forged the victory" for one of them. Ingush in Vladikavkaz and Prigorodnyy Rayon of the North Ossetian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] were partly exterminated and completely pushed out, deported beyond the borders of Ossetia. The North Ossetian press likes to compare the tragic events of last year with the Hitlerite aggression. The style of articles and speeches is a matter of taste, but, using the suggested analogy, we should extrapolate it to the area of practical ideology: In those times, Hitlerites, capturing some Soviet cities and burying some of its residents in ditches, hung a poster--"Judenfrei," Jew-free. In Ossetia they do not hang "Ingush-free" posters, but in a letter to IZVESTIYA a well-intentioned female resident of the republic writes: "The air in Vladikavkaz has become cleaner without the Ingush." Was it that long ago that Ossetian writer-democrat Kosta Khetagurov defended the dignity of the mountain people--Ossetians and Ingush--from the ignorant snobbishness of the bureaucratic press in Vladikavkaz? Now all 33 writers in the republic appeal to the people from the pages of SEVERNAYA OSETIYA with a proposal to hold a referendum on the topic: "Should we or should we not live with Ingush on our land?" The engineers of human souls advise--let us not. The organizing committee of the second congress of Ossetian people presented an ultimatum to the Russian president: "The issue of joint habitation of the Ingush with Ossetian people should be removed from the agenda... Otherwise the committee reserves the right to rouse our people to an armed struggle." And finally the session of the republic's Supreme Soviet turned the thesis voiced by the writers into law. The decree of the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet on the impossibility of joint habitation of Ossetians and Ingush, which has no analogy in modern history, with the exception of Nuremberg racist laws passed under Hitler, placed every Ingush outside the law on the territory of North Ossetia. This prompted the current head of the Provisional Administration, V.D. Lozovoy, to appeal to North Ossetian deputies: "I have to express my regret that you have not supported the proposal to dismiss the ill-conceived thesis of the impossibility of joint habitation. I ask you once again to come back to it and think again. You represent the proud and wise people of your republic. I understand your demand for justice, but there is no such thing as two justices, just as there are no two truths. There is only one truth. You have today a great historic chance to show your wisdom, so that you may later look honestly into the eyes of other people and your children, and be remembered kindly by your grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Find in yourself the wisdom and courage to arrive at a just solution and place yourself above political expediency in the name of and for the good of your people." V.D. Lozovoy found strong and precise words, but they did not touch the deputies. Perhaps the deputies would have given it a thought had they heard such a speech from an all-Russia rostrum, but no one delivered it there. In interviews with journalists, including foreign ones, A. Galazov does not advertise Vladikavkaz laws. He only reminds them that he cannot guarantee the safety of Ingush returning to Prigorodnyy Rayon. Buses carrying Ingush to four villages within the pale of settlement set by the presidential decree are pelted with stones. This is how the citizens apply the law of their Supreme Soviet. They are not hooligans or thugs, storm troopers or Nazis; they are simply doing their public duty. That is why village gatherings on the standard topic "No to Joint Habitation!" resemble well-rehearsed party meetings. Although things did go too far, and it is indeed easier for the Ossetians to live without the Ingush. Blood has been spilled by both sides. One hundred five dead Ossetians is a big loss not only for their loved ones--it is a perceptible loss for a small nation. Bloodshed does not make anybody better. The Ingush also nurture an image of Ossetians endowed with inhuman vices. Hate is seldom fair; it always goes overboard. A year of such peaceful coexistence did not do well by both peoples. All wars end in peace. A make-believe war was followed by a make-believe peace. Imaginary, but not bloodless. In the postwar year about 100 have been killed from both sides, their murderers never found. What it was--terrorism, hooliganism, revenge, provocation, robbery--who knows? And with all the effort that went into strengthening peace. All those people who tried over the past year to reconcile the Ossetians and the Ingush--elders, women, religious figures, Kirsan Ilyumzhanov, people's diplomacy and regular diplomats; even the Confederation of Mountain Nations, having had enough of fighting in Abkhazia, was ready to don "blue papakhas"; and now finally President Yeltsin. All to no avail. I will permit myself to share a personal impression, since I was present at the beginning of the Pyatigorsk-Kislovodsk process conceived two and a half months after the tragedy by the chairman of the Chamber of Nationalities, R. Abdulatipov, and S. Shakhray (State Committee for Nationalities and Federation Affairs) under the umbrella of the Senega Forum social movement. One expected a gathering of wise, experienced people from different North Caucasus republics, who had accumulated historical experience of joint habitation; people who undoubtedly had things to say, who knew how to make peace between two peoples and organize their living together. The result of this formal undertaking were two meetings: one for everybody in Pyatigorsk, with short speeches by representatives of social movements in the Caucasus; and another, the next day, in a posh Kislovodsk hotel behind closed doors, and only for top republic officials. At such forums the only outstanding feature usually is the banquet. Besides, the troubles of the two people were so close to the door that our gluttony looked like a feast amidst plague. At the next meeting in March (this time without any kind of public representatives), the Kislovodsk agreements were adopted under the ambiguous heading "Agreement on Measures for a Comprehensive Solution of the Problem of Refugees and Forced Migrants on the territory of Ingush Republic and North Ossetian SSR." It soon became clear, of course, that Ruslan Aushev's understanding of "comprehensive solution" was full-scale resettling assistance to Ingush refugees; while Akhsarbek Galazov, on the contrary, saw it as inclusion in the number of refugees of everyone who had come to North Ossetia: from South Ossetia, Georgia, and Tajikistan; Cossacks from Chechnya and Ingushetia; Meskhet Turks from Central Asia; and others. For these refugees Moscow provided substantial amounts of money. S. Khetagurov, chairman of the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet, reported to his compatriots with satisfaction: "We have received a nice infusion." The obvious military inequality of the sides found continuation in the obvious diplomatic superiority of the Vladikavkaz team. Legends abound among the Ingush regarding the powerful Ossetian lobby in Moscow. From circles close to the Ingush Republic leadership comes a tale of an incredible event. An edict (No. 407) was signed by the president of the Russian Federation; Point 4 envisaged the transfer of all power on a territory where a state of emergency is imposed to the Provisional Administration, that is, in essence it introduced federal rule; the decree had a cover letter to the parliament attached with a request for approval, and--behold the miracle: While the decree was en route from the Kremlin to the White House, Point 4 disappeared; the signed decree had a completely different point. And everything in Prigorodnyy Rayon remained as it was. "I am not a politician yet--I am only learning," says Aushev about himself. "I have one advantage over many politicians--I do not hold onto power. I do not need it. I have had enough battles, enough of giving orders; I have had enough power for several lives to come..." Aushev had also, however, learned a few lessons, and his next steps were more cautious. As to decisiveness, he had always had plenty of that--suffice it to recall his resignation from the job of deputy head of the Provisional Administration in charge of Ingushetia. Is it that he did not get along with Shakhray? "No," said Aushev. "Shakhray is an intelligent and competent man, but there is nothing to get along about--the problems are not being dealt with." He said that and flew back to Moscow. The Ingush, however, did not let him go and elected him the first president of their first--tentative as it was--state. One wants to believe that in the process of learning to be a politician Aushev will not learn too much, as others do, and will not suppress his straightforward and honest self; and anyway, if he becomes more "sophisticated," he will not be understood by his people, who also have only one advantage: Having never had their own state, they have not yet been washed out in the lye of our developed socialism. Aushev, a professional military man, needs peace; he needs to give his people a breather, give them back a taste for life. The ceremonial combination of the words "struggle for peace" has real meaning for Ingushetia. It looks as though V. Polyanichko learned something in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. This is a rather subjective feeling, and I have no way of verifying it: I was probably one of the last journalists to talk to him. On Saturday he invited me to visit him in Vladikavkaz at the beginning of the following week, so that we could have a more detailed conversation, but on Sunday he was killed. His murderers have not been found (although the opportunity to do so was there); there are different versions, including one that Polyanichko got curious in Vladikavkaz about machinations with nonferrous metals and sales abroad. This version recently got into the press and, as I hear it, caused considerable interest in Vladikavkaz; I will refrain from guesswork, however. It is a fact that he did get involved in the Ingush problem, however, and over the short period in his job as the head of the Provisional Administration he succeeded in making perceptible progress. The most important of his accomplishments was that, having studied the issue, he reported to the president, and the latter for the first time--and in presence of others, at that--had a tough conversation with Galazov. After that came a joint appeal of President B.N. Yeltsin and Chairman of the Council of Ministers V.S. Chernomyrdin to the peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, urging them to show mutual generosity, restore good-neighbor relations, and engage in constructive peace-building work. On Saturday 31 July an emergency congress of peoples of Ingushetia was held in Nazran. Polyanichko apparently was a little late; he found a place, unnoticed, somewhere in the back row. He did not speak, just listened. When everybody rose, however, it was no longer possible not to notice him--his height and bearing were truly of a general's proportions. He was satisfied with the congress, and although there had been some rather scathing speeches, it looked like a burden had been taken off him--perhaps he had been told something and expected worse. Not knowing that I had visited these parts before, he started telling me not to worry, that everything was going in the right direction, the people here were good, they understood everything correctly. It was then that he said a phrase I quoted in my current report from Nazran--that the Ingush unfortunately keep looking back too much on their ill-starred fate, but one cannot go forward while looking back. I detected in his words (partly to my surprise, because Polyanichko's reputation in our circles was not the greatest) ordinary empathy, the desire to do something for these people. He actually was already doing something, even set up a foundation for refugee assistance, and firmly supported their return to their places of previous habitation. On Tuesday a meeting of a joint commission was scheduled in the Kabarda city of Terek; the parties were to approve the choice of four villages in Prigorodnyy Rayon to which Ingush would return first. The meeting took place, but this was another stalling maneuver. His death delayed the choice of these four villages by half a year--they were named only in December, after B.N. Yeltsin's trip to North Caucasus. But to name does not mean to implement. Polyanichko was a doer. Colleagues in the Provisional Administration remember him as a very strong, tough, courageous, but also kind man. They remember his words, phrases. Correspondents once asked him under what circumstances he could order the troops to open fire, and he said: "Only in a salute!" He once said to someone: "The people are smarter than all the governments and administrations...". But these are the words of a man who decided to listen to the people not only at rallies. Now rural gatherings are taking place in North Ossetia; they protest President Yeltsin's decree on returning Ingush refugees, for starters, to four population centers in Prigorodnyy Rayon. Among the counterarguments presented by the "people": first issue an official opinion on the aggression, and find and convict the murderers. But, as gathering organizers know very well, we are talking about the first 15,000 persons "vetted" by the procuracy and commissions; there are no criminals among them. Which means that perhaps the problem lies elsewhere? Of course, the truth about the armed conflict is needed. One of the reasons it is slow in coming is surely not the main one--how to tell it without insulting either side; first they want to smooth it out, average it, squeeze into the framework of interethnic conflicts... But in any case, to make the everyday existence of 64,000 people, predominantly children, contingent on making this assessment public is both heartless, economically inexpedient, and simply absurd. Everything came to the fore during B.N. Yeltsin's trip. Pressure, bargaining. You leave us Prigorodnyy Rayon, and we will return your people there in a measured way. But bargaining is bargaining; the more desirable way it is to do it within the framework of the law, and this is what is nowhere to be found. All wars leave winners and losers. This war does not have any winners; there is only one winner--Akhsarbek Galazov. Of course, the time will come when the Ossetian people will give him his due, but time not only comes--it passes; this is what he is counting on. Two months before the armed conflict the anti-Galazov opposition appealed to the president of Russia to "look in detail not only into the political situation but also into facts of intentional exacerbation of interethnic tensions, and to monitor the use of finances directed by the Russian government to North Ossetia." People familiar with the political kitchen in Vladikavkaz warned: "In North Ossetia the split between the corrupt, amoral, and thieving authorities, on one side, and the people on the other already occurred a long time ago..." Where is this opposition now? Meanwhile, Galazov was first proclaimed "man of the year" in North Ossetia, and has now been elected the first president of the republic. The democratic opposition to the regime fell silent and, in order not to be accused of betraying the nation, either stepped aside or merged with the authorities in a single national-patriotic impulse. In the list of results of the five-day war in Prigorodnyy Rayon this may be arguably the most important one. It is not enough, however, to win over the opposition. A. Galazov's genetic memory prompts him with words worthy of Stalin: "Organs of internal affairs and state security should conduct a resolute struggle against provocateurs and whisperers of all suits and colorations." In short, the opposition is threatened with Kolyma. Of course, it is hard to understand: Ossetia has always been distinguished by its intelligentsia, and Ossetians are justifiably proud of the many names that have brought fame not only to the little republic but to all Russia as well. It is not hard, however, to deceive the intelligentsia, because it is happy to deceive itself. And it is not necessary to look for examples abroad of how entire nations have been deceived by false ideology and the propaganda serving it. What about us, in the entire former Union--was it long ago that we awoke? And could we hear the voice of Sakharov if we still had the beat of military bands and television and newspapers reporting daily that the enemy is right on our doorstep? There are, however, arguments no music can drown--the economy. Perhaps despite all the denunciations North Ossetia is flourishing under Galazov, and the regime, no matter how bad it smells to the opposition and merely decent people, nevertheless is providing a carefree life for its citizens, and for Russia--considerable revenue for its treasury? Let us not touch on the carefree life now--this is a topic for a separate conversation; regarding revenue for the treasury, though, there are indeed precise quantitative data. In one of the June issues last year SEGODNYA published an interesting table of differences between the amount of federal taxes and the total subsidies issued to the regions in per capita figures. With the exception of the Republic of Komi, North Ossetia received more than anybody else from the common treasury last year and contributed the least to it. To show more graphically how big this hole in the federal pocket is, it should also be pointed out that all of them together--Tuva, Tatarstan, Dagestan, Kalmykia, Karelia, Buryatia, Sakha-Yakutia, Mari El, Kabardino-Balkaria, Bashkiria, Chechnya, and Ingushetia plus Kamchatka and Irkutsk Oblast--made less of a dent in Russia's kitty than this one little republic in the North Caucasus. In a certain sense it is we, the Russian taxpayers, that armed this region in such a fashion that in terms of quantity of military hardware per capita it has no equal in the world. It is you and I who paid for the murder of each Ossetian and each Ingush who died in the senseless and historically futile conflict. One must give Galazov his due. To stand for his convictions is not his motto. Galazov is a successful and pragmatic politician. He always remembers his goal. He may, of course, guess wrong, shoot himself in the foot occasionally--the style of inertia is still great, but he will shake it up, will try to forget, and will try to make others forget--and those who should forget, do; the rest of them do not matter. Just look at how he has managed to complicate the already complex problem of refugees by packaging it with words like "phased," "through nonviolent means," "comprehensive," "places of compact habitation." How many obstacles did he erect--but they are still coming back. Life goes on. There are already 2,500 Ingush living in Chermen, and 1,500 in Kartsa, right next to Vladikavkaz. Spontaneously, without waiting for the negotiations to be completed, 10,000 persons returned to their burned homes. It is this simple invincibility of life that Galazov did not take into account, and so he began to fall behind. And one can no longer say that he is not behind the events in politics, too, considering that in Vladikavkaz during the days of the anniversary of the tragic events all the talk was about heroic deeds, glory, the readiness to deflect another aggression, while Nazran during the same memorial days did not forget to say words of gratitude to Ossetian neighbors who saved Ingush families in their homes--and there were hundreds of such incidents; it is a pity that the names of these people still cannot be said openly in Vladikavkaz. Because they (not "compact resettlement") are the hope; they are the true victory of life over enmity.
