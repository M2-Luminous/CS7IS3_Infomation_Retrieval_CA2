FR941012-1-00033 FR941012-1-00005 Regulatory Procedures Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome while still achieving the regulatory objectives. The total Federal and State cost for implementing this statutory amendment is estimated to be $10.6 million for the first full year with $5.8 million (55.2%) of this amount being the Federal share. Assuming that the number of additional Indian families becoming eligible for AFDC after the first year is an added 10 percent, then an added cost of $0.6 million is estimated for a total Federal cost of $6.4 million. These costs result from the statutory requirements and not from decisions made in the proposed rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that these regulations will not have significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because they primarily affect State governments and individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required. Paperwork Reduction Act There will be no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements imposed on the public or the States which would require clearance by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;511). (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program 93.020, Public Assistance Maintenance Assistance (State Aid)).
