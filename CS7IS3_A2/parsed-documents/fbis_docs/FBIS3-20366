The decision should be an independent one, entirely independent of how Sweden and Norway act. The official resolution from the joint meeting of the party executive committee, the party board, and the party's Eduskunta group did not specify a date, but judging from party chairman Pertti Salolainen's remarks, sights have been set on September. "If the present European Parliament succeeds in scrutinizing the agreement this spring, September would be a very suitable date for the referendum," he said, adding that the National Coalition Party cannot accept any "clever party political tactical maneuvering" on this issue. Nor should there be any unnecessary delays or anything else that could jeopardize the decision on EU membership at home. The possibility of simultaneous referendums on EU membership in the three Nordic applicant countries -- something to which Prime Minister Esko Aho seems to have given thought -- was not mentioned during the discussion, either by Salolainen or anyone else. The pressure for a rapid and emphatic yes to the EU is very strong in the National Coalition Party. The whole matter was even described as "the National Coalition Party's project." [passage omitted]
