There is no doubt that the Right has won, but it will not be capable of presenting a government to the country." He continues: "Regarding the Progressive Alliance, it is a team, a team that has played for the first time. It has gained valuable experience. I think it should remain on the scene because as other European experience has shown, the Right does not know how to resolve society's basic problems. This alliance," he says, "will be able to be an extremely clear and decisive opposition in constitutional terms." He adds: "The electoral law, obviously, has not clarified anything. Right from the beginning we said that it was compromise between the old and new system. Had there been an electoral system with two rounds the people would have been able to choose between each round whether to let the Right win, something which was not clear with this system." He adds: "The Left maintains the energy that it has had recently. I've already said it: this was an unsatisfactory result."
