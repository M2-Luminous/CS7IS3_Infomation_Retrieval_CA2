Russia has not yet ratified the treaty on trade and economy signed last fall granting the most favorable trade regime. In an interview to the daily LIETUVOS RYTAS [MORNING OF LITHUANIA], Kozyrovicius maintains that Russia does not intend to ratify this treaty until a packet of agreements on the Kaliningrad region have been signed. According to the ambassador, when last fall the Russian and Lithuanian prime ministers signed the inter state economic treaty, there was no condition raised to Lithuania that the agreement coming into force was directly linked with the political agreement on the Kaliningrad region. Speaking about new treaties with Russia, the draft treaty on transit through Lithuania to Kaliningrad was singled out by the Lithuanian ambassador. According to the ambassador there was no need to have such a treaty at all. He believes that it would be best if the Lithuanian Seimas could adopt a law on transit, which would embrace all the conditions. Speaking about the agreements on the Kaliningrad region, Kozyrivicius stressed that the treaty should be of an inter state and not a geographical nature. At the same time the ambassador pointed out that the continuing militarization of the Kaliningrad region caused concern to Lithuania. He also stressed that Lithuania recognized all Russia's rights to this territory and that Lithuania had no claims.
