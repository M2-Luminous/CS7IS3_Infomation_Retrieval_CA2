Located in Yunnan Province, Xishuangbanna is the only vast area of tropical forest in China. It covers an area of 19,000 sq km. It also boasts one sixth of the species of seed plants and pteridophytes in China. In 1959 the Chinese Academy of Sciences set up the tropical botanical garden, the first of its kind in the country. Because of human activities leading to deterioration of the environment, the tropical forests at Xishuangbanna have shrunk by 50 percent in the past five decades. Many species of plants are on the verge of extinction. In 1984 the tropical botanical garden set aside 80 ha of land to cultivate the endangered species. After years of research and experimentation the garden has succeeded in cultivating 108 species of endangered plants, including 46 species that were listed among the 53 major species of plants under state protection. Many of these plants date back to the tertiary period and are considered as living fossils. In order to better study and protect the endangered plants, the tropical botanical garden is preparing to set up a bank of seed genes of tropical plants.
