Sanchez, who stated the attack was "carefully planned," told EFE that Rene del Pozo was beaten a number of times in the head, abdomen, and back, and needed to be treated for bruises at Havana's surgical hospital. According to Sanchez, in the past two weeks, Rolando Pages and Elizardo San Pedro, two other activists of the most moderate group of internal dissidents, were the target of similar attacks "always under strange circumstances," and had to be taken to hospitals. In his opinion, these are "repressive and intimidatory actions by the Cuban Government's political police against peaceful citizens who want to express their disagreement with the continuous violations of civil and political rights."
