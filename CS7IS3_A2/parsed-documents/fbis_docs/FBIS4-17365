The figures were cited at a session of the Federation Council, upper house of the parliament, on Saturday. Members of the House Budget Committee stressed that "tax privileges have failed to act as a stimulant for industry and in many cases have been used for dodging taxes." In 1993 tax inspectors discovered over 1,000 unregistered legal entities which did not pay any taxes. They instituted criminal proceedings on more than 600 cases and about 200 in the first three months of 1994. They also stressed that more and more often tax inspectors become objects of assaults. Tax revenues could increase the federal budget by billions of roubles, tax police officials said. Last year inspections and raids helped recover additional 800 billion roubles and over 600 billion in the first quarter of 1994. Officials complained that the tax system is in "complete chaos." Non-payment of income tax and value added tax accounts for the bulk of all tax violations. Enterprises often report bigger costs of their products than they actually are in order to avoid paying taxes. Tax police experts believe only five major taxes should be left in Russia -- real estate tax, income tax for individuals and businesses, value added tax and excise tax. They recommended replacing profit tax with company income tax.
