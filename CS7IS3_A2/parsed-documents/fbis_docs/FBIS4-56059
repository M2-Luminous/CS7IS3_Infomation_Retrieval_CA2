[passage omitted] On the ground, EC observers reported that Tuesday's fighting, which involved artillery exchanges, left at least three dead among government forces and nine among civilians, according to Major Rob Annink, spokesman for UNPROFOR. Annink also pointed to the presence of three tanks, two of them Soviet model T-84s, in government lines, the first time they had been noticed in the region. He was unable to say whether the tanks were part of the Bosnian Army's armor or whether they had been borrowed from local HVO [Croatian Defense Council] Croat forces, now their nominal allies. The Bosnian forces were pushing westwards, towards the Serb-held town of Teslic, possibly in order to seize some strategic heights and so bolster their defensive positions, Annink said. The government attack was a "limited" one, but was "well prepared and continuing," he said. Further north, calm returned to the outskirts of the Serb-held town of Brcko, an area linking western Bosnia to Serbia. On Monday, government forces fired 10 shells at the town, five of which hit a power transformer, Annink said. Elsewhere in the country, there were clashes in the Bugojno and Turbe regions of central Bosnia and near Kladanj and Dastansko, northeast of here. [passage omitted]
