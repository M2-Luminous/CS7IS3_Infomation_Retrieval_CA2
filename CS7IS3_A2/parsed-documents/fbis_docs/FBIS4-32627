Security Council action. Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic quoted at a news conference, held after the federal government session, a statement in which the government said it expected of the U.N. Security Council immediately to take necessary measures to avoid consequences which a further negative development of events could have for the peace process. The Yugoslav Government statement said that, at the present crucial moment, it was the primary duty and responsibility of the Security Council not to permit a real chance for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina to fall through. The statement said that, if use was not made of that chance, there would unavoidably follow an escalation of conflicts with unforeseeable consequences. Prime Minister Kontic said that the developments since June 10, when the Geneva ceasefire agreement went into effect, showed that not all sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina wanted a peaceful solution. The creation of the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina has increased the ambitions of the radical Muslim leadership to persevere in its choice of a military solution, Kontic said. He set out that the Muslim-Croat side was using the Geneva ceasefire agreement for open preparations for a large-scale military offensive, which he said was confirmed in reports of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The Yugoslav Government said the UNPROFOR reports showed, among other things, that Muslim-Croat forces were supplying themselves with large quantities of most modern weapons and were not prevented in doing so. The statement said the regrouping of Muslim-Croat forces, coupled with a steady escalation of their combat operations, aimed at provoking the resumption of the war, were a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement and could seriously undermine all efforts invested so far to achieve peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Yugoslav Government said that Muslim-Croat forces were of late launching strong offensive operations against Bosnian Serb positions, and also towns, practically on all lines separating the two sides, which it said resulted in numerous casualties among the civilian population and in material damages. The statement said it was encouraging, nevertheless, that the Bosnian Serb forces were, for the time being, reacting with extreme restraint to the Muslim-Croat offensive operations and preventing the military operations from turning into a conflict on the largest possible scale. The Yugoslav Government said it viewed as crucial the current phase of the negotiations, which it said should lead to a resolution of the crisis caused by the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Prime Minister Kontic said it was the Yugoslav Government's position that the active participation of international factors--the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia-- in the quest of a lasting political solution, one acceptable to all sides in the Bosnian conflict, gave rise to hope that the tragic civil war would soon be brought to a halt and conditions would be created also for the solution of other major issues on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Government expects that full use will be made of the currently favourable elements and it, itself, is trying to make a concrete contribution to that end. The government said that Yugoslavia maintained that stable peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina was possible only through negotiations, and it called on the international community to put pressure on those who were violating the signed ceasefire agreement and demand that they immediately accept peace as the sole option. The Yugoslav Government listed in the annex to the statement the ceasefire violations committed by the Muslim side since the agreement took effect. The Yugoslav Government set out in the annex that UNPROFOR representatives had been informed about all the incidents, and that they, themselves, had been able to see in the field that Muslim troops were acting contrary to the ceasefire agreement. It said UNPROFOR representatives had promised representatives of the Bosnian Serb Army that they would inform their respective commands about everything.
