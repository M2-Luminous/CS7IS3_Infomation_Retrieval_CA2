Until press time, it was reported that NRP [National Religious Party] Knesset Member [MK] Sha'ul Yahalom and two policemen had been injured. Demonstrations were held, among other locations, at the Qiryat Shemona junction, the Miron junction, Karmi'el, Yoqne'am, Karkur, Rosh Ha'ayn, Haifa, the Golani junction, the Hadera junction, near the prime minister's home in Tel Aviv, and near the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem. Over 2,000 people took part in a violent demonstration near Rabin's residence in Jerusalem. The demonstrators clashed with policemen and attempted to storm the house. The police on its own initiative closed off the road opposite Rabin's residence and permitted the demonstrators to step off the sidewalk. However, when the crowd subsequently tried to forcibly rush at the house, they were repelled by dozens of policemen, some of whom were on horseback. Serious traffic jams were reported at around 2200 [1900 GMT] after dozens of burning tires were thrown on King George street. Tires and dumpsters were also set alight in the Ge'ula neighborhood and Hashabat Square. [passage omitted] Deputy Jerusalem Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir, who attended the demonstration, said that at the next municipal council meeting, he would propose awarding the title of friend of Jerusalem to anyone who would assassinate 'Arafat. [passage omitted] Hundreds of right-wing demonstrators yesterday participated in a demonstration opposite the prime minister's home in Ramat Aviv. At the demonstration, which was organized by the Eretz Yisra'el Front, which includes all the right-wing parties, the organizers claimed that the murder of two soldiers at the Erez checkpoint on 20 May, proved that the peace was an illusion and the army's operation in Lebanon yesterday was just a flashy maneuver to justify the government's failure in the battle against terrorism.
