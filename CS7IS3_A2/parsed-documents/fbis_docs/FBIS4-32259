But the cooperation of those enterprises did not succeed because Albania is observing the UN Security Council economic embargo against the Federative [as received] Republic of Yugoslavia. Consequently, the number of the private enterprises which exercise their activity in Malesi e Madhe district has decreased to 92 having 553 employed persons. A concrete example of the embargo's influence is the Vatnikaj Enterprise which had 100 workers before the UN decision for economic embargo against former Yugoslavia. All the workers have now left this enterprise and Vatnikaj is close to bankruptcy.
