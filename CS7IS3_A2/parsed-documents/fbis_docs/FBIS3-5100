Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, told a press conference after a morning cabinet meeting that the U.S. way of trying to resolve trade issues through unilateral measures carries the risk of shrinking trade as a whole. "It is worrying that the U.S. strengthened the trade retaliation authority at a time when the international community is trying to boost free-market rules," he said. Kumagai said the top priority for Japan now is to wrap up market- opening measures by the end of March as planned. "I don't think the Japanese market is unfair or exclusive, but nevertheless there is a need to create a market with greater transparency," he said. Japan needs to act voluntarily "to prevent Japan-U.S. relations from lapsing into a vicious cycle," he said.
