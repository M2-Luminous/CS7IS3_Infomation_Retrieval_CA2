The "transparent" borders and the unstable situation create practically ideal conditions for drug dealers. Possibly, this compelled the undersecretary general of the United Nations, the executive director of the United Nations International Program for the Monitoring of Narcotics, Giorgio Giacomelli, to visit Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other "hot" spots in this respect. Indeed, only jointly can one cope with the "narcotics fire" that is swiftly getting out of control. Understanding this, Russia and Tajikistan have concluded an agreement on cooperation in the exchange of information on the question of the fight against narcotics. Kazakhstan has come out as the initiator of the signing of such a document among the Central Asian CIS countries, Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan. The special services and the militia are making every effort to take control of the situation. What the results of this are, judge for yourself. . . . Machinist Vladimir Kruchinin sent a bucket filled with briquettes in red "sweet" wrapping, into the furnace. A moment later, a powerful column of poisonous dark smoke leapt up high into the sky. The fire of 1,500 degrees left only water from the narcotics. Among those who supervised the destruction of the hashish was also the undersecretary general of the United Nations, the executive director of the United Nations International Program for the Monitoring of Narcotics, Giorgio Giacomelli. "I have had the occasion to participate in a multitude of actions connected with the cutting off of the illegal dissemination of narcotics, but such wizardry [feeriya]," Giacomelli acknowledged, "I see for the first time. . . ." For us, too, this is the first such action. But, judging by everything, not the last. Already since the times of the Great Silk Route, Uzbekistan has played the role of an important staging post, through which many thousands of intercontinental cargoes passed. With the collapse of the [Soviet] Union and subsequent weakening of border protection, international narcotics dealers did not fail to use the convenient transportation arteries--dealers for whom the transparent borders inside the countries of the Commonwealth mean additional income and the reduction of risk in the transportation of the goods. How are the narcotics conveyed? Only a few examples. Thirteen metric tons of hashish turned out to be in boxes with raisins in transit through Uzbekistan. Another batch, weighing about two metric tons, was concealed under the packing for walnuts. . . . Today almost every investigator who is involved with the transit of narcotics has among his material evidence a grooved metal pipe--with magnet attachments. This is today the most powerful method of transporting narcotics in batches of up to several kilograms. The cavity of the pipe is filled with narcotic substances and tightened up with a lid. Then, with the help of the magnet, it is fastened to any metal surface--the plating of a barge, a river boat, the bottom of an automobile, a railway car. . . . Thus, more than 14 metric tons of narcotics were detained at the border of Uzbekistan and destroyed in the fire. Such a catch cannot even be boasted of by the specialists working in the region of the so-called "golden triangle." However, this also inclines the special services of Uzbekistan to a serious manner. You know, according to the assertions of analysts, we succeed in detaining only 12 percent of the poison that is being transported.
