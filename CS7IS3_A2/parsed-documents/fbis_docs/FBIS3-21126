Since first topping the one trillion yen mark in 1981, sales have doubled in just eleven years. Among expenditures in the electric power industry, the increase in repair costs was especially high because Kansai Electric Power began replacement of its steam generators. The study covered 520 companies in atomic energy related industries and is based on the data they supplied. Atomic energy related sales in the mining industry totaled ¥2,241,000,000,000, an increase of 22% over 1991. The increase in reactor equipment was 24% over 1991, and fuel cycle related sales also increased 11%, reflecting a rise in sales overall. Among the 326 companies responding, 40 had sales greater than ten billion yen, and the top 50 companies occupied 83% of total sales. When we break down domestic power generation by BWRs and PWRs, each format has about the same number of operating power plants, but when we look at plants under construction and in the planning stages, BWRs outnumber PWRs five to one for an overwhelming advantage. Atomic energy related expenditures by the electric power industry came to ¥1,834,190,000,000 for an increase of 0.5% over 1991. This breaks down to 41.2% for operating and maintenance costs, 39.1% for construction, 15% for fuel, 3.6% for setup costs and 1.1% for miscellaneous expenses. Operating and maintenance costs came to ¥755,300,000,000, a new high. Key: 1. Breakdown of Atomic Energy Related Sales; 2. If we let the expenditures by the electric power industry for 1992 equal 100, the expenditures for 1993-1997 are expected to range from 86 to 92. Construction costs of more than seven hundred billion yen in 1992 are expected to drop to the three hundred billion yen range by 1997. However, Electric Power Development Coordination Council plans call for eleven new NPPs in the next two years with an output of about 12,000,000 kW, and we can expect mid- and long-range construction costs to make a comeback.
