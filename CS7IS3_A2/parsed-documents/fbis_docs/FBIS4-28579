The report quotes a "high-ranking official in the royal government" as saying that "Samdech Sihanouk will become head of state with power and the throne left to his son" and that "this new government, called the national salvation government, will be led by a prime minister who is a neutral personality." The paper adds that there is as yet no clear indication as to who would be the candidate for the post of prime minister. The paper goes on to say that analysts consider this plan a ploy to create further confusion and an attempt to revive the almost doomed roundtable talks. The paper concludes by saying: "Although there is no official reaction yet from the two Samdech Prime Ministers, it is believed that the sole reason for this plan is to bring the Khmer Rouge into this new government! And it is certain that the royal government will not accept this plan. It is still remembered that students and the association of monks from Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory now part of southern Vietnam] recently demanded to stage a demonstration to hand over power to the king; however, this demand was thwarted."
