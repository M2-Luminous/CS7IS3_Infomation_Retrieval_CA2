The use of soft contact lenses (MKL) first introduced in the 1960s and their therapeutic properties, i.e., the ability of creating favorable conditions for the recovery of regenerative processes and protecting the damaged eye from infection as well as retaining the drugs in damaged tissues for a longer time, is considered. The outcome of eye burn treatment using soft contact lenses at various burn gravities, the visual results of eye burns after treatment using soft contact lenses, and the anatomical outcome of eye burns after treatment using soft contact lenses are summarized. The conclusion is drawn that soft contact lenses may be quite effective in correcting blepharospastic blindness and removing or alleviating the corneal syndrome and may be recommended for use in ophthalmic therapeutic films.
