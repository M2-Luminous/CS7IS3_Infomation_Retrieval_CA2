Letters with the same content were sent on Wednesday to the president of the World Bank amd the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Kontic wrote that inflation of more than 20 per cent a day was causing the withdrawal of goods, services and factors of production from the market. The government is aware of the urgency of stabilizing the national currency and putting the financial system back on its feet in order to save the economy, he wrote. The inflation is especially hard on the sick and the poor, Kontic wrote. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is hit by the world's highest inflation as a result of international economic sanctions imposed 19 months ago. Production is paralyzed, imports and exports are banned, and the country's assets are frozen in foreign banks. Retail prices rose by more than 20,000 per cent in November alone. Kontic invited an IMF mission to visit Yugoslavia any time before January 14. The start of monetary reconstruction is scheduled for January 17. The government has requested the UN Sanctions Committee to take action to release Yugoslavia's assets abroad (National Bank reserves and commercial bank deposits), Kontic wrote. These funds would be used to prop up the national currency and soften the transition from inflationary financing to an economy backed by a sound currency, he wrote. The initiative for these activities was given by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Kontic wrote. A team of experts has advised Kontic to start monetary reconstruction on January 17 even if his request is turned down by the international institutions concerned. The experts estimate there will be a deficit of some 800 million [figure as received] during the first half of the year. The deficit, they say, could be covered by releasing the foreign currency reserves of the National Bank and commercial banks. This could be done by lifting the sanctions or finding other ways of giving Yugoslavia access to these funds.
