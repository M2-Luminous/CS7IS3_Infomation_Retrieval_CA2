Kim referred to North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program in a banquet hosted by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. "(North Korea) has threatened peace in this region. But cooperation between South Korea and Japan will surely bring a nuclear-free peace to (the region)," he said. The South Korean president, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday for a three-day visit, said he expects both countries will overcome a transitional period through close cooperation and mutual trust. Prior to the speech by Kim, Hosokawa said that the building-up of relations of trust between Japan and South Korea will begin with addressing the past frankly. Hosokawa touched on Japan's colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, saying, "studying the lessons of the history from now on is a way of strengthening partnership (between Seoul and Tokyo.)" He said it is important for Japan and South Korea to cooperate on every field to develop and stabilize relations between the two nations. Hosokawa said such cooperation will convince Japan and South Korea that they are irreplaceable partners in an international society. Among those who attended the banquet were former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe and Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono.
