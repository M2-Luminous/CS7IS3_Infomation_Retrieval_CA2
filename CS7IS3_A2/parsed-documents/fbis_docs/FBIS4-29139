He said all opinions should be heeded in a democracy. Gen Wimon said people should not misinterpret the participation of the military as interference in politics. "I have stated several times that the military has a policy of non-interference in politics. I will not let the Army become involved," he said. Gen Wimon said soldiers and their families made up 300,000 people, constituting a large part of the community. "Opinions from all sectors should be listened to in a democracy." He said he did not think it improper for military representatives to join the panel because "they can present another view on the panel". "Don't you think military personnel are also Thai people who are entitled to political rights?" he asked. Gen Wimon said although he was a soldier, he could not be barred from exercising his right under a democratic system. "I have performed my duty under a democratic system and it does not involve my military career." Gen Wimon said he had not yet been officially informed whether military representatives would be invited to join the committee. He said he personally would not sit on the committee.
