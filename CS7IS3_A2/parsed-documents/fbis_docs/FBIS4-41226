As of January 1, 1993, Russia owed foreign creditors $74.6 billion. The spending on servicing the foreign debt in accordance with the schedule, coordinated with the creditor-countries, amounts to $40.7 billion, which is three times greater than the current credit balance. Out of this sum $17 billion (including interest) should have been repaid in 1993; $9.7 billion is the deferred 1993 payments and $14 billion -- overdue payments. In real terms, Russia could repay only $2.5 billion in 1993. The report also says that in 1993 Russia succeeded to persuade the Paris Club to transform part of its foreign debt. It reached the agreements on deferring the repayment of DM [deutschmarks] 8.5 billion to Germany, $1 billion to the U.S. and FRF [French francs] 1 billion to France. Depending on the type of the credit, the deferment will range from seven to ten years, plus a period of grace of two to five years. In 1993, import tariffs of about 2.5 trillion rubles were transferred to the federal budget instead of the estimated 4.5 trillion rubles, while revenues, gained from centralized exports, slightly exceeded 6 billion rubles. The report says that in 1993 the hard-currency balance in the Russian banks increased by 25 percent, while Russian residents' assets in foreign banks increased 2.8 times and amounted to $25 billion by the end of the year.
