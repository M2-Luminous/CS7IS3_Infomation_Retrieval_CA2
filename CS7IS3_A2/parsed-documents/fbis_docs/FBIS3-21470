There is no doubt that Iraq carries the major burden of suffering. Kuwait, though still trying to recover from the impact of an exceptionally brutal occupation, has succeeded in healing a lot of its wounds. It has also corrected many of its past mistakes, if not all of them. It has also abandoned its past comedic radicalism, learned the value of humility, and reformulated its policies to reflect the realities of its existence. As for the neighboring Arab states, they have learned many a lesson of the shock generated by the invasion and the consequent liberation of Kuwait. Experience has moderated their usually seraphic view of international life. They have come to realize that they live among neighbors that are particularly dangerous and that security cannot be achieved solely through appeasement and check diplomacy. Iran, on the other hand, has failed to exploit the opportunity afforded by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to regain its appropriate place in the [community of] nations. Iranian strategy remains a function of fiery slogans that exclude any rational analysis of the situation. The principal loser, as we already mentioned, has been Iraq. It continues to live under harsh restrictions imposed on its national sovereignty. Part of its land has been taken away, ostensibly to create a "secure haven" for the Kurds. Iraqi air space is largely off limits to Iraqi flights and the Iraqi Government is unable to access its frozen assets abroad. More importantly, Iraq is unable to engage in common commerce, including the exportation of its oil and the importation of goods other than medical and food supplies. Is it not time, then, to scrutinize the events in Iraq and its environs and then inquire if current policies should be maintained without modification? There are endless stories of the misery, deprivation, and despair that beset the people of Iraq as a result of international sanctions. We cannot shrug off those accounts as the manufacture of Saddam's infernal propaganda apparatus, because they originate with such trusted institutions as UNICEF and Physicians Without Borders, as well as with independent relief organizations. One must therefore take these accounts seriously. And that brings us to the question of sanctions, since we should never forget why they were imposed in the first place or which of them should remain in place and for how long. Some people, including the Kuwaitis who suffered, want the sanctions to continue until Saddam Husayn is toppled. Such a position, though understandable, has no justification, because Saddam's overthrow cannot be a fitting United Nations political objective, at least not according to the resolutions adopted so far by the international Security Council. That is a matter for the Iraqi people; and even then it would be difficult for us to fathom how a starving people that are forced to spend most of their time trying to survive would have the power to topple such a particularly abominable regime. Worse yet, the sanctions have prevented the fractured opposition from working to solidify its ranks, embark on a viable strategy, and offer a real alternative. The opposition has pinned its hopes on the mistaken belief that sanctions would destroy Saddam, therefore allowing his opponents to ride a red carpet into Baghdad. A second reason cited for maintaining the sanctions is to compel Iraq to abide by cease-fire stipulations and [to respect] Security Council resolutions. That is a sound and justifiable view. Still, one cannot dismiss [the idea of establishing] some sort of correlation between the scope and intensity of the sanctions on one hand, and the degree of Iraqi compliance on the other. In other words, if there is Iraqi compliance with 50 percent of the conditions, should not the sanctions be proportionately reduced? There is no doubt that Baghdad has done all it can to evade compliance. It is also obvious that Iraq is far from fulfilling all of its commitments. The nuclear aspect has been dealt with, but Iraq continues to conceal a major portion of its chemical and germ arsenal. It also continues to be evasive, not only on the issue of borders with Kuwait, but also on relinquishing all claims against its neighbor. That may be reason to keep some of the sanctions, at least until Iraq fulfills all of its obligations, but the stick-alone policy is not likely to be fruitful, and neither is the carrot-alone policy. One should put one's self in the shoes of the Iraqis. They have no incentive to honor their commitments because it is their belief that they will continue to suffer the full [burden of] sanctions whether or not they comply with UN resolutions. In a region where international policy is considered to be nothing more than a series of conspiracies, it is not inconceivable for the Iraqis to believe that they are victims of an international conspiracy. The time has come to review Iraqi performance over the past three years, in its entirety, in order to determine whether or not changes in current policies toward Iraq are warranted.
