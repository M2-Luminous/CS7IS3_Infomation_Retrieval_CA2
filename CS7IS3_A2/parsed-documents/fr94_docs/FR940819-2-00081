ACTION: Public notice. SUMMARY: The north half of the Wood River Ranch, 1,680 acres, acquired by BLM in Klamath County is closed to motorized vehicular travel from the time of acquisition until completion of the Management Plan. The area will be open for day use only. Day use is defined as two hours before sunrise and once half hour after sunset. Overnight camping is prohibited. No fires of any kind are permitted. No personal property such as hunting decoys, tents, etc., can remain on the Wood River Ranch during the overnight hours. Pit hunting blinds may not be dug on the property. These restrictions are necessary to prevent resource damage to soil, roads, vegetation, including spread of noxious weeds and possible damage to cultural resources. Limitations are also necessary to reduce the development of trails/roads due to unregulated cross country travel. Vehicles used for administrative, emergency, and law enforcement will be exempt from the motor vehicle restrictions. Adjacent landowners, their agents and employees, with a right-of-way for access, may use vehicles on the dike roads only to gain access to adjacent private property, may not take vehicles off of the dike roads, and while on the Wood River Ranch, may not off-load personnel, personal property or equipment. Motorized boats are not considered motorized vehicles but their use is restricted to the permanently flooded marsh. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Any person who fails to comply with this closure/restriction order is subject to the penalties provided in 8360.0&hyph;7. Violations are punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months. For more information contact: Lakeview District, Klamath Falls Resource Area Manager, A.
