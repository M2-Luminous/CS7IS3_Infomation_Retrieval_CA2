"Information highways" are a huge public works project, kicked off recently in France by the prime minister. The following surveys the current situation and outlook. France is setting out on the "information highways." The United States, where Vice President Al Gore is an ardent advocate, has made superhighways a top development priority. Now France is getting involved in the huge project, which was kicked off by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur during an interministerial meeting last 22 February. The goal is to install communication infrastructures that can transmit data, images, and sound interactively, throughout France. In other words, to set up the network of the third millenium, which will ultimately provide multimedia access to everyone. Two major technological breakthroughs--fiber optics and the digital revolution--provide the background for the sweeping project. Together they obliterate the lines between telecommunications, audiovisual broadcasting, and data-processing, and will make it possible in the future to combine telephone, television, and computer in a single multimedia terminal. As Gerard Longuet, the minister in charge of the program, stressed during a council of ministers meeting 23 February, information highways are going to "profoundly modify the way many economic and social activities are carried out: [they will result in] more telecommuting, new forms of educational and training support, broad access to professional or leisure data banks, and the introduction of services tailored by the television viewer or consumer." The government estimates the growth outlook for new communication technologies at 8 percent a year, or about 10 percent of Europe's GNP around 2000. This makes future multimedia networks of crucial economic and strategic importance, and explains the prime minister's plan to bring together all the players--France Telecom, cable companies, television stations, multimedia publishers, audiovisual producers, and computer service operators--in a "growth pact." The pact aims to raise several billion French francs' [Fr] worth of investments, notably in cable, over the next three years. "But the economic objective must not take precedence over the essential public service mission of these infrastructures," stressed Edouard Balladur. The prime minister believes the government should play a dual role: "To ensure that electronic highways are developed in a way that meets the country's economic, social, educational, and cultural needs on the one hand. And to make them quickly available to the greatest number of households, schools, and businesses on the other." The Minitel Precedent The French initiative falls within the European perspective advanced by proposals of the "White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment," which was prepared by the European Commission and adopted by the Twelve's heads of state and government in late 1993. In it, the Commission estimates the total investment needed in the telecommunications sector alone at ECU150 billion (about Fr975 billion) between now and 2000. European information highways would absorb ECU67 billion, 35 billion to install a high-speed communication network and consolidate European ISDNs [Integrated Services Digital Networks], 12 billion for electronic services (electronic images, data bases, electronic mail), and 20 billion for information systems and services (telecommuting, on-line medical assistance, remote administration). The Twelve set up a brainstorming group, headed by European industrial affairs commissioner Martin Bangemann, on 8 February to prepare the development of this "information society" and related new technologies on a continental scale. The group of experts will submit its conclusions next 24 and 25 June at the European Corfou summit, which will deal with the question of electronic highways and their funding. In France, the national information highways project will benefit from a famous precedent: the success of the minitel, which now offers 23,000 services to 6.5 million terminal-equipped users and roughly 500,000 videotex desktops. As for Numeris, France's version of the ISDN, it spans the entire territory and can already carry voice, data, and still or slightly animated pictures. But its transmission speed is grossly inadequate for true multimedia and interactive use. Hence the need to launch a new generation of "wide-band, very-high-speed" networks, which combine fiber optic equipment and new transmission and switching techniques, particularly ATM (asynchronous transfer mode). France Telecom has already invested heavily to equip its network with fiber optics. The public carrier is preparing to restructure its transmission network (the "national roads"), to convert it from a branching architecture to one that is "petal-like." It is also getting ready to launch the first commercial high-speed-tranmission services via ATM in 1995. Moreover, France has undeniable strengths in industrial telecommunication products, notably Alcatel's mastery of broadband networks. A Study Mission But the performance level of a network is not the only thing to be considered. Much is at stake in the notion of information highways, including technologies, industries, regulations, and effects on civilization. What should be sent out on these highways, to meet which needs, and to provide what kind of new services? What should be the public service role of the information highways? Who will have what kind of access to knowledge? What sort of legal framework should "regulate" the roads--in other words, allow the flourishing of new markets and the jobs they will create while meeting general and regional development needs? How will the information highways complement cable? The government has assigned the job of exploring all these critical questions to Gerard Thery, a former telecommunications general director whose name is linked to France's effort to "catchup" in telephones in the seventies and to the launch of the minitel. Gerard Thery will submit an analysis and proposals to the government this summer. His assignment is preparation for a bill that may be presented to parliament in the fall, before initial experiments get underway at the end of the year.
