Nule stated: The deal stands, and the only thing missing is for Cuba to present the corresponding guarantees because we are talking about a business deal as any other where there is a buyer and a seller. Minister Nule pointed out that Colombia sells oil to anyone who pays for the oil in cash and at international prices. Nule dismissed threats by Cuban emigre extremists in Miami, who threatened to boycott Colombian products in the United States in retaliation for selling oil to Cuba.
