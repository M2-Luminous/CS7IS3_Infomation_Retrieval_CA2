FR940819-2-00070 FR940819-2-00043 The following table illustrates the result of this recommendation compared with the current methodology using 1994 projections. 1994 NICB Estimate ($ Millions) 1‚ê£ 1Current Method 1BHC structure and treasury yield Clearing balance income: Investable funds $5,417.8 $5,417.8 Earnings rate 3.0877% 4.1109% Earnings on invested portion of clearing balances 167.3 222.7 Cost of earnings credits: Cost (Fed funds rate) 3.0079% 3.0079% Net cost of earnings credits 141.9 141.9 Net Income on clearing balances $25.4 $80.8 Had the recommended approach been in place for the 1994 estimate, clearing balance earnings would have increased $55.4 million or 33.1 percent, from $167.3 million using the current method to $222.7 million. This is due to a 102 basis points increase in the earnings rate, from 3.0877 percent in the current method to 4.1109 percent 1 . NICB would have increased from $25.4 million in the current method to $80.8 million. 1 The imputed weighted average earnings rate is derived as follows (short, intermediate, and long-term, respectively): ((32.67% * 3.0877%) + (27.58% * 3.3889%) + (39.75% * 5.4526%)) = 4.1109% Moreover, the Board believes that investment decisions made by BHCs are not static. Instead, these decisions are the result of several considerations, including the economic environment, their risk policies, and investment opportunities available. Consequently, the Board recognizes that the recommended methodology may require further adjustment based on economic situations or new investment opportunities. Prudent private sector investors would be aware of changing variables and would make the necessary investment changes to reflect market conditions. Accordingly, the Board would propose to make such adjustments, without public comment, unless the adjustment entails a change in the methodology. Therefore, imputed investment income would be subject to the Board's approval as are fee schedules for Federal Reserve priced services and the PSAF. In summary, the current short term nature of Federal Reserve clearing balance income is not representative of the behavior of most correspondent banks. Although the recommended methodology still does not purely match BHC activity, the Board believes that it more closely parallels the practices of a private sector service provider. The recommended methodology also complies with Federal Reserve pricing principles. The Board also believes that the Treasury rate provides a reasonable proxy for the actual rate realized by bank holding companies on clearing balances. The Treasury rate is simpler to administer because it does not incorporate a risk premium or administrative costs of managing portfolio risk. The Board requests comments on the proposal to: (a) change the methodology for imputing clearing balance income to more closely parallel the practices of a private sector service provider and (b) change the rate used to impute clearing balance income from the 90-day Treasury bill coupon equivalent yield to a longer term Treasury rate based on the earning asset maturity structure of the largest BHCs. By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 12, 1994. William W. Wiles, Secretary of the Board.
