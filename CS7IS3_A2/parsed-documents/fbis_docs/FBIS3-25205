Late last year, there were claims that Cameroon gendarmes were raiding villages in Nigerian territory. Then, Nigerian troops moved onto islands on the peninsula, ostensibly to protect Nigerian nationals living there. Now, the NIGERIAN NEWS AGENCY [NAN] says some 18,000 Nigerians have fled the area after raids by Cameroon gendarmes. And it seems a visit to Cameroon by Nigerian Foreign Minister Babagana Kingibe has not achieved very much. On the line to Yaounde, Raggi Omar asked Cameroon's minister of external affairs delegate, Francis Nkwain, if gendarmes had raided the disputed region. [Begin recording] [Nkwain] First of all, the content of the news is absolutely wrong. We are not pursuing anybody and if we were in a war situation, then it should be the military. The gendarmes are not the people who go to war on behalf of our nation. So, that must be somebody who is writing who doesn't even know what is happening in Cameroon. Secondly, the peninsula has always been controversial on the part of Nigeria, but the peninsula is Cameroon. We didn't fight a war with Nigeria to gain any land, no. We got the land from history. When the colonial power left, we took over. And the maps are there, there is no question about it. [Omar] So, you are completely refuting these reports on the NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA that thousands of Nigerians in this area are fleeing? [Nkwain] We refute them because it is impossible even for that to be the news. [Omar] But are people on the move in that region, can you confirm that? [Nkwain] We can confirm that the island--I mean, the peninsula--has been occupied by Nigerian troops since 30 December 1993 to 4 January 1994 and that the foreign minister of Nigeria came on the heels of our complaints and was received here by our head of state; and that our head of state sent the minister of external relations of Cameroon, who went to see President Abacha on the same issue; and that we all agreed that we were going to go down to the place to see whether or not the Nigerians had occupied the place or not; and we met today according to plan, and the foreign minister of Nigeria wouldn't let us go there. [Omar] So, let me get this straight: You met the Nigerian foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, today to go and see this area but he refused to go? [Ekwain] The minister of external relations of Cameroon, Mr. Oyono, was in Bouya, has been in Bouya since yesterday, where they met. And they were meeting there to proceed to the area to prove whether the place.... [pauses] The question was whether it was occupied or not. We are also aware that the Nigerian press has totally come out with funny stories in order to rationalize their action. That, we think, is their effort to prove to the world.... [pauses] That also proves to us that maybe they know they did something wrong. We are a small nation, you know. Nigeria is a big nation. [Omar] Have your meetings with the Nigerian foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, achieved anything at all? [Ekwain] I say we have not because we were to meet to join forces and go down on to the territory, but he wouldn't let us go there now, so I am waiting for the minister to come back and then we will know the details of what happened thereafter. Now, if in the meanwhile, they mount another campaign through their media, it is not our problem to say horrible things about Cameroon. [end recording]
