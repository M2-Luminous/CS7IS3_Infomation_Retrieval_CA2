FR940725-2-00076 FR940725-2-00047 [UT&hyph;050&hyph;04&hyph;4210&hyph;05] Proposed Plan Amendment AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: This notice of intent is to advise the public that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) intends to consider a proposal which would require amending an existing planning document. SUMMARY: The BLM is proposing to amend the Warm Springs Resource Management Plan, which includes BLM-administered lands in Millard County, Utah. The purpose of the amendment would be to identify certain lands as suitable for transfer to the State of Utah, through State indemnity selection, for agricultural purposes. DATES: The comment period for this proposed plan amendment will commence with the date of publication of this notice. Comments must be submitted on or before August 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the proposed plan amendment should be sent to F. Rex Rowley, Bureau of Land Management, Warm Springs Resource Area Manager, 15 East 500 North, P.O. Box 778, Fillmore, Utah 84631. Existing planning documents and information are available at the above address or telephone (801) 743&hyph;6811. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The lands identified for transfer comprise 200 acres in Millard County described as follows: T. 21 S., R. 19 W., Sec. 29, W1/2SW1/4, E1/2SE1/4, SW1/4SE1/4, Salt Lake Meridian, Utah. The existing plan does not identify these lands for disposal. However, the State of Utah filed a State indemnity selection application, UTU&hyph;71695, to have 200 acres of Federally owned land and interest in land transferred to the State of Utah pursuant to sections 2275 and 2276 of the Revised Statutes, as amended, (43 U.S.C. 851&hyph;852). Satisfaction of indemnity selection rights and disposal of parcels for that purpose are considered as ``serving the national interest'' in the context of Section 102(a)(1) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and in connection with land use planning. Therefore, this proposal appears to have merit and will be considered through the plan amendment process. A.J. Meredith, Acting State Director.
