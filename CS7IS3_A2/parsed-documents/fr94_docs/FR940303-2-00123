The American Gas Association Laboratories must also abide by the following conditions of this expansion of its recognition, in addition to those already required by 29 CFR 1910.7: This recognition does not apply to any aspect of any program which: (1) Is available only to qualified manufacturers and is based upon the NRTL's evaluation and accreditation of the manufacturer's quality assurance program; or (2) makes use of reciprocal testing from another non-NRTL. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration shall be allowed access to AGA's facilities and records for purposes of ascertaining continuing compliance with the terms of its recognition and to investigate as OSHA deems necessary; If AGA has reason to doubt the efficacy of any test standard it is using under this program, it shall promptly inform the test standard developing organization of this fact and provide that organization with appropriate relevant information upon which its concerns are based; AGA shall not engage in or permit others to engage in any misrepresentation of the scope or conditions of its recognition. As part of this condition, AGA agrees that it will allow no representation that it is either a recognized or an accredited Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) without clearly indicating the specific equipment or material to which this recognition is tied, or that its recognition is limited to certain products; AGA shall inform OSHA as soon as possible, in writing, of any change of ownership or key personnel, including details; AGA will continue to meet the requirements for recognition in all areas where it has been recognized; and AGA will always cooperate with OSHA to assure compliance with the letter as well as the spirit of its recognition and 29 CFR 1910.7. effective date: This recognition will become effective on March 3, 1994, and will be valid until June 7, 1995, (a period of five years from the date of the original recognition, June 7, 1990), unless terminated prior to that date, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.7. Signed at Washington, DC this 25th day of February, 1994. Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4896 Filed 3&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;26&hyph;M
