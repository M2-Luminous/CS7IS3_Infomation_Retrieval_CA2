Russia should be given the greatest credit. On February 9, NATO, while keeping Russia in the dark, sent an ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs, requesting them either to withdraw heavy weapons from the 20-kilometer exclusion zone or face air strikes. Russia promptly responded to NATO's move. Moscow launched a strong media offensive against possible NATO air strikes, which it said could only help escalate the war and damage the peace process. It said NATO had no right to make any decision on the Bosnia issue on behalf of the U.N. Security Council. On the other hand, Russia started an all-out diplomatic campaign to keep the ultimatum from being materialized. President Boris Yeltsin led the mission personally to explain to the leaders of the Western countries Russia's proposal: to demilitarize Sarajevo and put it under U.N. control. He also called for urgent U.N. meeting to cope with the worsening situation. On February 17, three days before the deadline, Yeltsin sent his special envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, to Sarajevo with his letter. The special envoy promised the ethnic Serb forces that Russia will deploy peacekeepers in the Bosnian capital. In return, the Serb side agreed to implement the ultimatum. The crisis was eased for a while, and everybody sighed a breath of relief. Local news media commented favorably on Moscow's mediation, describing it as a good show of Russia's independent foreign policy, which might help Russia strengthen its position and its influence on the world stage. The Balkan region had been a sphere of influence of the former Soviet Union. Russia, the legitimate heir of the Soviet empire, wants to keep it away from the finger of NATO, its flirting friend and hereditary foe. Moreover, if NATO had launched air strikes, it would have been its first military action on territories under the tutelage of the former Soviet Union. The Russian newspaper "PRAVDA" commented that it would have meant that NATO, the overpowering international military group of the time, was broadening its sphere of responsibility, and that it would harm Russia's strategic interests. From the geopolitical point of view, Russia wants to retain its interests in the Balkan region and in the meantime strengthen its big-power image in the world. The Russian Army newspaper "KRASNAYA ZVEZDA" said that if the West really wants peace in the Balkans, it ought to treat Russia as a big power and an equal partner. Peace could be achieved in former Yugoslavia and Bosnia only when the interests of various sides, including Russia, have been taken into careful account, it said. In Russia, political parties and government branches are unprecedentedly united in objecting to NATO's air strike threat. Yeltsin's tough stance on the issue will surely moderate the anti-air strike sentiment at home and strengthen his leadership. Moscow's success in persuading ethnic Serbs to end their 23-month siege of Sarajevo has pushed one step forward the process of politically settling the Bosnia conflict. Kremlin is winning in its diplomatic campaign. On February 21, after the deadline passed peacefully, Yeltsin phoned German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, putting forward three major tasks for an ultimate solution to the Bosnia crisis: -- Entrusting Sarajevo to U.N. management; -- Taking measures to strengthen other "security zones" in Bosnia; and -- Urging the three warring sides to sign an agreement on a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Observers here predict that Russia will seek to play an increasingly independent role in the making of peace in the war-tattered former Yugoslavia.
