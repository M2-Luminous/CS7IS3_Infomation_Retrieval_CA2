A set of 38 letters, forwarded to high-profile figures like House Speaker Yi Man-sop, opposition leader Yi Ki-taek and outgoing Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, insisted that the two sides hold a unified rally on Aug. 15 in Seoul or in Pyongyang. The rally should discuss "great leader" Kim Il-song's 10-point declaration for national reunification and unity proposed a year ago, the letters said. North Korea had tried to deliver the letters directly to the South on April 11, but the Seoul government refused to accept them. The board said it will not send the letters to each addressee and instead put them on public view.
