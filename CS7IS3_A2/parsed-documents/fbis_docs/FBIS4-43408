In reply to a question on the issue at his weekly news conference today, Ataman recalled Greek Cypriot claims that the CBM process has been terminated. Pointing out that the positive and constructive approach adopted by the Turkish Cypriot side has created an atmosphere of restlessness and uneasiness in south Cyprus, Ataman noted that the Greek Cypriot National Council has unanimously declared that it is out of the question to return to the CBM process. Ataman recalled Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias' statement in Istanbul that the CBM process is dead, adding that, however, the British foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state made statements conveying that the process is continuing. Ataman continued: For some time now there have been reports in the Greek Cypriot press that the successful attitude of the Turkish Cypriot side is causing concern and that if the process continues the Greek Cypriot side will not hesitate to take a stand against the United Nations. Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis' threat to resign has also been interpreted by the Greek Cypriot press as a form of blackmail against the United Nations. As you can understand this interpretation shows that the stand adopted by the Greek Cypriot side demonstrates its intransigent intentions and approach to the CBM process and to efforts aimed at finding a solution to the Cyprus problem through negotiations.
