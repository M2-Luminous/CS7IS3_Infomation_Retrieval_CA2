[Begin Solana recording] The whole operation remains open and remains ready to be put into effect if necessary. What I can tell you is, I stress again, that the situation on the ground is developing favorably, positively. The deadlines of the conditions of the ultimatum are being met. And I will emphasize once again that our forces and the Spaniards on the ground are well.

According to the foreign minister, this stance is supported in full by the Spanish government. [Begin Solana recording] It is the wish of the Spanish government, in collaboration with the European Union, to try to use this initiative which has been started to liberate Sarajevo to give a new impetus to the peace negotiations, which should spread to the whole territory of Yugoslavia. I can tell you that some initiatives are already underway. Yesterday and today we, many of the European ministers, were in touch with our Russian, Canadian and U.S. counterparts to try to put forward a new peace initiative as soon as possible. [end recording] [Alonso] The foreign minister emphasized that yesterday the government kept in touch with the different parliamentary groups so that they could have the most detailed possible information on the latest developments.
