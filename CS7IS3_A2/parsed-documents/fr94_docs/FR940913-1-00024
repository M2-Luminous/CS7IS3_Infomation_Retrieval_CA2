FR940913-1-00024 FR940913-1-00010 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Public Buildings Service 41 CFR Part 101&hyph;20 RIN 3090&hyph;AF50 Energy Conservation AGENCY: Public Buildings Service, General Services Administration. ACTION: Proposed Rule. SUMMARY: Since the mid-1970's, the General Services Administration has imposed rigid building temperature and air circulation standards in the buildings it owns and manages. These standards were established to promote energy conservation without appropriate attention to occupant comfort and productivity. The results of a recent survey of GSA's building occupants showed a low customer satisfaction in the areas of building temperatures and indoor air quality. These results, plus the introduction of new building energy technologies which provide energy conservation without diminution of comfort and service to building occupants, allow GSA to eliminate rigid temperature standards. This proposed rule will eliminate operating standards and allow for building temperatures to be maintained in a manner satisfactory to users and consistent with local commercial practices. In addition, it will delete the minimum ventilation rate and replace it with the ventilation standards specified by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE Standard 62 Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality). This will improve temperature comfort levels, ventilation, and the indoor air quality of buildings. This will, in turn, improve customer satisfaction and productivity. DATES: Comments are due on or before November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to: General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Office of Real Property Management and Safety, Washington, DC 20405. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jim Carelock, Office of Real Property Management and Safety, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;1563. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12862_Setting Customer Service Standards. Executive Order 12862 states that in order to carry out the principles of the National Performance Review, the Federal Government must be customer-driven. GSA, in an effort to become more customer driven, seeks to improve customer satisfaction, by changing regulations that have a direct effect on three areas of low customer satisfaction. GSA's customers, building tenants, have indicated by their responses to customer surveys that they have very low satisfaction levels for the following: ventilation, 42 percent satisfied; indoor air quality, 44 percent satisfied; summer temperature, 53 percent satisfied; and winter temperature, 56 percent satisfied. The two sections of the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) addressed in this proposal mandate space temperatures and ventilation rates that contribute to low customer satisfaction. These changes will permit the Buildings Managers to control building temperatures and mandate adherence to the latest air ventilation guidelines. On April 11, 1994 the Administrator of GSA granted a class deviation for the two sections of the FPMR. This action made the changes recommended in this proposed rule effective immediately for GSA buildings. Executive Order 12866 The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act GSA has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).

For the reasons set out in the preamble, it is proposed to amend 41 CFR Part 101&hyph;20 as follows: PART 101&hyph;20_MANAGEMENT OF BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS 1. The authority citation for Part 101&hyph;20 continues to read as follows: Authority: Sec. 205(c), 63 Stat. 390; 40 U.S.C. 486(c). SUBPART 101&hyph;20.1_BUILDING OPERATIONS, MAINTENANCE, PROTECTION, AND ALTERATIONS 2. Section 101&hyph;20.107 is amended by revising paragraph (c) (1) and paragraph (e) to read as follows: §101&hyph;20.107 Energy conservation. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (1) To the maximum extent practicable, temperatures will be maintained to maximize customer satisfaction by conforming to local commercial equivalent temperature levels and operating practices. GSA will seek to minimize energy use while operating its buildings in this manner. During non-working hours, heating temperatures shall be set no higher than 55 degrees Fahrenheit and air-conditioning will not be provided except as necessary to return space temperatures to a suitable level for the beginning of working hours. * * * * * (e) During working hours in periods of heating and cooling, provide ventilation in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 62, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality where practical in light of building structure, system capacity or other factors relevant to individual facilities. Where compliance with this ASHRAE standard is not practical, provide the maximum practicable amount of ventilation during periods of heating and cooling and pursue opportunities to increase ventilation up to the applicable ASHRAE standard. * * * * * Dated: June 2, 1994.
