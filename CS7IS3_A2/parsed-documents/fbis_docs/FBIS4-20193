However, this improvement inevitably depends on the Cyprus issue, he stressed. If [Turkish Prime Minister] Mrs. Ciller wants to assume initiatives regarding the Cyprus issue, she should realize that the issue is a problem of invasion and occupation of a large part of the island by Turkish forces. The Turkish and Turkish Cypriot sides should therefore show good intentions, he said. These intentions, the spokesman concluded, should be associated with both the confidence-building measures and the substance of the Cyprus issue.
