For a long time, the German company Schering was the only one with a Siemens/Fujitsu machine in its Berlin Lab. Now Bayer AG (also German) has ordered a computer from Cray Research. A two-processor, air-cooled Cray C92A system featuring very large DRAM memory capacity is scheduled to be installed in first-quarter 1994 in Bayer's Central Research Facility in Leverkusen, Germany. Terms were not disclosed. Bayer is global player in the chemical industry. In Germany they are producing at five different sites, but they are also producing in Japan, they have a big affiliated company in the United States of America, and they will invest more than ECU150 million in China, Bayer plans to use the new system to solve large, computationally intensive problems in process simulation -- such as planning and laying out of production facilities -- and to optimise plant operations for safety, environmental factors and cost-effectiveness. Virtually all supercomputer producers were competing for the business and Bayer's decision followed extensive benchmark testing, said Wolfram Wagner, director of technology resources in the Central Research Facility. These test runs showed that by simulating complex processes, Bayer would be able to reduce costs and time in process development and gain a clear competitive advantage, by optimising plant operations worldwide. "The Cray system, in conjunction with high-performance software, will open a new dimension in process development for us," he said. "Process simulation means designing the production facility on the computer system, optimising it dynamically, and speeding up its operations. It seems that we can reduce the production costs with more than 10 percent." Bayer and Cray Research also have agreed to collaborate extensively on developing and optimising computer-aided steady state and dynamic plant simulation. The focal points of the collaboration are: -- Analysis and performance optimisation of plant simulation software; -- Optimisation of application software, through the introduction and testing of specialised software tools; -- Development and testing of new computer-aided methods for simulating complex chemical plants on the T3D, Cray's parallel system; -- Porting and optimisation of applications software on multiprocessor systems, in collaboration with Cray Research and established software vendors; -- Testing of parallel computers for the use of this application software on real production problems.
