The Komsomolets sank five years ago in the Barents Sea. It is rusting so quickly that there is a danger of plutonium being released from the wreckage this year. The Netherlands has already had extensive talks with Russia about the nature and the costs of a salvage operation. If the two countries agree, the Dutch salvage companies Smit Internationale and Heerema Offshore will both be involved in the operation.
