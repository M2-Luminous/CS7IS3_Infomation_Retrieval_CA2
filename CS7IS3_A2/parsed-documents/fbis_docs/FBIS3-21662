He said that this is a personal matter and that he doesn't know much about this. If he knew anything about this, he would be smarter than American officials. Those who do something wrong must be dealt with in accord with the law. That's it. As for issuing statements about this, that is the duty of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The military probably won't get involved. The reporter asked, If someone in the military is involved in narcotics trafficking, will that affect the military? Lt. Gen. Chettha said that it shouldn't. The military is a huge organization. If only five out of a hundred people are bad, that's pretty good. But there are more than 100,000 people in the military. This shouldn't have any adverse effect on the military. We have constantly carried on narcotics suppression activities. Even abroad, even if the president or prime minister is involved in such activities, action must be taken in accord with the law. If there is clear evidence that a high-ranking official is involved, he must be punished in accord with the law. But if he is innocent, the military has disciplinary measures to provide help. General Charan Kunlawanit, the secretary general of the National Security Council (NSC), said that foreigners have frequently charged that Thais are involved in narcotics-trafficking activities. But he would like to ask foreigners, "Instead of focusing on the traffickers, why don't you stop buying drugs? If foreigners focus on just the one aspect, they will never solve this problem." The reporter said that there have been reports that both civilian and military officials are involved in narcotics trafficking. Gen. Charan said that he doesn't know anything about that. But he said that this does not concern the security of the nation. Rather, this is a matter of someone breaking the law. The units concerned must conduct an investigation. He does not, however, always believe what foreigners say, because foreigners like to meddle in Thailand's affairs. Thailand has done good things, but foreigners have never praised us. Thus, things must be done very carefully. [passage omitted] General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, the minister of interior and minister of labor, was interviewed by a reporter at Wat Phra Simahathat about the reports that other senior government officials are involved in narcotics trafficking. He said that the person's position has nothing to do with it. Anyone who violates the law must be punished. As for coordinating things with American officials in arresting high-ranking military officers said to be involved in narcotics trafficking, police officials are monitoring and investigating things. There are data, but before any action can be taken, there must be compelling evidence. An investigation must be conducted first. We can't base our actions on what they say. He said that everything will turn out fine. We have to do things in our own way. There is no reason for concern, because we know what is what. We know what is going on. Thailand has constantly helped the United States on narcotics matters. It's not true that we won't help. We have given more help than people realize. [passage omitted]
