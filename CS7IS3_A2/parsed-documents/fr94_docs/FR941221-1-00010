SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Temporary Regulations and 26 U.S.C. 7805(e)(1) In the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register , the IRS is issuing temporary regulations to clarify the treatment of certain allowances received by members of the Armed Forces in light of changes made by OBRA 1993. Section 7805(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) (26 U.S.C. 7805(e)(1)) requires the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking whenever the Secretary issues temporary regulations to allow an opportunity for public comment. The substance of the temporary regulations is reflected in the proposed amendments to §§1.61&hyph;2 and 1.217&hyph;2. The IRS intends to revise §§1.61&hyph;2 and 1.217&hyph;2 in response to taxpayers' comments on the proposed regulations. Background This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under sections 61 and 217 of the Code that are required because of the amendment of section 217(b) by OBRA 1993. In Notice 94&hyph;59, 1994&hyph;1 C.B. 371, the IRS announced its intention to issue guidance to clarify that certain allowances received by members of the Armed Forces continue to be excludable from gross income notwithstanding the amendment of section 217(b). Explanation of Provisions Section 217(g) of the Code provides that a member of the Armed Forces on active duty who moves pursuant to a military order and incident to a permanent change of station does not include in income reimbursements or allowances for moving or storage expenses, or the value of moving and storage services furnished in-kind. For purposes of section 217(g), moving expenses are defined in section 217(b). OBRA 1993 amended section 217(b) by narrowing the definition of deductible moving expenses.
