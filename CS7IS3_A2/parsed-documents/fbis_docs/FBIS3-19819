FBIS3-19819 "drweu056__a94033" FBIS-WEU-94-056-A Document Type:Daily Report 23 March 1994 ANNEX Italy & Vatican Share Swaps Mark Telecom Italia's Launch BR2103141494 Rome ANSAMAIL Database in English 1805 GMT 19 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR2103141494 Rome ANSAMAIL Database Language: English Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "Italia Telecom Mergers Set on Their Way"] [Text] Rome, 19 Mar (ANSA) -- The creation of Telecom Italia [TI], the new Italian telecom giant which will group all present public-sector telecom interests in a single company scheduled for a stock market flotation by the end of the year in one of the biggest privatisation sell-offs ever, got on the road today when various share swap operations were approved for TI's future component parts. Meeting to approve their annual accounts, five companies from the IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] stable -- SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone Company], Italcable, Iritel, SIRM [Italian Maritime Radio Company] and Telespazio -- agreed to the complex swap mechanism. The final vote on the merger should be approved at shareholders' meetings in mid-May. Yesterday, the government set some guidelines for the flotation. They included the assignment of a "golden share" to institutional investors without any telecom interests and a ceiling on individual stakes "much lower" than the three percent set for the Banca Commerciale and Credito Italiano. After the meeting, the forecast was that the flotation could be ready in the autumn. Reliable estimates of Telecom Italia's sale value will only be available when the official consultants make their assessment known. For STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company], the holding company which controls IRI's telecom interests and will control Telecom when it has been created, last year's market capitalisation was 21-23 trillion lire (12-13 billion dollars) of which IRI has about 52-53 percent. The flotation will be achieved by putting STET on the market. Yesterday, too, reliable sources said that, in what one commentator described as a "hot weekend" for moves to re-draw the Italian telecom map, the government was now hoping to name the second GSM portable phone licence holder -- there is now a SIP monopoly -- early next week, or at least before the elections next weekend. The further developments expected in May and after the Summer represent the end to a saga that began 6 years ago. The debate on grouping IRI's telecom interests under a single roof began in March 1988. A major step in December 1992 was the passage of ASST [State Telephone Services Agency], the state-owned telephone service company which handled a slice of international traffic, to newly created Iritel. Further outlines in TI's profile were sketched in on April 2 1993, when a ministerial committee said the public stake could be reduced "gradually below the threshold of 51 percent" and required a separation between the future group's telecom and manufacturing activities. Details of the whole operation were released last September. At about the same time, IRI set up Tecnitel to handle STET's manufacturing activities. According to a plan released on February 4 by STET Chairman Michele Tedeschi in a letter to the directors of the companies to be merged into TI, the new telecom giant will be divided into seven divisions under the strategic control of the streamlined corporate structure. With the corporate holding overseeing general strategy and seeing to it that there is no overlapping in the services provided by the various sectors, Telecom Italia's various divisions will function in the fields of private clients, business clients, international services, mobile phones and satellite communications. These sectors will be flanked by divisions dealing with the telecommunications network and with services. SIP marked today's new progress towards Telecom Italia by announcing record profits of 657.4 billion lire (390 million dollars), 42.7 percent up on 1992 and the highest announced by any Italian company for last year. The telephone company said it would pay ordinary stock a dividend up from 75 to 85 lire and savings shares one up from 95 to 105 lire. The year's accounts also saw net indebtedness reduced by 1.1 trillion lire (660 million dollars). SIP, whose shares have been outperforming most other stock on the Milanese bourse for months, produced few figures that were not some sort of record. Pre-tax profits were up 47.4 percent to 1.470 trillion lire, debt dropped for the first time below revenue to give a ratio of 0.948 and enable the company to finance its own investments, and gross profits per share grew by 26.2 percent to 106.4 lire, 22.1 lire more than in 1992. Surveying its technical results, SIP said 94.8 percent of Italian homes now have a telephone, over 1,100,000 km of optical fibre cables have already been laid, while mobile telephones grew by 54.2 percent, one of the highest rates in Europe, to top 1,207,000 subscribers.
