The economy remains broadly sluggish and is expected to continue to face rough going for a while, said Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). She was speaking at a press meeting after negotiating on revisions to the budget, due out Tuesday, with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. Kubota said her agency has requested the government to focus on the economy, and stressed, "we cannot move freely unless the economy recovers." In this sense, she pinned hopes on the government's budget along with the 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package launched last week. Despite tight revenues, the Finance Ministry maintained growth at the 4 percent level in public works spending in its budget draft announced Thursday. The government is to decide on a budget package at a cabinet meeting Tuesday after ministers negotiate separately throughout Monday with Fujii in a final bid to revive items that the Finance Ministry cut.
