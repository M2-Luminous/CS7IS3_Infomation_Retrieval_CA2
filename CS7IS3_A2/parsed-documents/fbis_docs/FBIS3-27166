It seems that people can stop worrying about the possibility that NATO would launch air strikes against positions held by the Bosnian Serbs. Why? Why did such a dramatic change prevail in the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina? To put it in a nutshell, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is improving, and there have been a number of notable changes. First, NATO issued its ultimatum on 9 February. After that, the warring parties in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, displayed a cooperative attitude and Moslems and Serbs swiftly reached a cease-fire agreement. In the following 10 days, the two sides abided by the agreement and Sarajevo was "at peace." From 17 February onwards, Serbian troops started the massive withdrawal of artillery and other heavy weapons from areas around Sarajevo. On 18 February, Karadzic, leader of the Serbs, guaranteed at a meeting with UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi that they would effectively place their heavy weapons deployed in within 20 km of Sarajevo under the control of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. Although the withdrawal was blocked by heavy snow, it was obvious that the Serbs did their utmost to fulfill the requirements of the ultimatum. The Bosnian Moslem Army also agreed to place its heavy weapons, at the same time, under the control of UNPROFOR. The reasons why the Serbs took this decision are: 1) They are "wise enough to know when to retreat" and they bear in mind that it is better to preserve their strength rather than be annihilated; 2) the Serbs have no alternative because the war, which has lasted for more than two years, has greatly undermined their armed strength, and they also need a breathing space; and, 3), for the Serbs, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from areas around Sarajevo will not bring about fundamental changes in the balance of forces and they will still gain the upper hand. For the Moslems, the greatest advantage they gain from the withdrawal is that the siege of Sarajevo, which has lasted for more than 20 months, can be lifted. Second, the fact that the Bosnian Serbs have changed their position is related to Russian mediation. On 15 February, Russian President Yeltsin told reporters emphatically after meeting with British Prime Minister Major that Russia could never be ruled out of a settlement of the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Over the past few days, Churkin, President Yeltsin's special envoy, has kept mediating between the various parties involved in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The armed forces of the Bosnian Serbs agreed to withdraw all heavy weapons from the area around Sarajevo, given that Russia would dispatch 800 blue helmets to Sarajevo, which was precisely the result achieved by Churkin when advising Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, to compromise. Now, people are realizing more and more that Russia is emerging as a new force in settling the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that Russia should be treated with increasing respect. Third, what should be mentioned is that after the artillery disaster happened in Sarajevo, the United States reversed its past "indifference" to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and explicitly supported the ultimatum initiated by France, which indicated that differences between the United States and its NATO allies on the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina had narrowed. Observers held that the United States, its NATO allies, and the United Nations, by and large, jointly adopted the policy of "exerting pressure on all the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina to bring about change" to force the latter to again return to the negotiating table. However, both Europe and the United States stressed that the threat of air strikes was absolutely not "bluff and bluster" but that they "would live up to their word," otherwise the operational capability and credibility of the United States, NATO, and the United States would be doubted by the international community. Fourth, France, Britain, and other West European countries have, to different degrees, adjusted their original positions and sought common ground while reserving differences with the United States because, as proven by the past year or so, it is difficult for the European countries to settle the crisis of Bosnia-Herzegovina alone. Now, the West European countries have no alternative but to acknowledge that without the active participation of the United States and Russia, it will ultimately be difficult to settle the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Hence, Britain and France wish to encourage the United States and Russia to bring their respective influence over Bosnian Moslems and Serbs into play to seek an effective way to settle the conflict. At this moment, there is no artillery fire in Sarajevo, and it is obvious that reason has prevailed on all of the parties concerned. However, NATO has not completely revoked its ultimatum. Although there is no gunpowder smoke, the problem still exists. Obviously, NATO is determined to maintain its high-handed posture over all of the parties involved in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to let the sword of Damocles hang above their heads so that none dares make a reckless move.
