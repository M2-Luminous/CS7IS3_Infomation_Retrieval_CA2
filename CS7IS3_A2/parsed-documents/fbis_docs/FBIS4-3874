FBIS4-3874 "drchi080_b_94011" FBIS-CHI-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 United States & Canada Racial Homicides Suspected, Proven in U.S. Racial Homicides Suspected, Proven in U.S. OW2604004994 Beijing XINHUA in English 1929 GMT 25 Apr 94 OW2604004994 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Washington, April 25 (XINHUA) -- At least 30 Asian Pacific Americans were killed in 1993 as a result of homicides in which racial animus was suspected or proven, the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium reported today. In its "Audit of Violence Against Asian Pacific Americans 1993," the first comprehensive, nationwide, non-governmental survey to assess the extent of anti-Asian violence, the consortium found 335 reported anti-Asian incidents in 1993, or one incident almost every day, despite significant underreporting. "As this report documents, incidents of anti-Asian violence are a problem for communities around this country," said U.S. Congressman Norm Mineta, calling the consortium's report "a telling indicator, both of the scope of this problem and how far we have to go to solve it." "Our trade tensions with Asian nations, the shakiness of the economy, and racism continue to drive a search for scapegoats," said Mineta. "All too often, those scapegoats turn out to have Asian Pacific faces." The consortium found the total of 335 anti-Asian incidents includes 153 incidents with demonstrable anti-Asian motivation and 182 incidents where this animus was suspected. "Among the incidents where there was demonstrable anti-Asian animus, assault, vandalism and threat or intimidation were reported most commonly," said Philip Tajitsu Nash, executive director of the consortium. The study found Asian Pacific Americans are most vulnerable where they reside, with commercial business sites also being dangerous places. In one incident, Sam Nang Nhem, a 21-year-old Cambodian American, was killed on August 14, 1993, when Nhem and his family were picnicking at their home in Fall River, Massachusetts. As Nhem was disposing of the trash in a dumper only 100 yards from his apartment, he was brutally attacked by white neighborhood residents, the report said. Nhem, father of a four-month-old infant, was called a "gook," repeatedly kicked and finally beaten to death. The Federal Bureau of Investigation states that the most frequently-reported anti-Asian crime is intimidation, but in contrast, our finding are that assault and vandalism are most common, said Nash. "Anti-Asian violence is widely underreported," Nash said. "as of January 1994, most jurisdictions had statistics for only the first three months of 1993." He said the majority of incident reports were collected in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco while limited data was available from only 14 states. He urged federal and local governments to thoroughly investigate all suspected hate crimes, promptly and completely collect hate crime statistics and recruit more Asian police officers to have an ethnically and linguistically diversed law enforcement force.
