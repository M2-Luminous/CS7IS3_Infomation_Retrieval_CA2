The proposed programme of air purification should receive enough money for its completion, he added. The sum which is necessary for implementation of gas heating and elimination of small and medium-sized sources of pollution was calculated by the Environment Ministry, Jezek reported. Jezek said he was surprised at the governmental position which wanted to lower the sum to three billion crowns (100 million USD). "The parliamentary draft law is still in force, while the government presents its position. However, the parliament decides," Jezek said. On May 11 the government approved the allocation of three billion crowns, obtained from the proceeds of the small privatisation, to the State Environment Fund. Afterwards Premier Vaclav Klaus said that the deputies "by error" had proposed to transfer 6.1 billion crowns for the purpose. He explained that the maximum amount was 5 billion crowns (160 million USD) because from the 30 billion (1 billion USD) proceeds from the small privatisation some 20 billion had been designated for privatisation of the health sector and 5 billion to settle the restitution claims.
