The fight against us is to the death," the top Cuban military commander has said in a speech to commanders, officers, and midranking personnel of the western Army. Raul Castro has said the Cuban Government will act forcefully and coldbloodedly, "will not fall for provocations or allow them to take the initiative on any terrain." Raul Castro, who is also the second secretary of the governing Communist Party, has inaugurated the annual training period of this section of the public force, which encloses the western provinces of Pinar del Rio, Havana, Havana City, and the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud. He said although the Cuban Armed Forces budget has been cut 50 percent, the training program for FAR commanders, officers, and midranking personnel would be consolidated in 1994. Up to the beginning of this decade, the former Soviet Union furnished the Cuban Armed Forces with planes, weapons, and ammunition, and top-ranking Cuban officers received military training in that country as well. At the event, which was held at the San Antonio de los Banos Air Base, President Fidel Castro's brother said despite the current economic crisis in Cuba, FAR made "a giant effort" in 1993 to ensure that its combat capacity not be eroded. He added he had recently visited Army units in the central and eastern regions of the island and was able to see how the troops were trained, the maintenance given to weapons, the preparation of the military operations area, and how the soldiers tilled the land.
