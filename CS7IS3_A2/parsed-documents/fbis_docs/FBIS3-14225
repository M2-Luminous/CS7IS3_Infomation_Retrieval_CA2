According to Peres, PLO leaders say that the PLO gap with the local population is in the territories. We must take this argument seriously, he says, and enable the PLO to go on representing the Palestinian peace camp. Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports: [Begin Peres recording] I intend to turn the agreement with the PLO into reality. Many wonder about my support for 'Arafat. I do not support 'Arafat because he is who he is, but because he wants peace. I support peace, and 'Arafat today is one of the means to attain peace. We must act rapidly and reach conclusions. There is no sense in procrastinating since we gain nothing from it. Human lives are destroyed and the human soul is also ruined. Some people ask: Do we not have the right to live in Hebron? Well, we have the right to live in Hebron. Some say: Are Jews not allowed to live in Hebron? Well, we can live in Hebron. The problem is not one of rights but of blood. When peace is attained, I have no doubt that Jews will be able to move and live in Hebron. Today it is not a question of moving or living there, but of confrontation and death. It is the government's duty to lower the level of friction. In the present situation, which is so emotionally charged, imagine that Arab residents of Israel were to buy a plot of land near the great synagogue in Jerusalem or near the Karmel market in Tel Aviv. How would Israelis react? We must take a realistic look at the situation. Attitudes must change before we decide on the final location.

He believes that politicians must make courageous decisions, should not pass the buck to the military level, and should not insist that the Army cope with an impossible, no-win situation."]
