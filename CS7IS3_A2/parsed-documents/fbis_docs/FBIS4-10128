Our relations with Bolivia have time and again been marred by sporadic reactions by Bolivian military officials, who have demanded, through unusual appeals, an outlet to the sea for their country. This is what happened on 22 March when the Bolivian Army commander, General Reynaldo Caceres, called for a change in the "thoughtless, obstinate attitude of the Chilean ruling class" regarding the Bolivian landlocked situation, a position out of keeping with history." Figueroa was asked on 23 March about the approach he will take regarding relations with Bolivia in light of the various aspects posed by this issue. On the one hand, there have been friendly gestures such as the cordial talks held by Figueroa with Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar, as well as the visit paid to Chile to attend the presidential inauguration by Mrs. Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada, the wife of the Bolivian president, who conveyed a message to the Chilean people. On the other hand, these gestures have been overshadowed by remarks such as that by Gen. Caceres. First, Figueroa said he will not comment on "remarks by third parties," alluding to Caceres. Second, he outlined his position regarding "the course" he will take in our relations with Bolivia. Figueroa said: "It is Chile's desire to have the best possible relations with Bolivia, in order to seek ways for understanding in the areas of politics, economics, culture, and tourism and for investment and infrastructure development in border areas. There is a whole world of possibilities that must be explored to develop these relations." Figueroa outlined his position in a meeting he held with Aranibar in Brasilia on 22 March. The two foreign ministers took advantage of a meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers to hold bilateral talks in Brasilia. At the end of the meeting, Figueroa talked about searching for "creative formulas" to develop Chilean-Bolivian ties. On 23 March he emphasized the need for these formulas. "These formulas could be applied within the whole spectrum of cooperation and to the work that two countries like Chile and Bolivia -- which truly seek to maintain good relations -- could undertake."
