It says: An act of terrorism was committed at the Markale market in central Sarajevo on Saturday, 5 February, leaving dozens of innocent people dead and hundreds injured. The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Ukraine resolutely condemns this act of terrorism that has considerably aggravated tension in the Balkans, at a moment when parties interested in the settlement of the Yugoslavian problem are involved in an intensive search for ways toward a peaceful solution to the crisis in the region. The Foreign Affairs Ministry appeals to the United Nations for a detailed investigation into the tragedy in Sarajevo and urges the warring sides to call an immediate cease-fire, get down to the negotiating table, exercise political will, and do their best to prevent the Sarajevo events of 5 February causing an escalation of military confrontation in the Balkans and provoking a geographical expansion of the conflict. This act of terrorism once again raises the issue of the need for an all-around examination of the Balkan crisis and a comprehensive approach to its settlement.
