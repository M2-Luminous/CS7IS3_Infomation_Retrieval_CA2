This comes about in the wake of the Cairo talks and the deliberations which took place at the prime minister's bureau today. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the first stage reference is to policemen who will have no enforcement powers, but will come to study the area. According to the agreement that is being consolidated, the Palestinian policemen in Hebron will supervise facilities, including the town hall and the university. Israeli forces and the Palestinian police will also conduct joint patrols, under Israeli command. As for the Norwegian observers, it has been reported that Israel demands that they number between 50 and 60, while the Palestinians want to have about 150. Our correspondent adds that the negotiations which will resume in Cairo on Tuesday are slated to end by 12 April. According to plans, the agreement will be signed by Prime Minister Rabin and PLO leader 'Arafat. Further meetings between 'Arafat and Foreign Minister Peres may take place before the signing. The prime minister will hold another discussion early next week, prior to the resumption of the Cairo talks on Tuesday.
