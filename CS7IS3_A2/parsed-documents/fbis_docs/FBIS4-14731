"The preponderance in the number of electors' votes in my favor and confident actions by my colleagues at the Interregional Bloc of Reforms irritated the contenders so much that they resorted to downright falsehoods," believes Volodymyr Hrynyov. He reported that on the [election] eve, foreseeing such actions, he submitted an appeal to the District Electoral Commission with a clear explanation of his actions in the election campaign within the framework of the law. "Now, when the Central Electoral Commission received an official telegram from Henrikh Altunyan with fictitious accusations, when Valeriy Meshcheryakov ostentatiously withdrew his candidacy `as a sign of protest,' I will be compelled to turn to the Central Electoral Commission with a request to protect me against the slander on the part of the former candidates." As a UNIAN correspondent learned, Volodymyr Hrynyov was planning to visit the Central Electoral Commission on 1 April.
