The deputies, who came from the Rukh, Statehood, Unity and center fractions, were protesting the offer of the post of deputy speaker to Aleksandr Tkachenko. The left wing Ukrainian Peasants' Party nominated Tkachenko, a former agriculture minister, for the post. Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil appealed for deputies not to register and confer among fractions on their own candidates for deputy speaker. The speaker himself, Aleksandr Moroz, said he would give the media a list of the names of the deputies who had refused to register for the session. Those deputies, he said, were obstructing "constructive" work in parliament. Communist leader Petr Simonenko in an interview with Interfax Ukraine criticized the national democrats, saying that "we have come to parliament to work and they are getting in our way." The rebel deputies meeting Thursday evening must present their candidates for the post of deputy speaker by Friday's morning session of the Supreme Soviet.
