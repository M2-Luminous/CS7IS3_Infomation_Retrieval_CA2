The latter consisted of dioxydin or terrilytin impregnated hydrophilic materials (HM; Ekran Scientific Industrial Association). Actual treatment consisted of application of the terrilytin-HM on the wound surface, followed by an overlay of the dioxydin-HM dressing. The results showed that the special combined HM dressing led to wound sterilization in 3 days (0% mortality) , vs. 14 days in control animals (33% mortality) managed in a conventional manner. Clinical benefits with the combined dressing also exceeded those of dioxydin-HM dressing alone. However, although the length of time required for complete epithiliazation did not differ in the control and experimental groups, these observations suggest that the combined HM may have application in human medicine in controlling wound infections.
