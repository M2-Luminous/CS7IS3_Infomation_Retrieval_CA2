Section 905.102 is amended by removing the definition of Major changes , revising the definition of Annual Statement , and adding in alphabetical order definitions of Annual Submission , Fungibility and Work Statements , to read as follows: §905.102 Definitions. * * * * * Annual Statement. A work statement covering the first year of the Five-Year Action Plan and setting forth the major work categories and costs by development or IHA-wide for the current FFY grant, as well as a summary of costs by development account and implementation schedules for obligation and expenditure of the funds. * * * * * Annual Submission. A collective term for all documents which the IHA must submit to HUD for review and approval before accessing the current FFY grant funds. Such documents include the Annual Statement, Work Statements for years two through five of the Five-Year Action Plan, local government statement, IHA Board Resolution, materials demonstrating the partnership process and any other documents as prescribed by HUD. * * * * * Fungibility. Fungibility is a concept which permits an IHA to substitute any work item from the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan to any previously approved CIAP budget or CGP Annual Statement and to move work items among approval budgets without prior HUD approval. * * * * * Work Statements. Work Statements cover the second through the fifth years of the Five-Year Action Plan and set forth the major work categories and costs by development or IHA-wide which the IHA intends to undertake in each year of years two through five. In preparing these Work Statements, the IHA shall assume that the current FFY formula amount will be available in each year of years two through five. * * * * * 3. In §905.601, paragraph (b) is revised, paragraph (h) is amended by removing the reference to ``§905.669(b)(2)'' and adding in its place ``§905.669(b)''; by adding three sentences to the end of paragraph (j); and by revising paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (k)(3)(iii), to read as follows: §905.601 Allocation of funds under section 14. * * * * * (b) Set-aside for emergencies and disasters.

HUD shall replenish this reserve at the beginning of each FFY so that it always begins with a $75 million balance. Any unused funds from previous years will remain in the reserve until allocated. The requirements governing the reserve for disasters and emergencies and the procedures by which an IHA may request such funds, are set forth in §905.667. * * * * * (j) Calculation of number of units. *␣*␣* New development units that are added to an IHA's or PHA's inventory will be added to the overall unit count so long as they are under ACC amendment and have reached DOFA by the first day in the FFY in which the formula is being run. Any increase in units (reaching DOFA and under ACC amendment) as of the beginning of the FFY shall result in an adjustment upwards in the number of units under the formula. New units reaching DOFA after this date will be counted for formula purposes as of the following FFY. (k) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣*
