The Banco de Colombia [Bank of Colombia] has been transferred to a group of Cali businessmen, and the cellular telephone service was turned over to private operators. These two deals generated revenues of about $1.7 billion for the government. What is this government's record on privatizations? Since early 1991 state holdings in about 15 companies have been transferred to the private sector, earning the state a little over 1.1 trillion pesos. However, these were not large privatizations. In most cases they were small enterprises in which the IFI [Industrial Development Institute] held shares. In the last two years, the IFI sold its shares in six enterprises for approximately 12.398 billion pesos. The state has been successful, though, in turning over to private enterprise some major areas that were traditionally considered the state's responsibility: railways, highways, ports, expansion of the gas system, and social security. It is estimated that in the next few years the private sector will invest close to $392 billion in plans to rehabilitate the railway system, highway construction projects, ports, and the construction of gas pipelines. In addition, for electricity generating projects, private companies plan to invest resources that will easily exceed 592 billion pesos. By doing so, the state will no longer be involved in providing public services and it will turn over shares to private investors, who should apparently be more efficient. That is, in essence, the primordial objective of privatization in Colombia. They want to turn over part of the economy that the state now runs in order to promote competition and the free market. In other Latin American countries, governments have been forced to sell state enterprises to shrink the gap between public spending needs and revenues or to cover massive external debts. In Argentina, for example, between September 1992 and October 1993, 45 enterprises were privatized. This easily produced $7.5 billion fresh dollars for the government. And the government no longer has to transfer about $2.1 billion a year from the budget to prop up bankrupt public enterprises. The Objective In Colombia, privatization was not undertaken to make the state smaller. If that were the objective, the results would be dismal: public spending, 24 percent of the economy's total production of goods and services or GDP [gross domestic product] in 1988, will be up to 30 percent in 1994. This means that the state has grown. Here the plan seeks to concentrate government action on activities like justice and security that, for obvious reasons, cannot be turned over to the private sector. The numbers speak for themselves: defense and security spending have risen from 1.9 percent of the GDP in 1990 to 2.5 percent last year. Military investments were up 82 percent. Given the spending increase, the revenues from privatization will help to maintain sound finances; the state will be able to pay its debts without difficulty. Nevertheless, turning certain activities like health care, pensions, and public services over to private companies does entail some risk. Private investors will take the profitable part of the business, and the state could be left with the obligation to handle sectors that do not generate profits. Where Privatization Now Stands Banks Sold The biggest banking reprivatization took place this week: the Banco de Colombia was sold for a total of 401 billion pesos in simultaneous transactions on the three stock markets. Its new owners are Isaac and Jaime Gilinski, who own 75 percent of the shares, bank employees and retirees, and small investors. Colombia's banking system began its round of privatizations in 1991 with the sale of the Banco de los Trabajadores [Workers Bank] to the Mercantile Bank of Venezuela for 3.225 billion pesos. Then the Tequendama Bank was acquired by the Construction Bank of Venezuela and Intercon Financial Bank of Aruba for 20.723 billion. In addition, the Banco de Comercio [Bank of Commerce] was sold to the Luis Carlos Sarmiento organization, to employees, and other investors. Next month the privatization of Corpavi [Savings and Housing Loans Corporation], the Banco del Estado [State Bank], and the Banco Popular [Peoples Bank] will begin. Road Construction Projects The system of building highways through licensing arrangements is going to surge ahead this year: the government has 20 projects ready to be turned over to the private sector, and it is studying another 11 projects. About 3,000 kilometers of roadways will be built with an investment of about $1.25 billion. This will rehabilitate 40 percent of Colombia's road system. There are plans to restore highways: the major road system and access roads for major cities, like the road between Bogota and Meta. Other plans cover the road between Medellin and the Rionegro Valley; Espinal and Neiva; La Paila, Armenia, and Calarca. In terms of construction, the plans include expanding roadways in places with heavy vehicle traffic. These are projects like the highway between Bogota and Villavicencio; the Perimetal de la Sabana; the road between Bogota and Puerto Salgar; and the Guataquia River bridge. During 1993, bids for two projects were awarded: the construction of the Buga-Tulua-La Paila roads and the rehabilitation of the road between Barranquilla and Cienaga. Now under study are a second road between Armenia, Pereira, and Manizales, and the bypass between Girardot and Ibague. Electrical Sector Although the electrical sector's major privatizations still remain to be done, three private initiatives have already been implemented in a sector that had been considered to belong exclusively to the public domain: generating energy. The first successful private generating project was developed by Proelectrica in Cartagena: a 90-megawatt plant was installed in the Mamonal industrial zone with a $60 million investment. Then the CCI [Colombian Industrial Consortium] and Spain's Sevillan Electricity Group invested $150 million in building the Flores thermal power plant in Barranquilla. This plant has a 100-megawatt capacity. The most recent project was upgrading Termobarranquilla [Barranquilla Power Plant], so it can generate 750 megawatts. The investment was $520 million. Corelca [Electric Corporation of the Atlantic Coast] joined with Distral and the private Swiss-Swedish consortium ABB [Asea Brown Boveri] for this project. The next step will be the sale of the Betania Hydroelectric Power Plant for a price close to $300 million. Ports and Railroads Transportation is one of the sectors that has undergone the greatest structural modifications in the privatization process initiated by the government. The National Railroads and Ports of Colombia have ceased to exist. The assets of both entities were placed in corporate liability funds, and the management of rail transport and the ports has been turned over to the private sector. For the railroads, the government created Ferrovias [National Railroads Enterprise], through which it will channel resources to improve the track and stations. The STF [Railroad Transport Company] has begun to provide service. For the ports, cargo management has been turned over to the regional port companies located in each of the maritime terminals (Santa Marta, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Buenaventura, and Tumaco).

There have been failures in Colombia, so some problems the government faces in trying to sell a company can be identified. The attempt to privatize Telecom [National Enterprise for Telecommunications] illustrates one such bottleneck: union pressures. As a solution, in France and England a system was used that has also been tried in Colombia: offering the workers shares of the company at a price below the market price. Experts say Colombia has no serious privatization plan, so it is likely that mistakes may be made in the design and implementation of the process, and it may take a long time to become a reality. Another fear is exchanging public monopolies for private monopolies. There is such a risk in Colombia, where few economic groups are able to buy big enterprises. One solution is for midsized investors to form associations with foreigners. That creates another problem: analysts say that attitudes in Colombia still foster a reluctance to use foreign capital. Negotiators A major protagonist in a privatization process is the investment bankers group. These firms serve as liaisons and facilitators in the transfer of a state enterprise. The investment bank evaluates the company and determines the sales mechanism (auction or bidding, as well as other methods). The most time-consuming part of their work is the negotiation process. Reaching agreement between the parties is generally complicated by factors like union protests and criticisms from various factions that oppose the sale of state assets. The bankers also have the job of appraising the company based on its financial position and the revenues it may generate in the future, in order to set a minimum price. In every such process two groups of bankers are involved: those who present the sales package for the government and those whose client is the private investor. The purchaser's representative has to study acquisition alternatives and obtain financing. This, among other things, explains why foreign investment banks have been hired for large privatization processes: the Colombian buyer needs foreign investment to purchase the enterprise. In these cases, the bankers help to obtain investors, who insist that the firm be internationally known. One method recently used a great deal in Colombia is an association between Colombian firms (which bring their knowledge of the country) and foreign firms, which have experience and a well-known name. This is because Colombia's investment banks are still getting started.
