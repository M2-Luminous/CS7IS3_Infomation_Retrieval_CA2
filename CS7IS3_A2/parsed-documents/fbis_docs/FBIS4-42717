The prime minister took advantage of the visits to remind his audience that peace must never be taken for granted and that only a strong Europe can protect us from new disasters. "Only with the support of our American allies could West Europe rebuild itself and live in peace for 50 years," the prime minister said. "Today, the world has changed. The success of the West European model, which hinges on freedom, is no longer being questioned. The Berlin Wall, which divided our continent, is no more." "Europe is undergoing change. This has been cause for rejoicing among us. However, such change entails risks as well. For the first time since 1945, war has returned to Europe, spreading devastation in the former Yugoslavia. On this day of commemoration, we must reaffirm our determination not to let freedom and the values we all believe in be trampled underfoot." `Key Foundation' "We also must do everything we can to ensure that such situations cannot happen again" the prime minister went on. "The Pact for Stability in Europe proposed by France could prevent future crises. The European Union must take charge of and improve its own defense system, alongside NATO, which will remain the key foundation of solidarity between nations on both sides of the ocean. Thus defended, and bolstered by democracy throughout the continent, the very peace that was restored 50 years ago will thrive on the indestructible ties born, on both sides of the Atlantic, of the belief that we share the same values forged in yesterday's ordeals." Edouard Balladur was accompanied by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, and War Veterans Minister Philippe Mestre. Before he spoke, a few paces from Sainte-Mere-Eglise's small church, from whose spire Private John Smith's parachute still hangs by way of a symbol, he welcomed Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands as well as Netherlands Prime Minister Lubbers, who had come to attend a commemoration of the city's liberation by Netherlands troops. [passage omitted] In Sainte-Mere-Eglise, the prime minister also congratulated at length the U.S. veterans who had just completed their parachute jump. Before speaking to the population, he visited the war museum, reaffirming his conviction that a strong Europe is peace's best safeguard.
