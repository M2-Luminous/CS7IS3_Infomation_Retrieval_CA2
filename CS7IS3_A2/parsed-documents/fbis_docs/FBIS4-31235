He Would Lose Today, but..."] [Text] If the elections were held today, Lech Walesa would not win them. On this point, the politicians of the government coalitions and the opposition fully agree. However, the elections will be held in over a year, and a lot may happen, they say. According to them, whether or not Walesa will have greater chances at that time than he does today depends on how he fulfills his official duties during this last period. Our interlocutors, both the members of the coalition and of the opposition, predict that the presidential elections will not yield final results in the first round, and another round will be indispensable. In line with the Constitution, the second round will be held if in the first round none of the candidates obtains more than half of all of the votes cast. It would be a competition between two persons with the largest numbers of votes. Today it is still not known how many candidates will represent the "Solidarity side." Henryk Wujec of the Freedom Union [UW] told us that his party will certainly field its own candidate and will certainly not back Walesa in the first round. Thus, it looks like, apart from Walesa, at least one more Solidarity candidate will run in the first round. If the right wing neither backs Walesa nor agrees on a joint candidate with UW, there will be several candidates. Politicians predict that in this situation Walesa may have great difficulties passing to the second round. If he does manage to do so, his chances in the second round will increase. In that round, he will probably meet with a candidate of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] or the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. In such a case, he may receive the support of postsolidarity groupings. Therefore, it looks like Walesa's chances to reach the second round will be largely decided by the first round. Today, only the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] declares that it will support him. It is important how Solidarity behaves; the way it acts will be followed by some of the rightist groupings. The rating of Walesa in the union is rather low today. There are rumors that the union may field its own candidate (the name of Marian Krzaklewski is mentioned, even though he announced several months ago that he would not run). It seems highly unlikely that Walesa will be backed by one of the rightist coalitions: Alliance for Poland [Przymierze dla Polski] (Christian-National Union--ZChN, Center Accord--PC, Conservative Coalition, Peasant Accord--PL, and Movement for the Republic--RdR), or the alliance of the Union for Real Politics--UPR, Christian-Peasant Party--SLCh, Party of Christian Democrats--PChD, National Party--SN, and Conservative Party--PK. It seems relatively most probable that Walesa might be backed by the RdR and the PL from one coalition and by athe SLCh from the other. However, both within Solidarity and in the rightist parties, there may be attempts at internal "pro-Walesa" coup d'etats before the presidential elections. It is most likely that a pro-Walesa policy will be adopted by the ZChN, and least likely that such a policy will be pursued by the PC. "It is not for the first time that President Walesa is showing that he is a courageous man who is not afraid of taking risks," believes Tomasz Nalecz of the Labor Union. However, because he has antagonized many milieus (not keeping promises, acting disloyally to aides, shifting of responsibility to others, refusing to take on responsibility), it is difficult to predict who might form an alliance with him. He believes that Walesa might be seriously threatened only by a politician who would guarantee to fulfill the fundamental role that should today be fulfilled by the Polish president--the role of an arbiter. "Unfortunately, Lech Walesa resembles... A Child in a Sand Pit ...who merely keeps throwing sand at his mates' eyes, causing conflicts and tensions. We need a peacemaking person, someone who would ease tensions. If a grouping or a nonparty group manages to find a generally respected person with an impeccable past, a person who would defend his stance, it will place Lech Walesa in a dead position," Nalecz says. Two politicians of the governing coalition, the SLD's Zbigniew Siemiatkowski and the PSL's Jan Bury, both agree that, if the presidential elections were held in a few days, Walesa would have slim chances of even getting to the second round. According to Bury, these chances will increase in a year's time; according to Siemiatkowski, "a lot may happen." "The president will at any price want to... Stand at the Lead of the Disgruntled Therefore, what should be expected are bows in the direction of Solidarity, which is emerging as the main oppositional force and the advocate of the way of thinking favoring demands. The president will probably make himself heard again when the enterprise tax on above-normative pays (popiwek) and the next budget are discussed; he will try to present himself as the defender of the prosocial policy. Another element of the campaign, which is becoming increasingly clear today, are the slogans of calling certain people to account, combating crime, and corruption. Walesa will want to persuade the people that he is the only one who has clean hands, claims Siemiatkowski. He does not exclude the possibility of dramatic personnel changes in the entourage of the president. The president's decision did not come as a surprise to Jan Bury. After the parliamentary elections, it became clear that Walesa was the only person... Able To Attract ...to himself the scattered postsolidarity groupings, despite all of the differences. Because, as he predicts, the first round of the elections will not be final and in the second round Walesa will compete most probably with a candidate of the left, the forces of the Solidarity origin will not have much choice and will back him. The church will not have much choice, either. Because the president is known for his ability to surprise everyone, Bury expects that, during the campaign, he will submit so many new proposals that one of them will certainly be catchy enough. He will be able to criticize any of his countercandidates for not keeping promises. Such criticism is also expected by Siemiatkowski, who claims that we will have a black presidential campaign. This is why serious candidates are not hurrying to make their intentions known. "Even the best candidate will not endure a full year and a half of slander. He will wear out." He believes that the real candidates will be known only next spring. "The Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN] will almost certainly field its own candidate. Most probably, it will be me," says KPN head Leszek Moczulski. He adds, however, that an official decision has not yet been made. Moczulski allows for the hypothetical possibility that the KPN would not field its own candidate but would back Walesa--in a situation when there would be fears that the second round might turn out to be victorious for the candidate of the left. "If the elections were held today, Pawlak would have the greatest chance," Moczulski believes. If he met with Walesa in the second round, he would win. However, today Walesa might have trouble... Reaching the Second Round However, we have so much time before the elections that discussing them is like talking about the hair color of a child that is to be born in a year and a half. "I personally think it is rather unlikely, if not impossible, that our coalition and my grouping will support Walesa," says Stanislaw Michalkiewicz of UPR, a party that makes up the alliance along with the SLCh, the PChD, the PK, and the SN. The issue has not been discussed yet. "I evaluate Lech Walesa's presidency as a presidency of unused chances. For us to support him, something would have to happen that I cannot even imagine right now." Michalkiewicz believes that most of the people who supported Lech Walesa in 1990 are his firm opponents today. "I Cannot Really See... ...anyone who would vote for him." According to him, if Walesa gained any new supporters during his presidency, there were not many of them, a fact that was proved by the electoral result of the BBWR (in the last parliamentary elections, the BBWR was backed by approximately 700,000 people--editor's note). "Walesa's chances are slim; however, they exist. All of this depends to a great extent on the further course of his presidency," says UW's Henryk Wujec. "I do not think that the new president will be known in the first round; the second round will be decisive. It depends on who will reach it. He has enhanced his chances by submitting his candidacy already. His potential supporters may be already grouping around him. He would not win the elections today, but, in a year's time... Things May Look Different Walesa has a permanent group of supporters, which, I believe, is approximately 20-25 percent of the voters. It is a fairly large group, but it is certainly too small to ensure him a positive result. Today it does not look like any of the serious postsolidarity groupings would be willing to back him. UW will certainly not support him because it will field its own candidate. I still do not know who it will be. I also think that, if both our candidate and Walesa reach the second round, many UW supporters will not back him because they are disappointed with his presidency." On 4 June, before his departure to Normandy, Lech Walesa was asked to comment on the public opinion research, showing that his popularity in on the wane. The president said that he is convinced that he will win next year's presidential elections. He believes that there is a chance to form a new "team." "There is only one condition--obey Walesa," he stated.
