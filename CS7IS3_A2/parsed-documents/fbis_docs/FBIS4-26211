"That will ensure the Ministry of Finance has easy access to financial resources," said Gao Jian, vice-director of the ministry's State debt administration. Starting this year, the central government has barred the ministry from borrowing from the People's Bank of China to finance its deficit. As a result, the ministry has shifted its attention to the domestic treasury bond market. However, the current selling format for treasury bonds poses a problem for the ministry. To ensure bonds are bought, the central government relies on measures such as local government purchase quotas. In highly-efficient, low-cost markets abroad, issue prices are determined by market supply and demand. Second, the main subscribers in the primary market are financial concerns, including banks, securities firms and institutional investors. Gao said many attitudes need to change to ensure a smooth treasury bond market. "Measures should be co-ordinated to stabilize the whole process," he said. These measures include establishing a market-oriented interest-setting mechanism. Gao also said the interest rate of treasury bonds should be decided by market demand and supply. In an underwriting syndication format, the rate should be set based on negotiations between issuers and underwriters or based on the tender prices determined by competitive bidding in auction format. At present, the coupon rate is set up with reference to the bank deposit rate. For several years, the rate of treasury bonds has been set 1 to 2 percentage points higher than bank deposit rates. Meanwhile, Gao said, central underwriting syndication should be expanded to replace local underwriting syndication. Central underwriting refers to security intermediaries who directly sign contracts with the Ministry of Finance. In local underwriting, the ministry entrusts local governments to underwrite bonds. This transition will require more primary dealers, who underwrite treasury bonds and bid for their price. The system was introduced last year when 19 securities firms, trust and investment companies and banks were approved as primary dealers. But they have not fully become a force in the primary market, Gao said. He added that the primary dealer system will be effective depending on how much the central bank encourages commercial banks to hold treasury bonds as liquid assets. Furthermore, Gao said, efforts should be made to improve the financial infrastructure, including setting up a national trading system to deal with paperless bond trading.
