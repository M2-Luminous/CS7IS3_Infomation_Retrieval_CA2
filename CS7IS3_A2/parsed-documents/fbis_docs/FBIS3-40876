In fact, it is as if without realizing it every deregulation accelerates the growth of this social gap. The reason is that big businesses have developed and expanded through improper competition. The Review Board of KADIN (Indonesian Chamber of Commerce) made these statements in the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce's Evaluation of Activities for 1989 to 1994, which was distributed last week. This evaluation was signed directly by the chairman of KADIN's Review Board (MP) H. Probosutedjo. In its general evaluation of the business world, KADIN's Review Board also said that big businesses are in control of various business sectors, from upstream to downstream. Big business control of business is noticeable and real, that is, they control it vertically and horizontally. KADIN's MP also said that there is too great a discrepancy between the wealth or assets owned by small and medium businesses and by BUMN's (state-owned businesses) on the one hand and the wealth or assets owned by big businesses, especially those that are really big businesses, on the other hand, and "that it has resulted in a social gap which is getting wider and deeper." "The growth of the gap between big businesses and other businesses is greater than the growth of the economy, and there aren't any effective efforts being made to prevent, control, or put a stop to the growth of this gap." What Other Theory? KADIN's MP concluded that KADIN must play an active role in overcoming this problem for PANCASILA [Five Principles of the Nation] harmony and unity by creating cooperation between the conglomerates on the one hand and the small and medium businesses, cooperatives, and BUMN's on the other hand. This is something that is "absolutely necessary." "The trickle-down theory, the theory of `foster child, foster parent,' and the theory of a piece of the pie, have not become a reality. What other theories will we have to go through in order to bring about a total Development Trilogy? In this respect, KADIN must really be able to create national harmony within a PANCASILA society." KADIN's MP also made a special evaluation of each player in the national economy. Many of the BUMN businesses, they said, are declining. Many are not healthy and in fact are sick. Meanwhile, the cooperatives are growing slowly, not in line with expectations, and "not in line with Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution for creating PANCASILA." The mandate of Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution, that the cooperatives should be the cornerstone of the economy, is still far from expectations. Cooperation between big businesses and the cooperatives and between the business world in general and the cooperatives is still very weak. Meanwhile, the growth of the private sector, particularly small businesses, has also been very slow. Among the reasons for this is the difficulty of obtaining funds, especially the credit expected from government banks. Permanent Working Capital Credit (KMKP), Small Investment Credit (KIK), and Candak Kulak [the credit system for small businesses] have not been very successful. Small-Business Credit (KUK) was in fact misused by big businesses. Many small businesses have also been squeezed by the expansion and development of big businesses, which have been growing through improper and destructive competition. For example, when markets are remodeled, small businesses usually lose their original selling place because the cost of a stall is set beyond their ability to pay. In addition to being squeezed out of their place of business, many small businesses have gone bankrupt, unable to compete with big businesses which develop their businesses from upstream to downstream on the grounds of free enterprise. Up to now there have been no attempts to stop or control improper competition. In fact, "Indonesian competition goes further than free competition in the liberal capitalist nations." KADIN's MP said that medium businesses have almost the same problems as small businesses. Many medium-scale businesses are being squeezed and are getting smaller as a result of not being able to compete with big businesses, which are always expanding and developing through improper competition. The result is that many midsized businesses, like small businesses, are tangled up in bank credit. They cannot pay the installments on their loans or pay the interest. A further result is that many of the guarantees of medium and small businesses have finally been turned over to the PUPN [State Credit Affairs Committee] (now called the BUPLN, the State Auction and Credit Affairs Board). Unable To Compete Big businesses usually have smooth channels of communication with government banks and with state officials; they have very close relations with businessmen, which enables the businesses to run smoothly. On the contrary, the heads of medium and small businesses and of BUMN's do not have this ability to communicate directly with those in charge or with the bank officials or government agencies concerned. The result is that small and medium businesses and BUMN's are unable to compete with big businesses and even less so with conglomerates. KADIN's MP also said that in general provincial businesses in the 27 provinces have been left far behind. KADIN's evaluation was issued at the same time that the list of candidates for KADIN directors and for members of KADIN's MP was drafted. For this purpose KADIN's MP held a series of meetings with groups of company associations and with business associations. MP held marathon meetings with certain cooperatives, BUMN's, and members of the private sector from 16 to 21 November. Requirements for KADIN's General Chairman In SK [Directive] 092/MP/XII/93 KADIN's MP also issued the requirements and criteria for candidates to membership in the MP, for general chairman and for the board of directors for the period 1994 to 1998. It was decided that the MP would submit a list of nominations to KADIN's Second National Congress, which would contain the names of 120 candidates for KADIN's MP and the names of 200 candidates for KADIN's Executive Committee for the period 1994 to 1998. KADIN's MP arrived at eight requirements for general chairman. They include administrative requirements, such as having already filled out a form for KADIN's MP. There also are personal requirements, such as: a person who is experienced, who is successful, and who has shown his dedication to KADIN. In addition, it should be someone who understands and is able to defend the interests of the business world and who is a leader. The last requirement is someone who has not been in trouble with the law, which includes not having had any trouble with security or defense. Supported At the same time, Aburizal Bakrie, chairman of the board of the Bakrie Group, told KOMPAS last week that he supports the criteria for a candidate for KADIN's general chairman set by KADIN's MP. Given these criteria, he thinks that the head of KADIN will be very entrepreneurial. "With these criteria we will get good KADIN leadership because I think that any head of KADIN who fulfills these criteria will understand the ins and outs of the business world," he said.
