"I guarantee that this trial will be conducted in the strict observance of the laws in force in the country and in line with international rules in the matter," the Guinea-Bissau head of state said in his answer to Portuguese head of state, Mario Soares, who wrote to him at the end of December to express the hope of seeing "caution" and "openness" guide this trial. President Vieira, in his letter published by the LUSA AGENCY just before the opening of the trial on 4 January, denies the allegations that the date of da Costa's trial was set up hastily. "All the steps of the criminal procedure have been scrupulously observed," President Vieira assured in his letter to Mr. Soares.
