No one says North Korea is producing nuclear fissionable materials, but the United States alone insists on that possibility, she said. War preparations against North Korea do not conform to the supreme interests of the United States, she said, adding that she thinks the United States must not escalate tensions but pursue a policy for normalising relations with North Korea. "Under the current situation," she said, "we must continue to use diplomatic means and improve relations with North Korea."
