The slump in production in the Far East has reached a critical point, it stresses, and a further reduction in the production and supply of energy cannot be permitted. The cost of a kilowatt-hour of electricity in some parts of the Far East has reached 200 rubles, whereas in central parts of Russia it is 16 rubles. The decisions of government bodies for the development of the Far East's fuel and energy base are not being fulfilled. In order to avoid the complete shutdown of industrial and other enterprises, the heads of administration of krays and oblasts in the Far East are asking the Russian president to urgently examine the question of state support for the region's economy. In particular, the Far East workers are hoping to obtain loans and credits amounting to 140 billion rubles to settle their debt for petroleum products sent to the region. The territories are also asking for the federal budget debt to enterprises in the state sector amounting to 450 billion rubles to be written off. A number of other questions regarding the supply of vital needs to the region are also raised in the appeal.
