In this way, he again indicated that he would make the Hata administration a full-fledged government and carry out political reorganization while considering forming a new political party. After attending the convention, Hata returned to the prime minister's official residence. There, he was asked by reporters about his speech at the convention. Hata said: "The hasty formation of (new parliamentary group) `Kaishin' created confusion. So, we have to proceed slowly next time. In the initial stage, the political group I mentioned should function as a parliamentary group. But in the future, I think it should become a political party." His remark suggests that he will first form a new parliamentary group that includes the Social Democratic Party of Japan.
