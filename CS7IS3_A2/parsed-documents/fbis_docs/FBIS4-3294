Watanabe, 70, also a former deputy prime minister, conveyed his latest decision at a third meeting with LDP President Yohei Kono, who has himself vowed to run for the supreme government post to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa. Hosokawa announced his resignation last Friday after eight months in office. The LDP veteran's decision came after the ruling coalition parties came closer to agreeing on a policy platform and naming Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as its single candidate for the premiership. Hata, 58, concurrently serves as leader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), the ruling coalition's core party. Watanabe's change of heart over the defection paved the way for the LDP to field Kono as its official candidate to run in an upcoming parliamentary election of prime minister.
