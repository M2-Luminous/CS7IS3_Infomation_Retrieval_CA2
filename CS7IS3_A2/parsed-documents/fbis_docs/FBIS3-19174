Dogan Gures has called for an emergency meeting of the Supreme Military Council (SMC) before the potentially explosive Nevroz festivities and the local elections. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for March 18 but military sources told the Turkish Daily News on Tuesday [8 March] that the date may be rescheduled by a day or two "but will definitely be held before March 21," the day the Nevroz festivities are to be held. In the past, separatist Kurdish terrorists have used the festivities to wreck [as published] havoc in southeastern Turkey. The unprecedented meeting is designed to pinpoint the assessments of the leading Turkish generals and admirals regarding the Southeastern problem and to convey the military's views to the National Security Council (NSC), which will convene under the chairmanship of President Suleyman Demirel on March 30 after the local elections. The Supreme Military Council meets twice a year according to the law to discuss strictly military matters. However, the chief of staff also has the authority to call for an emergency meeting of the council which is chaired by the prime minister. The presence of the prime minister is usually only a formality. The prime ministers open the military council meetings and then leave the generals and admirals to deliberate amongst themselves. Political observers say it is meaningful that the council, which normally meets in December and August, is being called to an emergency meeting only a few days before Nevroz and about a week before the local elections. They say this will mean the military leaders will discuss the outstanding issues and reach a consensus to be conveyed to the civilian authority. According to the law, the military council is only charged with "presenting the views of the military" and handling promotions and retirements of officers. However, the law does cover a broad scope of issues on which the military can present its views. The law says the military can do the following: disclose its views on the determination of military strategical concepts to be developed by the general staff and the reassessment of these concepts; to disclose its views on the main programs and targets of the military; to comment on the laws, statutes and regulations concerning military matters; and to air its views on various military issues seen fit by the minister of defense, the chief of staff and the prime minister. The law does not mention "internal security" as an issue to be discussed by the military council, yet as the Army is charged with handling security matters in southeastern Turkey, this situation entitles the military to discuss the problem within the context of the "military strategic concept," according to observers. Besides the prime minister and the chief of staff, the members of the military council include the defense minister, the commanders of the Land, Navy and Air forces, the Gendarmerie commander, the commanders of the First, Second, Third and Aegean armies, the commander of the fleet, the commander of the war academies, the commander of the NATO Southeastern Allied Land Forces, the secretary-general of the National Security Council and, last but not least the second chief of staff. As most of the leading commanders cannot participate in the National Security Council meetings they can air their views on the "protection of the integrity of the state, of the unity of the country and measures to preserve calm and tranquility in Turkey" at the military council meeting. Under normal circumstances the military council cannot discuss security issues regarding the nationwide local elections, yet as the military units are charged with restoring law and order in southeastern Turkey along with police forces, the commanders can discuss this issue as it is allowed to debate all issues that concern the military. It is known that the military wants the government to legislate a new wide-ranging anti-terrorism bill and is disturbed with the delays. The military council which can voice its views on laws concerning the military may officially convey its concern to the civilian authority on the delays regarding the anti-terrorism law. There is also talk that the military council may discuss the need for the proclamation of martial law in the troubled southeastern provinces, especially in view of the expected violence during the Nevroz celebrations. If a majority of the generals and admirals press for martial law, the council may convey such a request to the Supreme Military Council meeting at the end of the month soon after the local elections. Martial law can be proclaimed by a request from the Supreme Military Council. The Cabinet then convenes under the chairmanship of the president and proclaim martial law for a period not to exceed six months.
