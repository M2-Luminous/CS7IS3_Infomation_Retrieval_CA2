These measures should be implemented, the decree stresses, with a view to creating the necessary conditions for building up the production of agricultural raw material and food and ensuring the stabilization and steady development of the agro-industrial complex under market economy conditions. At the same time the chamber refused even to examine the statement prepared by the agrarian faction containing subjective, arbitrary assessments of the present situation in the agro-industrial complex and claiming that "the state of collapse in agro-industrial production is the result of the government's incorrect policy with regard to the agrarian sector of the economy and the grossest errors and blunders in financial, investment, and credit policy."
