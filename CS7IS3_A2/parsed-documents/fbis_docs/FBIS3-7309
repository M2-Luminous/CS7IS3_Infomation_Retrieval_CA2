In the meeting, the committee decided to send its members to Kumamoto Prefecture next week to investigate whether any illegal transactions took place when the prefectural government authorized the construction of a major resort facility at the foot of Mt. Aso during Hosokawa's term as Kumamoto governor. At today's meeting, the committee discussed ways to promote investigation from now on. Noting that Kumamoto prefectural government changed its regulations when it authorized the construction of a resort facility near Mt. Aso during Hosokawa's term as governor, the members agreed that this move was unusual and should be investigated. The committee decided to send four members, including Committee Chairman Matsunaga, who is former international trade and industry minister, to Kumamoto on 31 March. The four will interview prefectural officials about details of the regulation changes and visit the resort facility in question.
