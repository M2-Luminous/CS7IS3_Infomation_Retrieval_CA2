Among these prisoners are the murderers of the three soldiers killed in an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] encampment near Kibbutz Gil'ad in the attack later called "the night of the pitchforks." [passage omitted] Also on the list of candidates for release is Muhammad Sarawi, a resident of the village of Ibtin near Haifa, who in 1987 hurled a grenade in Haifa's Nordau pedestrian mall, wounding 25 people, including the child Dan Me'ir, whose leg was amputated. PLO representatives to talks with Israel are basing themselves on the precedent of the "Jibril deal" in 1985, when Israeli Arabs involved in terrorism were also freed. Senior politicians in Jerusalem tend to accept the demand to free the Israeli Arabs. Among them is at least one cabinet minister, as well as Foreign Ministry officials. As far as is known, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has still not made up his mind on the issue. Knesset Member David Mena' yesterday cabled Rabin warning against releasing Israeli Arabs who murdered for nationalist motives. The Shin Bet is also opposed to the release of Israeli Arabs sentenced to life terms. This opposition was forcefully expressed in discussions held at the defense establishment and at government forums. Defense sources said that such a release would cause a sharp deterioration in the security situation and create a dangerous precedent. YEDI'OT AHARONOT has nevertheless learned that parallel to the tendency to respond partially to the PLO demand on Israeli Arabs, the possibility of recommending pardoning Jews who murdered for nationalist reasons and who have already spent many years in prison has also been raised. The names of David Ben-Shimol and Yona Avrushmi have come up in this context.
