FR940602-0-00040 FR940602-0-00016 Section 173.420 In paragraph (a)(2)(i), the 1990 revision of ANSI N14.1 is added to the earlier editions of ANSI N14.1 cited in this paragraph. Also, in paragraph (b), the reference to ANSI Standard N14.1&hyph;1987 is updated to 1990. These changes are made for consistency with the incorporation by reference of the 1990 edition of this standard under this final rule. Section 174.25 The example provided in paragraph (c) is revised by adding the wording ``PG II'' to reflect a complete basic description, as stated in the sentence preceding the example. Section 178.503 The 17th Session of the UN Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods adopted amendments for incorporation in the eighth revised edition of the UN Recommendations. One amendment provides that UN markings on certain steel drums must include the thickness of the packaging material to the nearest tenth of a millimeter; however, the amendment does not require the marking to contain a unit of measurement (i.e., ``mm''). Section 178.503(a)(9) states that the marking must include the ``mm'' abbreviation for millimeters as part of the thickness marking for metal and plastic drums and jerricans intended for reuse or reconditioning as single packagings or the outer packagings of composite packagings. For consistency with the eighth revised edition of the UN Recommendations, paragraph (a)(9) is revised to clarify that the marked thicknesses must be shown to the nearest tenth of a millimeter and to reflect that the ``mm'' abbreviation is not required. Recognizing that some manufacturers may choose to include the ``mm'' abbreviation or may already be including the ``mm'' in drums markings, the provision allows marking of the ``mm'' symbol on a permissive basis. Corresponding minor editorial changes are made to the UN marking examples shown in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(3). Section 178.505 In §178.505, a typographical error is corrected in the last sentence of paragraph (b)(1) by changing the reference from ``§178.503(a)(10)'' to ``§178.503(a)(9).'' Section 178.506 In §178.506, a typographical error is corrected in the last sentence of paragraph (b)(1) by changing the reference from ``§178.503(a)(10)'' to ``§178.503(a)(9).'' Section 178.509 In §178.509, a typographical error is corrected in the last sentence of paragraph (b)(4) by changing the reference from ``§178.503(a)(10)'' to ``§178.503(a)(9).'' Section 178.511 In §178.511, a typographical error is corrected in the last sentence of paragraph (b)(1) by changing the reference from ``§178.503(a)(10)'' to ``§178.503(a)(9).'' Section 178.601 In §178.601, a typographical error is corrected in the first sentence of paragraph (g)(7) by changing the reference from ``§178.601 (g)(1) and (g)(2)'' to ``§178.601 (g)(1) through (g)(6).''
