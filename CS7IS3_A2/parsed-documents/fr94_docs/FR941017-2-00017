FR941017-2-00017 FR941017-2-00008 Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651; 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR part 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United States. Comments must comply with 15 CFR 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Docket Number: 94&hyph;106. Applicant: Texas A&M Research Foundation, Box 3578, University Drive & Wellborn Road, College Station, TX 77843-3578. Instrument: Two Fluorometers and Accessories, Model AquatrackA MK III. Manufacturer: Chelsea Instruments, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instruments will be used to measure chlorophyll-a (produced by phytoplankton) in order to distinguish the percentage of water turbidity caused by phytoplankton from turbidity caused by inorganic suspended sediment. One instrument will be deployed on a fixed platform in the Lower Laguna Madre, Texas and automatically collect data at selected time intervals. The second instrument will be deployed on a boat which will profile the water column at selected locations. The data collected will be stored on computers and analyzed for periodic variability in chlorophyll-a content of the bay water. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: September 9, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;107. Applicant: Brigham Young University, Purchasing Department, C-144 ASB, Provo, UT 85602. Instrument: Excimer-Pumped Laser System. Manufacturer: Lambda-Physik, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to determine elemental concentration in a wide range of materials, including inorganic compounds and high molecular weight organic molecules. It will also be used in the fundamental characterization of analytically useful plasmas and in studies of supersonically cooled molecules and molecules on surfaces. In addition, the instruments will be used in undergraduate and graduate research courses in chemistry giving students hands-on training with significant research problems. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: September 13, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;108. Applicant: Arizona State University, Department of Physics & Astronomy, Box 871504, Tempe, AZ 85387-1504. Instrument: Toroidal Electrostatic Analyzer. Manufacturer: High Voltage Engineering Europa, The Netherlands. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies of crystalline semiconductors and metals in bulk form and in thin film form to determine the precise location and identity of atoms at or very near the surface. In addition, the instrument will be used to train graduate students in state-of the-art ion beam analysis techniques. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: September 15, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;109. Applicant: Medical College of Pennsylvania, Anatomy & Neurobiology Department, 3200 Henry Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19129. Instrument: High Intensity Xenon Flashlamp System, Model HF-10. Manufacturer: Hi-Tech Scientific, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies of fundamental properties of the regulation of stimulu-secretion coupling for neurotransmitters in living single isolated cells and nerve terminals. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: September 15, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;110. Applicant: Dartmouth College, Department of Earth Sciences, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755. Instrument: Mass Spectrometer, Model MAT 252. Manufacturer: Finnigan MAT, Germany. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for analyzing oxygen and carbon isotopes of rocks and minerals, plants and animals, and waters for geological, biological and environmental studies. The research will include the following: ecosystem research, low temperature geochemistry, high temperature geochemistry, and impact geochemistry. In addition, the instrument will be used in both undergraduate and graduate level courses to introduce students to the concepts of isotope geochemistry. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: September 22, 1994. Pamela Woods, Acting Director, Statutory Import Programs Staff.
