Nothing was done, for reasons ranging from desire to keep out of others' wars, to the fear of losing them, to disagreement between the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). When the Serbs of rump Yugoslavia and the Croats began carrying out ethnic cleansing and genocide with impunity, the United Nations decided that it would intervene to keep the peace. That word was a misnomer, for there was no peace to keep. Paralysed by an arms embargo that removed their ability to defend themselves, the Bosnian Muslims became prey to the barbarities of the Bosnian Serbs. These Serbs were abetted by their brothers in Belgrade who, the same embargo notwithstanding, enjoyed vast superiority in arms because the hardware of the erstwhile Yugoslav military had come to their possession. The massacre of Bosnians continued, whether through outright shelling or the more insidious sniper fire and a siege that kept humanitarian supplies from reaching starving and wounded populations. In the meanwhile, out-of-work European politicians became famous by flying in and out of Sarajevo and Belgrade, trying to achieve a settlement which they, more than anyone else, knew existed only in the imagination. The reason: the Serbs knew that they did not have to make peace, for they were simply doing fine in an unequal war. As the world agonised and political leaders looked the other way, Bosnians died slowly and painfully. Then, last weekend, the shocking death of 68 people in a mortar attack in Sarajevo reminded NATO that it has some responsibility for ensuring that the Balkans do not slip irreversibly out of the civilised world. Foreign Ministers of the European Union (EU) met in Brussels on Monday to issue the toughest warning heard in recent months to those strangling Sarajevo. After the usual disagreements among themselevs, they asked that NATO meet to see how besieged Sarajevo could be relieved using all necessary means, including air strikes. But even now it is not certain that those necessary means will be used. True, air power is not an end in itself. Not only will its use endanger the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, will air strikes not supported by ground action lead to a Serb withdrawal? Who will provide the ground troops? Are NATO governments ready to face the political cost of sustaining casualties in what may turn out to be a protracted war? In terms of realpolitik, is it worth all the effort as long as the Bosnian massacre does not grow in a larger European problem? That apart, what is the point of undertaking military intervention in the absence of a larger, sustainable peace plan whose enforcement must be the objective of the military action? Is there such a peace plan? These are legitimate questions, but they can also become dishonest excuses for doing nothing -- which is exactly how they look today. The Serbs need to be punished for what they are doing, and prevented from doing what they will do if they are not stopped. The demilitarisation of Sarajevo enforced through limited air strikes, will remind them that they can be losers in an equal war. Strategicaly, the strikes will hold the situation while increased diplomatic pressure is brought to bear on the Serbs for a political solution. Concurrently, a lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia will enable it to balance the military scales for the same purpose: to make the Serbs realise that they have to talk real peace. To date, the U.S. has shown more than any other NATO member that the plight of the Bosnians means anything to the conscience of the civilised world. In the name of that civilisation, in the name of the right of a people to resist genocide, in the name of innocent Bosnians who are still alive, it is the U.S. which needs to lead the way to what needs to be done at once: Stop the Serbs.
