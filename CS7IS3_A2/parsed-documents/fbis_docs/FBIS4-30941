The Bosnian Presidency said Thursday that it would not send any representatives to the meeting "for the moment" but could "eventually" attend talks on Friday, the diplomats said. The government had demanded that the Serbs withdraw all armed men from around the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde before the talks went ahead. But earlier Thursday a UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman in Sarajevo said that contrary to a written pledge by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, some 150 armed Serb policemen were still inside a UN-imposed three-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde. "Nothing has changed in Gorazde," regarding the Serb forces withdrawal, UNPROFOR spokesman Major Rob Annink said. The withdrawal of the 150 Serbs from the exclusion zone on the east bank of the River Drina had been the main condition of the Bosnian Government of President Alija Izetbegovic for attending the peace talks. Under threat of NATO air strikes, Bosnian Serbs ended a weeks-long offensive against Gorazde earlier this year and pulled their heavy weapons back from the exclusion zone, but refused to withdraw the policemen from what they said was a Serb-inhabited section of the town. Karadzic, in a letter sent to UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi on Wednesday promised that "as of today there will be no armed Serb personnel" in the three-kilometre zone. Akashi said in a statement Wednesday that Karadzic's letter could provide "a sufficient basis for the opening of the meeting in Geneva" but the talks "could not take place unless all Bosnian Serb soliders, militia and armed civilians were redeployed outside the zone." Akashi was expected here from Zagreb later Thursday to chair the talks, which were also to be attended by mediators Thorvald Stoltenberg of the United Nations and Lord Owen of the European Union and the special U.S. and Russian envoys Charles Redman and Vitaliy Churkin. The Serbs were to be represented by Karadzic and Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic. Diplomatic sources said the international community and the United Nations have been applying strong pressure on the belligerents to return to the negotiating table with hopes of reaching tangible results, first on a ceasefire and then on an administrative division of Bosnia along ethnic lines, within eight weeks. But a Croatian diplomat said Wednesday that it might not be in the best interests of the newly formed Moslem-Croat federation "to settle for a comprehensive cessation of hostilities." "Previous agreements have all been violated by the Serbs," the diplomat said. "A new one, if implemented, would freeze the military situation on the ground, thus benefitting the Serbs." He said the belligerents would then be forced to deal with a contact group trying to settle the conflict at all costs, "even if it rewards Serb aggression." The contact group -- the European Union, Russia and the United States -- tried in vain last week to get the warring factions to agree to a four-month truce and to accept a plan that would give 51 percent of territory to the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Serbs. The Croats and Moslems are demanding 58 percent of the territory. The Serbs currently control about 70 percent. A French Foreign Ministry spokesman meanwhile said in Paris that representatives of the contact group would meet again with the warring Bosnian parties Saturday and Sunday in Geneva. The meeting had been scheduled for next week but was moved up for "practical reasons" related to Thursday and Friday's planned Geneva discussions, spokesman Richard Duque said.
