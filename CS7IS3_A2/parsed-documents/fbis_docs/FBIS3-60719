Ukraine does not sell arms to either the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the South African Republic, or Iraq. With regard to selling certain types of arms to Iran, Ukraine is pursuing its own economic interests and observes security principles. Borys Tarasyuk underlined that Ukraine had never sold sea-launched guided missiles to Iran. According to the Ukrainian diplomat, taking advantage of the imperfection of the system of control exercised by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Exports Controls, middlemen manage to ship arms, products, and technologies to the states under ban.
