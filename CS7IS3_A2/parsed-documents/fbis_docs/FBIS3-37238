Our correspondent Yevgeniy Zherebenkov reports: [Zherebenkov] This is not the first time the State Duma has turned its attention to the Yugoslav problem. Hearings on the situation in former Yugoslavia have already been held by the committee on international affairs. One of the Duma's first documents was a resolution on ways of settling the Yugoslav conflict. But the latest hearings, held by the Liberal Democrat-dominated committee on geopolitical issues, have not really heard any fundamentally new proposals. Deputies again demanded that the president use his right of veto in the UN Security Council against NATO's decision on air strikes in Yugoslavia. They also want him to tackle the question of lifting Russia's economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. Vladimir Ivanovskiy, a Foreign Ministry representative, assured the deputies that Russia would do all it could to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Here is what he said to me in an interview: [Begin Ivanovskiy recording] I arrived at the hearings straight from consultations at the Foreign Ministry with British Foreign Office officials. As you know, Major is here at the moment. Yugoslav problems will be one of the central topics at the talks. We are doing everything we can, working with the different sides. I said that the president's special representative had spent almost the whole of Saturday night in talks with Milosevic. It is also envisaged that our president will have further contacts with the presidents of the leading countries, those that are playing an active part in the settlement process. The minister is in constant contact with them. So everything possible is being done to avert the worst. There is only one method available to us -- talks and clarification of positions, the search for a joint solution. [end recording]
