The vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, Zhou Zhengqing, heading his country's delegation to the ADB's annual board of governors meeting in Nice, outlined China's views on the bank's program and policies in the 1990s. Zhou said that his government has always actively supported the ADB's capital increase and made unremitting efforts for its fourth general capital increase. But China "has to express great regret over plans to link policy consideration to capital increase" which were raised during the ADB's recent talks, he added. Zhou believed that as economic backwardness is the fundamental cause of poverty, environmental problems and sexual discrimination in the developing countries, the ADB should make economic development a top priority and gradually furnish these countries with the resources and capabilities to resolve these issues. "Rigidly linking projects to solutions of some social problems is detrimental to supporting the economic growth of the ADB's member countries and eventually harmful to social progress," said Zhou. Pointing out that China appreciates the ADB's efforts to improve the quality of loan projects, he noted that the key lies in increased cooperation between the ADB and those countries offered loans. He declared that China would, as always, strengthen cooperation with the ADB and learn from other states who had loans from the bank. "China also appreciates the ADB's efforts to push the economic development and social progress of its member countries," said Zhou. However, he called for the ADB to heed the specific situations of its members in promoting its policies and strategies on poverty alleviation, environmental protection, raising women's status, populations and protecting forests. He said that the ADB's policies and strategies in the above fields should be sufficiently adaptable and flexible and be easy to accept and implement. Zhou also called on the ADB to make greater contributions to the economic boom and social development of the Asian-Pacific region. In the last few years, he explained, loans and technical assistance from the ADB had supported China's reform, its opening up to the outside world and economic development, thus helping to ease the restrictions on China's economy from bottlenecks like energy, transportation and communication. He said that with the global economy growing at a slow pace in the past year, the economic growth in the Asian-Pacific region had maintained a high speed increase of seven percent, accelerating global economic recovery and development. "This is mainly a result of the reform, structural readjustment and open economic policies promoted by the Asian-Pacific countries and regions based on their own situations," he added. The ADB's three-day meeting, which began yesterday, is scheduled to focus discussion on how to improve ADB-funded projects and properly handle the relationship between economic growth and social issues. Founded in 1966 the ADB is a governmental international financial organization aimed at promoting Asian-Pacific economic development and cooperation. So far, it has provided loans totaling 47.7 billion dollars for 1,179 projects.
