Electric power sector officials in Matanzas announced that in the case of the Antonio Guiteras plant, the problem was due to tears in the boiler's heat-exchange surfaces. Damage assessment and repairs will begin at noon today. Specialists have stated that if the needed repairs are found to be minor, they could be done in two or three days of intense work, bearing in mind that the temperature of the boiler must drop before repair work can begin. The breakdown of the 330-megawatt generating unit caused a deficit of 70 megawatts during the morning and afternoon; and in the evening, the peak demand period, the deficit was of 90 megawatts. Specialists are making great efforts -- particularly since the sugarcane harvest is in the final phase and in light of other important economic activities -- to ready a schedule of outages for when power is available. The outage schedule will also guarantee an equitable supply of water to the residential sector.
