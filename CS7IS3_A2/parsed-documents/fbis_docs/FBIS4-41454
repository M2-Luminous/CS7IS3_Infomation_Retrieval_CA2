He will be taking part in the ceremonial signing of the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European Union, which will be held here today. Although there was no official announcement of President Boris Yeltsin's trip until the last few days, the world public had begun talking about it long ago. And preparation for the Russian guest's arrival was already in full swing on Corfu itself in the runup to the top-level EU Council session. Among other things, the Greek government asked the super-rich shipping magnate Yannis Latsis to put his luxurious yacht, the Alexandros, at our president's disposal during his stay. The yacht was recently used by former U.S. President George Bush when vacationing in Greece. It is clear therefore why the special services team which has arrived from Moscow includes divers. Representatives of the special services of other countries are also here. Thousands of Greek policemen have been brought in to prevent any possibility of terrorism or sabotage. However, all the manifold detail of the conference preparation, which is filling the press, does not prevent the public from seeing the main reason for the Russian president's trip to this distant island. He is to sign the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the EU, to cover the next 10 years. Without going into the detail of the almost 100-page package of documents connected with the agreement, it is important to stress that they cover virtually all spheres of collaboration with the EU -- economic, political, and cultural. These include the arrangements governing the trade in goods. This is perhaps the most "painful" issue. It has been resolved that the two parties will grant each other most-favored nation status. The EU does not henceforth regard the Russian Federation as a country with a planned economy but recognizes it as a transitional economy. The agreement envisages the development of cooperation in the basic sectors of the economy, the liberalization of the movement of capital and current payments, rules of competition, the harmonization of legislation in the economic sphere, and much else besides. Generally speaking, the document to be signed by Boris Yeltsin lays down the principles for the free movement of goods, capital, and services between the parties, on which basis gradual integration of the economies of Russia and the EU will take place. This should provide a healthy economic basis which mutually opens markets and makes it possible to create conditions favorable to the activity of companies and firms and a climate conducive to investment. We are thus talking about an all-embracing accord, a document which is not only extensive but very far-reaching. It will certainly considerably help Russia to assume the place appropriate to a great power in the world arena. According to Boris Yeltsin, his visit will be exceptionally useful to the Russian economy. He has described the signing of the agreement as the first tactical move whereby our country "arrives in Europe." Henceforth, he said, discriminatory measures against Russia "whereby we have not been given quotas for the export of goods are overcome." It can be said right now, he stressed, that the new parameters of cooperation and partnership will make it possible to increase exports to European countries. The president added that the transitional nature of the Russian economy had still not been acknowledged in the United States. Barriers to Russian goods had not therefore been abolished there yet. The EU Council will be examining a host of problems. After the signing of the agreement with Russia, for example, the ceremonial accession of Austria, Norway, Finland, and Sweden to the Union will take place. And yesterday evening the EU countries' leaders organized a dinner with the Russian Federation president at which topical international problems were discussed. The session will also sum up the results of the Greek representative's six-month chairmanship of the Union. His place will be taken by the representative of Germany.
