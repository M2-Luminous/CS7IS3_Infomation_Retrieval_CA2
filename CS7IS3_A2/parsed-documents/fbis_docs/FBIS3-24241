This treaty is a compromise, just as any agreement is, whether it be in everyday life, at the domestic state level, or in international relations. But it is a compromise that preserves the sovereignty of both sides. They have divided, in a sovereign manner, the powers in a new unification. Inasmuch as, according to Minister Sergey Shakhray, one of the chief representatives of the Russian side, as quoted in a ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA interview, "the methodology of the Federative Treaty formed the basis of the document," we shall refer to that act and compare what was put in whose jurisdiction by that act. A number of areas of behavior, including some extremely important ones, that were ascribed in the Federative Treaty to the sphere of the joint jurisdiction of the Center and the subjects of the Federation have now been firmly established as being within the exclusive, that is, sovereign, jurisdiction of Tatarstan. They include, for example, "questions of the possession, use, and disposal of the land, mineral wealth, the water, timber, and other natural resources, as well as the state enterprises, organizations, and other movable and immovable property situated on the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan." We might note, incidentally, an extremely important principle that has been established: the topic being discussed is the "exclusive property owned by the people of Tatarstan," rather than "by the state" (read: the state bureaucracy), as is frequently written in RF acts. According to the Treaty, Tatarstan itself has the right to resolve questions of the bar and notary practices, and to carry out the legal regulation of administrative, family, and housing relations, and relations in the area of environmental protection and use of natural resources. Tatarstan itself establishes the system of the republic's state agencies, and the procedure for organizing them and for carrying out their activities. Like any other sovereign state, Tatarstan itself resolves questions of republic citizenship. The republic itself forms its budget, establishes and collects taxes, and independently carries out foreign-economic activity; resolves questions of conversion at enterprises that are part of the republic's state property; creates the National Bank; concludes agreements with foreign states; participates in international organizations; etc. These and other exclusive powers and sovereign rights correspond to the Tatarstan Constitution, which has firmly established the state sovereignty of the Republic of Tatarstan. It is fundamentally important that the documents that are recognized as the legal basis of the treaty are the constitutions of both states. Legally this means not only the paramount importance and the priority of the norms and principles of the two constitutions and of each of them, but also the fact that, when interpreting the treaty, each side primarily proceeds from its own Constitution and coordinates its point of view with the Constitution of the other participant in the Treaty. For those who, in 1991, adopted the Declaration of the State Sovereignty of Tatarstan, who, in March 1992, in a referendum voted for the republic's sovereignty, and who subsequently, on the basis of that referendum, developed and adopted, in November 1992, the Constitution of the sovereign state of Tatarstan, something that must be of substantial importance is the fact that the treaty, as is stated in its preamble, is the "completely equal unification of two states," and that this unification occurred on the basis of the constitutions both of Russia and Tatarstan, as well as the principles enumerated in the treaty itself. The treaty is an agreement between sovereign states and the subjects of international law. This is not stated in the text. But that essence of the act is self-evident, primarily on the basis of the sense of the name and text of the agreement. It is called: "Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan." That means an agreement between two sovereign states (Article 1 in both constitutions). This is also mentioned in the preamble, where it is directly stated that the Republic of Tatarstan unites with the Russian Federation "as a state." Furthermore, the treaty was signed at the highest level -- by chiefs of state. The sovereignty of the contracting parties as entities in international law is also attested to by the subject of the agreement. It pertains to the delimitation of the authoritative powers, that is, the powers that are inherent in state sovereignty, since sovereignty is a category of authority. The fact that the treaty is an act in international law, that is, an agreement between two subjects of international law, also evolves completely obviously from the fact the contracting parties indicated as their legal basis their own constitutions --each of them unambiguously established the quality of a sovereign state that is based on the sovereignty of the multiethnic people of those countries (Articles 1 and 3 of the RF Constitution; preamble and Articles 1, 2, and 61 of the RT Constitution). Sergey Shakhray, RF minister of nationalities and regional policy, stated in the interview that was previously mentioned that "this treaty is not subject to ratification, in order not to create the illusion of being a document in international law." But ratification is a completely unmandatory attribute of the nature of the treaty as a document in international law. This depends upon how the contracting parties come to an understanding. Another matter is that the treaty distributes the sovereign powers within the framework of the unification of the two contracting parties that is created by them. Sergey Shakhray said, "From the point of view of international law and state law, this (the signing of the treaty and Tatarstan's consent to participate in elections to the Federal Assembly) means the recognition of the federal electoral law and sovereignty of Russia." If the minister, by his use of the word "recognition," means not the assertion of the existence of Russia's sovereignty, but the subordination of Tatarstan to the sovereignty of the RF, then the very preamble of the treaty begins with words to the effect that the contracting parties are guided not only by the RF Constitution, but also equally by the RT Constitution, and that they are proceeding from the "generally recognized right of nations to self-determination, on principles of the completely equal and voluntary expression of free will", etc. Incidentally, the nation of Tatarstan also expressed its self-determination unambiguously not only in March 1992, but also during the April 1993 referendum and during the referendum on the new RF Constitution. Gavriil Popov and Fedor Burlatskiy, in a Dialogue broadcast on 19 February, did justice to the political wisdom of President Mintimer Shaymiyev and the endurance of President Boris Yeltsin, who justly divided the victory (it is only in such an instance that it is indeed a victory) equally between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan. Finally, we would like to direct attention to the fact that the Treaty text contains four references to agreements between the contracting parties. As is well known, there are more than ten of them. It must be assumed that these agreements will also become accessible to the public. That would help to make a better evaluation of the historical nature of the role and limits of the importance of a treaty that is so important for Russia and Tatarstan.
