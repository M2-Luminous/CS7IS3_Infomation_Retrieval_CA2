SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In September 1992, EPA released a commissioned study entitled Influence of CBI Requirements on TSCA CBI (the ``study''). The study was commissioned as part of an EPA initiative to improve TSCA's utilization as a toxics information dissemination statute. The study provided an in depth analysis of CBI claims, submitter procedures for making such claims, EPA review and challenges of claims, and effects of CBI claims on information which is not eligible for confidential treatment by the standards established in TSCA and its implementing regulations, including 40 CFR part 2, on EPA's toxics information mission. After releasing the study, EPA has met with a variety of state, environmental, labor, and industry groups. In addition, EPA conducted a public meeting regarding the study. EPA carefully considered the recommendations provided in the study and the comments it has received from the public. Based in part on the recommendations and comments received, EPA formulated a working paper entitled Proposed Actions to Reform TSCA Confidential Business Information (the ``proposal'') discussing the issues raised by EPA, the study, and the various comments. The Agency conducted a second public meeting after the release of the proposal. Again EPA has received many comments. Based on the recommendations and comments received, EPA developed the final paper entitled Final Action Plan: TSCA Confidential Business Information Reform . The paper is available from the TSCA Hot Line at the location listed under the ADDRESSES unit. The following are components of the Final Action Plan: 1. Educational efforts. 2. Toxics information dissemination. 3. State programs. 4. Regulatory policy clarifications. 5. CBI review. 6. Industry voluntary information dissemination. 7. Regulatory changes: sunset provisions. 8. Regulatory changes: senior management official signing CBI claims. 9. Regulatory changes: upfront substantiation. All the comments received in the various stages of the policy development process, various other relevant documents and the transcripts of the public meetings have been incorporated into a public case file. This case file, No. 00125A, is available for inspection in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center located at EPA headquarters, Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Dated: June 27, 1994. Mark A. Greenwood, Director, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16332 Filed 7&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
