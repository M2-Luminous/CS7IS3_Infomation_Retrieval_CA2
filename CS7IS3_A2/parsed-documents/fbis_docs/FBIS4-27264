Hata told a session of the House of Representative Budget Committee that currently Japan has no plan to own a spy satellite. "But it is important to have correct (military) information to ensure our self-defense," the premier said. "We must study concrete issues." Hata, asked about relations between a Diet resolution prohibiting military use of outer space and spy satellites, said the fact that the Defense Agency receives information from a U.S. spy satellite on a commercial basis does not contravene the resolution. "I understand that the Self-Defense Forces have been allowed to make use of satellites that are generally used," Hata said. Atsushi Kanda, director general of the Defense Agency, told the same committee session that Japan should have the ability "to repulse ballistic missiles in the future." In that context, however, Kanda showed a cautious stance on the issue, saying, "there are various difficult problems such as the Diet resolution."
