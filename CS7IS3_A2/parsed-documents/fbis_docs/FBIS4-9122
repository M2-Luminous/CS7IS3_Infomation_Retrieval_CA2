"The only way to peace is the separation of Krajina from Croatia," Martic underscored in the Krajina political seat of Knin in an interview to the Belgrade correspondent of the Czech CTK news agency. "Life together is absolutely out of the question," he said. "The sooner this reality is accepted, life will be better in Krajina and in Croatia," Martic said. "Theoretically, it is possible, if Croats amend their constitution, that the (Krajina) people might agree to co-existence. And yet, even then, it would have to be solely through the will of the people," Martic warned. ``As far as I am concerned, personally, I would never approve that. I do not trust Croats...(because) Serbs have bitter experiences [words indistinct] the Krajina president said from [passage indistinct] Martic also strongly denied that President Slobodan Milosevic of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia had pressured him to get Krajina Serbs to agree to autonomy within Croatia in exchange for the lifting of the international embargo against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. "Milosevic is for us to chose our own way," Martic underscored. Martic sees a compromise by the Serb side not in agreement to autonomy within Croatia, but in the restoration of economic cooperation and comprehensive normalization of mutual ties. "The main condition is -- equal relations between the republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia as two independent states." "We are for peace, but not at all costs. We shall not buckle down under supposedly democratic pressure to give up our right to self-determination," Martic (?concluded). [passage omitted]
