In a statement today, al-'Arabi pointed out that inter-Arab trade today represents under 12 percent of collective Arab foreign trade. He noted that Arab investments in the Arab world are limited, although over $850 billion is being invested elsewhere. He called for adopting positive measures to attract part of the Arab capital being invested in foreign states. Al-'Arabi pointed out that the necessary foundation for a common Arab market exists but that it needs a set of measures to be perfected. He explained that the required measures are to facilitate the movement of goods and flow of trade among Arab states, reduce shipping charges, eliminate customs barriers, and encourage bilateral agreements as a basis for a common Arab market.
