Seventy-three per cent of the voters cast their ballots in his favour. Sysuyev's closest rival scored ten times fewer votes. Sysuyev was appointed the head of administration of Samara by Yeltsin's decree two years ago, the Sunday elections gave him popular support needed for further work. Although the economic situation of Samara has never been as complex as lately, none of the municipal development programmes has been aborted under Oleg Sysuyev. The city transport network has been renewed and three new underground stations have been added to the underground railway system. Housing has been built apace, and many hospitals and educational establishments have received new equipment. The mayor of Samara pins great hopes on the development of partnership relations with the German city of Stuttgart, American St. Louis and Bulgarian Stara Zagora. Exchange of experience has already involved scientists, doctors, teachers and policemen and is likely to do good to the partner cities and will help the nations establish better contacts.
