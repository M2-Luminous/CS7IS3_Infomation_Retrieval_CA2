A court in the Philippines banned the conference, but we have been informed that the organizers will disregard the decision. The conference will start on Monday [30 May] with an address by Konis Santana, the East Timorese resistance leader. Our correspondent in Australia, Antonio Sampaio, managed to obtain an exclusive copy of the video that also contains pictures of resistance members: [Sampaio] [Video shows armed members of the resistance in camouflage uniform, in the bush. Video shows the men in formation, sitting on the ground and performing tasks] These are the latest pictures to arrive from the mountains in East Timor, filmed at the end of April and given to us exclusively. They are destined for Manila, where at the end of weeks of Indonesian controversy and diplomatic blackmail, the first conference in the Asia-Pacific region on human rights in East Timor is about to start. The highlight of the conference will be the opening speech by Konis Santana, the leader of the East Timorese resistance. In this speech, Konis addresses heavy criticism at Jakarta and at the cooperation that governments in the region are maintaining with the Indonesian regime: [Begin Santana recording] [video shows Santana speaking, standing at a table with a gun next to him, and resistance flag draped behind him] Many around the world thought it impossible for a defenseless people to defeat such a great Asian power as Indonesia and assumed the East Timorese issue to be over. [end recording] [Sampaio] [Video shows armed resistance men in formation] The resistance leader also appeals for further joint efforts in favor of East Timor and makes wide reference to the peace plan proposed by Jose Ramos Horta [resistance spokesman abroad]: [Begin Santana recording] The East Timorese people are thus sufficiently ready to ensure civilized, orderly, and responsible behavior, within the context of the geo-political region. The East Timorese people recognize the interests of the region and Indonesia itself and will know how to respect those interests. The people of East Timor, aware of their position in the region, will fight actively to become a member of the Asia-Pacific region. Most of all, East Timor manifests its wish to put itself forward to become a member state of ASEAN, for only then will it be able to contribute to stability and peace in the region.
