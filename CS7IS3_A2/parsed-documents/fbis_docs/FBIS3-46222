The new work is proving to be even more rewarding than their original jobs, both for themselves and for the city authority. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei Province in central China. An official from the city's office for the service industries said that these redundant workers are now playing an important role in restaurants, commodity retailing, labor market and other fields of the service sector. If they had not got those jobs, the official said, their original enterprises and the government would have had to pay at least 500 million yuan a year in unemployment compensation to them. To create new jobs for them, the city authority spent 300 million yuan over the past years on the opening of 400 markets. It even provided money to those who wanted to start their own businesses but faced a shortage of funds, the official said. The city authority has also sponsored the opening of nearly 50 vacation schools and training centers, through which some 40,000 redundant workers were prepared for new professions, according to the official. Enterprises also got help from the city authority to create new jobs for those laid off by them. For example, the official said, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation has successfully re-employed 20,000 workers it had laid off, using them in its many new business ventures. The official said that the bringing in of these new forces had resulted in a great boost for the city's service industry, which produced a turnover of more than 10 billion yuan in 1993, almost four times higher than in 1984.
