Mr. Mesfin Seyoum, in a statement to the Saudi Arabian ARAB NEWS newspaper, said that Sudan should think twice before deciding to expand its ideology to neighboring countries, and noted that we may understand each other if Sudan is limited to implementing its ideology on its territory only. The foreign minister went on to say that trying to expand ideology in a way which would affect the peace and stability of neighboring countries would affect the countries concerned. Mr. Mesfin, answering a question on how he views the conflict which arose between Eritrea and Sudan, said anything which affects the peace and stability of neighboring countries will concern us, because it will also affect our peace and stability. Mr. Mesfin noted however that open and clear discussions were underway between the two countries.
