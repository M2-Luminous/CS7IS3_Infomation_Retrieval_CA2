FR940830-1-00050 FR940830-1-00009 EPA requests comment on the information in the report, ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests,'' including: (1) the conversion factors in Table 1 of this notice (and in Table 22 of the report) and the adequacy of the data supporting the conversion factors; (2) the procedure used to derive the conversion factors; and (3) any additional data that could be used in developing the conversion factors.

Recommended conversion factors are given to three decimal places and are not rounded off because they are intermediate values in the calculation of dissolved criteria. B. 1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study The rate of fish consumption is an aspect of exposure used in the methodology for deriving human health criteria. The current fish consumption rate used in the derivation of National ambient water quality criteria is 6.5 grams/day, which represents a National average consumption value per person for freshwater and estuarine fish and shellfish. The proposed Guidance included a fish consumption rate of 15 grams/day, which represents the mean exposure level for regionally caught fish for the regional sportfishing population. This estimate was made from a review of several regional studies in Michigan, Wisconsin and New York. A study conducted by West et al., ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study,'' for the State of Michigan was submitted during the public comment period for the proposed Guidance. The study had three main objectives: (1) to determine fish consumption patterns that could then be used in setting water quality standards in Michigan; (2) to determine angler compliance with Michigan fish consumption advisories and patterns of preparing fish recommended in fish consumption advisories; and (3) to determine which sub-populations are at greatest risk so that educational programs about fish consumption advisories can be targeted to those populations. The survey was conducted over one year and included 7000 licensed Michigan anglers who were sampled by mail. A systematic random sample was drawn such that stratification by geographic region and license type within each region was used to ensure that each licensed angler had the same chance of being selected. By ordering the population by license type within a region, a proportionate State-wide distribution of anglers was achieved. Questionnaires were mailed in two-week cohorts throughout the study period of January 30, 1991 through January 29, 1992. Surveyed individuals were asked to report detailed fish consumption patterns over the preceding 7 days. The survey reported a response rate of about 47%. The authors of the report include seven options that represented their opinions on the possible policy choices available to the State of Michigan. The seven policy options include: Option 1_6.5 grams/day. This represents the average consumption level for the State of Michigan as a whole (not just sportanglers). Option 2_14.5 grams/day. This represents the average sport fish consumption level by Michigan sport fishermen, adjusted for non-response bias. Option 3_24.3 grams/day. This represents the average total fish consumption level by Michigan sport fishermen, adjusted for non-response bias.
