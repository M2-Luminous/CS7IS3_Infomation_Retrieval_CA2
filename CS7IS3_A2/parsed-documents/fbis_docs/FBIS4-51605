The draft legislation therefore failed to pass its first reading. In compliance with the suggestion of House Speaker Marut Bunnak, the alphabetic roll call was employed and members of the National Assembly were requested to vote on all the seven bills at one time. Normally, special legislation involving constitutional amendment bills would require separate voting, which in the case of the seven drafts would take about 10 hours. The result of the voting was that the seven bills failed to get 313 votes or half of the votes from the 265 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives. The majority of the members of the National Assembly abstained from voting. The vote counting was completed at 1310. In response to criticism of his job performance by some opposition members of the House, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said it was a rather difficult task to try to please everyone, noting that the government had to be very careful in making decisions. He asked everyone to keep firmly to the democratic path, something which might not satisfy everybody. Things must proceed according to the procedures. He pointed out that the government not only had to serve the people, but also had to preserve the country's democratic system. Members of the National Assembly stood up to hear the Royal Decree declaring the closure of the extraordinary session on 1 May. The ordinary parliamentary session will be opened on 1 May for a period of three months.
