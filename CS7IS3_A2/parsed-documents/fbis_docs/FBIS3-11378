Party Presidents Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and Miguel Arraes met in Brasilia to debate the joint program of government. They defined their priority: the 70 million people who are being "ignored" by the Brazilian economy. "We will work together to design the program and coordinate the political sectors during the campaign," Lula said. After this meeting Lula met with Roberto Freire, PPS [Popular Socialist Party] deputy for Pernambuco, and with Sergio Arouca, PPS deputy for Rio de Janeiro. At a national party convention held last Sunday, 12 PPS state boards voted to support the PT in the presidential elections. At the meeting with the PSB Arraes raised the issue of the "ignored" sectors. Lula clarified that the PT draft government program advocates an economic policy that favors the lower income sectors. "Yet to support those who are oppressed is not sufficient. What is needed are concrete projects for solving the issue," said economist Maria da Conceicao Tavares, who attended the meeting between Lula and Arraes. Three PSB names are being considered for vice president on Lula's ticket: Jose Paulo Bisol, senator for Rio Grande do Sul; ex-prefect Vilma Maia (Rio Grande do Norte); and Maceio Mayor Ronaldo Lessa. Lula and Arraes said that their agenda did not include this topic. Late in the afternoon, Ronaldo Lessa contacted PT leaders to arrange a conversation with Lula. Lessa said that the PT has not made a formal commitment with the PSB because it must still negotiate with the PPS and the PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil]. He said the PSB position is "legitimate." "We are the largest among the allies. I am sure this is the major factor," Lessa said. In what is a favorable precedent, Lessa defeated then President Fernando Collor in the elections for the post of mayor of Maceio in 1992, in an unprecedented coalition between the PSB, PT (post of deputy mayor), PDT [Democratic Labor Party], PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], PPS, and PC do B.
