This was reported yesterday to DAVAR by a Gaza Strip Palestinian who meets with Americans on a regular basis. U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian toured the Gaza Strip 15 February and met with local Palestinian leaders. Representatives of foreign embassies conduct weekly visits to the Gaza Strip. It has not yet been decided whether or not to open a consulate, culture center, or some other form of official representation; however, the issue is occasionally discussed by U.S. diplomats and Palestinian officials. The Americans have already told the Palestinians that whatever form the representation takes, it will not be established before progress is made in implementing the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. France and the United Kingdom maintain culture centers in the Gaza Strip. Representatives of various European countries are also discussing the possibility of opening legations -- consulates, culture centers, or other institutions -- in the Gaza Strip with local Palestinian officials.
