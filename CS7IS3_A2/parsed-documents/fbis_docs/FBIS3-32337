FBIS3-32337 "drlat025_c_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 MEXICO Press Claims Presence of Armed Groups in Guerrero State PA0602023594 Paris AFP in Spanish 1846 GMT 3 Feb 94 PA0602023594 Paris AFP Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Report by Luis Granovsky] [Text] Acapulco, Mexico, 3 Feb (AFP) -- Despite official denials regarding an eventual presence of subversive groups in Guerrero State, Mexico, the country's press has continued to insist "the existence of armed groups that invite the population to join the guerrillas is a widely known secret," as the daily NOVEDADES proclaimed today. Under the headline "Subversion Is Promoted in the Costa Chica Region," the newspaper published on its front page a map of the "area with a possible guerrilla presence" and quotes statements from a police commissioner, a bilingual teacher, and other witnesses who have informed the authorities of the presence of armed individuals in the area. The Acapulco newspaper EL SOL, on the Pacific Coast, had written on 2 February that there are military training camps, that more than 20,000 AK-47 assault rifles had entered the state over the last few weeks, and that there is a "red alert" in the state due to the danger of "a new guerrilla front, similar to the one in Chiapas State." There was a guerrilla uprising in the southern State of Chiapas on 1 January, and for weeks national newspapers and magazines have been insisting that in the mountain and forest areas of Guerrero State there are armed groups, in addition an intense police mobilization to search for them. Jose Ruben Robles, Guerrero State government secretary, said on 22 February the information published by EL SOL reflects a "lack of responsibility and little professionalism," because "no subversive groups have been found, much less any military training camps." The newspaper also quoted an official document, existence of which the government has denied, but EL SOL Director Eloisa Lopez has confirmed to AFP that it exists and that she has a copy. NOVEDADES' envoy to the area has described such cases, however, as that of Huehuetonoc, where the bilingual teacher has reported that armed individuals, with beige uniforms, had invited the Indian population to join the guerrilla movement. This was also denounced by the town's police commissioner. It has also mentioned the arrest of a retired police sergeant who was bearing "prohibited weapons" and who had allegedly confessed to forming part of a group of eight people armed with AK-47 assault rifles and M-1 carbines and members of a "town police." The government does not deny the presence of armed groups but identifies them as crooks, criminals, or kidnappers, not as subversives. In Guerrero State there was, in the early 1970's, a guerrilla uprising that the Army annihilated quickly. It is recognized that in the region there are many groups of drug traffickers that have already clashed several times with the Army, which is fighting them, and even amongst themselves for control of the exit routes of the marijuana grown in the mountains. There have also been dozens of kidnapings, mostly of wealthy landlords who have had to pay large amounts of money to be freed. The only point on which the different versions agree is that there are many weapons circulating in Guerrero State: the disagreements regard who has them and for what they use them. Meanwhile, there is a psychosis of possible clashes in many towns in the state.
