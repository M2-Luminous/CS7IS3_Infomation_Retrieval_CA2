One could be: Europe has rarely seen a similarly colorless U.S. President who is more prone to attack and has as little substance. Prone to attack: The fact that, when the leader of the last superpower sits beside the beautiful wife of the Italian prime minister, the international press only mocks the "womanizer" Clinton, giving the clear image of a president who has practically admitted to having had an affair before his presidency and is looking for presidential immunity in case of possible further accusations. There are far heavier burdens: "Whitewater" is still waiting for him at home and his staff is constantly being decimated through suicide, resignation, or investigations. Colorless: Anyone who watched the President in Normandy -- how he pretended to be shocked -- who heard how he justified his refusal to serve in Vietnam, but regretted the lack of military experience (by referring to the war movies of his childhood), who saw what figure Bill Clinton cut in the interview with Francois Mitterrand, can only agree with the annoyed veterans: Youth is not a disgrace, but no one wants to take this paleness seriously. Lack of substance: The fact that Bill Clinton was the first U.S. President since Woodrow Wilson to speak at the French National Assembly is the only remarkable thing about this event. The call for a strong Europe (as a counterpart to the withdrawing United States) would not have needed this historical frame; one would have known anyway how determined Clinton is about his foreign policy -- see Bosnia, China, and North Korea. Lastly, the President went to Oxford to receive an honorary doctorate. And the renowned ECONOMIST, which once recommended that people vote for Clinton, received him in an editorial with terms such as "inconsistent," "no backbone," "embarrassing," and, therefore, "in the corner" out of his own fault. What can one add to that?
