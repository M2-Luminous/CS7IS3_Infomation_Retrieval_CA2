Summing up the talks, Presidential Spokesman Andras Farago said Goncz believed that business links between the two countries could be increased now that the necessary legal and institutional conditions have been created. The next step will be to work out an investment protection agreement and improve financial and bank relations. The president praised Chernomyrdin for his balancing role in Russia's political and economic life. Chernomyrdin stressed that Russia was striving for economic and political stability in consideration of Hungary's reform experience. At the same time, Moscow is aware that it is impossible to introduce a pure market economy overnight in the face of such difficult tasks as, for instance, privatization and military industry conversion, the Russian prime minister said. After meeting with Goncz, Chernomyrdin laid a wreath at the memorial of Soviet soldiers in Freedom Square and at the Hungarian heroes' monument in Heroes Square. Chernomyrdin will begin his Friday programme at the Szekesfehervar (central Hungary) unit of the Ikarus bus factory. He will continue in Budapest with representatives of Hungarian economic and financial life. In the afternoon, several documents will be signed in Parliament, after which Chernomyrdin and Boross will hold an international press conference.
