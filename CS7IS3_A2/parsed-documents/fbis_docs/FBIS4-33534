Figueroa added that the Chilean Government will formalize its proposal in a document to be submitted to Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who is also Mercosur Council chairman, on 8 June. The Chilean foreign minister is participating in the 24th OAS General Assembly, which was inaugurated in Belem, a city in Para State's Amazon region, on 6 June and will continue its deliberations until 10 June. Figueroa noted: "We have not joined Mercosur due to difficulties arising from import duties." Chile levies an 11 percent tariff on all imports regardless of the country of origin, whereas Mercosur member countries levy higher tariffs, the rate of which varies according to products. After a meeting with Mercosur foreign ministers in Belem, Minister Figueroa announced on 5 June that Chile will join Mercosur as an associate rather than full member. He nonetheless did not rule out the possibility of his country joining Mercosur in the future. Chile is one of the Latin American countries with the highest growth rate and the largest volume of foreign trade. It is the only country in the region that has not joined any integration movements in South America like Mercosur, the Andean Group, and the Amazon Pact. Figueroa said this decision will not produce changes in the negotiations his country is undertaking with the United States, the main partner of NAFTA, which also comprises Canada and Mexico. The foreign minister added that the Treaty of Asuncion allows "any country" that does not belong to other economic blocs "to join" Mercosur. Mercosur was established in March 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. These countries had invited Chile to join Mercosur since its inception but to no avail. At that time, Chilean authorities contended that they would rather not join this integration movement since Chile's import duties were lower than those of its neighbors.
