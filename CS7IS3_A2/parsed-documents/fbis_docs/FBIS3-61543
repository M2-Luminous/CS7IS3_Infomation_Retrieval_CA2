Tsiolkovskiy, turns 60 years old. The editorial board of NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA joins in the numerous congratulations that are being addressed to the celebrator. At present Moldova, like all the former Soviet republics, as well as the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, is going through the difficult, excruciating period of the transition from one socioeconomic state to another, from a totalitarian regime and a centralized economy to a democratic society and a market economy. This period has proved to be very complicated, with a large number of most urgent problems of the most diverse nature, with a sharp production slump and crises not only in the economy, but also in all other spheres of social life. Now a task of vital importance is to find means of getting out of the present situation, the task of establishing a rule-of-law state with a normally operating economy. All structures of society, including, of course, science, are interested and should take part in its accomplishment. In the modern dynamic world further progress is altogether inconceivable without science. It should provide answers to all urgent problems and, what is more, should foresee and predict the emergence of new problems and the means of their optimal solution. Our scientists are working in such vitally important areas as economics, ecology, interethnic relations, the restoration of the historical truth of our past, the observance of the principles of social justice, and the raising of the prestige of human values. The same, at any rate no less, attention is also being devoted to other directions of academic science. We see in precisely this the role of scientists of the republic at the present stage of its historical development. The Academy of Sciences of Moldova at present is the leading scientific center of the republic. About 1,300 associates, including 140 doctors of sciences and 770 candidates of sciences, are now working in its 25 subdivisions. At the scientific institutions of the Academy research is being conducted on urgent problems of physics and mathematics, engineering, geology and seismology, chemistry, biology, agriculture, geography, medicine, economics, history, language, literature, ethnography, the culture of Moldova, and so on. Our applied research and development are aimed at the solution of the most urgent problems in the area of ecology, agriculture, and power engineering and at the development of new materials and technologies. Of the most important developments in recent years, which are of directly practical importance, it is possible to name an advanced technology of the cultivation of alfalfa, flow charts of the obtaining of two or three crops a year from the same area, technologies of the production of various biological preparations for the protection of plants, a whole-milk substitute for the feeding of calves, a technology and equipment for the electrospark machining of metals, a set of equipment for the electric refining of vegetable oils, Plazmoliz equipment and technology, a technology of the production of aromatizers from the waste products of the essential oil industry, multicomponent materials for optoelectronics and microelectronics, a technology of the production of synthetic wollastonite, various preparations for medicine, and much more. In recent years at the Academy of Sciences of Moldova important steps have been taken to bring science in line with the new tasks facing the republic. A new concept of the development of science was adopted. A detailed analysis of the basic directions of research was made. The organizational structure of the Academy was improved. The Government of the republic approved its new charter. The international ties of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova were expanded substantially. I want to direct attention to one (among many others) important change in the structure of the activity of the Academy, which, we hope, in the future will have a substantial influence on the functioning of all science of the republic. At the end of last year and the beginning of this year three new departments of sciences--the agrarian, technical, and medical departments--were established at the Academy. They are called upon to fill the gaps, which existed until now, in the degree of coverage by the Academy of those fields of knowledge, which until now had practically no ties with it. As a result the research, which was being conducted at sectorial institutes and higher educational institutions, was not coordinated at the proper level on the scale of the republic, which decreased the significance of the contribution being made by science to the national economy of the republic. At present the coordination of the directions and themes of science in the republic is one of the main tasks of our science. A few years ago such coordination existed, although it was carried out mainly from the union center and to a significant extent was formal. After the collapse of the Soviet Union this coordination also disappeared, although its need in principle is obvious. Precisely for these reasons we believe that the building up of the Academy with the three indicated departments of sciences is called upon first of all to change the state of affairs in this area and to promote the orientation of our entire scientific potential toward the comprehensive and coordinated solution of the most urgent problems of the republic. At the present stage of civilization science, as an explorer and builder of the future and as an extremely integrated result of creative activity, cannot develop in isolation. It has become an area of joint activity with common results for all mankind. In other words, science is profoundly international and can develop only in case of constant contacts among the scientists of different countries and only through the constant sharing of ideas, opinions, results, and experience. Our Academy of Sciences already has considerable experience in international ties. However, until the proclamation of the independence of the republic the ties were confined for the most part just to the former union republics and were in many respects of an episodic nature, with the exception, perhaps, of Ukraine and Belarus, with whose scientists we cooperated more intensively, and this cooperation is continuing. In practice we did not have direct ties not just with capitalist countries, but even with the countries of the former Soviet bloc. While the few ones that were maintained were carried out only with the permission of the All-Union Academy or with its aid. The situation changed after 1990, when the real opportunity appeared to establish direct scientific ties with any countries of the world, including in the form of contracts and agreements, including the elaboration of joint themes, the establishment of international laboratories, and so on. In 1992 alone we concluded a new agreement with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Athens National Polytechnical University and agreed on joint scientific research with scientists of Poland. Steps were taken toward cooperation with scientific centers of Italy, Sweden, Great Britain, France, Germany, China, India, and Turkey. Our traditional ties with the former Soviet republics are also not being severed. In the same 1992 our Academy of Sciences participated in an international meeting of academies of Great Europe in Stockholm, at which there was an interested discussion on the means of developing cooperation, on the exchange of information and specialists, and on the participation of the academies in the joint elaboration of global problems in such areas as ecology, airspace, and health care. I want to note that at the academies of the countries of Western Europe they are greatly alarmed by the formed situation in science and, in particular, in academic science in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In connection with this the conference participants came forth with an appeal to governments and international organizations to support science in every way in the countries of the former Soviet bloc. This year our Academy has already taken part in the international conference "Scientific Policy in the Service of Great Europe," which was held in Germany. Here the Academy of Sciences of Moldova was recommended for membership in the Association of the European Community for the Support of Science in Eastern Europe. Last September we became cofounders of the International Association of Academies of Sciences--a nongovernmental self-administered organization that was established for the combining of the efforts of scientists of the sovereign states, which have been newly established on the basis of the former republics of the USSR, and other countries in the solution of the most general scientific problems, for the coordination of scientific strategy, for the support of the most promising research, and for the joint use of unique and expensive equipment. The holding in July of this year in Chisinau of the 18th Congress of the American-Romanian Academy, in the organization of which we took a direct part, is evidence of the increased international authority of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova. In recent years our ties with scientists of neighboring Romania have been developing particularly fruitfully. At present all the institutes of our Academy are cooperating with Romanian scientific centers, research is being conducted on more than 60 themes. Thus, at the Academy of Sciences of Moldova the same reorganizational processes are taking place as throughout the republic. We have already achieved much, but much still has to be done so that science would become a more significant support in the accomplishment of the tasks facing the country. At the same time I cannot but direct attention to the difficult conditions, under which we have to work, and to the problems with which we are faced. First of all I want to indicate the continuing lack of receptivity of the national economy to the achievements of science--an unheard of phenomenon in developed countries. Here the orders of the national economy for scientific research and development have decreased sharply. Whereas in 1985 the amounts paid to our account from the fulfillment of economic contracts came to about a third of the entire amount of financing of the Academy, in 1992 they came to only 7 percent and are continuing to decrease. Today we can offer for introduction more than 60 scientific developments. However, in spite of all our efforts, they are not being taken. The lack of interest in the results of the activity of scientists and, consequently, the decrease of economic contracts are sharply aggravating the financial support of science, which today is based in practice only on budget financing. We know the difficult financial situation of the republic and understand that Parliament and the Government can allocate for us only very modest funds. Moreover, they are unstable, their real significance is steadily decreasing. The budget allocations for science in our republic in their real significance decreased from 37.6 million rubles in 1990 to 15.6 million rubles in 1992, that is, to less than half, although in nominal terms they increased substantially. For comparison let us note: Last year the allocations for science in Moldova came to only 0.45 percent of the national income of the republic, while, for example, in Germany back in 1989 such allocations came to 2.8 percent of the national income. Due to financial difficulties first of all the research process is suffering, inasmuch as we cannot acquire the necessary hardware, equipment, chemicals, and other materials. Due to the lack of assets, especially currency, it is becoming more and more difficult to support international scientific ties, especially trips of our scientists abroad. And I cannot but agree with the president of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, who stated that at present a real economic "iron curtain" has arisen before scientists of the former union republics. Inadequate financing, the lack of housing, the general uncertainty as to the future of science, and, in connection with this, the decline of the prestige of science as a sphere of activity, particularly for talented young people, have given rise in recent years to another problem--the problem of personnel. Scientists are abandoning science, are leaving for other spheres of activity, and are going to other countries. Last year 80 associates from the Academy of Sciences alone left the republic, of them two were corresponding members of the Academy, six were doctors of sciences, and 31 were candidates of sciences. This year only 72 people, who wish to devote themselves to science, were admitted to graduate studies of the Academy. It is possible to continue the list of today's problems of science, including academic science. However, scientists fully realize that their very own efforts are required for the return to science of its role as the motive force of progress. Today the basic task of academic science is to correctly direct its attention to the solution of the most urgent problems facing the republic, to the strengthening of the ties with sectorial and VUZ science, and to the expansion of international cooperation. The main thing is not to lose the achieved potential and scientific personnel.
