In the critical period of efforts to accelerate the reform of the financial system so as to meet the demands of the construction of a system of socialist market economy, the vigorous promoting of the construction of socialist spiritual civilization in the financial sector, especially the enhancement of the construction of banks' professional ethics, the strengthening of the cohesiveness of the ranks of financial workers, the encouragement of the valuable spirit of hard pioneering work, selfless sacrifice, and honesty and self-discipline, and further establishing banks' good image, is of great significance for accomplishing the difficult but glorious task given by the state to the financial sector. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly emphasized that in the course of reform and opening up, it is absolutely necessary to persist in fighting corruption for a long time. Banks are special enterprises which engage in the business of money, and the main channels through which enterprises get funds. Under the current situation where legal supervision and internal constraining mechanisms are not fully developed, corruption is also prone to happen and spread in the financial sector. The big and major embezzlement and bribe-taking cases revealed recently by the news media have sounded the alarm for the people: Fighting corruption and promoting honesty in the financial sector are a difficult and long-term task in the course of reform and opening up. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out, clean government construction depends first on education and second, on the legal system. Focusing on prevention through doing a good job of carrying out education on banks' professional ethics in an expeditious manner so as to improve the overall quality of financial personnel is of especially critical importance. The existence of a good habit of observing professional ethics and a strong sense of professional ethics not only affects a person's code of conduct, but is also the precondition for establishing banks' good image and improving their reputation. Currently we must carry out further efforts to establish banks' good image in society and improve banks' reputation. Banks' reputation is the basis for banks' survival, and the most important way to improve banks' reputation is to enhance banks' self-construction so as to win the trust of enterprises at large and the social public. We must proceed with the enhancement of the construction of banks' professional ethics by doing three things: First, advocate devotion to one's duties, trustworthiness, self-discipline and self-respect, diligence, and being responsible; establish the idea of collectivism; heighten the sense of responsibility and sense of mission on the part of cadres and workers; and overcome the tendency to be passive. Second, advocate doing hard and pioneering work, acting in accordance with the public interest and being honest, refraining from the pursuit of personal interests, and making selfless sacrifices; establish the idea of serving the people whole-heartedly; raise cadres' and workers' conscientiousness in being honest and exercising self-discipline; restore banks' "three iron things" (iron funds, iron accounts, and an iron abacus) reputation; and resist the corruptive and corrosive effects of money worship, hedonism, and ultraselfishness; and third, promote the sense of competition and sense of efficiency entailing an eagerness to carry out reform, explorations, and creative work; and raise cadres' and workers' enthusiasm for financial reform. As should be pointed out, in the course of reform and opening up in the past 15 years, most financial institutions have adhered to the policy of "doing two jobs" and "being tough on two fronts," and given emphasis to enhancing the work of educating employees on ideological and political matters and on professional ethics. Most financial workers are honest, have self-discipline, are devoted to their duties, work hard, and provide friendly service, thereby making contributions to the efforts to manage well the financial work, to promote the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, and to reform the financial system. In February this year, three grass-roots financial units and one employee were gloriously named learning from Lei Feng advanced groups and one individual, by four organizations including the CPC Central Propaganda Department and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League; in March 33 units and 39 comrades of the financial system were gloriously named "advanced groups in activities of learning from Lei Feng" and "advanced individuals in activities of learning from Lei Feng" respectively by the People's Bank of China and the Chinese Union of Financial Workers; of the 119 "advanced individuals of the nation who have acted bravely for a just cause" commended jointly by the CPC Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Public Security in August, 13 were workers on the financial front; eight comrades of the financial system were gloriously named "March Eighth red flag holders of the nation" by the All-China Women's Federation... These advanced groups and individuals who have been commended only constitute a small proportion of the advanced models in the financial system. Over the several years, in addition to "financial guards" of the "Er Lan type" who fought bad elements bravely in order to protect the state's and people's property from being lost when bad elements were robbing banks, the financial sector has also seen many comrades who, working in the front line of financial work, are silently making selfless sacrifices; models of resisting corruption, remaining always uncorrupted, and honesty and self-discipline; and advanced groups and individuals who are engaged in hard pioneering work, who make vigorous efforts to produce improvements, who are eager to carry out reform, and who conduct bold explorations. Even amidst the disorder regarding financial discipline in the previous period, there also emerged a large number of advanced models who remained sober-minded, who refused to engage in inter-bank lending in violation of regulations, who did not use credit funds for trading in real estate and stocks, and who did a good job of managing well funds, the employees, and themselves. They are models for us in the financial system and the elite elements of our financial system. The current task facing us with regard to financial work is very difficult and heavy. The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Issues Relating to the Establishment of a System of Socialist Market Economy points out that large steps will be taken to reform the fiscal and taxation, financial, investment, and planning systems in a coordinated manner. Doing a good job of carrying out the reform of the financial system requires a united and stable team of financial cadres and employees who have a high fighting spirit and high morale, and calls for the creation of an atmosphere conducive to vigorous efforts to make improvements, to energetic efforts to pursue lofty goals, and to bold explorations. Therefore, in conjunction with implementing the spirit of the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the National Economic Work Conference, with studying the third volume of Deng Xiaoping Wenxuan (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping) and the work of fighting corruption and promoting clean government, with enhancing ideological and political work and professional ethics education, and with implementing the spirit of the recently held conference of presidents of branches of the People's Bank nationwide and based on consideration of the actual situation of financial work, the financial system should publicize the national advanced models in a big way, so that everyone has examples to emulate and target entities to catch up with. Through utilizing the power of examples, promote the activities of learning from the advanced and of competing in making contributions in the entire system, so as to stimulate the fighting spirit, inspire people, heighten morale, enhance the cohesiveness and centripetal tendency of the financial system as a whole, and promote further establishing banks' good image, thereby making the construction of socialist spiritual civilization in the financial system reach a new level.
