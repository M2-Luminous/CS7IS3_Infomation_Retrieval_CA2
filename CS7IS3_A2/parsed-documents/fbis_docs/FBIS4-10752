However, Carlos Lage [Cuban Council of Ministers Executive Committee secretary] told GRANMA last November that they were not looking for a new model, as the whole point was to maintain the socialist model. Don't you see a contradiction between these remarks made by two key members of the present political leadership? [Robaina] The way we expressed ourselves might seem contradictory, but deep down we are talking about the same thing. I prefer to explain things publicly rather than look for a label for the model. I do not want to maintain a label that is no longer entirely correct, nor import a label that is not ours. That is why I decided to summarize the model within which we are working -- for anyone who might insist on finding a label for it -- by saying that it is a viable Cuban economic model where many things can be modified, where there is room for other things, and where the essence of many things is maintained. Those are the things Lage defends, with all clarity. About the modifications, I expressed myself in one way, and Lage in another. But it is clear that we are not talking about a model that is identical to the one we had before, because substantial differences already exist. [Urruzola] You are part of the generation of Cubans who were educated under the principle that "Cuba belongs to the Cubans," even if they make mistakes. That is changing today. You accepted opening a space for foreign capital in the country's economy. At some time you will have to deal with that capital's interference in the decisionmaking process. When I was in Cuba I perceived that the people had certain difficulties in accepting that. [Robaina] Only "certain difficulties?" Cubans have a lot of difficulties understanding that. But the success of what we defend depends not so much on the resemblance of what we are doing with what we supported in other circumstances, than on our capacity to adapt ourselves to the moment in which we are living. In the same way I was educated in that concept you mentioned, I was also educated to adapt to new times. In this process of adaptation the point is to know to what extent Cuba continues belonging to Cubans under the new rules of the game. We cannot continue to stagnate. But I would be lying if I said that the process is clearly or easily understood. It is a very complex and tough process, even for the new generations, as they were educated based on a series of tenets that are today in one way or another being adjusted. We need to do a lot of persuading and convincing. [Urruzola] What do you mean when you talk about "what we defend" or "the essence?" [Robaina] For us the essence is sovereignty, independence, to be able to speak with one's own voice, and not wait for someone to signal to us what we must do when there is something in the world we must speak about. We do not want the infant mortality rate to rise, or life expectancy to drop. We do not want to need money, support, or relatives' help to act professionally. We do not want to stop doing our best in the Olympic Games. We want to continue to develop our scientific world. For us the essence is not disturbed if we accept mixed associations in our economic model, or liberalize work, or let one work on one's own, or hand the land to peasants for their use for an indefinite period, or reorganize the state administrative apparatus. [Urruzola] Nevertheless, with the new economic situation in Cuba, scientists, university students and professors, and intellectuals have been particularly harmed. Given their relationship with government organizations, they are still earning 300 pesos, which is equivalent to $3. At the workers congress of the National Research Center I heard scientific researchers saying: "They are forcing us to do things that we do not want to do." Is it not a serious risk that precisely that sector which must find a solution to the country's problems is in such a situation? [Robaina] My country is a country of many risks. We nevertheless prefer to run these risks instead of running a more serious risk: that of not facing life, and believing that problems will be resolved in some other way. Cubans do not sit back and do nothing. Cuba believes that, under circumstances such as these, it is actually through the discussion of all the issues by workers' congresses that the wise voice of the people, which will convey to our country's leadership the need to introduce new transformations, will be raised. These transformations, for example, include putting domestic finances on a sound footing so that sectors like that of the scientists will not in some way be harmed after all the contributions they have made to our country. This does not merely involve deregulating the dollar, but also finding compensation mechanisms for the sectors dollars do not reach. This is the challenge. [Urruzola] The state's role in the previous period, that is, when measures to become self-sufficient were not taken, is now strongly criticized on the island. Not everyone believes that the current situation has arisen solely from the downfall of Eastern Europe and the U.S. blockade -- about which there is also discussion of its real economic impact -- but people talk about "squandering" and "irresponsibility." Has your country's leadership been unable to devise alternative economic policies? [Robaina] We have openly done a self-examination on this issue. In my opinion we were overconfident. For a long time we got used to the existing pipeline and to the mechanisms that guaranteed certain sectors. This led us to believe they were guaranteed for life. We thus neglected, for example, the arable land and the habits that made the population consume or not consume the currently successful crops. It is a very serious responsibility that we are taking on as a state. When we began to change, we believed that we would have more time, but we were overwhelmed by an extremely tough situation in a period of time much shorter than had been envisioned. This is one of our dilemmas today: to what extent the state must remain in those areas in which it has demonstrated efficiency, and what the priorities for change might be in those areas in which it has not. I believe the phenomenon of mechanically transferring mistakes or copying models is very clear. Therefore, with both calmness and alacrity, we must avoid running into the same stumbling block. Everywhere there are positive and negative experiences, but we cannot -- again -- mechanically transfer policies from others. I share the opinion of those who must have told you that for some time the state implemented measures that led us into stagnation. I am also among those who believe that, even though the blockade represents the greatest problem in coping with the current situation, there are also problems that do not depend on the U.S. blockade. There is a second blockade that life has imposed on us. And there is a third blockade that involves us, that depends on our mistakes, our bureaucracy, and our inability to resolve some issues. There are many things on our shoulders, but all depends on what we are able to do. Our country cannot remain waiting for the blockade to be lifted. We must constantly condemn it, and sooner or later it will be lifted, but we cannot wait, sitting back and doing nothing. Undoubtedly we had to learn things in a tense and very difficult situation. Had we done these things before, the country would not be experiencing the current economic situation. [Urruzola] Until recently you headed the Union of Young Communists. You must therefore be well acquainted with young people. Apparently, most of those who are 20 years old dream of leaving Cuba. Those who are 30 years old hope to be free to leave and enter Cuba, a freedom they do not have nowadays because of laws or regulations that have existed for many years. Isn't this at odds with the current situation? [Robaina] The situation is, first, not only no longer the same as that which prevailed many years ago, but it is also no longer that which prevailed a few months ago, either. The ability to enter or leave our country currently does not depend on Cuba's having more or fewer regulations. For the first time Cuba is now under the same conditions as the rest of the world, and the people's only limitation -- which is serious, essential, and very complex -- is the lack of money or foreign currency. [Urruzola] University graduates, for example, say they require the education minister's authorization to go abroad. [Robaina] Incidentally, I was going to discuss the issue of professionals. As in any country in the world, some people are subject to regulatory processes, not for traveling, but for certain proceedings that are required depending on their task. As never before, we have become more flexible concerning age limits, proceedings, and paperwork. Even though this issue has not been entirely resolved, I assure you it will be resolved soon, because it will be one of the points for discussion during a conference on emigration scheduled for 22-24 April. Many of these migration issues were proper for a time that has definitely been overcome. In the past, people eagerly sought travel. Now there is a process that will be increasing as regulations are removed. In this process, people will discover their own ways. Nowadays many talk about leaving because they have not experienced what is felt when one leaves. Nevertheless, it has become normal for people to leave and return, even with unexpected frequency. Some people believed hundreds of people were going to remain abroad. Actually there are hundreds of people who returned with their own conclusions. We are experiencing a normalization process, not only for those who are inside and want to leave, but also for those who are outside and want to enter. [Urruzola] For many years the issue of Cuban exiles has been marked by politics. In other words, those who were leaving were "worms," or leaving was tantamount to betrayal. This caused an entire generation, your generation, to grow up harshly criticizing their fellow countrymen living abroad. All of a sudden this does not apply, and the people are told that the Cubans living abroad, save those who are engaged in "hysterical politics" as you have described it, have a right to become concerned about your country's destiny. This represents a very drastic change. [Robaina] I do not believe it is all of a sudden. We are talking about 30-odd years, and there are precedents for this new period. It is not the first time that our country has maintained a relationship with Cubans abroad. And changes are taking place not only within our country, but also outside. Now the Cubans who are living in other countries are not characterized by the historical attitude of those who, committed to politics, claimed for themselves the total and absolute representation of the Cuban community abroad. Part of this community has remained silent for many years, fearing harassment, but now it is no longer silent, and the hysterical people are actually concerned. My country requires people from outside to become familiar with our internal situation, and the people inside need to become familiar with the outside situation. I believe our country needs to understand that today we have two paths: Either we hold out our hand and control the Cuba-emigration connection as does any country in the world, in a normal and civilized relationship, or that large mass of people will remain instrumental to policies hostile to our country. This must be understood, and overstatements must be avoided. If they were called worms at a given time, it was proper in a given situation. It is also not necessary to cry repentance because, as I have already said, it actually is important to be abreast of the new times and stick to essentials. And it is essential for this relationship to be normal and fluid. There is a limit to this: All those who left our country do not have a right to tell us, those of us who remained in our country, what to do. These are the rules of the game that my country imposes today for talks and rapprochement. It would not be true to tell you that everyone understands this. And I believe in the people who harbor doubts. I believe they are more sincere and more authentic. And I am willing to talk and discuss things with these people. [Urruzola] According to Cuba's current legislation, the foreign capital that is eligible to invest in Cuba is that belonging to companies or individuals residing abroad. Does this mean that Cubans living abroad will be able to invest in their country? [Robaina] This is a very serious problem. From a legal standpoint Cuba cannot embark on a foreign investment drive saying that "everybody except Cubans who have left the country are eligible to invest here." No country in the world would tolerate or understand this. The problem lies in the fact that the country in which they want to invest is a country they have left, and there are wounds that have not yet healed. In my view, we have to build a climate of trust through foreign investment in general, because there are many Cubans who are not yet convinced that the country needs foreign investments, and still less that those who left Cuba should be allowed to invest here. The country has just implemented an opening drive. There is therefore no need to give precedence to Cubans residing abroad, but by the same token we cannot say that they are the only ones who are not eligible to invest in our country. The challenge that we now face is to try to find a happy medium, something that is indeed quite difficult for us Cubans. [Urruzola] There will come a moment when, of necessity, Cubans living abroad will invest in Cuba. [Robaina] Precisely. [Urruzola] Will this fact lead to the question: "And why not Cubans who live on the island?" [Robaina] That will be at a later stage. It is obvious that we cannot limit ourselves to the Cubans that went into exile, as this would entail other problems. Scientists will contend that they, who stayed behind to do research and were thus unable to amass a fortune, are not allowed to invest in their country, while others who made money through other means are allowed to do so. These are unavoidable risks; and as you see, they cannot be solved overnight. [Urruzola] I was told in Cuba that of every 10 youngsters who reach the age limit for affiliation with the UJC [Young Communists Union], approximately nine do not want to join the party. At a university, faculty members even told me that they were having trouble having students elect class delegates, because youngsters did not want to be elected. Have Cuban youngsters gotten tired of politics? [Robaina] One needs a lot of background information to make that judgment, and I personally do not share that view. During their first years at school, just to cite the example you brought up, students always ask themselves whether or not they should take on political responsibilities incident to the life of young university students, which is something very complex. I can assure you that the UJC registered an all-time growth in 1993 -- 100,000 youngsters affiliated with it. [Urruzola] There are those who contend that party affiliation used to be selective in the past, whereas now there is mass affiliation. [Robaina] No, there is no mass affiliation at any level. The selection criteria are even more strict, as affiliation is no longer dependent on the request made by a youngster to join the party, as was the case for some time, but rather on the decision to accept or reject this request made at a board meeting. Yet the underlying subject concerning the UJC is that it should not only devote itself to working with militants, but rather extend its wings to target the mass audience. Furthermore, party affiliation by youngsters has always had its ups and downs, in every place and every province, and even according to the work of the party itself. Many times the UJC is blamed for this. And yet things do not always depend on the UJC, but also on the party in general and the party in particular, and on the body the youngsters are to join. I believe the greatest exchange of ideas undoubtedly continues to be among the young. Even though throughout the world signs of apathy can be seen most clearly among the young, things are different in Cuba, as there are a great number of youngsters involved in economic, political, scientific, and social pursuits. And yet to contend that the change the country is undergoing has had no repercussions would be to deny something that has been traumatic, for example, for my generation. The most important challenge that the UJC faces at present is to come to grips with a process involving 5.7 million Cubans who are under 30. What my parents considered sacred conquests, to be defended until death, are nothing novel to any of us as this was already in place when we were born. Moreover, the young do not like to be constantly reminded that they never lived under capitalism, because they are not to blame for that. One cannot establish dialogue or the rules of the game on the basis of these codes. I do believe, however, that the key to success is that they feel they are participants in and masters of their pursuits; otherwise they will not defend them. [Urruzola] Do you feel you are participating today? [Robaina] I think young people are participating. I am not saying an overwhelming majority of them; nor do I believe in the concept of unanimity. I believe in the thousands of young people who participate in the country's development, although I also know that many young people feel disillusioned with our project, for family, social, or political reasons, or due to foreign influences. Or better said, they do not feel enthusiasm for our project, but feel attracted by the siren songs emanating from abroad. When the blockade is lifted it will not only be medicines and food that Cuba will receive. The country and the new generations will have to face much tougher decisions than the ones we are facing today. The discussion will be at the level of values, ideas, and lifestyle. The enemy is not as clearly perceived as before, which is complex and difficult to understand for young people. I think what Cuban young people need most today is to learn about young people in the rest of the world, and how they live. Their biggest problem is that they do not value what they have today. This attitude is also due to an excessive paternalism developed over a long period of time. [Urruzola] When I visited Cuba I did not feel that Cubans were really concerned about the issue of a multiparty system. What seems important is the separation of the state from the party, the revaluation of civilian society and the role of citizens. Cubans seem to want the party reduced to a more specific role. They seem to want the party out of numerous areas where its opinion and decisions are not necessary. Is this so? [Robaina] I am glad you have perceived both feelings, particularly the one referring to the multiparty system, which is not a priority in my country. The world has taught us that like it or not, accept it or not, the single party system in my country, in practice, has resolved more situations that the multiparty system in other countries. It is a very typical Cuban solution. We implemented it because of a threat that has not yet disappeared. The interest in setting limits on state and party responsibilities is not only society's concern. The party itself is concerned about the problem. The issue was discussed at length in recent meetings. When the party started administering the country, it neglected more appropriate political tasks. Besides, it was not prepared to administer, and did not do a good job. We realize that clearly. The important thing today is to determine what party role we should strengthen, which roles are appropriate, and how to strengthen the state and the government, also through their own particular roles. That means we must strengthen state power structures and establish state jurisdictions which for a long time were very much superimposed. This situation made it very difficult to know who was responsible for what. In this sense we started walking down a certain path. But there are more things that we must still do than things we have already done. [Urruzola] On that path there has already begun to appear something that will probably increase with time: the Cuba of differences. Differences of possibilities, opportunities, and dollars. This is seemingly provoking an irreversible deterioration in the ethical values on which the revolution was built. Does the country leadership perceive it that way? [Robaina] That is part of the inevitable risk. We know that it will be worse if we do not face reality. I think you are correct. Today we live a world of differences. But I think it is also necessary to make clear that it was much more serious when those differences existed in an illegal world. The elimination of penalties for holding dollars did not create differences, it only brought to light things that already existed. The options we had were either to ignore that reality, or to face it and seek mechanisms to compensate for it. We sought mechanisms to prevent society from going backwards. We wanted society to continue having a solid base, a structure of extremely rich moral values. That is not easy to implement. Even in the Cuba of differences, there are a lot of examples of solidarity and equality. For instance, when young people working in the area of tourism decide, on their own initiative, to share their incomes with others working in sugar harvesting. Or when someone receives hard currency and purchases staples for himself and his neighbors, or tennis shoes for his children and a friend's children. Cuba is not only a country with differences. It is also a country where people share. But it is true that we are facing an important challenge in the area of values and ethics.
