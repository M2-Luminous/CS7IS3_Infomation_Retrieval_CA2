The plan, manifesting China's medium- and long-term strategy in this sector, will be announced shortly, an official of the Ministry of Coal Industry said today. As the most important primary source of energy in China, coal accounts for more than two-thirds of the country's energy consumption. In 1993 alone, China produced 1.14 billion tons of coal, an increase of 25 million tons over 1992. The output is expected to top 1.16 billion tons this year, the ministry official said. He said 1993 will be the crucial year for the coal industry to complete the shift from a planned economy to a market economy. The government is scheduled to lift all its control over coal prices by the end of this year. In order to be answerable to the market, he said, the major state-owned coal mines will continue to maintain production in line with demand as well as transportation capacity. One of the principal goals of the industry this year will be reducing production costs and improving labor efficiency, he said. This necessitates the optimization of the coal mines. Loss-making mines with no hope of making profits will be shut down, suspended or shifted to other lines of production, while those with quality coal, good market access and high efficiency will step up technological upgrading to increase their production. The product mix and the industrial structure will also be streamlined, the official said, adding that efforts will be made to pursue diversified operations. The locally-run mines will be screened, with emphasis placed on the construction of 100 top-priority coal-producing counties and 15 coal-mining areas, the official said. In an effort to speed up the construction of coal mines, the ministry wooed other sectors to invest in the area, in light of the principle of "He benefits who invests." It has already extended a welcome to the industries of electrical power, metallurgy, chemicals and transportation. The ministry is also encouraging coastal regions to invest in coal-rich areas and foreign investors to form joint ventures and cooperative coal mines. China will be active in attracting more foreign funds and introducing advanced equipment, technology and experts as well as management experience from abroad to raise productivity. He said that this year some of the major coal mines will be licensed to handle exports, which stood at 18 million tons in 1993.
