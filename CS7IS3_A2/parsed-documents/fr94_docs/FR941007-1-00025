FR941007-1-00025 FR941007-1-00003 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [IN40&hyph;1&hyph;6342B; FRL&hyph;5067&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of a New Source Review Implementation Plan; Indiana AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The USEPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Indiana to satisfy Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area new source review (NSR) SIP. The USEPA is proposing to approve the recodified version of the Indiana permitting rules to replace those in the existing SIP. The USEPA is also proposing to remove references in the Code of Federal Regulations to the construction ban imposed in Lake and Porter Counties for failure to have an approved ozone plan since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 removed this ban. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the USEPA is approving these actions as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views these as noncontroversial actions and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before November 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulatory Development Section, Regulatory Development Branch (AR18&hyph;J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Copies of the State submittal and USEPA's analysis of it are available for inspection at: Regulatory Development Section, Regulatory Development Branch (AR18&hyph;J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.
