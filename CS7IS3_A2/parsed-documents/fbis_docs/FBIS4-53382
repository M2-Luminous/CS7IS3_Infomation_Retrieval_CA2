Security Council. "The Socialist International supports an increase in the number of permanent members to include Germany and Japan as well as a number of regional representatives, whilst ensuring that the developing world is properly represented," representatives from 63 parties and organizations said in a resolution. The Socialist International (SI) currently comprises 111 political parties and organizations worldwide. Summing up the two-day congress at a news conference the SI president, former French Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy, noted that the Tokyo meeting aimed at listening to the concerns of Asian countries and at strengthening the socialist movement globally. Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and representatives from Bangladesh, Myanmar [Burma], Cambodia, Laos and India were among the special guests at the congress which focused on democracy and social development in the Asia-Pacific region. Mauroy said the SI, given the rapid economic development in the Asia-Pacific, must expand relations with free labor unions to counter the excesses of "wild capitalism" and protect Asian workers from the "great misery" that Europe experienced during the industrialization in the 19th century. Speaking at the same news conference, the former head of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) of Japan, Makoto Tanabe, who is SI vice president, pointed to the congress resolution on Asia, which singles out North Korea as a security risk for its suspected nuclear weapons program. "North Korea, which is defying the demand of the U.N. that it implement comprehensive safeguards measures, can never gain the support of the international community," the resolution said. The SDP has long maintained friendly relations with North Korea. However, Tanabe said, "on these issues we express, of course, our agreement to this resolution." Tanabe called on Pyongyang to allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and on other countries to intensify efforts to dissuade North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.
