To achieve that goal, we must bolster positive trends in the old laender, promote growth in the new laender, and secure the international competitiveness of the German economy. Increasing investment by companies and state investment in the infrastructure is a priority. This is the only way in which new and secure jobs can be created. A new boost in investment assumes that the high level of costs will be reduced and that more room for maneuver will be created for entrepreneurial activity. In the fall of 1993, the government presented an extensive range of measures with its report on securing Germany's future as a center for business. These measures are being rapidly implemented. I need only mention the Law on Facilitating Investment and Land for Housing Construction, the Old Debt Law, the removal of fixed rates in the transportation of goods, the Law on Securing Germany's Future as a Center for Business, and the guaranteeing of training posts in eastern Germany. The action program for more growth and employment has allowed us to make a significant amount of progress. To improve the employment situation, structural problems in the labor market also have to be eliminated. Over a period of many years, especially in times of strong growth and high employment, structures and patterns of conduct developed that are only an obstacle to overcoming the crisis rapidly. The key elements of an employment policy geared toward growth, employment, and competitiveness are a new orientation with respect to policy on collective agreements, higher flexibility in the labor market, as well as the development of effective labor market policy measures. Collective Agreements Are Often Too Rigid The partners to collective wage agreements must find their way back to wages that are justified in market terms and are linked to shortages on the labor market. More consideration must be given to the requirements of the unemployed and weak companies than has been the case so far. The labor market situation requires more sharply differentiated wage settlements based on regions, branches, and qualifications, as well as room for maneuver for individual company solutions and elements based on company earnings. Many collective agreements have come to form too rigid a framework, making it impossible to respond to new demands and market developments in a flexible enough manner. The justified interests of the unemployed should no longer be ignored in negotiations on collective wage agreements. For example, it should be possible for the long-term unemployed to be paid rates below those contained in collective agreements for a limited period of time to facilitate the return of those people to the labor market. There has been some movement in this respect, as the settlement in the chemical industry shows. The policy on collective agreements must also address the fact that there are people seeking employment whose qualifications and ability do not correspond to the requirements of a high-wage economy oriented toward the world market and that they will not be employed for that reason. The high-wage policy in the Federal Republic has led to a high level of unemployment despite there being more than enough work, because there is a low demand for poorly qualified workers who are paid according to collective agreement rates. That is why we need an additional low wage sector. The state, as an employer and collective agreement partner, must also send out the right signals during this year's collective agreement negotiations. That is why the government decided to freeze civil servants' salaries this year. In the new laender, the issue is above all one of extending the period over which incomes will be adjusted to levels in western Germany. This is also an area in which the state must assume a vanguard role. To overcome the employment crisis, it is still necessary to make use of opportunities for employment that have not been exploited to date. We have a great demand for services in private households, for example, in areas such as child care, looking after elderly people, and for part-time jobs. That is why the government intends to make the creation of employment opportunities in private households and of part-time jobs easier. The demand for part-time jobs is much greater than the supply. This is an area in which companies must overcome their often unjustified reservations. In many areas, with some imagination and flexibility, part-time employment would be possible, and it would often benefit companies in the form of higher motivation and productivity as well as lower absenteeism. To assist the move to part-time employment, we will guarantee unemployment insurance benefits for a fixed period of time if employees transfer from full-time to part-time employment. In the public sector, too, the government will issue a clear signal. A readiness to consider new forms of work organization is something that I also hope will emerge from the joint actions of unions, employers, the Federal Office of Employment, and the government, aimed at creating more part-time employment. Private Employment Agencies Additional jobs can also be created if there is more scope for organizational creativity. This applies to policy on collective agreements, on working hours, as well as labor market organizational structures. The government will permit private employment agencies so that competition between private and public employment agencies will balance out the situation in the labor market more quickly and efficiently. This step has been long overdue, because the monopoly enjoyed by the Federal Office of Employment, which might have been justified when it was formed, has not met the demands of a highly technical and highly industrialized economy for a long time now. Employment will be further stimulated by extending the duration of limited employment contracts. Working hours is a very important area in which the German economy and labor market must become more flexible. This is an area in which too many rigid structures, along with constant reductions in working hours, have developed. This applies to daily, weekly, and annual working hours as well the length of working lives. The parties to collective agreements must be serious about flexible working hours, and they must be ready to respond to a much greater extent to individual wishes regarding longer or shorter working hours. There is no general recipe for making working hours more flexible and work organization more productive; various forms of work organization are possible. The government will create a better framework with a new labor law. The law will create more scope for additional work when necessary and work on Saturdays and Sundays. With regard to working lives, we want to and must reverse the trend to retirement at an increasingly earlier age, if only because of Germany's demographic development. A Bridge for Reintegration In times of high unemployment, labor market policy performs an important social function. Further training and retraining, job-creation measures, and wage-cost supplements should assist the return to normal employment. Since German unification, these instruments have been used extensively to cushion structural change. In the meantime, however, we have reached the limits of what is acceptable in terms of budgetary and economic policy. Labor market policy measures have to be financed at the expense of competitive jobs. Germany is already in the lead with regard to wage ancillary costs. In addition, it has emerged that the form that some of these instruments take obscures the way in which in regular jobs differentiate to too great an extent. The government has introduced adjustments that consider both economic and social aspects. Job-creation measures can contribute to easing structural change in the new laender and to cushioning the effects of the recession on disadvantaged groups in the west German labor market. However, it must be clearly seen that this will not lead to the creation of permanent, competitive jobs, but is only a social bridge for reintegration into the first labor market. If such measures are applied extensively for increasingly longer periods of time, there is a growing danger that private companies will experience pressure and be disadvantaged. This is particularly problematic when a medium-sized business is still in the first stages of development. In addition, those employed under such measures begin to harbor illusions that they have normal and permanent jobs. This impression is reinforced when people employed under job-creation measures are largely paid according to collective wage agreement rates. To avoid distorting competition and insufficient motivation to change to regular employment, the government has called on the partners to collective agreements to agree on special wage scales for subsidized jobs in particular. State wage-cost supplements for job-creation measures will be limited to certain wage levels in the future. Funds can then be used to assist more unemployed people. There will also be more incentives to transfer to normal employment. In those regions in the old laender that are particularly affected by structural crises, subsidies for a limited period of time will be introduced under Chapter 259 of the Law on Promoting Employment. This will allow wage benefits to be turned into wage-cost supplements for measures to improve the environment, social services, and the youth assistance programs. Further, an additional offer will go out to the unemployed throughout Germany in the form of community work projects. These will be state subsidized forms of employment for which pay will not be based on collective agreement wage scales. It will more often be the case that unemployed people who voluntarily participate in such schemes will receive a flat rate of compensation. Framework Conditions Have Been Improved Government labor market and employment policy is geared toward facilitating the creation of additional competitive jobs through more flexibility and more room for maneuver as well as reducing regulations and the tax burden. That is because in a world of rapidly changing technology and increasing international competitiveness, only he who responds quickly and flexibly to change will be able to stand his ground. Thus, the government has improved framework conditions through a series of important measures. It is now up to the partners to collective wage agreements, companies, and employees to use this to create more employment.
