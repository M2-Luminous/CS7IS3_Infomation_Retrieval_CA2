Had this situation [the formation of the Kaishin parliamentary group] been created before the election to nominate the prime minister took place, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] would not have voted for Tsutomu Hata and, it follows, there would have been no Hata cabinet. It is nothing but a political betrayal to exclude the SDPJ in such a manner the moment the election to name a new prime minister was over. It is quite understandable that in such circumstances the SDPJ left the administration. When Hata was elected prime minister, there was a flood of mass media reports describing Hata attractively as "sincere," "earnest," "an ordinary person," and "gentle." I wonder, however, if it is possible for us to find anything "attractive" in his unfaithful attitude. I wonder if he will again make (Ichiro) Ozawa, who controls politics from behind the scenes, responsible for all the undesirable situations. When asked about the "dual power structure" in which Ozawa takes the actual lead, Hata replied, "even an actor is allowed to select the scenario." This was an implicit admission that he was merely an actor. However, even if the scenario was written by Ozawa, Hata must be held responsible for choosing it. I wonder to what extent Hata will perform the scenario written by Ozawa. There seems to be no end to Ozawa's program to reorganize the political world until all the existing political parties are dissolved, and the Taisei Yokusankai [Imperial Rule Assistance Association] is built up to carry out the Japan reform plan according to Ozawa's scenario. If Hata is going to participate in such a forcible and unfaithful reorganization of the political world, and is going to take the responsibility for carrying out the Japan reform plan, he should immediately discard his image as "an ordinary person," and instead adopt an image as "a cunning person," or "the follower of a strong man." No matter what kind of a cabinet Hata forms, it is inevitable its life will be short. Though he may intend to prolong the life of his administration by undermining the solidarity of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ, I do not want him to cause further political confusion by so doing. What the people want is the Diet dissolved and a new general election as soon as possible. Japanese politics is apparently facing a historical turning point. The wheel of the history should not be turned merely for the purpose of political disputes in the absence of the people. Now is the time to consult the will of the people. That is the only thing we expect the new cabinet to do.
