The constitutional revision starts with the discussion of and voting on a political agenda which has previously been negotiated with those political parties that promoted the constitutional revision, and which includes a novelty for Brazilian voters: the end of the compulsory vote as of 1995. This means that in the 1996 municipal elections, each citizen will decide whether or not to vote. One of the 15 amendments included in a draft agenda that was issued yesterday by Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party -- Rio Grande do Sul State]), spokesman for the revisionist congress, grants President Itamar Franco, current state governors, and mayors the chance to run for other elective posts in the next elections without having to resign to their current posts by April, as is established in the law. This amendment will be enforced as of the date of its publication. The constitutional revision should end by 15 March, a mere 17 days before the deadline to resign from the posts. With the new deadline state governors will be able to run for the presidency in the next elections, for example, without having to leave their posts until Octover 1994. Executive branch officials who hold elective posts will be allowed to seek reelection for one single term, but this rule will be in force as of 1 January 1995. Therefore, only those elected in 1996 will benefit from this new regulation. Jobim also proposes shortening the presidential term from five to four years. He says: The idea is to grant more continuity to the government. As things stand now, one governs for only two years. During the first two years you learn to govern, while during the last you campaign for the elections. The draft agenda also includes issues that will shake up the lives of legislators. This, according to Jobim, "only shows that Congress is willing to end its ailments." A legislator who leaves the party for which he was elected will lose his mandate, and will not be eligible for election for another two years. Another case of ineligibility includes dishonest handling of public affairs and immoral conduct. This will prevent a person like Paulo Cesar Farias, for example, from being elected. The constitutional revision will hit the executive branch heavily, restricting the possibilities of its submitting provisional measures. The president will be unable to issue provisional measures on the budget or electoral rights, for example. The 16 Proposals Vote: An end to compulsory voting as of 1 January 1995. The spokesman argues that "the Brazilian peopole are mature enough to be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not to vote." Reelection: Executive branch officials who hold elective posts are allowed to seek reelection for one single term, and to do so while still in office. This amendment will be enforced as of January 1995. International rights: It regulates current international regulations between Brazil and other countries. Incompatibility: The president, state governors, and mayors do not need to resign their respective posts to run for other elective posts. Moreover, their relatives are also eligible to run. This measure will be enforced as of the date it is published. Challenging mandates: There will be a 60 day deadline, instead of the current 15 day deadline, for submitting a request to challenge an election after the date it is held. Ineligibility: Those charged with dishonest handling of public affairs and immoral conduct are subject to ineligibility. Termination of term: A legislator who leaves the party for which he was elected loses his mandate, and is ineligible to run for another two years. Presidential term: It will be four instead of five years, with the possibility of seeking one single reelection. Congressional immunity: The Federal Supreme Court (STF) may sue a legislator prior to congressional authorization. The case will be closed only if there is an absolute congressional majority vote in favor. Congressional immunity will encompass the opinions, words, and voting of legislators, and is extended to common crimes. Provisional measures: The issuance of provisional measures is prohibited, and Congress has a 60 day deadline to review it instead of the 30 days it now has. It can only be used in urgent cases. It cannot be used for issues pertaining to complementary laws or for issues of the exclusive competence of Congress or those regarding nationality, citizenship, political or electoral rights, or the budget. Military recruitment: It will continue to be compulsory. A military man with over 10 years of service may run for an elective post without having to join a political party. He only needs to be nominated by the party. Establishment of states: The discussion starts in the local state legislative assembly, which immediately summons a plebiscite. Only then does the national Congress manifest itself. Establishment of municipalities: Will be established in keeping with the population and minimum public income before the holding of a plebiscite. Religious worship: The current text is maintained. Maternity leave: The text establishes that pregnant legislators are entitled to maternity leave. Nationality: It establishes that foreigners' offspring born in Brazil are considered Brazilian citizens. It also establishes that Brazilian citizens who work abroad and who are forced to adopt the nationality of their host country continue to be Brazilian citizens.
