While 26.1 percent would accept higher prices, only 18.5 percent would want to sacrifice their standard of living. Most Czechs feel they "cannot do much for the environment." In the same poll, when asked to name the most important thing, almost half respondents replied that it was "keeping order in the country" (47.5 percent). The next most important issues for the citizens of the Czech Republic were "having a greater say in the decisions of the government" (17.9 percent), protection of the freedom of speech (17.8 percent), and stopping price rises (15.2 percent). The poll included a question on territorial arrangement and local government reform. Some 56.1 percent of respondents said the solution to the problem was important to them, while 43.9 percent said it was not. Twice as many people intending to vote in the forthcoming local elections found the issue important than those not intending to vote. STEM, the Center for Empirical Research, conducted the poll in the last week of November among 972 respondents. People's views on the quality of health care in the first year of the independent Czech Republic were the subject of another STEM poll whose results were released today. Thirty-three percent believe health care has improved, whereas 22 percent think it has worsened. The biggest problem is felt to be under-funding, while the choice of doctors and the behavior of health care staff towards patients were rated the most positively. Only 40 percent of those asked regarded themselves as healthy, the others citing minor or major complaints. However, 58 percent felt they were healthier than most of their peers. The poll also revealed that almost half Czechs use the services of private practices. STEM asked 1,400 people in the first week of December.
