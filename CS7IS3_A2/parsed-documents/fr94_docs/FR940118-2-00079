FR940118-2-00079 FR940118-2-00050 The Employer and sponsor of the Plan is an Iowa corporation, with offices in Harlan, Iowa. The Employer is engaged in the manufacture of mill supplies and trencher parts. Todd Plumb is the sole shareholder of the common stock of the Employer. Since 1990, Todd Plumb has served as the sole trustee for the Plan. Prior to that time, the trustees of the Plan were the Southgate Trust Company, Todd Plumb, and Max Plumb. Further, the GICs were held on behalf of the Plan in the past by Southgate Trust and are now held by First Trust MidAmerica. Norwest Bank Iowa, N.A., located in Des Moines, Iowa is currently acting as administrator of the Plan and will assume the duties of trustee of the Plan, as soon as this proposed exemption is granted. 2. It is represented that since 1983, the Plan held participation interests in a fund which provided debt financing to a series of separate trusts (the Trusts) which engaged in commercial real estate development. In addition, since 1984, the Plan also held equity participation interests in such Trusts. In October 1985, all of the Trusts were merged into the Master Mortgage Fund Trust VII in which the Plan retained ownership interests. Subsequently, on December 15, 1988, Master Mortgage Fund Trust VII was converted into a Master Mortgage Investment Fund, Inc., a real estate investment trust (the REIT). The Plan acquired the Assets through certain transfers of the Plan's holdings in Master Mortgage Fund Trust VII to the REIT. 3 3 The Department notes that the decisions of the fiduciaries on behalf of the Plan, in connection with the acquisition and holding of the Assets are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of part 4, subpart B, of title I. The Department expresses no opinion, herein, as to whether any of the relevant provisions of part 4, subpart B, of title I have been violated regarding the Plan's investment in and subsequent holding of the Assets, and no exemption from such provisions is proposed herein. In this regard, the Department is expressing no views with respect to the establishment, administration, or operation of the REIT, nor has any relief been requested in that regard. 3. The Assets which are the subject of this proposed exemption consist of the Plan's holdings of participation interests in three funds (the Funds). One of the Funds holds the Preferred Stock of the REIT (the Preferred Fund), another holds Common Stock of the REIT (the Common Fund), and the third fund (the Secured Note I Fund; formerly the Guaranteed Plus Fund) holds notes of the REIT collateralized by mortgages. The REIT, a Delaware corporation, has offices in Overland Park, Kansas. The investors in the REIT include the Plan and other qualified retirement plans. The REIT was organized for the primary purpose of realizing income from investing in and originating short-term loans, junior real estate mortgage loans, wrap around mortgage loans, first mortgage loans with and without participation features, construction loans and pre-development loans to real estate developers, secured by income producing real property. The REIT completed its initial one-year public offering on November 18, 1989, selling a total of 2,756,474 shares of preferred stock (the Preferred Stock) and 841,542 shares of common stock (the Common Stock) for subscriptions in the amount of $35,980,160. As of December 31, 1990, the REIT had 2,491,522 shares of Preferred Stock and 1,308,669 shares of Common Stock outstanding. It is represented that the change in outstanding stock of the REIT reflects shares issued under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the conversion of Preferred Stock to Common Stock. 4. It is represented that between 1984 and 1990, the rate of return received by the Plan on its interest in these Assets or in the Trusts fluctuated from a high of 15.8% in 1984 to a low of 5.8% in 1990. During the period between 1983 to 1991, the percentage of the Plan's portfolio involved with these Assets or with the Trusts varied from a low of 8.66% in 1983, to a high of 63% in October 1991. Through its investment in the Preferred Fund, the Plan owns approximately 43,848 shares of Preferred Stock of the REIT, as of December 31, 1992. Likewise, through its investment in the Common Fund, the Plan owns approximately 211 shares of Common Stock of the REIT, as of the same date. 5. The Secured Note I Fund was established on January 31, 1988, by Master Mortgage Fund Trust VII for the purpose of providing secured debt financing to the related Trusts. After the REIT was established in 1989, the Secured Note I Fund offered a $10,000,000 line of credit to the REIT. Under this line of credit, as of December 31, 1990, the Secured Note I Fund had extended $8,344,522 to the REIT, payable on January 31, 1991. Due to the inability of the REIT to repay this debt on January 31, 1991, the Secured Note I Fund again extended credit to the REIT, in the form of two notes (the Notes) in the amounts, respectively, of $1,677,044 and $6,805,340 and extended the date of repayment under the terms of these Notes to January 310, 1992, which in turn was extended to January 31, 1993. It is represented that as of September 7, 1993, the Notes had not been repaid. The Notes bear interest at nine percent (9%) per annum adjusted from time to time in accordance with certain interest rates charged by the Merchants Bank of Kansas City and are collateralized by the assets of the REIT, primarily mortgages which are subordinated to unrelated third party notes. The total outstanding balance of these Notes, as of September 30, 1991, was $8,862,016. The Plan acquired a participation interest in the Secured Note I Fund as a result of a transfer of funds from the Master Mortgage Fund VII at the end of 1989, and another such transfer from the Preferred Fund at the beginning of 1990. 6. On April 17, 1992, the Board of Directors of the REIT unanimously approved the filing by the REIT for financial reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Since that time the REIT has been operating as debtor-in-possession under the protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. On its balance sheet for the period ending December 31, 1992, the REIT lists total assets of $23,321,456 and total liabilities of $18,814,132. 7. The Employer has proposed to purchase the Plan's interests in the Preferred Fund, the Common Fund, and the Secured Note I Fund. It is represented that there is no market for the Assets and that the income potential and the market value of such Assets has declined. Further, Todd Plumb, as trustee for the Plan, has been repeatedly unsuccessful in attempting to sell such Assets to a third party purchaser or in having the Assets redeemed by the REIT. For this reason, the applicant believes it will be in the best interest of the Plan to invest the proceeds of the Asset sales to the Employer in other securities, the return rate of which will significantly exceed the rate of earnings on the Assets. It is represented that, if such Assets were retained in the Plan, there may not be sufficient liquidity in the Plan to pay cash to beneficiaries or to participants withdrawing from the Plan. In this regard, the sales of the Assets to the Employer will avoid an in-kind distribution of an undivided interest in the Assets to the participants and beneficiaries which would have no immediate value and little long term value. The Assets are valued at a book value to the Plan of $683,384, as of June 30, 1993. In accordance with this value, as of September 30, 1993, the Assets represented approximately 44% of the assets of the Plan. The applicant represents that the book value is approximately the amount invested by the Plan in the Assets.
