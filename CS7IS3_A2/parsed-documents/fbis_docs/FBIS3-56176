With reference to his recent meeting with the prime minister he said that they had talked about a specific post, but did not say which post had been offered to him. Earlier Shokhin had told journalists that if he did not retain the post of vice premier he would not consider his work in the government expedient. He noted, however, that at first he would "fight" for a serious post in the State Duma, say the post of a committee chairman. "I would prefer to act in this capacity given the complicated situation in the State Duma," he said. Shokhin refused to comment on the presidential decree on Cabinet reorganization, saying that he would not like to criticize the decree. He said, though, that if he had been given an opportunity to take part in drafting this document, "some of its provisions would have looked much better". Next week, appointments to the post of vice premier and other posts are to be announced.
