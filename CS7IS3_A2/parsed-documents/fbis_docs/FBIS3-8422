High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to do everything in its power to prevent the forceful expulsion of Yugoslav citizens from Germany and that their status is determined before that. The permanent Yugoslav mission at the Geneva U.N. headquarters sent a letter to U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata saying that Germany has not officially informed the Yugoslav authorities about its intention for the mass expulsion of Yugoslav citizens -- Serbs, Montenegrins and Albanians, who are being denied refugee status. In question are 200,000 people whose requests for asylum in Germany were rejected, the letter said. It underscored that Yugoslavia will not prevent the return of its citizens who have the correct documents, but warned that those persons who do not fulfill the requirements of the Yugoslav law, will not be able to enter Yugoslav territory. If Germany expels such persons, UNHCR should prepare camps for them in Romania, the letter said. If Germany carries out its threats, UNHCR should also act in Yugoslav territory to prevent the deterioration of the already grave situation regarding the refugees. In Yugoslavia there are some 600,000 registered refugees from the breakaway ex-Yugoslav republics, and estimates are that there are at least 200,000 unregistered refugees living with relatives and friends. Yugoslavia believes that UNHCR should insist that the German authorities strictly respect the 1951 Convention on the protection of refugees, the 1967 Protocol and other relevant international documents, and thus prevent yet another humanitarian catastrophe, the letter said. Bonn's decision to expel Yugoslav citizens is clearly aimed to exert political pressure on Yugoslavia. It is simultaneous with the persecution and arrests of Serbs in Germany on charges of alleged war crimes in ex-Yugoslavia. At the same time, Bosnian Serb military sources claim that Moslem refugees are being rounded up in Germany and dispatched to the Moslem Army in the civil war-torn ex-Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
