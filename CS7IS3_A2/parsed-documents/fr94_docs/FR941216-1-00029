FR941216-1-00029 FR941216-1-00010 The estimated annual burden per respondent/recordkeeper varies from .3 to .5 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of .475 hours. Estimated number of respondents/recordkeepers: 200,000. Estimated annual frequency of responses: 1. Background Section 1275(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) grants the Secretary the authority to prescribe regulations under the original issue discount (OID) provisions of the Code, including regulations relating to debt instruments that provide for contingent payments. On April 8, 1986, the IRS published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (51 FR 12022) relating to debt instruments with OID. Section 1.1275&hyph;4 of the 1986 proposed regulations provided rules for contingent payment debt instruments. On February 28, 1991, the IRS published in the Federal Register a proposed amendment to §1.1275&hyph;4 (56 FR 8308), which would have bifurcated certain contingent payment debt instruments into their component parts (§1.1275&hyph;4(g)). On December 22, 1992, the IRS published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking that substantially revised the 1986 proposed regulations (57 FR 60750), and on February 4, 1994, the IRS published in the Federal Register final OID regulations (59 FR 4799). However, neither the 1992 proposed regulations nor the final OID regulations contained rules for contingent payment debt instruments under §1.1275&hyph;4. The IRS received numerous written comments on §1.1275&hyph;4, as originally proposed in 1986 and as amended in 1991. In addition, on November 17, 1986, the IRS held a public hearing to discuss the 1986 proposed regulations, including §1.1275&hyph;4. Commentators criticized §1.1275&hyph;4 of the 1986 proposed regulations because the regulations ignored the economics of many contingent payment debt instruments. In particular, commentators believed that the 1986 proposed regulations did not reflect the reasonable expectations of the parties because the regulations used a ``wait and see'' approach to the accrual of interest determined by reference to contingencies. The commentators noted that, with respect to certain contingent payment debt instruments, the 1986 proposed regulations resulted in a significant backloading of interest. Commentators also criticized the 1991 proposed amendment to §1.1275&hyph;4. Commentators argued that there is rarely a unique set of components into which a contingent payment debt instrument can be bifurcated. In addition, commentators questioned whether it is appropriate to bifurcate a contingent payment debt instrument because it is often unclear how the contingent components should be taxed. Some commentators suggested that it is preferable to determine interest accruals on a contingent payment debt instrument by assuming that the issue price of the debt instrument will bear a return at the applicable Federal rate (AFR) or some other specified rate. Other commentators suggested that it is preferable to determine interest accruals by constructing a projected payment schedule and accruing on the basis of the projections.
