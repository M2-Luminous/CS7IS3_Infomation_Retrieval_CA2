This is what Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will reiterate tomorrow when he receives separately the top leaders of the trade unions and the employers' organization. His proposal will be very clear: New topics -- the incomes agreement, the social protection model, the occupational health bill, or the reform of pensions -- can be negotiated, but the labor reform will not be touched in anything substantial. In the letter which he sent to trade union leaders Nicolas Redondo and Antonio Gutierrez yesterday, the prime minister reiterates that any change is subject to prior agreement between the employers' organization and the trade unions; a virtually impossible condition, as the Spanish Confederation of Employers Organizations made clear. The trade unions received Gonzalez' message with "disappointment." Jose Maria Zufiaur asserted that it is "political suicide" to seek to disregard the general strike and ignore millions of workers' rejection of the labor reform. The prime minister's letter gives some clues to the government's intentions. It suggests negotiation of an incomes agreement to the trade unions and reminds them that the labor reform is passing through parliament. In addition, Labor Ministry officials are preparing a list of new topics which can begin to be negotiated -- the social protection system, the occupational health bill, or the reform of future pensions. Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office Miguel Gil confirmed to EL PAIS that the labor measures will not be renegotiated, but other matters, which are "certainly important, such as the incomes agreement," can be discussed. On the labor market, Gonzalez refers to accepting "changes consistent with the meaning of the reform which enjoy the agreement of the trade unions and the employers' organization." Time is an adverse factor, because the period for the parliamentary groups to submit their partial amendments to the three bills in hand expires 8 February. Afterward, until their approval in the Senate -- it is estimated that this could be in June -- there is always some chance of introducing changes, although it is certainly more difficult now.
