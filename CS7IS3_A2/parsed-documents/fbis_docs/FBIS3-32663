This reconciliation process prompted an imminent peace meeting. Congress President Juan Jose Rueda said the Law to Prevent and Punish Torture, which the state legislature approved, establishes sentences of one to 12 years imprisonment for committing torture. Governor Javier Lopez Moreno sponsored the measure, which also invalidates confessions made in the absence of a defense lawyer and which is within a framework of pacification measures. These measures include an amnesty for common crimes committed during the conflict. The local congress also approved a pardon of state taxes between January and June of 1994 in the 30 municipalities affected by the conflict, which began on 1 January with the emergence of the armed group the Zapatist National Liberation Army. According to the measure adopted in Tuxtla Gutierrez, which is located 1,100 km southeast of Mexico City, taxpayers of the Lacandona Jungle and the Chiapas Highlands will be exempt from paying taxes on land, income [nomina], and unlisted businesses. Governor Lopez Moreno has decided to reform the penal code following demands made by Indian leaders and farmers in Chiapas who have criticized this document by calling it the most "backward" in the country. A virtual truce has prevailed in the conflict area since 12 January, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari decreed a unilateral cease-fire as a measure to facilitate actions by Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. Camacho Solis and the armed group are awaiting an "imminent" and first peace meeting aimed at finding a solution to the armed conflict, which, according to official figures, has resulted in many deaths. Meanwhile, residents of the Teopisca, Huehuetan, Cacahoatan, Tuzantan, and Mapastepec Municipalities have occupied local governmental buildings to demand the dismissal of their respective mayors, whom they accuse of corruption and of promoting violence. Teopisca residents on 8 February also blocked the Pan-American Highway between San Cristobal de las Casas and Comitan to call attention to their demand, which is similar to that of the residents of other municipalities located in the conflict area. The demonstrators prevented the delivery of medicines, potable water, and food to the municipality, allowing only journalists to enter.
