In an exclusive interview with YONHAP News Agency, Kokoshin said Wednesday that Russia positively evaluates its cooperation in the military field with South Korea. The prospects for further expansion of such cooperation are bright, he said. The development of military cooperation between the two countries will not have an adverse effect on any third country but rather contribute to the easing of tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, he noted. Kokoshin, who is in charge of Russia's defense industry, said that conditions are ripe for South Korean companies to take part in the process of privatizing Russia's arms industry. Russia needs South Korean capital for joint development of its arms industry as well as Korea's expertise in marketing. He said the Russian Government is prepared to supply up-to-date military hardware to South Korea to help repay loans the former Soviet Union had taken out from Seoul. Moscow has already made a proposal and is now awaiting the Seoul government's reply, he added. He also said there was no room for doubt about President Boris Yeltsin's promise that Russia would not provide North Korea with offensive weapons, a pledge Moscow would continue to honor. With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, Kokoshin said the Russian Government's basic policy is that Pyongyang should not have any nuclear weapons and therefore, Moscow will do its utmost to achieve that goal. In any event, Russia believes that the level of North Korea's nuclear development isn't very high, he added.
