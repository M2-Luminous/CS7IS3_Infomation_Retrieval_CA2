Clark also announced that no agreement has been reached so far on the package. The proximity talks on the confidence-building measures are continuing. President Rauf Denktas received Clark this morning. Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister; Atay Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense minister; Ozel Koray, under secretary of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministry; presidential advisers; Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's assistant special envoy in Cyprus; and UN experts also attended the meeting, which lasted approximately one and a half hours. In a statement before the meeting, Clark remarked that the outcome of the confidence-building measures package will become clearer today. When a journalist reminded him of his statement yesterday and asked him if he is hopeful about reaching an agreement on one or two disputed issues, Clark said that these two subjects constitute the main points that cause differences of opinion between the two sides. He expressed the belief that if agreement is not reached because of these two issues, the efforts exerted so far will have been wasted. Asked if the two issues concern Maras [Varosha], Clark noted that the aim is to formulate an agreement that will benefit both sides equally, adding that if Maras benefits the Greek Cypriots, then the Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport must benefit the Turkish Cypriots. Clark declared that if the advantages granted to the Turkish Cypriots are not guaranteed against those granted to the Greek Cypriots, the benefits specified for the Turkish Cypriots cannot be implemented. In a statement after his meeting with Denktas, Clark announced that no agreement has been reached so far on the confidence-building measures package. He said that he is now hopeful that an agreement will be reached on the implementation of the package. This has not been achieved yet, Clark remarked, adding, however, that he is still hopeful that a conciliation will be reached by the end of the month. Pointing out that certain new alternatives emerged during today's meeting, on which both Denktas and himself will reflect, Clark said that in the coming days UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will submit a report to the UN Security Council on the developments. Questioned by a reporter on the disputed matters, Clark stated that he does not wish to comment on these issues at this stage. In answer to another question, Clark declared that if the package is to be implemented successfully, it must grant equal and concrete advantages to both sides. Asked if the proximity talks will continue, Clark said that he will leave the island today, but his assistant Feissel will continue the contacts. [passage omitted] In a statement after the meeting, Rasit declared that an agreement that could endanger the interests of the Turkish Cypriot people will not be accepted. He noted that the Turkish Cypriots are conducting the talks in goodwill. In reply to a question, Rasit remarked that the issues of Maras and the Lefkosa Airport are interdependent and one must be careful to secure the balance. We have not yet reached a balance, he added.
