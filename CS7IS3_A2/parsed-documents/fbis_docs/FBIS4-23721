It discussed incidents at assembly areas and freedom of movement throughout the country. At the end of the meeting, we spoke to Deputy Minister Tomas Salomao, who headed the government delegation. [Salomao] The CSC approved a timetable on the closure of assembly areas. The government intends to complete the demobilization of its on troops on 15. [sentence as heard] The government will decide what assembly points should be closed down. On the freedom of movement in Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] areas, yet another appeal was made to do away with rhetoric and adopt practical solutions. We ought to be pragmatic. Renamo leaders have already said the areas have been opened. So citizens and election registration teams must not face problems. As a whole, this has been a constructive and positive session. [Unidentified correspondent] At the end of a Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] meeting yesterday, it was reported that the government would confine its troops by 28 June. That would represent an average of 700 men daily. Do you think the government can do that? [Salomao] It is possible. As you know, we have a proposal in that regard. One should take into consideration that there are assembly points in (?areas where troops are based). Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo delegation, says his movement has once again reiterated its commitment to UN resolutions on the confinement and demobilization of troops. [Domingos] Specifically, the meeting discussed and ratified a number of documents that had been dealt with by other commissions -- namely, the confinement and demobilization of troops and closure of assembly points. Renamo remains committed to fulfilling UN resolutions in terms of which troops should be confined by 1 June and demobilized by 15 July. All our troops have already been confined to assembly points. Our troops will be demobilized by 15 July [words indistinct] it is up to us to issue the lists. So far, the names of over 3,000 men have already been selected for demobilization. UN Secretary General representative Aldo Ajello says the adoption of a timetable on the closure of assembly points was an important step in the timely completion of the peace process. [Ajello] It has been a very positive meeting. It has been decided to adopt a timetable [words indistinct]. The timetable sets dates for the closure of assembly points. That is a very important step in the completion of the peace process as scheduled. [Correspondent] The government says it will confine its troops by 28 June. That means the government will have to confine 700 men daily. Do you think the government will be able to meet the deadline? [Ajello] It is possible. If they want to do it, then it is possible. If logistical conditions permit, I think it will be possible. I think the accord that has been signed reflects a commitment to confining troops as scheduled. Over the past weeks the commissions did not meet because the government was meeting with its internal organs to discuss the implementation of the last phase of the peace process. Important decisions have been made. There is a new element which is very positive. The process had slowed down, but as of now we will see it moving rapidly. I think it will be possible to comply with the timetable. [Correspondent] The CSC session dealt with the eternal problem of Renamo areas and the freedom of movement. What are the developments? [Ajello] The information we have on freedom of movement in Renamo areas, particularly by electoral registration teams, says Gaza Province is the only area facing problems. There are several logistical problems -- not political problems -- in other parts of the country. The question of Gaza Province was discussed by the commission. I will gather all the necessary information (?from the) Renamo delegation to settle the dispute.
