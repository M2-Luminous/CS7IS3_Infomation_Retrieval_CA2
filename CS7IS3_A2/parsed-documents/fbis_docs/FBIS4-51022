Vice Premier Zou Jiahua delivered a television speech on the campaign. [Begin Zou Jiahua recording] During the safe production week campaign, the people's governments and the departments concerned at all levels should firmly seize the opportunity. Leading cadres at various levels should set an example in treating it as an important task. The safe production week campaign should be unfolded truly in an organized, well-guided, and down-to-earth way. It is necessary to stress actual results and prevent formalism. It is necessary to use the news and propaganda media and adopt lively and effective measures to give a concentrated publicity to the principles and policies of the party and the government concerning the safety in production. People should be commended for good deeds in safe production. Anyone who neglects safety in production should be exposed. The wrongdoing of acting recklessly and violating the operating rules should be resolutely stopped. We should guide and supervise enterprises so that they pay great attention to safety at all times. We should mobilize all quarters of society so that they attach importance to safety in production and be concerned about it. In this way, we will create a good social climate in which everyone is concerned about safety and ensures safety in everything. All enterprises should regard production safety as very urgent work and do it well. They should take up the responsibility for safe production. In light of the reality of their own trade, they should mobilize the masses to check loopholes and adopt measures to eliminate hidden danger, solve conspicuous problems concerning production safety, and ensure safe production. Ensuring production safety is very important work and of benefit to both the country and the people. It is also a protracted, complex, and arduous task. We must constantly stress it, pay attention to it everyday, and do it daily. We should do all we can to perform our duties on our jobs and take the initiative in making even greater contributions to safety in production and to the long-term peace and stability in our country. Thank you! [end recording]
