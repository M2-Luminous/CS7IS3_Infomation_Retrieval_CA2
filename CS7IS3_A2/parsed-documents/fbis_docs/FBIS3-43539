Ululu told NOTICIAS that he received the information from a Renamo branch in Lisbon, which said that the Portuguese Foreign Ministry had sent an invitation for a Dhlakama visit to the Renamo Office in Maputo. He said that "so far, we (Renamo) have not received an official invitation from the Portuguese Government. We shall reply as soon as we receive the invitation." Asked to comment on the objectives of Dhlakama's visit to Portugal, Vicente Ululu said his movement was interested in briefing European countries about the steps being taken in the process of pacification and democratization of the country. Ululu said: As you are aware, the peace process is progressing satisfactorily. At the moment we are sending our guerrilla forces to assembly points throughout the country. Some of these troops will join the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, while others will be demobilized. All these steps show that the process is progressing smoothly. [passage omitted] The Renamo leader is also expected to visit Spain and the United States, although senior Renamo officials declined to comment on that report. The Renamo secretary general also told NOTICIAS that he does not exclude the possibility of his leader "visiting Tanzania, Zambia, and Namibia, in the coming days." [passage omitted]
