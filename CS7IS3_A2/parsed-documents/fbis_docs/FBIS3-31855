Damovski: "Tranquilization of Coalition Relations"] [Text] An informal meeting was held three days ago [21 February] in response to a message from Djeladin Murati, PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] president, to Prime Minister Crvenkovski, in which he asked for an urgent government session with the participation of the PDP ministerial group. The meeting was attended by Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov, Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, Parliamentary Chairman Stojan Andov, together with the parliamentary vice chairmen, [Interior] Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, and Risto Ivanov, and the PDP ministerial group. According to all the information available, the misunderstandings in the government coalition were overcome at this meeting. Let us recall: In his letter to Prime Minister Crvenkovski, Djeladin Murati said that he had learned that the authorities had started a game of dishonest obstruction against the PDP group so as to conceal its approach to the new group from the other congress (Menduh Taci's group), and to hide the support that it was giving to it. The aim was, Murati said in his letter, to eliminate from political life and discredit Albanian delegates and ministers in a perfidious way. Murati thought that there were indications of Interior Ministry involvement, and that if the facts were not examined, "it would be possible to reexamine further activities within the institutions of the system." Amazingly soon after that, on the next working day, the requested meeting was held and it was concluded that the PDP would remain within the institutions of the system. As an introduction to this conclusion, the visit of the Macedonian state delegation to Albania was mentioned, and, understandably, the alleged forcing of the split within the PDP. As we know, minister-coordinator Bekir Zuta was a member of the Macedonian delegation that made a recent official visit to Tirana, and the Albanian side demanded his exclusion from the discussions with Albanian President Sali Berisha. The PDP leadership interpreted that as a kind of a shift in policy toward their party. The second subject discussed at the meeting was the opinion expressed by the PDP about forcing Taci's position via the state media (Taci's interview for Macedonian Television and AFP in Albanian, the reports on the main newscast about the interview, reports of telephone calls with Taci on the main newscast of Macedonian Television, and the contribution of other journalists to the party's division). The PDP group also brought up the problem of granting citizenship, as well as the great reservations demonstrated by the Macedonian leadership concerning the behavior of the Albanian Embassy in Macedonia, even going so far as to be directly involved in supporting Menduh Taci's faction.... Nonetheless, a certain agreement was reached. There are no more threats to abandon the coalition, the PDP is no longer so upset, and an image is being projected among its membership that their group is being consistent in its efforts to realize their policy goals.
