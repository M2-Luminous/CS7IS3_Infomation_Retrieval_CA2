On Wednesday [16 February], the European Commissioner responsible for Cooperation and Development, Mr. Manuel Marin, will go to Israel where he will meet with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, among others. During his visit, the European Commission vice president will announce the formal launch of negotiations aimed at producing a new cooperation agreement between the Twelve and Israel before the end of the year. This agreement will replace the old one in effect since 1975, and has been on the cards for some time in the light of developments in international relations or certain advances made at the level of the European Community, e.g., the entry into force of the single market and Maastricht Treaty, the creation of the European Economic Area [EEA], and the signature of new agreements between the Twelve and several Maghreb countries. The drafting of a new agreement has proven particularly indispensable since conclusion of the "Gaza and Jericho first" option between the Israelis and the Palestinians last September. The agreement constitutes a second dimension of the European Union's policy in the region, for Europe is the main source of funds in the Middle East, with a program worth ECU500 million spread over five years. According to European Commission President Jacques Delors, the agreement will enable the European Union [EU] to give guarantees to Israel, which he describes as "an industrial society whose principal outlet is Europe." "Israel has changed, the Community has changed, and the world has evolved," explains Mordechai Drory [Israeli ambassador to EU]. "What we are now asking of the Twelve is an updated version of the economic and commercial chapter of the old cooperation agreement, entailing adjustments made to the agricultural dossier, a modification of the original rules and regulations, or even the extension of free trade to services. As for scientific cooperation, Israel would also like to be involved in European research and development programs, especially in the industrial sector." Since the early 1980's, trade exchanges between the two parties have become progressively more imbalanced, to the detriment of Israel. Israel's trade deficit vis-a-vis the Twelve rose to ECU3.1 billion in 1992, with the EU remaining the Israeli Government's leading trade partner -- with Germany ahead of Great Britain and France on a country by country basis. To what may this trend be attributed? Mordechai Drory believes that the main cause has been the lack of European investment, and the absence of joint ventures between Israelis and European investors: "People have been reluctant to invest in Israel, due to the political situation, and the Arab boycott of Israeli products. Most investments in Israel have been made by major international groups of U.S. origin, which have not hesitated to come here, among other things because they are being actively supported by their government. In the United States there is an extremely tough antiboycott law, which threatens any U.S. entrepreneur who responds positively to threats of an Arab boycott. There is also a law of this kind in some member states, but not at European level." Today, agricultural produce represents only 20 percent of our exports to the European Community. However, between them, the Twelve alone absorb nearly three-fourths of Israeli exports of agricultural products, stresses Mordechai Drory: "Consequently, in this sector, the European market is of vital importance to Israel." Furthermore, proportionally speaking, Israel exports less high-tech products to the European Community than it does to the United States. "That is mainly due to the fact that a large share of our industry is concentrated in high technology. We have few unskilled workers, no raw materials, and a very high level of research. However, the more highly developed an exporting nation becomes, the more high-tech products it imports. The United States has this politico-economic base, so it imports more products of this kind from Israel. The situation is different according to the member states."
