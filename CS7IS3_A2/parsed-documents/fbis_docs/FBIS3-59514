Sports industries, as well as the automotive and aeronautics industries, are interested. To sell to the Japanese its software for computing composite-material structures, Framasoft+CSI, a Framatome subsidiary, has found a worthy ally: no less than Toray, the world's number one in carbon fibers. Toray has been using the software, baptized Composic, in-house for the past year for its own account, and began marketing it in July 1993. To date, it has found three clients: the National Aerospace Laboratory (the Japanese NASA) and two manufacturers of golf clubs. These first users operate in the two sectors that consume the most carbon fibers in Japan. This is, of course, not happenstance. But Toray is making no secret of its intent to penetrate other sectors, especially the automotive sector. This will not be possible unless the sector's design departments, whose culture is still strongly influenced by metals, learn to work with composites. And the Composic software should help them in this regard. "The design of a part made of composite material still takes more time and the productivity of the design departments is very low," says Toyoki Tanaka, manager of Toray Industries' research and engineering laboratories. Actually, the 20 or so engineers and technicians comprising this center have substantial computer facilities at their disposal: A battery of computers, including a Cray, and softwares gleaned from all parts of the world, such as Abaqus and Ideas of American origin. But these are difficult to use and require a learning period of at least two months. 40 Units Already Sold in Europe The Framasoft+CSI product "is learned" in two weeks. It enables the construction of a part, on a computer screen, by stacking up to 60 layers of materials, and the advance computation of its mechanical behavior. It is much more productive than its competitors. For example: The design of a bicycle wheel with three carbon-epoxy-fiber spokes takes no more than five days versus two to three months heretofore. And "the concordance between design computations and test results is very good," says Toyoki Tanaka. Composic does have its limitations: It does not provide for taking into account the nonlinear behavior of materials. Given the interest being shown by Toray, however, Framatome+CSI expects to close this gap. The software has already been sold to the extent of approximately 40 units in Europe in the aeronautics (Aerospatiale), sports (Rossignol), and automotive (BMW, VW, Ligier) sectors. It will undoubtedly contribute to the more widespread use of carbon fibers by industry, possibly even in the automotive sector, but the price of the fibers will also have to come down. This angle is also being studied under the Toray research program.
