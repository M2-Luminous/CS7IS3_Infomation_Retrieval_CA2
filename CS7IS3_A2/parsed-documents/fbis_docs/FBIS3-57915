Certain proposals cut no ice with me, they leave me absolutely cold. Those putting them forward should also be explaining where they are planning to get the money to finance such a nonsensical operation." Luigi Spaventa, one of our top economists, who is temporarily lending the Ciampi government a hand in the capacity of budget minister, displayed his habitual sense of fair play. He wanted to avoid direct polemics with [Fininvest President] Silvio Berlusconi or with any of the others who, over the past few days, have been riding the idea of drastically reducing the tax burden on citizens. However, he was unable to conceal his annoyance at such facile demagoguery. As a good economist, he is used to reasoning with figures and tables. He placed one of the latter under our nose. It contained comparisons between several different nations. The minister remarked: "A tax burden equivalent to 47 percent of the GDP is mentioned. I do not know where these figures come from. In fact, we are around 40 percent, a little below the EEC average. There will be no room to maneuver," he added, "until we bring the public debt in line with our GDP. The tax burden could only be reduced now through unsustainable and unthinkable cuts in the benefits provided by the government for families." [Schettino] Minister, some proposals may perhaps have a very demagogic flavor, but the tax burden has reached intolerable levels in our country. Should the government not be more courageous and reduce the taxes paid by citizens? [Spaventa] I believe any and every taxpayer would like to see his tax bill reduced. There is a big gap, however, between what is desirable and what is actually feasible. It is misleading to make people believe that the tax burden can be eased without saying how this would be offset. Those advocating a reduction of the tax burden to 35 percent must clearly tell citizens that this would require cutting expenditure by 6.7 percentage points. Cuts would all have to center on child benefit since we have already scraped the bottom of the barrel in the other sectors. Expenditure on interest can be reduced only if we continue to have a credible position on the financial markets, and this implies interest rate cuts. Coercive measures to reduce public expenditure are out of the question. [Schettino] If a reduction is not possible, then at least a tax burden ceiling could be set by amending the Constitution... [Spaventa] Considering how Article 81 of the Constitution (according to which government expenditure must always be covered -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) has been implemented, I am very skeptical about ceilings being decided on paper. I have more faith in the thrust provided by movements, and such a thrust makes any further increase of the tax burden impossible at present. [Schettino] In the meantime, however, every month employees are forced to pay well over half their salaries in taxes and social security contributions. Is this not too much, in your view? Is it really unthinkable to grant a tax reduction? [Spaventa] A reduction of direct taxation is certainly appropriate. Taxation rates are too high in our country. We must be clear, however, that any such reduction would have to be funded through new taxes, possibly in the form of indirect taxation, or through cuts in expenditure. [Schettino] Nevertheless, in a period of recession such as the present one, should tax payers not be getting a heavier pay packet so as to stimulate consumer demand, and thus revive the economy? [Spaventa] Unless we close the gap between the public debt and the GDP, fiscal policy cannot be used to sustain the economic cycle. This gap between the mountain of accumulated debts that we are carrying on our backs, and the country's wealth, must be set at a sustainable level for the economy. If we attempted to follow an expansion policy at present, this would only have negative effects, and we would have to foot a very high bill in terms of interest rates. I would like to point out, however, that despite these binding limitations, the government gave back over 1.1 trillion lire [L] under the heading "fiscal drag." It reduced the tax burden for people buying their first home by L1 trillion. In addition, despite the fact that the income from certain sources, such as IVA [value-added tax] and social contributions, fell short of estimates by close to L3 trillion by the end of 1993, the government decided not to decree new taxes. [Schettino] What about the L6.8-trillion maneuver? What about the increases in IVA and the price of gasoline -- are these not new taxes? [Spaventa] These taxes were announced a long time ago, and they form an integral part of economic policy for 1994. They do not represent an unforseen increase. I would like to remind those who now appear shocked and suprised at the measures decided by the cabinet on 29 December, that already in mid-July the programing document and Finance Bill were referring to the need for a tax package at the end of the year. Subsequently, in September, this statement of intent was transformed into one of the articles in the provisions attached to the 1994 Finance Bill. The article in question, including a specific budgetary allocation, was duly approved by parliament. To say now that we have suddenly introduced an umpteenth tax increase is to deny the facts. [Schettino] Indeed, the end of the year maneuver had already been announced. However, some consternation was caused by the realization that one of its key elements was in fact an umpteenth increase in the price of gasoline. [Spaventa] We had to choose between a higher IVA increase or raising the price of gasoline. I thought it would be more appropriate to act on gasoline since it has only a very slight inflationist impact on the economy, given the drop in oil prices. [Schettino] One last question: Will a further, mid-year package, including further cuts in expenditure, really be necessary? [Spaventa] Anyone speaking of a further package would do so in a purely personal capacity. We are still in January and it is too early to say what will happen. I can only say now that, as regards certain obligatory expenditure items, such as wages and pensions, no interventions are possible in the course of the year. But let us not start crossing the bridge before we get there.
