If he had not gone AWOL from his unit on 27 October 1992, he would have returned home honorably as a U.S. serviceman who had completed his duty in a dangerous area. On that day, however, he committed a heinous crime which will not easily be erased from the memory of Koreans. He killed a Korean prostitute working for U.S. servicemen in Tongduchon by hitting her on the head four times with a coke bottle. As the mass media reported the atrocity of this incident, which was referred to as the so-called "murder of Ms. Yun Kum-i," the public was stirred and denounced the crimes of U.S. servicemen. Some pointed their arrow of blame to the authorities of the U.S. Armed Forces, while others held the government responsible. Those with extraordinary interest in this incident have even formed a joint committee to cope with it in an effort to appeal for the revelation of details into the truth of the incident. Lamenting Ms. Yun's death, the U.S. Armed Forces authorities in the ROK have made clear that "if the accused is convicted in an ROK court, we will help send him to an ROK prison." On 29 April, Private Markle was finally sentenced with the severe punishment of 15 years of imprisonment by an ROK court, and he will soon be transferred to an ROK prison. Thus, the murder case of Ms. Yun Kum-i has been settled. But, crimes by U.S. servicemen have not come to a complete end. While the stir surrounding the murder case has died down, however, such crimes which had been subdued for some time, are showing signs of raising their head again. This is substantiated by the number of cases involving crime by U.S. servicemen as disclosed by the Report Center for Damages Incurred From U.S. Servicemen's Crimes, the organization affiliated with the Headquarters of the Movement for Rooting Out Crimes by U.S. Servicemen in the ROK (co-chairman: Pastor Chon U-sop). Writer Choe In-ho Is Also a Victim The Report Center opened to provide legal aid activities for victims of crimes by U.S. servicemen. With headquarters in Seoul, the center opened on 1 April and keeps watch over U.S. servicemen's crimes through its ten chapters in areas where U.S. servicemen are stationed. In April alone, over 20 cases of various crimes involving U.S. servicemen were reported at the center. In one case, a man suffered a broken nose while trying to mediate in a quarrel involving bullying by a group of U.S. servicemen, and in another, a man was hit by a hit-and-run car of a U.S. serviceman. The common feature of these cases is that only the victims have suffered. Such a tendency has become more apparent recently. Mr. Cho Chae-hak, a representative secretary of the Report Center, said: "Before the first trial on Private Markle was referred to an ROK court for sentencing, a bloodthirsty atmosphere prevailed, and U.S. servicemen dared not commit a crime. The U.S. Armed Forces authorities appeared to be trying to keep their servicemen under discipline in a bid not to unnecessarily incur the Korean people's displeasure. The situation has begun to change gradually, however, and it seems that U.S. servicemen have returned to their past attitude of callousness and arrogance." In fact, as long as the present status continues, we can say that while U.S. servicemen's crimes become slightly subdued under certain circumstances, we cannot say that they have been reduced to the level of "extinction." This is because when a crime involving a U.S. serviceman takes place, most aspects--such as procedure and conditions of involvement by the ROK and US sides, the investigation process, the treatment of the accused, and retroactive compensation --are stipulated to the advantage of the U.S. servicemen. This is all the more convincing in light of the case of writer Choe In-ho who was practically forced into an early end to his writing career due to a car accident on the Yongdong Express Way on 21 March. That accident occurred because the U.S. serviceman who was driving the military truck on the expressway was dozing. Mr. Choe In-ho's car could not avoid the charging vehicle as it abruptly crossed the median strip. Mr. Choe suffered severe injuries and was hospitalized for four weeks. Fortunately, Mr. Choe recuperated and was discharged from the hospital some time ago, but he has yet to be compensated for his completely damaged car, not to speak of the medical costs incurred, because when someone is involved in a car accident for which a U.S. serviceman is responsible, that person must wait at least six months for reparations such as medical fees. While Mr. Choe is unlikely to suffer much unfairness because, as a leading ROK novelist, he has both the social stature and ability to readily find the legal means to settle the case on his own, what would happen to someone who didn't have the same social status or ability? The answer is "there would be no choice but to suffer." This Means That We Have Given Up Jurisdiction Ourselves This is confirmed if we take a look at the status of U.S. servicemen's crimes that occurred recently in the Tongduchon area where six U.S. military camps such as Camp Casey and Camp Mobile are located. A typical case was that of Mr. Pak Kyong-nim, a standbar manager in Tongduchon. Mr. Pak met with an accident last Christmas. After closing his business that night, Mr. Pak and his co-workers went to a U.S. servicemen's club in Posan-dong. He was severely injured by a U.S. serviceman who stabbed the left side of his chin, his right arm, and the his abdomen. He received 40 stitches. At that time, Pak and his group were engaged in a gang fight against the U.S. servicemen. The self-regulating civilian vigilantes in Posan-dong caught two black servicemen who were alleged offenders on the spot and referred them to the U.S. military police detachment. But, that was the end of it. The ROK prosecutor handed over jurisdiction to the U.S. military on grounds that the case was minor, and the U.S. military side released the suspects on grounds of insufficient charges. Far from getting any compensation, at this point, Mr. Pak does not even know the names of the offenders. According to data submitted to the National Assembly by the Ministry of Justice as part of the former's inspection of the government administration in 1992, only 12 of a total 338 cases of U.S. servicemen breaking the law on various occasions such as in violence, car accidents, or thefts as compiled between January and August 1992 received severe punishment such as going to jail or a dishonorable discharge from the military. In view of this, it is clear-cut what result will be meted out to the Koreans who have suffered from U.S. servicemen's crimes. Mr. Chang Tae-won, chief of the self-regulating civil vigilantes in Posan-dong, Tongduchon, said: "We refer offenders that we apprehend to the U.S. military police first, but, we have never been notified by the U.S. Armed Forces of the outcome of such cases." Crimes involving U.S. servicemen are handled according to the provisions in the Status of Forces Agreement [SOFA] between the ROK and the United States, which was revised in 1991. According to this agreement, the ROK side has primary jurisdiction except for in cases of "crimes committed against United States property or security" or "crimes committed during the execution of one's official duties." Therefore, in Mr. Pak's case, the ROK Government even gave up its natural duty to its citizens. According to experts, such contradictions originate from the existing SOFA in which agreed upon provisions such as minutes and items of understanding impair the legal effectiveness of the main agreement. For example, the agreed minutes, which are an addendum to the main agreement, stipulate that even if there is no request from the United States, the ROK shall not ask for the primary jurisdiction from the U.S. side "for swift handling of the cases." This means that the clause for 'automatic relinquishment of jurisdiction,' which was written out in 1991's revision, has been revived. Furthermore, the agreed minutes stipulate that "in the event that a representative from the United States is not present, the statement made by a suspect or the accused shall not be adopted as evidence for conviction." Professor of International Law Yi Chang-hui (Hankuk University of Foreign Studies) has firmly said that the 1991 revision of the SOFA is insubstantial. He said that, excepting severe crimes such as murder or rape, the ROK Government is still unable to exercise its jurisdiction and its rights to direct investigation over U.S. servicemen's crimes because of the various "exceptions," such as the minutes that were agreed upon. While the stir surrounding the murder of Ms. Yun Kum-i abates, crimes by U.S. servicemen are raising their head once more as if to jeer the insubstantial SOFA provisions. Professor Yi is going to hold a large-scale public hearing this July with a view to attracting public attention to the revision of the SOFA.
