The command of the first Krajina corps of the S.R. army said on Wednesday evening that Serb defenders in the area of Teslic some 20 kilometres south-west of Doboj had repulsed an attack there and forced the enemy troops to return to their earlier positions. The Moslems continued to bring in fresh troops from the direction of Zenica and deploy them close to Serb positions in the southern and south-eastern part of the Teslic front, the command said. After daily defeats and major losses in manpower and weaponry along all lines of contact in the area of Ozren and Vozuca, Moslem fighters vented their anger by opening infantry and artillery fire on Serb civilian settlements. Apart from major damage, there were no civilian casualties, the S.R. army command said.
