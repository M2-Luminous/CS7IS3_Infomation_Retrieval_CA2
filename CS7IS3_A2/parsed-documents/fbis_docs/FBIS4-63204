He said that "judging from this discussion, many of our ideas concerning partnership and Relations with NATO are being heeded." "We are optimistic about NATO's determination to discuss relations with Russia. This is a move in the right direction, because for natural reasons relations between Russia and NATO have gone beyond the Partnership for Peace program," he said. To quote Ushakov, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's visit to Brussels, scheduled for the next week, has two main goals. "Firstly, it implies the discussion of the military doctrine and high-level contacts with NATO. And secondly, Grachev intends to discuss Russia's participation in the Partnership program and consolidate the conceptual foundation of our cooperation with NATO," he said. He pointed out that the Partnership for Peace program was mostly oriented to military cooperation. "At the current stage, this is not the most important thing for us. Russia is interested in real partnership, above all political and economic," he went on to say. He announced that Grachev would inform the NATO officials of the Russian ideas of partnership with NATO. "We do not intend to slow down our dealings with NATO. The essence of our relations with NATO is far more important for us than any framework documents similar to the Partnership for Peace program,," he said. Russia's partnership with NATO has been developing even without the Partnership for Peace program which does not add any essential elements to our cooperation," said Ushakov. No statements will be made in Brussels concerning the date of Russia's joining this program, he continued. The Russian Defense Ministry welcomed the NATO discussion of granting Russia a special status in the Partnership for Peace program, the Defense Ministry told Interfax on Thursday. Military experts noted, however, that it was not yet clear what was actually meant by the term. Neither is it clear how Russian representatives will be able to influence decisions taken by the participants in the Partnership for Peace program. Experts believe that the definition of Russia's status may have the decisive impact on whether or not Russia will join this program. "The final decision is to be taken by Russian President Boris Yeltsin," said Ushakov. As we reported earlier, Grachev's visit to Brussels and his speech at the NATO headquarters, had been scheduled for May 24 and 25. Firstly, the visit implies the discussion of the military doctrine and high-level contacts with NATO. And secondly, Grachev intends to discuss Russia's participation in the Partnership program and consolidate the conceptual foundation of our cooperation with NATO. On his way to Brussels (May 23), Grachev is to make a stop-over in Germany where he will visit the Western Army Group and hold talks with German bankers.
