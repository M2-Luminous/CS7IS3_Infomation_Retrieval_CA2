I might hazard a guess that whatever the outcome of the meeting, it will for the moment be impossible to talk of some stable long-term compromise between the leading factions in the new parliament. On the contrary, an enduring struggle is emerging between the newly formed parliamentary forces in the run-up to the first session (which, I must remind you, opens on Tuesday, 11 January), with many instances of disagreement, and not just between those whose orientations run absolutely counter to one another. There are today no grounds for talking about any kind of democratic bloc. The nature of the sporadic statements made by Shakhray's and Yavlinskiy's camps bear witness to their intention primarily to do their own thing. "Russia's Choice" is looking very much alone at the moment. Maybe the situation will change after "Russia's Choice" makes it plain that it is not claiming the role of "big brother" in relation to its potential less numerous allies. But for the moment it is easy to detect notes of hurt pride in the tone of Sergey Shakhray himself and his closest associate, Konstantin Zatulin. For example, commenting specifically on the intention of the four aforementioned factions to "add" their own deputy speakers to the speaker, Zatulin says that he sees in this a threat of the next in the series of presidium dictatorships. But Shakhray, as far as we know, absolutely avoided participation in a negotiation process according to the formula "four plus the others." Strictly speaking nothing unpredictable is happening. It would be strange if the factions, which have just emerged from the furnace of the elections, suddenly began to fraternize according to principles of equality and nonresistance. And if they only took as their basis for reconciliation proposals prepared somewhere off in a presidential commission. No, what should have happened has happened -- that is, a power struggle. For every former Soviet person knows: However much you talk about the titular nature of the speaker's position, it is nevertheless the position of the chief. Everything comes down to the degree to which this chief will adhere to decorum and regulations, and to how much of a professional he will be. The only thing which is alarming is that the faction members are clearly striving for relations based on seniority. The number of votes received at the elections, it seems, is beginning to fulfill the role of a distinguishing mark. Naturally such a table of ranks produces a corresponding mood in relations. Nonetheless there are no grounds for absolute pessimism. I repeat that there is in train a normal process of, let us say, the sharing out of strategically advantageous seats in the State Duma. In such circumstances nervousness and overwrought emotions are unavoidable. Let us try to hope that participation in the lawmaking process itself will settle the "Brownian motion" of the political struggles within parliament and turn the parliamentarians' attention to Russia's and Russians' urgent problems.
