Following a series of speculations as to who would replace Manuel Camacho Solis as peace commissioner, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed the president of the National Human Rights Commission, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, the new peace and reconciliation commissioner for Chiapas. Shortly after 1500, the Mexican president issued a message in which he reiterated the Mexican Government's commitment to resolve the Chiapas conflict through peaceful means. He added that democratic progresses and welfare with justice is not achieved through violence. Let us listen to what he said: [Begin Salinas recording] I reaffirm my commitment to dialogue and negotiation as a means of attaining peace in Chiapas. This is a commitment to the political solution of the conflict. We rule out violence and the use of force as methods to promote and make social demands. As a demonstration of this determination to seek peaceful solutions to the conflict, I have invited Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, who has accepted, to resume the dialogue and attain the worthy peace demanded by Chiapas. [end recording] President Salinas said in the Vicente Guerrero Room of the Los Pinos Presidential Palace that his government will make additional efforts to find political solutions to the Chiapas problem. He also agreed to make progress toward democracy together with the political parties and the nongovernmental organizations. In a five-point message, the president stated his determination to resume the talks and attain peace in Chiapas. In Point No. 3, President Salinas said the Mexican Army will maintain a unilateral cease-fire declared on 12 January as long as it is not attacked. He added that patrols at the southern border, as well as the operations to prevent gunrunning activities in the area, will continue. In Point No. 4, the president reiterated his commitment to strengthen social and economic actions in Chiapas in the areas of agriculture, health, and nutrition. Finally President Salinas said he will keep the public informed about the progress made in the peace process. As the president read the message, Madrazo Cuellar stood to the right of the president. Salinas gave him his full support so that his mission as peace commissioner may be successful.
