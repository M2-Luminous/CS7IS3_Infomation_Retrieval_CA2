He was speaking following today's decision by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to withdraw their patent applications for cDNA sequences of unknown function, filed in 1991. Mr Waldegrave said: "The MRC and NIH patent applications were filed in order to protect the interests of the UK and US taxpayers, with least damage to the international research effort in genome mapping which requires the free flow of information. "However, The Medical Research Council, with the support of the Government, has always argued that these applications should not be granted. I welcome the co-operation between the UK and the US on this important issue and look forward to further developments in this important area of research." This announcement backs up MRC's decision in October 1993 not to file any further patent application on newly-obtained cDNA sequences of unknown function unless accompanied by knowledge of the gene function. Sir Dai Rees, Secretary to the MRC said: "We feel this withdrawal of the patents is a correct step, and we are delighted to be able to co-ordinate our actions with those of the NIH."
