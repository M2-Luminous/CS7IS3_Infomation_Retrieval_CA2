[see item LD3012171493 in previous Terrorism Report] He told Friday's edition of the Cologne daily EXPRESS that the writers had made three decisive mistakes which had unmasked them: "First, the letter is very different from the confused linguistic style of the Red Army Faction [RAF]. Second, real terrorists would never claim to have tampered with the victim's car. They act professionally and do not talk about it. And third, they look for symbolic figures for their attacks. Mr. Saelzer was neither well known nor powerful enough to be a target for terrorists."
