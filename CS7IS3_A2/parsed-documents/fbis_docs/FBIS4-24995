In line with the provincial methods for implementing the state policies on supporting, transforming, consolidating, cooperatively developing, and upgrading town- and township-run collieries, the conference made a proposal for consolidating them. It is reported that over the past years, our province has rapidly developed the local collieries. So far, 13 cities and prefectures and 35 counties, cities, and districts across the province have 592 local collieries of various categories at various levels, and these collieries have a capacity of turning out 17.85 million tonnes. Thus, local collieries have held up half of the province's coal industry. As an important component of the province's local coal industry, town- and township-run collieries turned out 10 million tonnes of coal last year, accounting for one seventh of the province's demand for coal. Facing town- and township-run collieries' problems cropping up due to lax management, arbitrary mining and digging, tax evasion, poor conditions for safety in production, low disaster-combating capability, the occurrence of more accidents, and the overstepping of the bounds for mining, Chen Jianguo stressed: At a time of grasping the development of state-owned key collieries and state-owned local collieries, the provincial government has decided to comprehensively and thoroughly clear up and consolidate town- and township-run and collective-run enterprises so as to realistically solve their prominent problems.
