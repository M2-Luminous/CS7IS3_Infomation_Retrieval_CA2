Please cite FAC 90&hyph;22, FAR case 94&hyph;720 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Al Winston, Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA) Team Leader, at (703) 602&hyph;2119 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAC 90&hyph;22, FAR case 94&hyph;720. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (the Act), Pub. L. 103&hyph;355, provides authorities that streamline the acquisition process and minimize burdensome government-unique requirements. Major changes that can be expected in the acquisition process as a result of the Act's implementation include changes in the areas of Commercial Item Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and introduction of the Federal Acquisition Computer Network. This notice announces FAR revisions developed under FAR case 94&hyph;720, which was based on provisions in the Act that increased the threshold for obtaining certified cost or pricing data from $100,000 to $500,000 for civilian agencies. This matches the threshold previously applicable only to the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Coast Guard. The Act also repealed the requirements to obtain commercial pricing certification for certain items under civilian agency contracts. This interim rule is intended solely to make the changes necessary to implement those limited portions of the Act. Further, more extensive changes to implement other portions of the Act will be made subsequently. The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94&hyph;720) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see ADDRESSES caption, above) on or before January 4, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether a public meeting on this rule should be scheduled. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because nearly all contracts awarded to small business are awarded on the basis of competition for a firm fixed price and submittal of cost or pricing data is not required. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C 601, et seq. (FAC 90&hyph;22, FAR case 94&hyph;720), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The paperwork burden estimate applicable to the requirements for certified cost or pricing data (9000&hyph;0013) has been reduced to reflect the reduced numbers of submittals of certified cost or pricing data by civilian agency contractors. The reduction in the estimated burden for cost or pricing data requirements stems from the reduced number of submittals of cost or pricing data due to the increase in the threshold from $100,000 to $500,000. The paperwork burden applicable to the Commercial Pricing Certification requirements (9000&hyph;0105) has been eliminated. Inquiries should be directed to the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755 and cite FAC 90&hyph;22, OMB Clearance No. 9000&hyph;0013 or 9000&hyph;0105. D. Determination to Issue an Interim Rule A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense (DOD), the Administrator of General Services (GSA), and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that compelling reasons exist to promulgate this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. This action is necessary because the portion of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 that increases the certified cost or pricing data threshold for civilian agencies is effective upon enactment. Additionally, the Act repeals the requirements for commercial pricing certifications and the unnecessary regulatory burden related to commercial pricing certificates should be eliminated as quickly as possible to reduce administrative costs within the Government and at contractor locations. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 14, 15 and 52 Government procurement. Dated: November 29, 1994. Capt. Barry L. Cohen, SC, USN, Project Manager for the Implementation of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.
