He also said the INCD has eight agents highly qualified in the area of investigation, who will work full-time to determine the activities, whereabouts, and money laundering activities of Sinaloa's most important drug traffickers and drug producers. The official said that the 41 federal agents are part of a select group of investigators, adding that they were taken in helicopters to bases the Attorney General's Office (PGR) has set up in mountainous areas. The official stressed that authorities will investigate those who finance the production of narcotics, because the aim is to specifically punish those who provide the financial resources, not so much drug couriers. The INCD director asserted that authorities have detected some marijuana and poppy plantations in the mountains dividing Durango, Chihuahua, and Sonora. Meanwhile, Antonio Figueroa Lee, president of the Alberto Sanchez Gonzalez Bar Association, affirmed that the PGR must improve the process of selecting agents to effectively fight drug trafficking.
