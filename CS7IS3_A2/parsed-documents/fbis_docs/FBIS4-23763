FBIS4-23763 "drafr115_c_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-115 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 15 Jun South African Press Review for 15 Jun MB1506112094 MB1506112094 BFN [Editorial Report] BEELD Prison Riots -- The government must act firmly says a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 13 June in its reaction to the prison strikes. "The bloody uprising and hostage drama at the Modderbee Prison and the millions of rands' worth of damage caused by protesting inmates in at least eight prisons are indications of a very disturbing development." The spate of violence and vandalism in the latest so-called "peaceful" protest is "unacceptable and inexcusable under any circumstances. Such behavior should not be tolerated." According to the editorial, the organization claiming to represent the prisoners, the South African Prisoners Organization for Human Rights, "has this time either overplayed its hand, or it has no control over its members....The decision by the government to give all prisoners a six months' remission is a mistake." It is high time the government sent out a loud and clear message: "The season of violence and lawlessness is gone for good." Help for Africa -- A second editorial on the same page of the paper notes: "It is becoming all the clearer that African countries, especially those south of the Sahara, are waiting with optimism that South Africa will rescue them from the economic quagmire in which they find themselves due to corruption and bad management....Western countries have written them off. The former Communist Bloc has forgotten about them and are themselves in economic misery. South Africa must now jump to their rescue." According to the paper, President Mandela is handling this sensitive issue "well." At the recent World Economic Congress in Cape Town he assured African countries that South Africa did not intend to dominate them, but as a copartner, wanted to play a role in trying to reconstruct and develop Africa south of the Sahara. The editorial goes on to suggest: "If South Africa could help its neighbors in creating jobs for themselves, for instance, its own problem with illegal immigrants could be minimized." There must be caution against too big expectations. "The government's task of upliftment lies here first of all, and only thereafter can it direct its efforts elsewhere in Africa. There is little money." SOWETAN Government Action -- An editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 15 June on page 10 warns that "people are starting to loose patience" with the slow pace of government action on its promises. "Most people are reasonable and do not expect the Reconstruction and Development Programme to take off at once. A start, however small, has to be made. The important thing is to place some projects physically on the line. For instance, even if one area is prepared for housing, the streets tarred and the infrastructure put in place, people will be mollified. The trick is to show physically that the intention to make the plans work is there."
