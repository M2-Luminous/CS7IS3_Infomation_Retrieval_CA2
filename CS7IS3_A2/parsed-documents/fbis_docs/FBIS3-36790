This is how Andranik Migranyan described the Russian "Monroe Doctrine" that is increasingly penetrating even the official Russian foreign policy in his recently published essay. According to his own words, the well-known political scientist expressed his views as an "independent expert" in the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. However, given the fact that he is also a member of Yeltsin's group of advisers, his publications merit particular attention. First, we asked Professor Migranyan about the official reception of his essay. [Migranyan] This writing met with an unfavorable reaction in the Foreign Ministry, but not because they do not agree with the essence of my thoughts, but because I criticized the Ministry and Andrey Kozyrev for not working out the government's foreign policy concept in time. Besides, the reaction to the subject matter of my writing also shows that the position of the Foreign Ministry leadership has gone through a firm evolution. Kozyrev's latest declarations in defense of the Russian minorities show that he wants to go even further in this direction and is trying to prove that he is a "hawk," a believer in tough solutions. [Vida] Do you think that Kozyrev is capable of representing the emerging new Russian foreign policy? Not so long ago, he was still singing a different song altogether. [Migranyan] Indeed, I also see a rather firm change in Kozyrev's attitude. To be honest, I could hardly tell whether he is capable of heading a foreign policy commensurate with the changed circumstances. My feeling is that, even if he tries to do it, the relevant domestic political circles will hardly take it seriously, because it looks as if he was simply clinging to his chair. All this also makes him less predictable for the West, which, naturally, would like to continue to negotiate with the previous Kozyrev whose position was clear and free of opportunism. [Vida] If Kozyrev's constant claim that the president determines the country's foreign policy is true, everything you just said about him applies even more to Yeltsin. [Migranyan] I think the president has the right to modify his course. However, in order to carry this out and to give a clear sign of this, he also has to carry out a personnel change at the leadership of the ministry. [Vida] Judging from Western reactions to Gaydar and Fedorov's departure, Kozyrev's dismissal would cause a big stir, all the more so because the West, and particularly the United States, regards his presence as some kind of guarantee: As long as he is in place, there cannot be a too big problem. [Migranyan] If the West made a case out of Kozyrev's replacement, this would only show its shortsightedness, because this would justify the anti-Western rhetoric of Yeltsin's opposition and, thus, it would only hit back at the West itself and, of course, at those who want to continue the reforms. The Ministry practically received a monopoly on shaping the Russian foreign policy from Yeltsin in the past two years, something not suprising if we consider the internal explosion danger he had to face and the fact that he has never dealt with foreign policy before. The Cold War is over, and friendly relations with the West must be built now with the end of confrontation and, obviously, Yeltsin had nothing against this. It is another matter what means can be employed to achieve all this. The president put Kozyrev in charge of the problem of the technical aspect and technology problems, and he supported him because the Western partners were satisfied with him. However, the times of euphoria have also come to an end in foreign policy, especially in the matter of illusions regarding the West. Central and Eastern Europe have slowly become sober, when Moscow was still speaking about an alliance with the West. It would have been quite strange to see this general enthusiasm justified, because politics is a "hard game" in which everyone follows his own aim, without any philanthropy. [Vida] Do you think that the mentioning of the Russian sphere of interest raises certain apprehension in Western, Central, and Eastern European countries? This provides arguments to political forces who find it quite welcome that one can again speak of Russian expansion, for example, when talking about the need to expand NATO. [Migranyan] Quite contrary. A failure to clearly determine Russia's interests would lead to misunderstandings. Every major power should clearly determine its zone of influence. A possible impression that Russia does not have individual interests at all would not be a good thing. [Vida] In other words, Russia should be recognized as a major power. [Migranyan] The Soviet Union had very clearly declared interests, complete with the means needed for the assertion of these interests. As the legal successor of the Soviet Union, Russia must again find its place in international politics. Uncertainty in this respect will only increase the camp of supporters of Zhirinovskiy and the like, and of communists, because their main complaint is that no one in the world counts on Russia any longer. Therefore, despite all their sympathy toward the West, the realists, and I am one of them, admit that we must clarify the things deriving from Russia's major power status. This is why I categorically oppose the demagogic practice of using the "Russian threat" to justify the need to expand NATO. Our former allies in Central and Eastern Europe are not led primarily by a real fear from Russia or the desire to join NATO; they are playing this card to join the Council of Europe as soon as possible and, in the meantime, to receive as many trade benefits and monetary injections as possible. We will not allow ourselves to be taken in by this demagogy. We can also mention Zhirinovskiy, because a few more such initiatives and power will fall into the arms of Zhirinovskiy. I was one of those who publicly urged discarding the Brezhnev-doctrine, but one of our main arguments at that time was that no one wants to fill the vacuum left by the Soviet Union in Central and Eastern Europe. Such agreements emerged later. The German reunification did not take place in order to allow NATO to expand. The fact that Soviet Union collapsed does not exempt the West and the United States from the obligations they took upon themselves at the end of the eighties. One should not forget that, in the meantime, Russia got even farther from the region, and it has become weaker in every respect that the former Soviet Union. It is ridiculous to come up with the "Russian threat" today. [Vida] One of the conclusions of your studies is that the post-Soviet region is the first test of the partnership relations between Russia and the West, where the West has to recognize Russia's special role. Has Clinton's visit given any hopes in this respect? [Migranyan] The United States is exercising pressure on Ukraine in the nuclear arms affair. In Clinton's presence, Yeltsin made a tough statement about the situation of the Russian population in the Baltic states. They probably reached a certain agreement on the use of Russian troops as peace-keeping troops in the crisis points of the former Soviet Union: over the Caucasus, in Tadjikistan. It seems that the idea that Russia plays a particular role in guaranteeing stability in Euro-Asia is met with increasing support and understanding in the leading Western power. [Vida] In your study, you repeatedly emphasized that the borders between the successor states, including Russia's borders, were determined artificially and they are far from being final. What do you suggest by this? [Migranyan] Nothing more than the fact that, for the time being, we do not even know where Russia's borders lie: The situation of Chechnya, Tuva, Tatarstan, and Baskyria is flexible. The same way, Georgia's borders or Ukraine's borders are also unclear, because it has not been decided whether they will remain as independent states at all. The border issue first of all depends on this and, therefore, it would be too early to close the issue definitely. Because of the unsettled state of the successor states, the borders between them do not yet have the same function as the borders between other countries with many centuries of history. [Vida] How do you envisage the future of the CIS? [Migranyan] I am optimistic, because the latest reintegration process does not derive from subjective causes or the moods of a certain politician, but from objective factors. The former Soviet republics faced the fact that they are not expected anywhere and they have no place to join. Otherwise, they would not turn again toward Russia and toward one another. At the same time, Russia is not interested in forcing the reintegration process, because, with this, it would automatically take extra economic burdens upon itself. In my opinion, Moscow is absolutely aware of this.
