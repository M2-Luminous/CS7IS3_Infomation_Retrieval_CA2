Babenko, TORGOVAYA GAZETA correspondent, under the rubric "Ukraine": "Prices Are Not Stinging Any More, They Are Murderous"] [Text] Dima the hairdresser, whose client I have been for many years, finished his fancy manipulations on my head and, with many apologies, asked me to pay 50,000 karbovantsi for a regular haircut. "What can you do?" complained the hairdresser with a touch of melancholy. "Such wild expenses for rent, water and sewage, electricity..." Generally speaking, the March prices in Kiev defy all description. I made a tour of the neighboring food stores and, within some 30 minutes, dropped 100,000 karbovantsi. Here it is: 300 grams of bologna-type sausage for 25,000; the same amount of butter for 30,000; 10 eggs for 24,000; five kilos of potatoes for 15,000; a liter of milk for 10,000; and two loaves of bread for 6,000. The average salary, meanwhile, equals now 763,000 karbovantsi a month in the federal sector, or from 587,000 to 362,000 in the fields of trade, municipal services, education, and health care. The prices in Kiev are simply murderous. But even then groceries may not cost all that much if we recalculate the prices in Russian rubles at the rate of 1 to 23. But in Ukrainian terms this is just a nightmare. It is true that prices are terrorizing everybody. At the Kiev railroad terminal you had better stay away from porters if you have less than 100,000 karbovantsi. A ride in a taxi cab used to cost five Soviet rubles four years ago, but now it costs 300,000 karbovantsi already. One can easily guess that the reasons for all this lie on the surface. According to the official data of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers administration for the economy, the amount of consumer goods manufactured in January and February of this year was 36 percent lower than in the same period of last year, the volume of manufactured goods dropped by 41 percent, etc. When she heard about my haircut problems, a friend of mine who is a doctor with a candidate's degree in medicine offered to perform this service free of charge. Her hair-cutting skill was duly appreciated by my relatives and neighbors. A doctor of technical sciences whom I had known since our student years told me, not without a certain degree of smugness, that he has been repairing shoes for a year, and he promised to teach me this very profitable trade. Generally, like the people of the besieged Oriental city in the legend, the residents of Kiev are not crying any more. They are laughing. But very, very bitterly.
