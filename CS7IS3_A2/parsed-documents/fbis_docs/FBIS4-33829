"We still do not have the final (peace) agreements, but the decision to respect the cease-fire has been affirmed, and we maintain the commitment to seek a political solution in favor of peace," Camacho said after meeting with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. On Sunday, Camacho Solis stated the government's position with regard to an announcement made by the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) that the first phase of the dialogue for peace is over. The EZLN also called for a national dialogue with the participation of the country's "progressive and independent" sectors and announced that it will not prevent the holding of general elections on 21 August "in territories under its control." The armed group, which forcefully occupied several towns in the State of Chiapas on 1 January, also unilaterally extended an offensive cease-fire and thanked the peace commissioner for his efforts to find a political conflict to the conflict. Camacho announced during a news conference that the government agreed to maintain invariably a 12 January decision that the Mexican Army establish a unilateral cease-fire for all armed offensive actions (...) unless attacked. He added that patrols and relief operations will continue to be carried out at the southern border and that measures will be maintained in view of the possible mobilization of weapons and explosives within the region of conflict. This measure seeks to prevent other groups in the area from arming themselves and provoking confrontations among communities and organizations, he said. Camacho added that the solutions the government offered to the problems of justice and development, which are contained in the 32 commitments of the dialogue in San Cristobal, will be applied to other (?communities), which are not involved in the conflict, because they are fair. Likewise, he said the state government will strengthen the dialogue and negotiation mechanisms in the areas under its control, and that, regarding the EZLN topics, he will request the participation of San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who is the mediator. The commissioner pointed out that the EZLN insists on his intention to be recognized as a militant force, which is not possible under any circumstance, "because it would undermine national sovereignty and the integrity of our territory." He added that "this would lead to interference by international forces in a Mexican domestic matter." Governor of Chiapas Javier Lopez Moreno also announced tonight that he will be responsible for fulfilling the 32 commitments reached with the EZLN in the peace talks and that Commissioner Camacho Solis will only intervene in the "delicate" cases.
