This was pointed out by Kinkel in Athens this morning after talks with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev. The letter by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, has created favorable preconditions for a settlement in Bosnia, he stated. However, Kinkel warned against too much enthusiasm. "The NATO ultimatum will continue to be valid. It apparently had the desired effect." To achieve a peaceful settlement in Bosnia, Russia must by all means be involved in the talks. Kozyrev stated in Athens that the promise by the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their weapons in exchange for the deployment of 400-500 Russian blue berets in and around Sarajevo is the "beginning of the end of the war in Bosnia." A new round of political dialogue between Russia and the European Union started in Athens this morning. It is being attended by the executive foreign ministers of the European Union from Belgium, Greece -- which currently holds the chairmanship of the European Union -- and its successor Germany. Referring to Greece's unilateral action against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- it closed the port of Salonika for all deliveries to and from Skopje -- Kinkel stressed that this was an "unusual step that does not correspond to practices within the community." Exerting pressure is no instrument for settling such issues. "We do not need a destabilization of Macedonia," he pointed out.
