The full text of the presidential spokesman's statement follows: The head of state has always stressed, in his statements to the nation, his commitment to implement all political, economic, social, and security targets contained in the platform the National Dialogue Commission endorsed. In this framework, a presidential statement on 18 March 1994 was announced on the head of state's intentions to resume political dialogue and received for that reason national figures, political parties, economic and social associations. Accordingly, as of 19 March and until now, the head of state held discussions during the first phase with national personalities and representatives of the Movement for Democracy in Algeria, Party of Algerian Renewal, Ennahda, Ettahadi movement, National Liberation Front [FLN], Hamas, as well as representatives of the following social and economic organizations: National Organization of War Veterans, General Union of Algerian Workers, National Union of Framers, National Association of Public Administration Cadres, National Organization of Martyrs' Sons, National Union of Public Contractors, confederation of association of managers of local public enterprises, Confereation of Algeruab employers, genreal confederation of Algerian economic operators, Union of Algerian Students, retired staff of the National People's Army and Youth and women's associations. During all those meetings, the head of state clarified and specified what he meant by serious dialogue -- without excluding anyone -- within the framework of respecting the constitution. It is a constructive framework capable of bringing together all Algerians concerned about the country's security and interest of its people. The head of state stressed that serious dialogue was such that dealt with current problems facing the nation. They were urgent problems that required urgent and quick solutions. The head of state also said dialogue that did not exclude anyone and respected the constitution was one that accepted differences in opinion. However, it was on the condition that these opinions fell within the framework of respecting the constitution, that principal law which formed the nation's common denominator, and was the primary guarantee for the promotion of democracy. Accordingly, respect for the constitution rules out all dialogue with all those who violate it by resorting to violence. The head of state added that terrorism, violence, and the attempt to sabotage the country was a matter that necessitated mobilizing all nationalists to eradicate these phenomena by all means and methods provided by the law and the country's sovereignty. He said that the state, on its part, was determined to shoulder all its responsibilities to confront this violence and to firmly and continuously fight it. But he added that the security solution alone was not sufficient. It is true. Just as it emerged in the platform endorsed by the national conference, security work must be consolidated by political action. These culmulative actions are aimed at tearing out the roots of violence forever from our society. The president took this opportunity to provide clarifications on the contacts he carried out with the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. In this context, the head of state reminded that many parties had proposed taking appeasing measures to put a stop to the phenomenon of violence throughout the dialogue process by the National Dialogue Commission. At the same time, the leaders of that suspended movement expressed their readiness to work towards putting a stop to violence and restoring calm. Mr. Lamine Zeroual, who then met personally with FIS officials in his capacity as national defense minister, got their commitment to work in that direction. Appeasing measures were taken by the government, including the release of two FIS personalities with the agreement of the other detained leaders. Those two personalities were given a mandate by their colleagues to carry out the commitments they made to put a stop to terrorism and for the return of calm and security. These commitments have not yet been implemented until our present day. But the head of state insisted on clarifying that the national values and constitutional principles are unnegotiable, just as defending the country's unity, security, and citizens were. During these talks, the head of state reminded those he spoke to that during the transitional period, he would remain attentive to epitomize all the aims contained in the platform endorsed by the national conference. He added that this result would enable the existence of necessary conditions for the return to elections, which was everyone's aim. The head of state expressed his hopes that the dialogue would allow the entwining of efforts and collective energy to epitomize all these aims. The meetings, which the head of state convened during the last two weeks, recorded vast feelings on the dangerous state the country was going through. Those he spoke to said they were prepared to promote this dialogue to serve the nation's higher interests. Thank you. [end recording]
