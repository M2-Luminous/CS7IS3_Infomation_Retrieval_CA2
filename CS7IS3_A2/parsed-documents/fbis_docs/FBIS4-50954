The achievements in the protection of legitimate rights and interests of the intellectual property right owners in China has attracted worldwide attention. Statistics showed that from 1986 to the end of 1993, China's courts have handled a total of 3,505 preliminary intellectual property cases. Among them, 1,783 relate to patent matters, 1,168 cases were filed for copyright infringements and 554 cases were lodged for trademark infringement. Liu Jiyang, chief secretary of the China Intellectual Property Society, said that as China's legal authorities stick to "fair and just" principles, China has moved closer to the international standards in the enforcement of intellectual property legislation. Before July 1993 there was no special division in courts for handling intellectual property cases. Cases concerning intellectual property were tried by the economic division and the civil division respectively. Since Beijing was the city in which the number of intellectual property disputes was the highest in the country, the Beijing Higher People's Court and the Intermediate People's Court set up their intellectual property divisions at the same time in July 1993, which was the first such division set up in Chinese courts. Since the beginning of this year, the higher people's court and some of the intermediate people's courts in Shanghai Municipality, Guangdong Province, Fujian Province and Hainan Province have all set up intellectual property divisions. Su Chi, presiding judge of the intellectual property division of the Beijing Intermediate People's Court, said that the cases accepted by the division covered all kinds of intellectual property cases. They include cases involving disputes over patents, trade marks, copyright (including the copyright in computer software), non-patented technology and various cases concerning the violation of the principle that honesty and credibility shall be observed and infringement of others' trade reputation and trade secrets. Since the establishment of the division, it has accepted 217 intellectual property cases, among which 21 were relating to foreign countries and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. The total sum claimed in all these cases amounted to 156 million renminbi yuan. Su Chi said that the intellectual property cases were all tried by collegiate panels in the division. In cases of a complicated technical nature, such as cases involving patents and computer software disputes, expert assessors are invited to join the panel, Su said. "However, in most cases, the panel consists of judges only," Su added. When technical problems are involved in a case, explanation or evaluation made by at least two experts should be heard in court. As Su Chi put it, all the intellectual property cases were heard in public. He said that the division not only announces the time of court sessions in accordance with the procedures provided by the law, but also distribute ahead of schedule the time list of the court sessions to the public every month. According to statistics, more than 3,000 people sat in court within more than half a year. Su Chi pointed out that among the various intellectual property cases accepted by the division, infringement cases made up 80 percent of the total. He said that the principle in dealing with infringement disputes was that once the infringing act is proved by evidence, the court should order the infringer to stop the infringing act and to compensate for all the damage that the rights-holder suffered because of the infringement according to the claim of the rights-holder and the provisions of the law. The amount of the damages should be such as to properly compensate for the losses of the rights-holder and to stop any further infringement. Su gave the example of the case in which the Beijing Vie de France Food Co. sued the Beijing Sunshine City Department Store. He pointed out that it was the first case in China's intellectual property trials that the reasonable expenses for the investigation of the infringing act and of the litigation is deemed to be part of the economic loss and is borne by the infringer, as ordered in the judgment. Su explained that the reason was that the "full compensation" principle of the Chinese civil law should be fully implemented so that the damage sustained by the infringed party can be fully compensated for and they can have less worries about the economic expense when they launch a legal struggle against the infringer. Besides, Su added, the judgment also took into consideration the principles provided by the Uruguay Round Intellectual Property Agreement. In the past 14 years, China has established a complete legal system for the protection of intellectual property rights. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress enacted the laws governing trademark, patent, copyright and anti-unfair competition subsequently. In 1992 and 1993, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted the revised Patent Law and Trademark Law, extending the protection of the Patent Law to such objects as chemical substances, pharmaceuticals, food, beverages and flavorings. The patent rights became applicable to importation while process patents now became applicable to products. Furthermore, trademark protection has been extended to service marks and harsher penalties for trademark infringement acts have been imposed. China has also been participating actively in the international cooperation in this field, fulfilling the international obligations and joining international organizations. Dr. Arpad Bogsch, secretary-general of the World Intellectual Property Organization, highly praised China, saying: "In the history of intellectual property, China has made these achievements at a speed second to none."
