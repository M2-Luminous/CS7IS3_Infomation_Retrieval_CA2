He worked at the scientific-research institute of measurement devices (Novosibirsk) from 1958 to 1987 and became director of this institute in 1970. In 1987, Yuriy Aleksandrovich was appointed Ground Radar Weapons Chief Designer. He coordinates the work of enterprises in the cities of Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Pravdinsk, and Murom that are developing and producing radar systems. Prior to the breakup of the USSR, this group also included the enterprise that is located in Ukraine (Zaporozhye). The Chief Designer's residence is located at the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Radio Equipment. Yuriy Aleksandrovich Kuznetsov is the lead designer of the S-300V and S-300P Air Defense Missile Systems' detection radars and their modernization. Yuriy Aleksandrovich has been awarded orders of the USSR and has been awarded the rank of Lenin Prize Laureate for contributions in the development of radar weapons. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, you have a wealth of experience in the development of standardized radar weapons. Please tell us what goals were set in this work and what successes have been achieved? [Kuznetsov] Radars are utilized by various consumers who often make incompatible demands on them. This is one of the reasons why it is impossible to get by with one type of radar. Another reason consists of the fact that substantially different frequency ranges are employed in radars and therefore radar components that depend on frequency (antennas, transmitters and receivers) cannot be identical. The problem of standardization is reduced to the substantiation and development of the minimally acceptable standardization. The benefit of standardization is obvious: the economic impact during development, production, operation, and repair of radars and during the training of personnel. Therefore, the idea of standardization has long attracted both developers and also customers of radars. This idea is being implemented in two directions: the development of radars that can be utilized for different purposes and the development of standardized components (assemblies, systems) that are designed for various types of radars. The first direction is fundamentally possible only in the event that the identical frequency range is being utilized and there is no great divergence among the requirements made on the radar by various consumers. The second direction encompasses assemblies of the identical frequency range that are part of various radars and also a device that does not depend on the frequency range being utilized (power sources, display devices, and others). Standardization of this equipment is possible for various radars. Implementation of standardization consists of finding a compromise between incompatible requirements. Either a concession to the requirements or complication of the items (rational satisfaction of requirements) is the solution to the task. The latter entails certain excesses in the item for each consumer but permits us to have a single standardized item. Let's illustrate this in the simplest everyday example. A requirement exists for the production of an electric shaver with different voltages: 220V and 110V. We can produce two items: one for 220V and another for 110V. But we can produce an electric shaver with a power voltage switch which, naturally, complicates the item. However, that standardization permits us to produce one item (instead of two), to increase series production and, on the whole -- to obtain an economic impact. Of course, it is much more complicated for radars than in the example cited but the main sense is the same: standardization can be accompanied by the complication of the radar. Therefore, we need to decide if the end result is justified. Furthermore, we need to take into account that its solution strongly depends on subjective factors and on the organization of work as a result of the compromise nature of the standardization task. In our country, there is definite experience in the development of standardized radars. We can cite the P-37 radar as a positive example of standardization. The P-37 found employment in the Ground forces, the PVO Troops, the Air Force and in civil aviation. We can indicate some results on the standardization of radars through the example of the work of the NII of Measurement Instruments (NIIIP) at which I began my work career and where the ideas of standardization were being realized already from the end of the 1950's. The first airborne target detection radar that met Ground Forces requirements was developed at the institute. The "Bronya" Rangefinder Radar was installed on an off-road armored tracked self-propelled vehicle and the deployment and teardown times totaled five minutes. This radar was dual-purpose: for utilization as part of the "Krug" Air Defense Missile Complex and as part of a radar site. Table 1.

Two three-dimensional surveillance radars that are mounted on tracked self-propelled mounts and that have a teardown and deployment time of five minutes were developed in the 1970's-1980's. One of them, the "Obzor-3" Radar with a 250-300 km operating range, is being utilized as part of the S-300V Air Defense Missile System and also at Ground Troops radar posts. The second radar, a lighter type, "Kupol", has an operating range of 100-150 km and is a "Buk" Air Defense Missile Complex detection and target designation radar and is part of radar posts. All of these radars will be repeatedly modernized in the future. The results cited have turned out to be possible primarily thanks to organizational decisions (one customer, one enterprise-radar developer for various applications) and through the joint efforts of the customer and the developer to standardize the requirements for the radar and also to minimize the complications of the radar. With regard to the standardization of units and systems, that is, radar components, I need to say the following. Many units that are part of various radars fulfill identical functions. Therefore, when several developments are carried out at one enterprise or under the management of one lead designer, all of these units, as a rule, are common for all of the developments. When the frequency range coincides, the mutual standardization of the radar device is higher. For example, the previously mentioned device for the "Obzor-3" Radar and the S-300P detection radar system was standardized by more than 50%. A high level of standardization can also be achieved for units that do not depend on frequency range (power sources, displays, and so forth). However, when the organizational conditions are not complied with, then the components in various developments will be different, especially if the customer does not specially stipulate the need to utilize standardized units and systems in his requirements. There were several radar customers in the USSR Ministry of Defense and that same situation is being preserved in the Russian Ministry of Defense. The conditions for radar usage for various customers have their distinctive features. These are the objective difficulties of standardization. But there are also subjective difficulties. Each of the customers has his own traditions, his own distinctive features, and each considers himself to be more correct, therefore, coordination among them is impeded. Receipt of identical technical tasks for radars from different customers have practically been excluded. To develop a standardized radar, it is necessary for the various customers' primary requirements for it (target detection range, throughput, accuracy, and operating range) to be sufficiently close. However, I repeat, even in this case the development of a standardized radar can not occur due to organizational difficulties which emerge when there are several customers. Therefore, it is necessary that the interests of all consumers be submitted by one customer. The Ministry of Defense has examples of that organization of work. Furthermore, I need to point out that two lead designers, even working on one and the same technical task, will never develop identical radars. This is associated with the fact that modern radars are very complex items; different experts will assess the significance of various parameters and various technical solutions in different ways. Therefore, the development of standardized radars is only possible under the management of one chief designer. We have arrived at the conclusion on the advisability of the following organizational regulations to ensure standardization: a single technical task, one customer, and one lead designer. Analysis of the capabilities, substantiation of the feasibility of standardization and development of a single technical task is an important phase in the work on standardization. The Chief Designer, who heads the Lead Designers Council, along with the customers, is called upon to accomplish these functions. Cooperation between the Chief Designer, customers and the developing enterprises is carried out primarily on the basis of previously established ties since the Russian Federation Government has so far not introduced the institute of chief designers on equipment directions. (As of today, the activity of chief designers is determined by an interim decision of our department.) Unfortunately, the Chief Designer's impact on the work of other enterprises is weak: the Chief Designer's decisions are only recommendatory in nature for these enterprises. It would be more appropriate if the Ministry of Defense concluded contracts with the Chief Designer, but then again in a number of cases, it would be advisable to have a contract not on an individual system but on a weapons complex, for example, a radiotechnical company radar weapon. The Chief Designer himself will be able to determine the developers of individual systems, conclude contracts with them, and will coordinate their work. Then not only would standardized radar weapons be developed but many issues for connecting individual systems, their support by auxiliary equipment, and the issues of the organization of operation and maintenance would also be resolved. It occurs that way in practice when a customer assigns the development of an air defense missile complex to one Chief (lead) Designer. If the customer issued a task to each co-developer of individual elements of this complex, significant major difficulties would arise during its development. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, could you cover the work of the Lead Designers Council in more detail and also the Interdepartmental Coordinating Council on Radar which previously existed under USSR Minradioprom [Ministry of the Radio Industry]? [Kuznetsov] The Lead Designers Council was founded in 1988 as a consultative organ. The Council formally existed until 1991, that is, until the breakup of the USSR. The substantiation of the standardization of radars that is necessary for the development of a single radar field and proposals for the development of standardized components for all radars was the primary result of the Council's work. The Council's recommendations were adopted for implementation in the project for a single radar field and were included in the (union) Arms Program and the recommendations on standardization of components are being partially implemented (for example, on the development of a secondary processing device and secondary power sources). The Deputy Minister of the USSR Radio Industry headed the Interdepartmental Coordinating Council (ICC) on Detection Radars. As a consultative organ, it had a broad spectrum of tasks on this equipment direction, including on standardization issues. Specifically, the ICC reviewed common requirements for standardized series of radars. However, coordination of requirements on specific models of each series was carried out with difficulty. Here the primary difficulty was created once again due to the presence of several customers. Still, we managed to implement some of these projects. Two variants of the "Kasta-2" low-flying target detection radars were developed. They were standardized for employment by two consumers. Several standardized radars of another series are being developed on behalf of various Armed Forces services. There is a high level of inter-project standardization in the radars being developed, although this relates more to the developments that are being conducted at one enterprise. However, I must say that the level of standardization for radars on the whole can be increased even further. Furthermore, the Ministry of the Radio Industry ICC did a great deal to organize specialized production, beginning with standardized base load-bearing structures (the structure of an electronic module, unit, or cabinet) and ending with technologically specific production (rotation drives, magnesium casting and others), which created more favorable conditions for employment of standardized solutions on radar components. Similar measures, including the creation of ICC-type organs, are timely even at the present time. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] How do you assess the technical level of our modern radars as compared to foreign radars? [Kuznetsov] I already discussed that in a July 1992 KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interview. We have better results on a number of developments. We developed metric band radars with sufficiently high technical specifications. There are no equivalents abroad and the metric band radar has advantages on detection of small airborne targets and targets manufactured using "Stealth" technology. Antiradiation missiles cannot be aimed against these radars. The high mobility of many types of radars, especially those that were developed based upon a Ground Troops order, is another of our advantages. But then again, I need to say that high mobility has been achieved with other good specifications. So, pulse tuning of the carrier frequency and a dual frequency signal were already realized in the 1960's in the "Bronya" radar. The "Obzor-3" and "Kupol" radars are 3-D radars and have adaptive capabilities. An antenna in the shape of an original waveguide array was employed in these radars which permitted us to obtain the first side lobes at a level of up to minus 35-40 db and a detection zone based on elevation of up to 45-55�. Furthermore, these antennas have high technological effectiveness. Further, we developed good klystron [reflection oscillator]-type transmitters. They have a broadbandness of 6-7%, have an average output of 10-20 kVt, and also stacked magnets instead of solenoids. We don't know of any foreign klystrons with these specifications. I can cite another entire series of technical solutions on which we have an adequately high level (high-voltage power sources and certain others). However, we also lag behind. This is in regard to computer equipment and circuitry items (for example, digital microcircuits, analog-digital transformers, and powerful semiconductor instruments). The lag in the sphere of circuitry is resulting in a situation where some domestically-produced radars consume more energy and their weight and size specifications are worse than foreign radars. On the whole, I can say that, in the sum total of specifications, individual types of our radars have a high technical level and, in principle, are quite competitive on the world market. Additionally, we can play on the low unit cost of our radars, that is, they sell for prices that are lower than the prices of their foreign equivalents. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Continuing the last thought, what can you say about the successes of domestically-produced radars on the international arms market? [Kuznetsov] We are making our first steps in this sphere. One and half to two years ago, we understood that, on the one hand, we must primarily rely on ourselves and not on the state. On the other hand, that we can earn quite a bit through sales of our equipment on the world market and that we have something to sell on that market. In practice, we have participated in only two international arms exhibitions: at "Mosaeroshow" in August 1992 and at "IDEX-93" in February 1993. We demonstrated the following domestically-produced radars (in the form of mockups, television videos, and information sheets) at Abu Dhabi: "Nebo-SV", "Nebo", Kasta-2E1", Kasta-2E2", "Obzor-3" as part of the S-300V Air Defense Missile System, a radar post that is part of the S-300PMU1 Air Defense Missile System, and "Kupol" as part of the "Buk" Air Defense Missile Complex. There was a great deal of interest in this equipment even though we didn't display any actual models. We demonstrated actual models of the "Nebo", "Nebo-SV", "Obzor", "Kupol" and Kasta-2E1" radars at the "Mosaeroshow-92" exhibition. The exhibitions taught us a great deal. First of all, we saw that "Kasta" type radars are valued at $6-8 million on the world market, that is, the profitability of these items will be very high for us if we manage to sell them on the international market. For now, the sale of our models is being carried out without our direct participation through specialized foreign trade organizations. So far, the organization of arms sales in Russia is distinguished very little from how it occurred in the USSR. Existing foreign trade organizations are not resolving and cannot resolve service and engineering issues. The principle has remained as before: "Sold and forgotten". The world's leading countries and firms don't sell like that. We must also master the entire chain that is associated with arms sales. We need to place the arms developer and manufacturer at the center of the problem. Russian law states that arms sales are a state monopoly. This is correct but this needs to be carried out rationally -- through the issuance of arms sales licenses to enterprises by the state. All enterprises cannot have experts on all sales issues. Therefore, we do not need to destroy the existing foreign trade structures. They must be utilized but the manufacturer must be the main actor in the sale. So far, the issue of the developers' participation in sales has not been resolved. Here we need to proceed from the fact that arms sales can be successful only when we, as sellers, organize concern on the entire life cycle of the weapon being sold. This includes maintenance, operations training, concern about modernization, its implementation for weapons that have already been sold, and so forth. That approach requires the mandatory participation of the developer. In some cases, the developer needs to assume responsibility for many operational issues. Only professionals can operate complex items and therefore the developing firm can also provide radar crews. I can cite an example. The American AN/TPS-117 and AN/TPS-124 radars are serviced by specialists from General Electric, the firm that developed them. Naturally, the firm supports the operation of these radars for an additional payment. And, finally, it would be advisable for us to sell not individual items but series of subsystems that are united in a system. This cannot be carried out without the developer. Foreign trade organizations cannot organize and support this entire weapons life cycle and complex approach. Today, our lack of experience is being manifested in relatively simple issues. For example, take information servicing. A catalog of exhibition participants with the specifications of the exhibitions was printed at Abu Dhabi. There was no information in it on the content of Russia's exhibitions, only the participant from Russia -- "Oboroneksport" VO [Foreign Trade Association] -- was indicated, but it is difficult to find in the catalog what that association is demonstrating at the exhibition. For example, there is a "Tanks" section in the catalog's index: all of the firms (countries)-exhibitors are listed in it except for our "Oboroneksport". There is not even a mention of the T-80 Tank in the catalog even though it caused a furor at the exhibition. The same thing occurred with other equipment. Exhibition participants and visitors from throughout the world took the catalog with them which does not contain all of the required information on Russian equipment. We are grateful to "Oboroneksport" for organizing participation of a large group of military equipment developers and manufacturers in the exhibition at Abu Dhabi. That was useful. But we understand that the level of foreign sales activity will not be raised without the direct participation of the developers.
