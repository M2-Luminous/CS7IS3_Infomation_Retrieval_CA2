Considering this, the Russian side has not cancelled plans Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis' visit to Moscow, and the preparation for the visit is going on, a spokesman for the ministry, Grigoriy Karasin, told a briefing in Moscow Tuesday in an answer to an Interfax question. Karasin pointed out that Latvia had been given the necessary explanations by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov in the wake of the incident. "We can officially denounce this resolution which emerged as a result of a technical mistake. However, we do not understand Latvia's dissatisfaction with the explanations already given," Karasin was quoted as saying. As has already been reported, the Latvian Foreign Ministry believes that neither Russo-Latvian summit, nor contacts on the level of state delegations are possible until the Russian president himself makes a formal denunciation of the resolution. Karasin called on the Latvian leadership to "start making real politics instead of fanning up an incident which has already been settled."
