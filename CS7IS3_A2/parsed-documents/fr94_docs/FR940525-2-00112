FR940525-2-00112 FR940525-2-00064 Date of amendment request: April 22, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would modify the Millstone Unit 2 Technical Specification Table 3.3&hyph;9 by eliminating the measurement range of 10 ^1 &hyph;10 4 counts per second (CPS) for the entry regarding the ``Wide Range Logarithmic Neutron Flux Monitor.'' Also the amendment would correct a few typographical and editorial errors on page V of the Index for the Millstone Unit 2 Technical Specifications. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: NNECO [Northeast Nuclear Energy Company] has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10 CFR 50.90 and has concluded that the changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. NNECO's proposal to eliminate the CPS scale for the ``Wide Range Logarithmic Neutron Flux Monitor'' entry in Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification Table 3.3&hyph;9 will not affect the ability of Millstone Unit No. 2 to meet the intent and purpose of panel C&hyph;21's original design. The 10 ^8 % to 100% power scale overlaps the CPS scale. The range of 10 ^8 % to 100% power for the ``Wide Range Logarithmic Neutron Flux Monitor'' is adequate to permit the operators to bring the unit to hot shutdown from outside the control room. Also, the instruments on C&hyph;21 are not used to provide the start-up rate signal during start-up or refueling operations. This proposed license amendment does not impact the performance of any safety-related component, system, or structure. A review of the original design drawings concluded that this proposed change is consistent with the original plant design, and reflects the actual as-built condition of the unit. The original design drawings show that the wide range logarithmic neutron flux indicators only receive a percent power signal. NNECO's proposals to rectify a few typographical and editorial errors on page V of the Index for the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications are administrative in nature. They ensure that the Index accurately reflects the contents of the technical specifications. Based on the above, the proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed license amendment does not impact the performance of any safety-related component, system, or structure. Panel C&hyph;21 is required to permit the operators to bring the unit to a hot shutdown condition from a location outside the control room. Deleting the CPS range for the ``Wide Range Logarithmic Neutron Flux Monitor'' does not affect the ability of the operators to accomplish this function. Also, the proposed change is consistent with the original design of the plant. The proposed license amendment cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident form any previously analyzed. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. NNECO's proposal to eliminate the CPS scale for the wide range logarithmic neutron flux monitors will not affect the ability of Millstone Unit No. 2 to meet the intent and purpose of panel C&hyph;21's original design. The 10 ^8 % to 100% power scale overlaps the CPS scale. The range of 10 ^8 % to 100% power for the ``Wide Range Logarithmic Neutron Flux Monitor'' is adequate to permit the operators to bring the unit to hot shutdown from outside of the control room. Also, the instruments on C&hyph;21 are not used to provide the start-up rate signal during start-up or refueling operations. This proposed license amendment does not impact the performance of any safety-related component, system, or structure. Therefore, this proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, et al., Docket No. 50&hyph;336, Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, New London County, Connecticut Date of amendment request: April 25, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would change the Technical Specifications concerning four related issues: (1) Power-operated relief valve (PORV) and block valve reliability; (2) low-temperature overpressure protection (LTOP); (3) boron dilution; and (4) shutdown risk management. Specifically, the proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications 3.4.3 and 3.4.9.3 to address the issues specifically raised in Generic Letter (GL) 90&hyph;06. Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 3.4.1.4, 3.4.2.1, 3.4.9.1, 3.5.3, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.1.2.4, 4.4.1.4, 4.4.3.1., 4.4.3.2, 4.4.9.3.1, 4.4.9.3.2, 4.5.3.2 and 4.9.8.1 would be revised to provide consistency with the proposed changes in GL 90&hyph;06 or are related to the boron dilution issue or shutdown risk management philosophies. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The proposed changes do not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated.
