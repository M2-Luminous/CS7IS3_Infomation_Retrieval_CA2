Security Council on the huge loss Jordan has suffered as a result of the international sanctions against Iraq. The king briefed the ambassadors from the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, on the severe economic loss on the kingdom brought about by the enforcers imposing sanctions against Iraq. The U.S.-led enforcers were earlier reported to have stepped up efforts to inspect Aqaba-bound ships recently, triggering an outcry in the kingdom. The parliament last week called on the government to link Jordan's return to the Arab-Israeli negotiation table with the lifting of the blockade of Aqaba, and the kingdom subsequently lodged a protest with the United States against the siege. Information Minister Jawad al'Anani said Saturday [26 March] that the U.S.-led task force monitoring the trade embargo against Iraq has inspected a total of 1,700 vessels since 1991 but has not detected any contraband materials in breach of the embargo. Only food and medical supplies are exempt from the sanctions. In recent months, Jordanian officials have lodged complaints for many times with visiting foreign dignitaries including U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. On Saturday, a cargo ship carrying freight for Jordan coming through the Red Sea will be inspected on shore instead of high seas in what was viewed as a precedent-setting event, the first since the imposition of international sanctions against Iraq. The ship, a 13,000-tonne German vessel carrying 3,000 tonnes of general cargo for Jordan, was prevented from proceeding toward Aqaba on March 18 by the U.S.-led enforcers. After four inspections, the enforcers ruled on Wednesday that the ship, Skyman, could not be allowed to proceed to Aqaba since they did not have "accessibility" to inspect some of the cargo. The vessel proceeded to a gulf port to unload cargo destined there before returning to the Red Sea for a new inspection with better cargo accessibility. One source said that "it was half way to a gulf port from the Red Sea when an agreement was reached after the Jordanian Government intervention that the vessel could be inspected at Aqaba port rather than the Tiran Straits," where the inspections usually take place. "Subsequently, it was recalled to Aqaba," he said. It was not immediately known what response the ambassadors had made in the meeting with the king, but observers here said that the summon of the ambassadors was a continued effort by the kingdom to lift the siege of Aqaba.
