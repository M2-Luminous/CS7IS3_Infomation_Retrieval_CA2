Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias arrived at Zurich-Kloten Airport from Athens on Tuesday [3 May] morning. His Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi had arrived in Zurich on Monday evening. The holding of the talks and the issues to be discussed were still uncertain on Tuesday morning. The Greek Embassy is referring all requests for information to the Foreign Ministry in Athens. The meeting was proposed two weeks ago in Greece after a border incident triggered a political crisis. On 13 April, three days after the fatal attack against a border Albanian military camp by Greek nationalists, Albania expelled four Greek diplomats from Tirana. Greece reacted by evicting an Albanian diplomat. New skirmishes broke out over the weekend between Greece and Albania on the occasion of the Orthodox Easter celebrations. Greece threatened to cancel the Zurich meeting. On Sunday, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou hinted that the talks might take place anyway. On Monday evening, around 1,000 Albanians demonstrated in front of the Greek Consulate. They denounced the "aggressions against Albanians" and pleaded for a return to peace in the Balkans.
