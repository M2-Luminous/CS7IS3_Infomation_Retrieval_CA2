FBIS4-57166 "drlat093_c_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-093 Daily Report 10 May 1994 MEXICO Industry Association: AFL-CIO Suit Thwarts NAFTA Industry Association: AFL-CIO Suit Thwarts NAFTA PA1205141694 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 10 May 94 p 25 PA1205141694 Mexico City EL FINANCIERO Spanish BFN [Text] Nuevo Laredo, Tamps [Tamaulipas], 9 May -- The suit filed by the U.S. AFL-CIO against Magneticos de Mexico, a Sony subsidiary on this side of the border, for allegedly mistreating its workers is an attempt to hinder the implementation of NAFTA and the potential opening of new assembly plants in the country. Ricardo Lopez Santos, president of the National Association of the Processing Industry (Canacintra), has criticized the "obscure interests" of the AFL-CIO and U.S. congressmen who want to capitalize on the problem and thwart the trade agreement. The AFL-CIO suit was supported by 25 U.S. congressmen, headed by Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and Majority Whip David Bonior. According to the AFL-CIO, union delegates pressured workers of the Magneticos de Mexico assembly plant to vote against their favorite representatives. This suit reportedly is the second suit filed by the U.S. labor organization since NAFTA went into effect less than five months ago. Lopez said: "They are expressing opinions on a problem which they know nothing about. They are trying to capitalize on it to halt the trade agreement and prevent other companies from opening businesses on the border because of an apparent state of violence." Lopez said that Sony did not pressure its workers. The plant facilities were blocked due to union rather than labor-management problems.
