The defense minister, Dr. Yeo Ning Hong, made this point at the airpower conference held in Australia today. He said the ability to manage tensions could prevent the Asia-Pacific from turning into a basin of turbulence and conflict. Dr. Yeo pointed out that the outlook in the region is not an entirely rosy one, with North Korea's nuclear ambition and the dispute over the Spratlys. With the uncertainties ahead, having a strong defense capability is important for each country. Dr. Yeo stressed that the relationship between the U.S., Japan, and China are instrumental to regional stability.
