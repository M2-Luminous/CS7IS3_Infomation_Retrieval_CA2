Kinkel said the reports and documents presented by human rights groups will be evaluated. However, it will probably be difficult to prove the allegations. Saxony's Interior Minister Heinz Eggert also threatened consequences if it turns out that reports about the arrest and torture of the Kurdish couple Ramazan and Zubeyde Cetin, who were deported to Turkey on 6 April, prove true. Lothar Hermes, spokesman of the Saxon Refugee Council, claims that he spoke with the Cetins on the telephone on Friday [15 April] and they told him about having been mistreated. Eggert expressed "most serious doubts" about such reports. If the allegations are confirmed, "then the entire discussion about the Kurds in Germany must be held in a new way." The Berlin State Protection has confirmed reports by the Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Ministry that the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) is blackmailing asylum-seekers. A spokesman said the PKK intends to extort 20 million German marks from Kurds and Turks in Germany in 1994. In the meantime, 210 ground-to-air missiles for Turkey were loaded on the freighter Kayseri near Stadersand on the Lower Elbe on Saturday. The loading was originally expected to take place in the free port of Hamburg. Protests occurred there, however.
