This entire case was given official weight in an unusual way by precisely the chief actor in the affair--representative in the Assembly's House of Zupanijas (House of Parishes) and chief inspector of the republic MUP Tomislav Mercep. At the last 1993 meeting of the House of Zupanijas, which started yesterday, he asked the government a representative's question in which he requested the protection of the legal state and the answer to the question "whether the Republic of Croatia will undertake measures against the people who betrayed the state secret" by publishing the above-mentioned report in GLOBUS (about which we have reported in detail). The Bloody Path of the Criminal Group It is interesting that Mercep did not deny what was written in this text. With such a declaration he in fact confirmed the authenticity of the MUP report, from the content of which, i.e., description of a series of crimes against citizens mostly of Serb nationality (along with a few Croats), it directly follows that, along with the immediate perpetrators, the war criminal is the very same Tomislav Mercep who commanded this unit, the purpose of which was obviously liquidation. This fact and the bloody path of Mercep and his criminal group from Vukovar, across the Pakracka Poljana and Zagreb, to Gospic and back, has been known among the Serbs in Croatia for a long time, but his crimes (as well as those of other criminals) have been concealed from the Croatian public or declared "dirty Serbian propaganda." It is even more interesting that not only Mercep confirmed in this manner the authenticity of the report on his own crimes; its authenticity was also confirmed by Minister of Internal Affairs Ivan Jarnjak, himself, responding last night in the House of Representatives to the representative's question by Franjo Greguric on the same topic. Greguric, namely, was interested in the "position of the MUP in connection with the accusations presented in the GLOBUS article on human rights abuses by Mr. Mercep, assembly representative, and his collaborators," as well as "about measures for the protection of citizens and their property." Minister Jarnjak immediately answered that, on the occasion of this article, "a thorough investigation" had been carried out in the MUP, that the above-mentioned confidential report was drafted on the basis of "talks with the suspects, i.e., those who were interrogated in connection with the tragically killed Zec family" (it is symptomatic how persistently he avoids the word crime and similar expressions), and that this report was drafted "at the request of the Office for the Protection of the Constitutional Order" (which at the time was headed by Josip Manolic). The report was written in three copies, one was left with the Zagreb Police Administration and two were delivered to the above-mentioned office (which was the focal point of control of all the Croatian intelligence services and police). Jarnjak also said that "according to the statements of people who were able to obtain the report no one gave the report to anyone outside the MUP." [passage omitted] "This material is at the attorney general's office. Thus, he should have continued to work on this case, and he should have been asked to start the entire procedure. When the court establishes the validity of this report, then someone can be charged, and the case can be made public. I think that the case was not handled in a proper manner and that this was ill-intentioned." Let us recall that the state public prosecutor in the last year was Stjepan Herceg, who recently submitted his resignation without explanation (he did not undertake anything in regard to this case, or at least it has not been made known to the public), while the four murderers of the Zec family were acquitted before the Zagreb court "because of procedural errors." It is not hard to conclude what kind of a sign this is for the functioning of the "legal state" in relation to the members of the Mercep unit. At any rate, today the assembly appointed Krunislav Olujic, an HDZ representative from Osijek, to the office of the state public prosecutor. [passage omitted]
