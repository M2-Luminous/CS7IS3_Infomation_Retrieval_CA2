They want to travel through those countries to reach their final destination: the United States. Various U.S. Administrations have used different methods to encourage desertions during our people's long struggle and have proclaimed with fanfare the need to exterminate the bad example Cuba has set on this continent. Encouragement for illegal escapes and forced entries into diplomatic missions has increased recently, almost in geometric proportion to the increasing solidarity Cuba has awakened in the civilized world due to its unwavering position in the face of an aggressive and clumsy policy. Seeking to propitiate the occurrence of these irresponsible actions, visas are systematically denied to those who want to emigrate; immigration accords are not fulfilled; and, while legal obstacles increase, the coasts are kept open to welcome, with ample media coverage, those who manage to survive this odyssey. Quite a few in Miami have established a lucrative business by trafficking in human beings. Our people are convinced that if the goals were truly humanitarian, visas would simply be given to everyone who requested one, illegal arrivals onto the territory would be banned, and opportunities would be given to those who want to live in the promised land. It, however, is a promised land rather than a granted land, except with the risk of one's life. Such is the case of those now occupying the three diplomatic missions. Our intention is not to offend anyone who wants to emigrate. While we respect the people's right to live wherever they want, we will let no one swindle us into granting nonexistent categories to people who simply immigrate for personal reasons, family reasons, or economic reasons or simply for adventure. That is going too far. The Belgian hotel's guests include 34 people who have been warned about markedly antisocial behavior and 25 others who have been prosecuted for common crimes, including breaking and entering -- an experience that undoubtedly facilitated the task of breaking into the diplomatic missions. A total of 25 children -- including the world's youngest political refugee, who is only a few months old -- were dragged into an adventure that could only have one ending. Oblivious of the drama in which their impulsive parents forced them to participate, they face food problems and live in extremely close quarters. The most critical thing is that once the alleged political refugees illegally and disrespectfully entered the Belgian ambassador's residence, they used the facilities to establish an alleged organization, distribute propaganda, and display signs under the Belgian mission's roof. We must remember that diplomatic missions cannot be used as centers for political activities against the host country because this violates the functions for which they are accredited. The Belgian Foreign Ministry has acted in a responsible way by instructing its ambassador to notify his guests about the nature of the illegal action they have perpetrated because it violates that country's territory and Cuban laws, and to ask them to abstain from carrying out provocative acts in his garden. We must note that our guards were calm. Their composure prevented injuries even when their lives were in danger. A total of 46 of the occupants have already abandoned the facilities and are home. We must explain that whoever is guilty of a crime before or during the action of violently entering an embassy will have to answer for this. For example, the criminals who stole a truck and damaged state property by crashing through the German Embassy's gate will have to answer to the authorities -- not because of the illegal entry, because we have given guarantees both to Belgium and Germany on this occasion as a gesture of goodwill toward their governments. These guarantees, however, do not include immunity for other crimes. To exonerate the criminals would encourage them to break into diplomatic missions. Some of them are repeat offenders, and this is simply inadmissible. Cuba knows that most of the diplomatic corps accredited to our country understand and coincide with our government's position, and they cooperate in this concern. This is the time to underscore our staunch principle: Absolutely no one who enters a diplomatic mission by force will be authorized to leave the country either now or later. This is a nonnegotiable position, and we will not give in under any circumstances. It would be easy for Cuba to expedite the way for those who opt to enter the embassies. Who would pay the consequences? Who would be left at the mercy of any intruder who violates the immunity of his territory with the intention of emigrating? What would be the position of the governments of these countries if Haitians who are now repatriated en masse preferred to break into their diplomatic missions? What if, instead of risking their lives at a border bristling with rifles to hunt them down, Mexican wetbacks opted to jump the walls at the European or Latin American missions in Mexico City? Cuba has a responsibility to protect diplomatic missions. It is dutybound to protect the immunity and inviolability of their territories, and it will strictly fulfill its duty. The experience derived from over three decades of withstanding blackmail, a blockade, and a direct and indirect aggression have taught us that we cannot give an inch. You lose every principle that you give up. That is the best guarantee for those who represent their countries in Cuba. It is always appropriate to ask: What is the purpose? Is it perhaps to establish this option as a legitimate way to leave the country? Inaugurate in Cuba a new style of getting documents to enter a country, a style different from the one which exists in other capitals? Artificially encourage a political situation for reasons that are suspiciously similar to the ones the United States is fruitlessly trying to create? Complicate things for our country during the recently concluded fourth Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias? We have yet to lose heart before powerful enemies. We have resisted despite adversity. We are not a nation that can be intimidated or put on the defendant's chair. It is time something is understood once and for all: Cuba does not admit pressure, regardless of where it comes from or who exerts the pressure. We were taught courage, and we learned the lesson well. We were taught unwavering principles, and we are good students. We were taught that the enemy cannot be given a single inch, and we are faithful disciples. Cuba is serene. Nothing clouds the clear conscience of a nation that has courageously faced difficult tests. Our Foreign Ministry has amply explained our revolutionary government's position. It is willing to fully cooperate with accredited diplomatic missions to solve their conflict and even prevent future problems in a sensible way. The people who have sought asylum at the Belgian, German, and Chilean missions have only one option: To unconditionally leave the same way they entered.
