FR940104-0-00030 FR940104-0-00007 While the Regional Director has completed the process of consultation with the appropriate persons and the Council, and has developed regulations to implement the required standardized measure of harvest capacity and associated rules for combining permits, the regulations have not yet been proposed. However, this proposal will soon be published in the Federal Register for public comment, and a final rule is expected to be published and to be effective by April 1, 1994. In anticipation of issuance by January 1, 1994, of the regulations governing the combining of permits, some vessel owners have acquired larger vessels and additional limited-entry permits. NMFS estimates that by January 1, 1994, 30 or more vessel owners will have limited entry permits endorsed with the size of a qualifying vessel that has been replaced by a vessel more than 5 feet (1.52m) longer than the qualifying vessel. Under ยง663.33(f)(2), none of these vessel owners could participate in the fishery until he/she obtains a single permit endorsed with the size of the larger vessel. In order to allow limited-entry permit holders in the situation just described to participate in the limited-entry fishery until the date by which the Regional Director is expected to have issued the necessary final rule, NMFS is suspending, until April 1, 1994, the effectiveness of 663.33(f)(2)_the provision of the regulations imposing limitations of endorsed length on the use of limited-entry permits. Failure to take this action would result in limited-entry permit owners who have already obtained, or are in the process of obtaining, additional limited entry permits for combination into a larger permit being unable to participate in the limited-entry fishery until the Regional Director issues the necessary final rule. The limited-entry program is not intended to prevent permit owners from participating in a fishery for which they have obtained the appropriate limited-entry permits. NMFS does not expect this suspension will result in much, if any, additional harvest capacity entering the limited-entry fishery during the time of the suspension. The harvest of all major species taken in the limited-entry fishery during the first 3 months of the calendar year is controlled with restrictive trip limits that serve as a disincentive to any permit holders bringing new, large-capacity fishing vessels into the fishery. Classification This final rule is issued under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Because this rule must be in effect at the time limited-entry permits are required for participation in the limited-entry fishery (January 1, 1994) in order to allow vessel owners who intend to combine permits to participate in the limited-entry fishery pending establishment of a system to combine permits, it is unnecessary and not in the public interest to provide prior public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Also, because this rule temporarily relieves a restriction, it is being made effective immediately without a 30-day delay in effectiveness under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1). List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 663 Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: December 29, 1993. Nancy Foster, Deputy Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service. For the reasons set out in the preamble, the effectiveness of 50 CFR 663.33 (f)(2) is suspended until April 1, 1994.
