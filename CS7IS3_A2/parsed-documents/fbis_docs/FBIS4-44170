In an exclusive statement to AL-HAYAH following a meeting he held at noon on Tuesday [21 June] with his Belgian opposite number, Jean-Luc Dehaene, who is nominated to succeed [European] Commission President Jacques Delors, he said that Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri, who is currently in the United States, has informed him of the support of President Bill Clinton's administration for the Algerian Government's endeavors vis-a-vis the political dialogue with all the parties renouncing violence as a means to reach power. [passage omitted] In his statement to AL-HAYAH Mokdad Sifi stressed his government's determination to continue the political dialogue. He indicated that he is not banking on achieving a political "miracle" in the near future, "because dialogue is a long process and requires time. And the Algerian Government is awaiting the participation of the parties which have been late" in joining the Transitional National Council. On the continuation of the dialogue with the detained Islamic Salvation Front leaders, Mokdad Sifi said that the Transitional Council "is the framework organizing the dialogue among the parties and influential figures who respect the Constitution and the country's laws and who openly declare their renunciation of violence. The dialogue is aimed at committing all parties in the country to working to improve the economic and social situation so that Algerians can proceed with free and democratic elections as soon as possible in order to choose the men who are going to lead the country, God willing." Mokdad Sifi met the day before yesterday with members of the Algerian community in Brussels. He answered questions some of which dealt with the situation in the country. He told an elderly immigrant: "Power is for the people and God." And that the current leadership is supervising a transitional phase to normalize the political situation and reform the economy, then hold free parliamentary elections. On the contacts made between Islamic Front [leaders] in exile and some European capitals and Washington, Sifi said that the official U.S. position announced by President Bill Clinton in Paris "condemns violence and supports the dialogue the Algerian Government is leading. Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri, who is currently in Washington, has stressed in contacts with him that the U.S. Administration fully supports the Algerian Government's endeavors vis-a-vis the political dialogue and economic reforms." He pointed out that the European Union has "on numerous occasions supported the Algerian Government's endeavors in the economic and political spheres." He said that he had raised with his Belgian opposite number prospects for relations between the European Union and Algeria "in a manner that takes account of current changes in Algeria. And there is political consensus with the Belgian prime minister that the European Union's borders do not end at the northern waters of the Mediterranean and that there can be no southern bank without the Arab Maghreb, in which Algeria represents a major party." He said that they are agreed that "the situation in Algeria affects Europe at all levels, economic, political, and geopolitical." [passage omitted] Sifi said that the agreements Algeria has signed with the IMF will save until next May the payment of $5 billion. He pointed out that loans his country is going to obtain from international monetary establishment, commercial banks, and the European Union "will enable it to import raw material to revive the economy and to import consumer goods." He expected economic growth to reach 3 percent this year and 6 percent next year. He pointed to the importance of the projects of reactivating small and medium establishments, agricultural investment, and building dams and houses, and also major projects like constructing 3,000-km-long railroads, as these projects will increase employment opportunities. Sifi said that the government has taken measures which have received the IMF's approval to protect social groups with limited income against the consequences that usually result from the process of liberalizing the economy, especially in the areas of housing, education, and health. And to control the prices of some basic commodities. The European Commission will donate grants to finance projects that will help the government to implement the public housing program. The Algerian Government is banking on increasing gas imports in the long term from the current rate of 30 billion to 60 billion cubic meters by 1998 -- which would secure additional financial revenue to finance the development program.
