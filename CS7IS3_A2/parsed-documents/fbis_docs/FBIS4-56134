By its gradual shifting to more and more radical statements, the KSCM does not intend to return to the past, but only to "defend the honest labor of millions of people", and react to the complicated economic situation in the country, he stresses in the left-leaning daily. "The situation differs from that of the pre-revolutionary period, and therefore the solution to it differs as well," he adds. The management of the Czech economy is poor, Klanica states, pointing to its "catastrophic decline" since 1989 in comparison with European Union member countries. Klanica says he believes that "It is erroneous to link a planned economy -- I am omitting the adjective 'central' -- only to the communist method of directing the national economy. Strategic planning, though not to the last details, is necessary. Even big world concern practice planning, and it was a great mistake when some less educated politicians abolished planning in their post-November (1989) euphoria, arguing that it was linked to communism," Klanica says. Referring to the People's Union for National and Social Salvage (LUNSZ), a left-wing organization of former KSCM member and pre- revolution communist hardliner Miroslav Stepan, Klanica says that LUNSZ is trying to "split the KSCM from the left", after former communists Josef Mecl and Jaroslav Ortman, now leaders of the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and the Left Bloc Party (SLB), the entities including mainly former KSCM members, "failed to disintegrate it from the right". "We are against any further fragmentation of the KSCM, as it would weaken its political force," Klanica adds. Asked whether or not he believed his party would win the elections, as had left-wing forces in Poland and Hungary, Klanica stresses that neither in Hungary nor in Poland was the "communist tradition as strong as in the Czech Lands even before 1989". "The Czechs have a very strong sense of history," he states, adding that it was probably not so strong in Hungarian and Polish workers' and socialist parties. Asked why Slovakia's Democratic Left Party (SDL), the former Slovak communist party, which reformed itself into a social democratic type of party, is doing far better in the Slovak polls than the KSCM, although the "tradition" was not as strong in Slovakia as in the Czech Republic, Klanica says that public opinion polls are unreliable and misleading because they do not poll enough people. "I believe that the KSCM will gain 14 percent of the vote at least in the elections, as many people have already found out who is lying to them and who tells the truth," he says. Klanica points out that before the last, June 1992 elections the KSCM had only 7 percent in the polls (while the Left Bloc coalition bloc, made up practically of KSCM members, received 14 percent of the vote in the elections). "It was because people were afraid to express their opinion. Today their fear of our 'democracy' is even bigger," he insists. Local elections in the Czech Republic are to be held this autumn, parliamentary elections in 1996, the date of the elections to the Senate, the still non-existent upper chamber of the Czech parliament, is yet to be set. In the latest polls, the KSCM received about 10 percent. Klanica also comments on the drop of the number of KSCM members from about 350,000 to 220,000 within the past year. The party's transformation and the adaption to different social conditions has naturally been reflected in its membership, he says, adding that now (former) communists are members of all political parties and holding all types of political posts. "Simply because there used to be many of them -- 1.7 million -- and they were capable, they found their places very well," Klanica says. He stresses that the KSCM is willing to cooperate with the SDL and the SLB, and within the whole opposition. He describes is as nonsense that the opposition forces do not cooperate, blaming each other for "too left-wing" positions.
