FBIS4-59592 "drnes094_o_94005" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 SYRIA U.S. Secretary of State, Delegation Arrive U.S. Secretary of State, Delegation Arrive Immediate Israeli Response Urged JN1605155194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1130 GMT 16 May 94 JN1605155194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Gentlemen: President Hafiz al-Asad presented to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher Syria's viewpoint on the peace process and its goal. In light of this, the U.S. secretary of state has stressed that the negotiations have entered a new and important stage. They also agreed to resume the talks when Christopher returns to Damascus. This means that the United States is exerting extensive efforts and is also eager to take steps that will help the parties involved march together on the long road to peace. There is no doubt that Syria welcomes the U.S. efforts and hopes the U.S. secretary of state's tour will produce true and constructive progress to push the peace process forward. Syria also reaffirms the constant principles of a just and comprehensive solution and the basic requirements and necessary priorities of the peace process. Syria is also eager to achieve the full goals of the peace process, and will spare no effort to render the U.S. secretary of state's tour successful in order to rescue the peace process from the current stalemate it is facing as a result of the many Israeli obstacles, which have become traps and mines threatening the peace process and pushing its toward a deadlock. Any fair observer will not have much difficulty in understanding the nature of the Syrian position. Syria's position toward the peace process is very clear, and not much effort is needed to explain Syria's role and constant principles. The entire world is aware of Syria's credibility and its sound policy toward the peace process. It also understands Syria's correct position and its principles, derived from the resolutions of international legitimacy and from the need to establish justice and protect the region from shocks, trouble, and tension in order to secure a total Israeli withdrawal, stability, security, tranquility, and peace in the region. Syria opened the way for a real, just, and comprehensive peace by agreeing to the U.S. initiative based on the principle of land for peace and the resolutions of international legitimacy, which stipulate the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the occupied Arab territories. During the sixth round of the Washington talks, Syria presented a paper of principles that was branded as comprehensive and balanced. Syria has formulated its clear and serious position toward peace by adopting the principle of total withdrawal in return for comprehensive peace. This is a practical and real translation of the principle of returning the land to its Arab owners. In other words, there will be no peace with occupation, and there will be no peace other than just and comprehensive peace based on regaining rights. This is the honorable peace to which Syria adheres and seeks. The necessary condition for the success of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour lies in Israel's immediate response to carry out a total withdrawal from the Golan and return it together with its citizens and every inch of land to the motherland, Syria. Proceeding from this, it is Israel that is required to show goodwill to achieve a just and comprehensive peace.
