This has become one of the hottest topics at the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]. It is an historical topic. Thanks to the devotion of several generations, socialist China has large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises -- a huge "family fortune" worth 1.8 trillion yuan in total fixed assets. Despite accounting for only one third of the total number of enterprises in the country, they contribute half of the state's financial revenue and make up an all-embracing industrial structure. Joining the Shanghai delegation's discussion, General Secretary Jiang Zemin said: "Large and medium-sized state- owned enterprises are the pillar of the national economy as well as a unique advantage of the Chinese economy. Thanks to this advantage, China has been spared from many inevitable problems in the economic development of many developing nations." Enterprise reform aimed at tapping state-owned enterprises' potential has been carried out for 15 years, beginning with the launching of the "pilot project for expanding enterprise powers" in 1978. With the state introducing various measures and enterprises bringing all their resources into play, the delegation of power, the cut in enterprise profits levied by the state, the levy of taxes in lieu of profits, and the contract system of managerial responsibility were implemented one after another during this 15 year period to help a number of vitalized enterprises emerge as stars in their sectors, and to bring about profound changes in the overall outlook of state- owned enterprises. This is also a practical issue. In contrast to the fast rising new force of village and town enterprises, it is hard for state- owned enterprises to takeoff because of their heavy burdens. The deputies summarized the present situation of state-owned enterprises as: Low economic returns, slow development, being heavily burdened, and wanting in sustaining power. Among the problems, various loans to be repaid by industrial enterprises covered by the budget already come to 800 billion yuan, 18 years would be needed to clear the debts even if all their profits were used for debt repayment. Jilin deputy Quan Zhezhu said: At present the enterprises have several heavy burdens: 1. Too many debts; 2. too many retired workers and staff members; and 3. intense pressure from social undertakings. Whether or not large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises can extricate themselves from this predicament has a direct bearing on the success or failure of our reform. We may say, invigorating large and medium-sized enterprises is a problem that is not only difficult to solve but must be solved. This is also a topic concerning the future. A Henan deputy working for the State Council said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee made a decision on several issues pertaining to the establishment of a socialist market economic system, which is distinguished from the capitalist market system by the leading position occupied by large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises symbolizing socialist state-owned property. Improving and invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are the central and long-term issues in establishing a socialist market economy. The deputies said: The "Regulations for Transforming the Operating Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" and the pilot project of "changing operating mechanisms and establishing a modern enterprise system" promulgated and implemented by the state in the past two years have advanced China's enterprise reform to the third step of clarifying property rights, following the redistribution of powers and profits. From now on, state-owned enterprises will have a chance to really shake off administrative trammels, lay down the heavy historical burden, recuperate and build up their strength, and gradually form a capital fleet to sail into the vast ocean of markets. The deputies call 1994 a year for "storming fortifications" and "smashing the barriers" in China's shift to a socialist market economic system. More than 1,500 Chinese and foreign reporters are gathering in Beijing to try to seize information at the NPC session and report to the nation or the international community on whether or not China can successfully make a major leap in this crucial year. While we could at least refer to some experience from outside our boundaries in shifting toward a market system and in reforming our financial, banking, and foreign trade systems, we have no precedence to follow in invigorating socialist state-owned enterprises and have to relay on our own exploration and creation. In his "Government Work Report," Premier Li Peng put forward a new measure to vitalize large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in 1994: "Change the operating mechanism of state-owned enterprises and explore ways to establish a modern enterprise system." Premier Li Peng said: The reform of state-owned enterprises is the focal as well as difficult point in reforming the economic structure. Establishing a modern enterprise system with clearly defined property rights, unequivocal enterprise rights and responsibilities, enterprise functions that are divorced from administrative functions, and scientific management is an inevitable need of developing socialized macro-production and the market economy, as well as an arduous and complicated job. This year the state will organize a number of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to, in accordance with the "Company Law," carry out a pilot project for establishing a modern enterprise system, to accumulate experience and gradually push on our drive. The continued, vigorous advance of the social security system reform and lessening of the burden of social undertakings on enterprises have created conditions for enterprises to participate in fair market competition. A deputy working for a macroeconomic department said: In addition to a macro-environment favorable for state-owned enterprises to take big strides toward the market, the enterprises have now been handed most of the powers that are supposed to be granted under the "Regulations for Transforming the Operating Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People." The enterprises must seize this opportunity to make good and full use of the various policies introduced by the state, accelerate the transformation of operating mechanisms, and move to the starting line for fair competition. The state has selected 16 cities -- including Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Wuhan -- as the first to carry out a pilot project for making a spurt toward such highly difficult enterprise reforms as "bankruptcy," "replenishment" [bu chong 5943 0339], and "peeling off" [bo li 0475 4418]. It is necessary to strengthen the enforcement of the "Bankruptcy Law," rely on cities to establish trading markets for property rights, and accelerate the readjustment of the enterprises' organizational structure. We should replenish the enterprises' capital in cash through various channels to solve their serious fund shortages. At the same time, efforts should be made to peel the burden of social undertakings off state-owned enterprises to make it possible for them to compete with fewer burdens. Deputy Ruan Chongwu, governor of Hainan Province, said: Government departments should separate government administration from enterprise management, "however reluctantly they may go about it," letting enterprises handle matters that fall within the scope of their authority; allowing the market to deal with things that should be solved by market forces; and shifting the government's work toward coordinating, integrating, and balancing the interests of various social sectors so that they will become a single force driving overall social interests forward. How did entrepreneurs feel about the deputies going all-out to help state-owned enterprises? Liu Benren, a deputy from Hubei, said: This year, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company will focus on establishing a modern enterprise system and on improving economic returns in accelerating the pace of transformation through the shareholding system. Deputy Geng Zhaojie, chairman of the First Automotive Group, said: In establishing a modern enterprise system, the government should turn over the reins to enterprises, which should also reform themselves; otherwise, nobody can save us. Geng Zhaojie said: There is a gold mountain beneath every state-owned enterprise. With the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, each enterprise will have a magic shovel with which to excavate the mountain. Whether it will strike gold will depend on its capability.
