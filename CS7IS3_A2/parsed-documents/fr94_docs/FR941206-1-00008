FR941206-1-00008 FR941206-1-00001 Eighty-one commenters addressed the issue regarding the classification of poultry products produced by mechanical separation according to bone solids content. Of the 81 commenters, 78 disagreed with the requirements discussed in the ANPR which tentatively considered that only product with 0.6 percent or less bone solids content could be labeled ``(kind)'' or ``(kind) meat,'' without the reference to ``mechanically separated.'' The commenters stated that the establishment of a 0.6 percent bone solids content demarcation between what would be labeled as ``(kind)'' or ``(kind) meat,'' and ``mechanically separated (kind),'' based on data collected in August 1993 (data presented by FSIS in the report entitled ``Determination of Acceptable Limits of Percent Bone Solids in Ground Poultry Products'') would basically eliminate half of the currently produced product and reduce the available amount of this low cost poultry ingredient for further processed poultry and meat food products by 60 to 70 percent. Moreover, commenters further emphasized that, to operate within the current 1 percent bone solids content limit for boneless poultry, most processors must target their operations at about 0.6 percent bone solids content. The commenters indicated that achievement of the low levels of percent bone solids content that were reported by FSIS in the report of the August 1993 data occurred because it is necessary for producers to target well below the current 1 percent limit in order to consistently meet and not exceed the 1 percent requirement. Thus, setting a requirement at 0.6 percent for what could be called ``(kind)'' or ``(kind) meat'' would require producers to aim at significantly lower levels of bone solids content which would present an unreasonable burden on the industry. Manufacturers would have to adjust their mechanical deboning machines to adjust the pressure needed to force ground poultry bones with adhering muscle and other tissues through screens in the mechanical deboning equipment to eliminate more bone from the finished product, thereby reducing product yield. According to the commenters, in order to label a product as ``chicken'' or ``turkey meat,'' i.e., to meet the ``upper control limit'' of 0.6 percent, a processor would have to target a 0.3 percent bone solids content level to qualify for that product category because of the lack of precise controls in the operation of the deboning equipment. One commenter claimed that industry data submitted to the Agency ``shows, under the principles of statistical process control, a controlled process that targets 0.6 percent bone solids will result in a product that meets the 1 percent bone solids requirement 99.5 percent of the time.'' Another commenter claimed that the industry data presented indicate that the average percent bone solids content is 0.57 percent with a standard deviation of 0.227 percent, so that ``at the 99 percent confidence limit, evidence that a process may not be running efficiently is when an individual sample analysis is greater than 1.15 percent.'' Therefore, according to the commenters, the Agency is wrong to advocate an average bone solids content of 0.6 percent as the current measure of good manufacturing practices for poultry products produced by mechanical separation. The same commenters criticized the FSIS report on bone solids content stating that ``no statistical analysis, factorial or otherwise, was done to describe the two categories of mechanically separated poultry based on bone solids content to determine if, in fact, they are different and/or whether members of the populations were in fact similar.'' The commenters further asserted that the data presented by FSIS did not actually demonstrate that two ``categories'' of mechanically separated poultry exist. The commenters asserted that such an analysis may show that the only difference was due to the type of starting materials (e.g., necks versus carcass frames versus backs) or that there are, in fact, no separable populations. Further, it was asserted by several commenters that the usual practice in quality control is to use 3 standard deviations above a target criteria as a control limit, rather than the standard deviation of 2.33 (corresponding to a 99 percent confidence that the process is not in control), as was suggested by FSIS in its report of the 1993 study. One commenter provided an example of how the 3 standard deviations approach would be applied. It was explained that since the mean percent bone solids content presented in the report of the 1993 study was 0.68 percent and that the average standard deviation by establishment was 0.138, then 3 standard deviations above the mean control limit would be approximately 1.1 percent bone solids content.
