There are few television viewers who have not seen the advertisement accompanying this cheery jingle. All the same, does Russia have a lot of gold? One of the myths disseminated in recent years is the fabulous reserve of gold which can come to the aid of Russia's economy during this period of crisis. But it turns out that the country's gold reserve, which had been accumulated for a century, was squandered by the end of "the Gorbachev period." It amounted to no more than 140 metric tons by August 1991. At the same time, 8,200 tons of gold were stored in the vaults of Fort Knox in the United States, and the total gold assets of the world's banks had reached 35,000 metric tons. Belgium and the Netherlands alone threw about 1,000 metric tons of gold into the world market in 1991, which led to a drop in the world price to $324 per ounce (31.1 grams) from $446 in 1987. At the turn of this century, when intellectual politicians such as Sergey Yulyevich Vitte [Witte] and Petr Arkadyevich Stolypin held the position of minister of finance and prime minister, gold mining was especially encouraged by the granting of various state privileges. In 1914, 64 metric tons of gold, or one-tenth of the world's production of this metal, were extracted. Russia's gold reserve was more than 1,500 metric tons. The bolsheviks understood the strategic role of the gold reserve as well as the tsarist ministers, and after the civil war they began intensive restoration of the state geological service and the gold industry. By 1928, the country had extracted 36 metric tons of gold. In order to speed up restoration of the state gold reserve, precious metals were confiscated from private individuals through the system of Torgsin [All-Union Association for Trade With Foreigners] stores, brilliantly portrayed by Mikhail Bulgakov in the novel "The Master and Margarita." By 1953, the gold reserve in the USSR had reached 2,050 metric tons. If it is taken into account that 2,100 metric tons were extracted from 1928 to 1953 and that the United States demanded 1,500 metric tons of gold to pay for Lend-Lease during World War II, we can see how effective the state system of precious metal accumulation was over these years. Khrushchev deprived the gold industry of its previous privileges and began squandering the gold reserve, and this was completed under Gorbachev. Nevertheless, the powerful gold industry in the USSR increased the amount of gold extracted right up to 1990; it totaled an average 160 metric tons annually from 1955 to 1965, 250 metric tons per year from 1965 to 1975, and 273 metric tons per year from 1975 to 1990. Only South Africa extracted more gold--about 600 metric tons per year. The expenditures to establish and develop the mineral-raw material base for all types of minerals, including gold, during this period accounted for a stable 1.2 to 1.4 percent of national income, but the economic effectiveness of geological operations was highest among the primary sectors of the national economy. Investment programs over the past decades were oriented mainly toward development of the mineral-raw material base in settled regions with a more moderate climate on the USSR's southern perimeter. The huge amount of funds confiscated in Russia were invested in the construction of mining combines and development of territories which are sovereign today. Russia turned out to be in a critical situation with respect to a number of minerals after the collapse of the USSR. Russian industry's requirements for manganese, chromium, antimony, titanium, mercury, and lead are being met almost entirely by deliveries from former union republics, which costs Russia $2 billion per year. In gold production Russia holds just fifth place in the world today (158 metric tons in 1993). It extracts four times less gold per capita than Uzbekistan. Attempts are being made to increase the state gold reserve. It increased to 308 metric tons in 1993. However, the lack of a consistent state mineral-raw material policy does not make it possible to count on even reaching the gold reserve level of 1913 quickly. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gold Production in Russia and the USSR | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year |Production, in Metric Tons Per year | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1914 (Russia) |64 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1928 (USSR) |36 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1955-1965 (USSR) |160 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1965-1975 (USSR) |250 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1975-1990 (USSR) |273 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 (Russia) |158 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gold Reserves in Russia and the USSR | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Size of Reserve, in Metric Tons | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1914 (Russia) |1,500 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1953 (USSR) |2,050 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 (USSR) |140 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 (Russia) |308 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Let us return to the United States' experience. Since 1929 it has had a federal mineral-raw material policy aimed at the country's self-sufficiency in strategic raw material. The "Law on a national policy and research and development in the field of materials and mineral raw material" passed by the U.S. Congress in 1980 states: "...the United States should always pursue a policy aimed at providing for a sufficient supply of the materials needed to maintain national security, the public welfare, and the level of industrial production..." Since 1981, at the initiative of the United States, Canada, and the FRG, an international program has been implemented jointly with South Africa, Australia, and Great Britain to keep a record of the strategic types of mineral raw material and ensure its accessibility. The United States' gold reserve has reached its maximum amount since World War II--25,000 tons. After the war De Gaulle took decisive steps to increase France's gold reserve. All countries, especially Canada, Japan, Taiwan, China, India, abd Saudi Arabia, want to add to their gold reserve. Over the past 5 years, the United States, Australia, Canada, and China have doubled their gold production. It is a different situation in the territory of the former Soviet Union. Unlike the United States, unified national mineral-raw material programs were not developed or implemented during the USSR's existence. Development of the country's mineral-raw material base was not linked with the task of building up strategic and mobilization resources. The 2 years which the Law "On Mineral Resources," adopted by the VS RF [Russian Federation Supreme Soviet] in February 1992, has been in effect have shown that the federal mineral-raw material interests are practically unprotected by this legislation. The Supreme Soviet adopted and put into effect a statute on the procedure for paid, licensed use of mineral deposits long before the federal mineral-raw material priorities were defined. The numerous auctions and competitions for the right to develop mineral deposits have not led to the establishment of one mining enterprise. The mass issuance of licenses for geological study of gold-bearing areas has taken vast regions, where practically no geological exploration work is being conducted, out of the jurisdiction of state regulation in a number of parts of the Russian Federation. The lack of a federal mineral-raw material policy has led to disorganization of the geological sector. Its financing from the budget in 1993 amounted to just 17 percent of the 1990 level. Employment in the sector has declined by half and is continuing to decline. As a result, not one new deposit of metallic minerals has been found in Russia since 1992, and the increase in the gold reserve does not cover its production. This is leading to depletion of the mineral-raw material base--the principal source of resources for the Russian economy. The situation is especially critical because many gold mines have reserves for just 6 or 7 years. At the same time, a number of the large gold deposits in Russia that were prospected before continue to be unused. These deposits include Sukhoy Log in Irkutsk Oblast, Nezhdaninskoye in Yakutia, Mayskoye in Chukotka, and Olimpiadskoye in Krasnoyarsk Kray. However, the funds needed to develop them are so substantial that this is practically impossible without foreign investments today. The raw material base of Russian gold, the mining of which accounts for about 70 percent of Russia's total production, is in an even worse situation. In most of the leading regions (Magadan Oblast, Yakutia) which provide most of the placer gold, there are reserves available for just 3 to 5 years. The situation is somewhat better in the Amur and Transbaykal regions and Buryatia, but the average gold content in these regions is very low--just 0.16 to 0.17 grams per cubic meter, and production in these areas cannot compensate for the loss in the northeastern regions. New regions with gold-bearing potential such as the Polar Urals, Timan, Karelia, Taymyr, Anabar, and Olenek have not been studied adequately. The gold content of the sands and gravel which are being excavated in thousands of quarries in many parts of the Russian platform has not been studied at all. So the country's geologists have the urgent task of searching for deposits of gold, not to mention the other minerals. Considerable attention should be devoted to the Federal Geological Service without delay. The specific nature of the geological sector and the objective gap in time between the stages of searching for deposits and the actual opportunity to begin working the minerals found have to be given particular emphasis. Any forecasts about Russia emerging from the depression after 1995 are not worth the paper they are written on unless the extent of the degradation of the mineral resources base is taken into account. So that Russia's gold can reinforce the country's economic might, the policy on mineral resources has to be changed and made the state's business today.
