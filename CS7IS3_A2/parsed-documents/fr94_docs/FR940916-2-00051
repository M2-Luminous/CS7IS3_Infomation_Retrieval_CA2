ACTION: Notice of draft permits and permit modification. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing for comment two draft, 5-year Phase I Acid Rain Permits including sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO X ) compliance plans and one draft modification to the SO 2 compliance plan of a previously issued final Phase I Acid Rain Permit in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR parts 72 and 76). DATES: Comments on the draft permits and modification must be received no later than October 17, 1994 or the date of publication of a similar notice in a local newspaper. ADDRESSES: Administrative Records. The administrative record for the permits, except information protected as confidential, may be viewed during normal operating hours at EPA Region 7, 726 Minnesota Ave., Kansas City, KS 66101. Comments. Send comments, requests for public hearings, and requests to receive notice of future actions to EPA Region 7, Air and Toxics Division, Attn: Jon Knodel (address above). Submit comments in duplicate and identify the permit to which the comments apply, the commenter's name, address, and telephone number, and the commenter's interest in the matter and affiliation, if any, to the owners and operators of all units in the plan. All timely comments will be considered, except those pertaining to standard provisions under 40 CFR 72.9 or issues not relevant to the permit or the permit modification. Hearings. To request a public hearing, state the issues proposed to be raised in the hearing. EPA may schedule a hearing if EPA finds that it will contribute to the decision-making process by clarifying significant issues affecting an SO 2 or NO X compliance plan. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Call Jon Knodel, (913) 551&hyph;7622. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated final rules implementing the SO 2 portion of the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. In today's action, EPA is issuing to the following utility plants draft permits and a draft permit modification that propose to allocate SO 2 emission allowances and approve SO 2 compliance plans, consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement and that propose to approve NO X compliance plans under 40 CFR part 76: La Cygne in Kansas: 23,489 substitution allowances for each year 1995&hyph;1999 to unit 1; 12,682 substitution allowances for each year 1995&hyph;1999 to unit 2; two substitution plans, each for 1995&hyph;1999, in which Montrose units 1, 2, and 3 designate either unit 1 or unit 2 as a substitution unit; one NO X compliance plan for 1995&hyph;1999 in which unit 2 will comply with the standard emission limitation of 0.50 lb/MMBtu. Iatan in Missouri: 14,479 substitution allowances for each year 1995&hyph;1999 to unit 1; one substitution plan for 1995&hyph;1999 in which Montrose units 1, 2, and 3 designate unit 1 as a substitution unit; one NO X compliance plan for 1995&hyph;1999 in which unit 1 will comply with the standard emission limitation of 0.50 lbs/MMBtu. Montrose in Missouri: three substitution plans, each for 1995&hyph;1999, in which units 1, 2, and 3 designate either La Cygne unit 1, La Cygne unit 2, or Iatan unit 1 as a substitution unit. Dated: September 12, 1994. Brian J. McLean, Director, Acid Rain Division, Office of Atmospheric Programs, Office of Air and Radiation.
