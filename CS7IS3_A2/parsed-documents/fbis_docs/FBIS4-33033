This makes you wonder whether there is an impasse, although Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner denies this. In Paraguay's case, the delay in designating a new ambassador has been greater. Paraguay has not had an ambassador in Washington since January 1994 when Juan Esteban Aguirre resigned that post. Aguirre is currently occupying a high-level Inter-American Bank (IDB) position in Peru. Ramirez Boettner said the country has already asked the United States for its agreement on one name for the post, and the ministry is awaiting an answer before submitting the nomination to the Senate. The foreign minister did not want to provide the name of the future ambassador, saying: "It is not customary to release the name of an ambassador-designate until the country where he is supposed to serve sends its agreement." Ramirez Boettner said the delay in designating a U.S. ambassador to Paraguay to replace Jon Glassman is not a sign of disagreement with Paraguay. "It is absolutely normal. They are going through a transition period during which they are choosing an adequate candidate for the post. It is absolutely normal, and we have splendid relations with the United States in all respects," the foreign minister said. [passage omitted]
