Al-Shar' conveyed President Hafiz al-Asad's greetings to the German president, who asked him to convey to the president his best wishes and warmest condolences on the death of Staff Major Basil al-Asad. Talks dealt with regional developments and the peace process. In this regard, the German president emphasized Syria's important regional role under the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad. He reiterated Germany's condemnation of the Hebron massacre and hoped that this crime, which was condemned worldwide, would not affect the peace process in the region. Earlier this morning, the Syrian side led by Faruq al-Shar' and the German side led by Klaus Kinkel held a session of official talks at the German Foreign Ministry in Bonn. [passage omitted] The two sides exchanged views on ways to bolster and develop bilateral relations in various areas and in a manner that serves the interests of the two countries and peoples and contributes to peace and stability in the region. The two ministers reviewed relations between Syria and the European Union and stressed the importance of developing cooperation between them on all levels. Talks centered on the situation in the region, particularly the developments of the peace process and its future prospects. In this regard, Kinkel stressed Syria's important role in achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region. [passage omitted] Speaking to reporters in Bonn today, Faruq al-Shar' said: For peace to be comprehensive and achieve security and stability in the region, the well-known peace requirements should be met. These are full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and implementation of Resolutions 242 and 338, and 425 on Lebanon. Otherwise, talk about peace will be mere talk that will not produce concrete results. On the contrary, using hollow phrases about peace without real results will lead to new acts of violence and terrorism similar to the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque.
