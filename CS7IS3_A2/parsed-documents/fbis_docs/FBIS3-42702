During February low pressure system activity in the atmosphere is most intensive on the European territory of Russia, in the southern regions of Western Siberia, and in the eastern outskirts of the country. Almost the same as in January, there will be strong winds and snowstorms. The high pressure system will remain, encompassing the central regions of Eastern Siberia and, to a considerable degree, the Far East. This month will be changeable. The sun is already warming the earth on calm, clear days in the southern part, but there is still severe freezing and snowstorms. What is February expected to be like when it comes into its own? In the Central and Central-Chernozem regions the monthly air temperature is expected to be close to the many-year average (norm), and in the Central-Chernozem region--1-2 degrees above the norm, and it is expected to be in the range of minus 5-12. The prevailing temperature at night will be minus 5-10 and during the day--0 to minus 5. During certain periods of the first and second 10-day periods during the night hours the freezing will go down to 20-25 degrees. The weather will be mainly dry and sunny with few clouds. In the Northwestern region the average monthly temperature will be close to normal: minus 7-9. The prevailing temperature will be 5-10 degrees below zero, and during the day--from minus 2 to plus 3. But 20 degrees below during the night hours during the first half of the month is also quite probable. There will be snow, blizzards, and severe winds up to 15-20 meters per second at the beginning and at the end of the month. In the Northern region the average monthly temperature will be 1-2 degrees below normal: minus 12-18. At night it will be 15-20 degrees below zero and during the day--8-13 degrees below zero, but on certain nights during the first and second 10-day periods the temperature will go down to 25-30 degrees. At times there will be snow, blizzards, and individual strong winds up to 25-30 meters per second. In the Volga-Vyatka region and Central Volga area the average monthly temperature will be 1-2 degrees above normal, and in the north of Volga-Vyatka region--about normal: minus 7-13. The freezing at night will go down to 13-18, and during the day--7-12. Hard freezing at night down to 20-25 (in the northern part of Volga-Vyatka region--down to 30) and during the day down to 17-22 degrees may occur during certain parts of the first and second 10-day periods. Snow, blizzards, and strong winds are most probable at the beginning and end of the month. In the North Caucasus and Lower Volga area the average monthly temperature will be 2 degrees above normal: zero to minus 5. At night it will be 3-8 degrees and during the day--plus 1-5. At the same time one cannot rule out the possibility of more severe freezing--down to 13-18 degrees. Precipitation in the form of rain and wet snow will amount to 15-30 mm and, most likely, it will be during the first 10-day period and at the end of the month. There will be infrequent strong winds up to 15-20 meters per second. In the Ural region and Western Siberia the average monthly temperature in northern regions will be 1-2 degrees below normal and amount to minus 20-25, and in the southern regions--1-2 degrees above normal: minus 12-17. In the northern regions at night it will be 22-27, and during the day--12-17, but on certain nights of the first 10-day period it will be 35 (in the south--down to 25-30) degrees. In the southern regions mainly at night it will be 15-20 and during the day 8-13 degrees. Snow, blizzards, and strong winds are most probable during the second and third 10-day periods. In Eastern Siberia the average monthly temperature in the northern half of the territory will be close to normal: 23-30 degrees, and the southern half--1-2 degrees above normal, and will amount to 15-22 degrees. The most severe freezing will come at about the middle of the month when the mercury will dip at night in the north to minus 38-43, and in the south--to minus 28-33; the rest of the time in the northern half the freezing will go down to 25-30 at night and during the day--15-20, and in the southern half at night--15-20, and during the day 8-13 degrees. It will be slightly cloudy, sunny, and there will be a little bit of snow only during certain periods. In the Far East the average monthly air temperature will be close to normal, and only in Magadan Oblast will it be 1 degree lower. In the southern regions at night it will go down to 15-20 degrees below zero, during the day--8-13, and in the southern regions at night 20-25, and during the day 13-18, but at the beginning and about the middle of the month it is possible that the temperature will drop by 7-10 degrees. Snow and blizzards are most probable at the end of the first 10-day period and about the middle of the third 10-day period. ...and for Today According to information from Rosgidromettsentr, a cold low pressure system began its path in the south through the European part of the country. Following it will be freezing weather in the majority of regions. On Wednesday in the Northwestern, Central, and Central-Chernozem regions at night it will be 18-23 degrees, and in places 30 degrees, and during the day--15-20 degrees. But the depth of the snow cover here is sufficient to reliably protect the plants from the cold weather. It will also get colder in the Upper Volga region, and the zone of the snowfall will shift to the Lower Volga Area and the western part of Kazakhstan. There will be inclement weather with precipitation and winds in the Northern Caucasus, where an ice crust and fog cannot be ruled out.
