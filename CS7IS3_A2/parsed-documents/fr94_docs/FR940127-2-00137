AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''). ACTION: Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Act''). APPLICANTS: The Alger Fund (the ``Fund''), any future series thereof, and any registered investment company for which Fred Alger & Company, Incorporated serves in the future as principal underwriter or for which any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Fred Alger & Company, Incorporated (within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act) may in the future serve as principal underwriter; and Fred Alger & Company, Incorporated (the ``Distributor''). RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: Order requested under section 6(c) of the Act amending previous orders that granted an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d) of the Act, and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder. SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: The Fund previously received exemptive orders that permit it to impose a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions of shares, and waive the CDSC in certain instances.
