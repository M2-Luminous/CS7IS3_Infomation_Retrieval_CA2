FR941013-1-00065 FR941013-1-00010 The EPA estimates that there are approximately 10 industrial landfills currently operating that accept only nonhazardous industrial process wastes. These landfills receive a wide range of wastes that may contain significant amounts of organic HAP. Furthermore, the EPA estimates that nationwide there are approximately an additional 1,800 construction and demolition debris landfills currently in operation that can be included in this segment of the off-site waste and recovery operations source category. However, the EPA does not expect wastes received at construction and demolition debris landfills to contain significant amounts of organic HAP. 3. Industrial Wastewater Treatment Facilities Analogous to landfills, many waste treatment facilities are operated by municipal governments and private companies throughout the United States for the treatment of wastewaters. Wastewater treatment facilities accepting residential and commercial wastewaters are considered to be publicly owned-treatment works (POTW). No POTW are included in the off-site waste and recovery operations source category because POTW are listed as a separate NESHAP source category. In addition to POTW, some privately-owned wastewater treatment facilities process nonhazardous wastewaters received from off-site sources. A nationwide survey was conducted by the EPA of wastewater treatment facilities operating in 1989. Using these survey data, a data base excluding POTW was created. The results of this survey indicate that 15 wastewater treatment facilities were operating nationwide which were neither a POTW nor a hazardous waste TSDF but did process wastewaters received from off-site sources that potentially could generate wastewaters containing organic HAP. 4. Recycled Used Oil Management Facilities Used oils from motor vehicles and other sources potentially can contain organic chemicals, such as benzene, which have been listed as HAP under CAA section 112(b). Although the management of used oils which are recycled is regulated by separate rules promulgated by the EPA under authority of RCRA section 3014, these rules do not address air emissions from used oil management facilities. The EPA gathered information regarding recycled used oil management practices in the United States for the development of the RCRA standards. This information indicates that approximately 2,800 million liters of used oil enters the commercial used oil recycling market each year. Approximately three-fourths of this recycled used oil is sent to facilities categorized by EPA as ``used oil processors.'' Used oil processors typically collect used motor oil and industrial lubricating oils. These oils are processed to remove water and sediments from the oils. The processors then sell the oil as a fuel for burning primarily in boilers, furnaces, and space heaters. There were 182 used oil processing facilities operating in the United States in 1991. The remainder of the recycled used oil is sent to facilities categorized as ``used oil re-refiners.'' At these facilities the used oil is processed into base lube oil stocks and other products. In 1991, there were four used oil re-refining facilities operating in the United States. Several companies have expressed interest in expanding used oil re-refining capacity in the United States. 5. Oil and Gas E&P Waste Management Facilities There are a variety of wastes and recoverable materials generated during oil and gas exploration and production (E&P). The majority of these materials are managed on-site at the production site (i.e., at the location of the well). However, some E&P wastes and recoverable materials generated at the production site that may contain organic HAP are subsequently sent to off-site crude oil reclamation and land treatment facilities. The EPA gathered information regarding E&P waste and recoverable material management practices from EPA conducted site visits and existing industry sponsored surveys. Nationwide, approximately 100,000 Mg/yr of E&P wastes and recoverable materials are sent to off-site crude oil reclamation facilities. These materials consist mostly of tank bottoms from crude oil storage tanks or produced water storage tanks. In addition, approximately 135,000 Mg/yr of E&P waste sludges are managed in off-site land treatment operations.
