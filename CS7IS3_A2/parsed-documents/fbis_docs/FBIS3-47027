First of all, we would like to thank you for granting us an interview. In 1993, China and Laos have continued to carry out restructuring and have made satisfactory achievements. Therefore, as the old year is ending and the new year approaching, could you please brief us on achievements of Laos in restructuring and in economic development in the past year? [Khamla] [passage omitted] According to the announced figures, the GDP has increased by six percent. The total production of each sector can be categorized as follows: food supply production was 1,448,900 metric tons; agricultural production increased by 4.5 percent; industrial and handicraft production increased by 9.2 percent; electricity output increased by 17 percent; processed industrial products increased by 10 percent; and services increased by 6.9 percent. [passage omitted] Goods transportion by land, water, air, and sea has been developed. The number of private enterprises and partnerships has increased rapidly, thus making the distribution of goods into every part of the country possible. The volume of goods transported has increased by eight percent, while the volume of goods in circulation increased by 10 percent compared to 1992. [passage omitted] On the trade balance, in the past year the volume of goods in circulation in the local market increased by 10 percent. The total value of goods exported was U.S. $220 million. This represents a 34-percent increase from 1992 and four percent above the year's target. Total imports were valued at U.S. $385 million, an increase of 13 percent. Banking has been efficiently managed and the government was able to keep the amount of loans under control. At the same time, the exchange rates between the Lao kip currency and foreign currencies were stable. A new mechanism have been introduced to finance. Specifically, efforts were made to clearly separate the two roles in management thus making the state financial system unified and centralized. This has contributed to the implementation of a mechanism that is in line with the open-door policy, the setting of a balanced budget, the establishment of a national treasury, and the improvement of tax collection methods. A number of major rules and regulations have been laid out to make the finance and budget managements gradually conform with the new mechanism. [passage omitted] [Reporter] In 1993, China and Laos exchanged more friendship visits than in previous years, while economic and trade cooperation increased noticeably. Therefore, could you please brief us on this issue? What do think about economic and trade cooperation in the future? [Khamla] We can say that both China and Laos in 1993 exchanged more friendship visits than in any previous year. This is because Laos and China are close neighbors; the peoples of the two countries have enjoyed the traditional solidarity, friendship, and good relations since ancient times; their mountains, forests, and rivers are linked to each other; their weather and natural resources are also similar. All these are favorable factors for ties and cooperation. [passage omitted] Over the past four to five years, economic and trade cooperation as well as border trade, have increased considerably. Trading has increased from only a few kinds of goods in the past to more than 300 at present. Two-way trade volume has increased from only US$5 million to US$6 million per annum in the past to US$30 million a year at present. There have been economic, and science and technology cooperation projects carried out in various ways and means and participated in by several economic sectors. The process of cooperation involved the provision of gratis aid, interest-free or low-interest loans for construction of hydropower electric plants, or the development of agriculture, forestry, and the rural economy. On cooperation in the expansion of industry or in mining exploration, many Chinese companies have been awarded contracts for the construction of roads, airfields, hydropower electric plants in the northern, central, and southern regions of Laos, with a combined total cost of more than US$60 million. Over the past four years, the PRC has invested a total of US$21,914,000 in 34 projects in Laos. In 1993, the PRC invested in 17 projects worth more than US$13 million. To enhance future economic and trade relations and cooperation, although both countries have had similar experiences, I believe each country has some unique qualities and different conditions and levels of development. Despite differences, both have similarities in many aspects, such as geographically, in natural resources, in labor, funding, science and technology, and in the lessons of socioeconomic development and other fields. I believe that along with the relations and cooperation between the potential markets, Laos and China will be able to find basic sectors, projects, forms, and methods of cooperaton that can serve as strategies and key factors for firm and lasting cooperation. I believe both countries are jointly considering basic, lasting, and key cooperation projects in several fields. These are integrated agriculture; forestry; processing industry for export; hydropower; mining; geology; construction materials; communications and land, water and air transportation; and tourism. [passage omitted] Our country is the country of peace, stability, and social order. Its location is important as the international community is interested in development projects in this region, some of which are the Golden Quadrangle development project; the project to link Asian transportation routes -- roads, railways, waterways; the Mekong River waterways transportation project from the watershed in Tibet to Vietnam. [passage omitted] Trade and the economy have very important roles for Lao-Chinese ties and cooperation. In this regard, all concerned agencies of each side will have to make efforts not only to increase production but also to consider the natural resources of each country, as well as the trade balance. They will also have to take into account various main strategic projects, ways to increase prosperity, and international competition. For example, border provinces may cooperate in agricultural cultivation, animal husbandry, logging and timber processing, reforestation, mining, the expansion of processing industries, the renovation of transportation routes, and tourism development through various ways and means. Regarding capital, they may discuss loan procurement from different places for established projects so that they can be completed within a suitable time-frame. With this concept, I fervently hope the organizations concerned, PRC businessmen and investors, as well as those from other friendly countries will intensify their cooperation with the LPDR to bring about real benefits and glorious success to all sides.
