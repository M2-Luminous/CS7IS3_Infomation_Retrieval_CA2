Among other things, Venizelos said on Athens radio that Greece has strong arguments for the European Court to reject the EU commission's appeal. Correspondent Nina Asimakopoulou has the following report: [Begin recording] [Venizelos] The Republic of Greece, through its representatives, has presented all its legal arguments, a huge reserve of arguments, and all its political arguments, because the issue is primarily political. Our first argument is that the issue is political and one that is associated with foreign policy and security in the southern Balkans, sources of tension in an area that is already tense. As is evident, a similar evaluation of developments cannot be done by a judicial body but by a political one, and this is why the EU Commission dealt with the issue politically through the dispatch of Hans van den Broek, the EU commissioner on foreign and security policy. In addition, the EU Commission had asked for the opinion of the EU Council of Ministers that, typically, was never given. Our second argument is that there is no reason whatsoever to consider the issue a priority, because the EU Commission delayed any action for over two months by conducting a political discussion around this issue. Also, the issue is dealt with politically by the United Nations through Cyrus Vance's mission, and by United States through the mission of Matthew Nimetz. Our third argument is that there is no excessive use of rights deriving from Article 224 of the EU Accord on behalf of our country, because this regulation allows the assumption of similar measures when there is international tension constituting a threat of war. Of course all the above lead to the rejection of the EU Commission's appeal that, and here is the paradox, it claims harm Skopje, but not the EU, from Greece's sanctions, even though there is a very small volume of trade between EU and Skopje. [Asimakopoulou] In other words, you are optimistic for the outcome of the case, aren't you? [Venizelos] Obviously I am optimistic, because our arguments are very strong and this initiative by the EU Commission was wrong. [Asimakopoulou] If a sentence is issued against Greece, can it be implemented? What would Greece do in such a case? [Venizelos] There is no chance of a such a decision being imposed. Such decisions have a symbolic character. Keep in mind that we always talk about a process of temporary measures that is not the main procedure, and it is not accidental that all these have defused the EU Commission's political pressure on this issue.
