In the last few days, they have organized a whole series of protest pickets and gatherings by ultra-patriots with resolutions containing the old demand for the mandatory mention in the treaty's preamble of the so-called "Zeligowski march on Vilnius," as a result of which, for over 20 years, the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius was called the city of Wilno and was the center of the East Polish province. A patriotic furor was raised by Romualdas Ozolas, leader of the Centrist Alliance party and member of the Seimas, who is also one of Lithuania's most influential politicians. Known for his territorial claims against Kaliningrad Oblast and suspicion toward neighboring Belorussia [Belarus], he reacted extremely negatively to the preliminary results of talks between the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry and the Poles, and to the ministry's pragmatic stance -- namely, not to make historical appraisals but to limit itself to a recognition of the inviolability of borders, as is the accepted practice throughout the world. In the midst of the arguments, the leader of the Lithuanian centrists even named the Polish ambassador in Vilnius as a secret service staffer (later, the Belorussian ambassador in Lithuania was also credited with this "flattering" characteristic). A scandal broke. The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry was obliged to express regret over such appraisals and interpretations of the treaty. At this point, representatives of certain right-wing organizations and movements came to the aid of the chief Lithuanian patriot. Picketing of the Foreign Ministry, the Seimas, and the president's residence began. A propaganda campaign was launched in the newspapers. The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry made a statement noting in particular: The country's state interests are reflected in the draft treaty, and its text will not be published before signing -- in line with a decree of the Lithuanian Government on the nonpublication of treaties being prepared for signing, and which are on the same footing as state secrets. The Foreign Ministry recalled that, as a rule, the competence of the foreign policy department is verified during the ratification in parliament of agreements prepared by diplomats. In all probability, official Vilnius will not fall under the thumb of local nationalists. President Algirdas Brazauskas is determined to sign this treaty, which is so important for both countries. A telephone conversation on this subject took place between him and Polish President Lech Walesa, and both leaders expressed support for the bilateral agreement. On the other hand, the Lithuanian authorities realize that the national radicals, by playing the Polish card, are not in the least concerned about state security, but rather about political advantage. In an effort to rock the atmosphere in the country, the ruling Democratic Labor Party believes, they are prepared even to rouse the dissatisfaction of the local Poles densely populating South East Lithuania. Therefore, the ruling majority is unlikely to allow the initiative to be snatched back by those who strive for power through any means. The authorities will firmly stand their ground, otherwise the nationalists may spoil everthing -- relations with Poland, and relations with the local Poles.
