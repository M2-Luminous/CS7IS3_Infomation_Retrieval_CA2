Several brokers and bankers told BISNIS yesterday that BAPINDO, which went public through the issuance of about 800 billion rupiah in bonds, must give guarantees to investors that their investments are safe. "Holders of BAPINDO bonds are now generally disturbed," said a broker who did not want his name mentioned. In fact, he added, some of the bonds that were issued have fallen due, but many that have not yet fallen due are in the hands of investors. "To reassure investors, there should be a statement from the government," he said. Meanwhile, Mas Abdurachim Husein, chairman of the Association of Stock Brokers Representatives (AWP2E), said that it is difficult to sell BAPINDO bonds now. "To reassure investors, I also hope that there will be a statement from the government that BAPINDO bondholders are safe," he urged. BAPINDO has issued bonds seven times, the most recent in January of last year at a value of 300 billion rupiah. Those bonds were issued in series J and at both fixed and floating interest rates. The fixed interest rate was 17.25 percent per annum for the first through the fourth interest coupons. Floating interest rates were in effect for the second, third, fourth, and fifth years and applied to the fifth through the 20th coupons, based on average interest rates for three-month time deposits at the State Savings Bank. BISNIS sources at BUMN's in the sphere of the Department of Finance said that the arrest of three BAPINDO directors does not mean that they are suspects. "It is possible that two of them are suspects and that one is only a witness," he said.
