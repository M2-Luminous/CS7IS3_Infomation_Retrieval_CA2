It said already 85 to 95 percent of the essential drugs are out of patent limits and the remaining drugs will also be off the list by the time the law comes into force in the next 10 years. The study was on the impact of GATT on Indian economy. The study said prices of drugs will not rise before 2005 AD and this would give the Indian industry sufficient time to build its research and development activities. The study also says India stands to gain by about $4.5 billion by the turn of the century under the new trade setup with benefits of around $1.5 to 2 billion in the initial years. The increase in trade is likely to occur from the tariff reduction on a number of agricultural and industrial products.
