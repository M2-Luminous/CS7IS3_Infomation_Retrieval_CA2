"We were sitting on a keg of gunpowder for the first few days, because the situation we inherited was very delicate, but he noted that (the "gunpowder") is being rendered inactive." Reina, a 68-year-old leader who took power on 27 January, inherited a country with a foreign debt of some $3.7 billion, a fiscal deficit exceeding 11 percent, and a commercial balance that was unfavorable by some $400 million. On completing his first 100 days of government on 10 May, Reina stated in a message to the nation that "Honduras' current problems stem principally from the ethical and administrative blunders of the former government." He also stated that "dishonesty in the conduct of state workers was one of the most serious flaws of the former government" and that "it is not fair, in light of this, to leave unpunished those who were favored by the most brazen methods of corruption ever recorded in Honduras' recent history." Callejas rejected these remarks and said that, if Reina has proof of corruption in the former government, he should present it before the courts. The president has pledged to send to prison the corrupt ones and to adopt drastic measures -- which will have an effect on the Honduran people -- to remedy the damage caused and to initiate the economic recovery demanded by the nation. "The country does not have resources, but we are making immense efforts and hope to push ahead," the president stated in an interview granted to ACAN-EFE in Tegucigalpa. In his opinion, when a country has a government that is "absolutely legitimate, democratic, and of moral authority amd handles funds in an open and pure manner, there is confidence, sympathy, and national and international sovereignty." As an example of that confidence and international solidarity, the president cited the visit to Honduras last 24 May by U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, who met with the Central American presidents to analyze the agenda of the Summit of the Americas. The summit was called by President Bill Clinton and is scheduled to be held in Miami in December. Reina admitted that Honduras' situation is difficult, but said it is better than that of other countries, which are "beset not only by economic problems, but also by violence, instability, and lack of political solutions." Reina's government was politically strengthened by the visit of Gore, who expressed to the president his solidarity with "the government of moral revolution" that he is directing to overcome the economic crisis of this Central American nation, which returned to democracy in 1982, after virtually two decades of military regimes. In his four months of government, Reina has implemented some monetary measures, which have been supported by the private sector, to alleviate the crisis. He has not, however, been able to control the spiraling inflation, which, between January and May, registered 12.7 percent, according to Central Bank figures. The prices of products have increased, hitting hard the low income sectors. The president has asked Hondurans to have "patience" and not to pressure him, because he is convinced that the "vast national convergence" process, which he has asked all social sectors to join, will bring the country out of its most serious problems. Domestically, Reina has also secured political achievements, such as the elimination of the mandatory military service and its replacement with a "voluntary, educational, humanitarian, social, and democratic" plan approved by the National Congress. The Armed Forces were not in agreement with it, but in the end accepted it out of "discipline." The president took over a government plagued by a difficult economic situation, worsened by the electricity crisis faced by the country since last January, resulting in drastic power cuts for periods up to six hours. One fourth of the country's production is affected by the lack of electricity. The crisis has become more acute because of a shortage of 120 megawatts, although the government is making efforts to overcome the situation that is keeping Honduras in semi-darkness.
