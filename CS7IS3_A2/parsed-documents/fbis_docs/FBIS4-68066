FBIS4-68066 "jptot019__l94031" JPRS-TOT-94-019-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 9 May 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA LEBANON Hizballah Official on Israeli Withdrawal, Revolutionary Hizballah Official on Israeli Withdrawal, Revolutionary Guards JN0305151694 London AL-WASAT in Arabic 2-8 May 94 pp 19, 20 JN0305151694 London AL-WASAT Arabic BFN ["Text of a Dialogue" with Shaykh Na'im Qasim, deputy secretary general of Hizballah, by Faysal Jallul in Beirut; date not given] [Excerpts] Jallul: Hizballah is at odds with the Lebanese State, and therefore, it has to either accept or reject it. It seems to us that your party has decided to adapt to the situation. This is clear because it did not respond to the al-Ghubayrah incident and because it takes part in parliamentary action and politics. Qasim: Adaptation usually means a relinquishment of principles. This is wrong and unacceptable. Adherence to principles, however, does not necessarily mean a military clash with those with whom we differ. The West may want to promote the idea that any ideological and political difference with a party like ours will inevitably lead to a military clash. We in Lebanon have chosen the way of clashes with the Israeli enemy only. On the internal level, we believe that ideological and political differences should not lead to military clashes. We also still believe in the need to promote the Islamic trend and thought as the best alternative for the people. We offer our faith to others, share with them issues acceptable to us and them, explain our views on issues of dispute, and do not believe in the use of force to impose our will on others. Therefore, we did not respond militarily to the 13 September massacre. Those who perpetrated the massacre wanted to draw us into an internal military conflict to justify the international security situation, confuse the party, and try to settle some scores under the pretext that our party opted for a military clash, especially with the Lebanese Army. We did not respond militarily because we do not believe in the use of that method by any side and because we did not want to be drawn into others' plans whenever and wherever they wanted. We view the 13 September massacre as part of a plan to strike at the resistance, and not as a transitory issue designed to prevent a peaceful demonstration. [passage omitted] Jallul: You are linked with Iran by spiritual and strategic ties, and you are linked with Syria by political relations on the ground. Do you not fear the risks of a collision between the two parties over the Middle East issue? Qasim: [passage omitted] In our relations with Iran and Syria, we do not feel that Iranian-Syrian relations are contradictory, and we feel that we are in harmony with both parties. [passage omitted] Jallul: Will you continue to fight Israel if it withdraws from Lebanon? Qasim: We support the Palestinian people in defending their occupied territories because we regard this people as rightful. However, details of this support would be discussed at an appropriate time. [passage omitted] Jallul: In your slogans you say that "Israel is a germ" and should be removed from the map. Let us suppose that the Lebanese state and Israel would sign an agreement for withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Would you continue to open fire on Israel across the Lebanese border? Qasim: We will oppose any agreement that gives legitimacy to occupation which usurps lands. Jallul: In Palestine or Lebanon? Qasim: Anywhere in this occupied territory. Details on the way of dealing and on confrontation will be left for the future. Jallul: Is the Iranian "Revolutionary Guard" playing a role in the confrontation you are waging with Israel? Qasim: The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard does not fight in southern Lebanon. However, it is known that some of its members are present in the al-Biqa' area; they play an educational and training role and do not participate in other matters. This is partly due to the Islamic leadership's attitude and partly due to the harmony among those concerned in the region. [passage omitted]
