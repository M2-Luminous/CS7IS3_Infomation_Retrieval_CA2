FR940127-0-00012 FR940127-0-00003 Discussion of Comments The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register (57 FR 39631&hyph;39635) on September 1, 1992, providing for a 60-day comment period ending November 2, 1992. The Agency received 25 comments in response to its proposed rulemaking action. A high number of commentors indicated the rulemaking was not needed because existing regulations were adequate if properly enforced. Some commentors were supportive of the rulemaking action. Comments were received about the potential abuse of the authority granted to FmHA field representatives, that the rulemaking action would cause undue delays for approval, impose more work on existing staff, and possibly warrant requiring fidelity bonds by Agency personnel. Some commentors suggested alternatives to the proposed rulemaking action, such as requiring all reserve funds be remitted to the Government for holding under its accounting system until such time as a request is approved for a withdrawal, requiring cosignatories only for problem accounts, requiring only some reserve funds to be subject to withdrawal, relying on account statements from financial institutions only, and withholding any authorized return on owners' investment for any year in which reserve accounts abuses occur. The Agency considered the various alternatives and determined the proposed rulemaking action was needed and would not impose an undue hardship on borrowers. The alternatives suggested did not warrant adoption by the Agency. The Agency does not deem it wise to require reserves to be remitted to the Government, and also finds such an alternative to be administratively undesirable, in part because the considerable accounting software modifications needed would make it cumbersome to implement. Requiring co-signatures only for problem accounts is not attractive because it does not fully accomplish an Agency objective of ensuring abuses are prevented, rather than relying on punitive measures. The Agency considers its existing policies to be adequate to impose appropriate punitive measures for those who are trying to meet program objectives; however, abuses are still occurring and preventive steps are deemed necessary. Relying on added review of statements from financial institutions does not fully accomplish an Agency objective of ensuring abuses are prevented, rather than increasingly relying on Agency monitoring to discover and punish abuses. A high number of commentors indicated that it was important that the Agency be required to act timely on requests for reserve fund withdrawals, especially where emergency repairs are needed. The Agency expects its employees to take timely action on reserve account withdrawal requests, especially where emergency cases arise. The Agency normally expects such requests to be acted on within 5 working days of the request (See 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C). However, the Agency does not agree that this is a valid reason to drop the proposed countersignature provisions. Agency regulations have long required prior consent before reserve account funds are used. When circumstances arose where emergency repairs were needed during non-federal working hours for which no cash was on hand to pay for the repairs, operators ensured such repairs were made using commonly available business practices. Operators can normally request the work be billed for payment within 30 days, or that the work be paid via the extension of credit arrangements. Such work is then able to be repaid at a later date, either through the authorized release of reserve funds for authorized purposes, or through an alternative revenue source such as project rents. However, the Agency recognized the need to permit the post approval of commitments made (e.g., work committed under credit arrangements, etc.) in emergency cases. The Agency modified 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C at paragraph XIII B 2 c (5) as a result of similar comments in a separate but related rulemaking action to accommodate such treatment. A large number of respondents also recommended requiring at least two Agency employees to be authorized to countersign for reserve account withdrawals to ensure that prompt action can be taken should employees be on travel or leave. Although the Agency understands it may be desirable to ensure that at least two officials are authorized to countersign for reserve account withdrawals, it may be impractical to require multiple counter-signatures by authorized Agency officials in some circumstances. The Agency does not object to accommodating multiple counter-signatures. However, it does not desire to require multiple signatures, in part, because normal business practices should not demand extremely prompt action on reserve withdrawal requests even when emergency situations occur. There are ample means of handling emergencies in a prompt manner other than by relying solely on the immediate access to reserve account funds. Also, some FmHA offices do not have two qualified employees to authorize reserve fund withdrawals.
