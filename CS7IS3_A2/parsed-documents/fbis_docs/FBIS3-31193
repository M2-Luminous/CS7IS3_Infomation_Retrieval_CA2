This week the cabinet heard a report by Jeszenszky on the consequences of the embargo, she said. According to the report, UN member-states are not automatically entitled to financial compensation for losses caused by UN actions, Juhasz said. On a Hungarian proposal, the UN Security Council declared that Hungary needs assistance in solving economic hardships stemming from observance of the UN resolution. For this reason, the Security Council appealed to the UN member states to provide direct technical and financial assistance to easing the harmful consequences. The United Nations qualified Hungary's temporarily suspending its contribution to the UN budget as an acceptable way of alleviating economic difficulties.
