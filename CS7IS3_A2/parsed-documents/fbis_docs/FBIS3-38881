They stress that he acts better as a statesman, he has a considerably higher reputation abroad, and he has the same ability to push through what he wants. However, only a minority -- just 29 percent -- would vote for him in direct elections because Scharping has more "charisma" and, thus, gets 43 percent of the votes. However, even the challenger cannot be completely satisfied with this glorious result of opinion research in January, because as many as 27 percent of the Germans in the new laender, as well as 14 percent in the west, said: "We would not vote for either of them." Twelve percent in the east and the west do not know whom they would prefer as chancellor. However, one thing is certain: The reputation of the Federal Government and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] is falling deeper and deeper into the icy depths of opinion. As a result, large circles, in particular the CDU, are shivering: Only about one-quarter of the Germans expect the government led by the CDU to master the "current main political problems and tasks best," while 39 percent think that of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Only in economic policy (38 to 30 percent) and in combating crime (29 to 28 percent) is the coalition expected to be a bit more competent than an SPD-led government. In all other fields, the trust in the chancellor and in his team has waned. Be it in unemployment (17 to 45 percent), tax policy (21 to 43 percent), state debts (25 to 27 percent) or in social policy (13 to 64 percent), the majority says: "The Social Democrats would be better able to solve the problems." This applies even to one of the current domains of the CDU/CSU as the guarding of price stability. A total of 31 percent of those polled thought that here, too, the SPD would do better (coalition: 27 percent). Those in the Konrad-Adenauer House [CDU headquarters] and in the Chancellor's Office in Bonn, who have not yet dressed warmly in view of these figures, are beginning to freeze: Only 18 percent of the Germans want a coalition government under the leadership of the CDU or a CDU/CSU government, but 32 percent think: The SPD should rule on its own or should be the decisive force in a coalition. Despite these devastating results of the FOCUS poll, the CDU/CSU has not yet completely lost among the voters. Facing the decision of making a cross on the voting slip for the Bundestag elections here and now, 34 percent (minus 1 percentage point compared with December 1993) would still vote for the CDU/CSU, while 39 percent would vote for the SPD (plus/minus zero). Just like before the Bundestag elections in 1990, the polls in the new laender are damaging the CDU/CSU's hopes for winning the all-German elections. While in western Germany, 37 percent would again vote for the CDU/CSU, in eastern Germany, the CDU would get only a meager 23 percent. Here, the old communists of the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] would get a proud 16.5 percent of the votes of mourning GDR nostalgics, which, however, would not be enough for entering the Bonn parliament again because of the nationwide 4-percent threshold, unless Gysi and company managed to get a direct mandate. The strategists of the CDU/CSU can turn these figures around as much as they want: At the moment, the coalition is so far removed from a majority among the population as Helmut Schmidt with his Social-Liberal team in the past. Together with the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] (8 percent), the CDU/CSU would get 42 percent of the votes. The SPD and the Greens (10 percent), on the other hand, would get 49 percent of the votes and thus have a sufficiently solid majority in the Bundestag, because, in addition to the PDS, Republikaner (3 percent) and "others" (2 percent) would not enter the Bundestag either. However, if the parties were to take into consideration only these results, they might reckon without their actual host, namely those who have not yet decided. A total of 26 percent of those eligible to vote do not yet know which party they will vote for. The struggle for votes will focus primarily on them because their decision can change the election result to such an extent that it will give the lie to the election forecasts. The real surprise, however, which everyone -- from Helmut Kohl and Theo Waigel to Klaus Kinkel and Rudolf Scharping -- can enjoy is the low number of those Germans who would not vote at a Bundestag election. On behalf of FOCUS, Basis Research asked 1,500 people eligible to vote (of them 1,000 in western Germany) and only 12 percent of them answered: "I will not vote." This means that the turnout would definitely be over 80 percent. Thus, the often- mentioned "disenchantment with politics" would just be an empty shell. The Bundestag elections will be won by those who give a convincing answer to the dominant question: Who will finally lead us, how and when, out of the economic low and get the almost 4 million unemployed back to work? All over Germany, the present "general" economic situation is rated very poorly: 49 percent say it is "bad" or "very bad." Only 15 percent think it is "good" or even "very good" (1 percent). A total of 35 percent think it is neither good nor bad. This mood is bound to send shivers down the spines of politicians, unless there were the replies to the following question: "How do you assess your personal economic situation?" To this question, 6 percent replied "very good," 53 percent "good," 30 percent "neither good nor bad," a mere 9 percent said "bad," and 2 percent "very bad." It seems that those who have always said "the mood is worse than the actual situation" are right. Even in the new laender, the polling institutes spot contentment -- not even four years after the "monetary union." A total of 45 percent say: "I am fine or even very fine." Only 15 percent complain: "I am in a bad or even a very bad way." Forty percent reply: "neither/nor." The level of optimism is not going down either: Only 15 percent of Germans see a dark future and fear that they might be worse off in a year's time. But 19 percent are convinced: "I will be better off then." A total of 66 percent think that their economic situation will not change. Here, too, there is a big gap between the "personal" and "general" economic situations, for the Germans do not assess the economic future of their country as brightly as their own. Only 2 percent are convinced that "things will be much better in a year's time." "Somewhat better," is how 29 percent rate the year 1995. "The same," say 40 percent, "somewhat worse," 23 percent, and 5 percent say it will be "much worse." If one compares the positive and the negative replies, the following becomes apparent: Optimism is growing. In February 1993, the relation between "things will get better" and "things will get worse" was 26:38 percent; in January 1994, the ratio was 31:28 percent. The curve of optimism reached its peak in June 1993: Back then, 35 percent thought that things will be "better" in a year's time, while only 26 percent said that things will get "worse." The elections will be won by those who can present the most convincing answers to the questions that most bother the voters: unemployment (the biggest problem for 58 percent), economic policy (26 percent), social policy (24), fighting radicalism (23), foreigners (20), and internal security (19 percent). The election campaign arena is set. The match can begin.
