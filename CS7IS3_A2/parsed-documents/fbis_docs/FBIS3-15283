He expressed his concern over the fact that, in conditions when a campaign has been unleashed in the United States around the Ames affair, the publishing of such reports serves in the final analysis the unseemly purpose of misleading the public, exerting a psychological pressure on the staff of counterintelligence bodies, and paralyzing their activities.
