Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;619&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon a transportation service for Public Service Electric & Gas Company (PSE&G), which was authorized in Docket No. CP79&hyph;389, as amended, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. TGPL proposes to abandon firm and interruptible transportation carried out under its Rate Schedule X&hyph;222 for PSE&G. TGPL is authorized to transport up to 75,000 dt equivalent of natural gas per day (or a greater amount if mutually agreed upon) on an interruptible basis for PSE&G and up to 6,600 dt equivalent of natural gas per day on a firm basis. Both firm and interruptible services were for transportation from offshore and onshore Louisiana to various delivery points in New Jersey. PSE&G has notified TGPL of its intent to terminate the service under Rate Schedule X&hyph;222 with an effective date of June 22, 1994. It is stated that the service proposed for abandonment would be replaced by TGPL's existing Part 284 transportation on an interruptible service under TGPL's Rate Schedule IT. It is asserted that PSE&G can receive equivalent service this way with the same quality and flexibility as other Rate Schedule IT shippers.
