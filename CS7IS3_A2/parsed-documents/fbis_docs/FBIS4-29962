The white paper positions this year as the "First Year for Multimedia" in which work on the next-generation telecommunication network is undertaken in earnest and predicts that the new age will stimulate the birth of new industries and contribute to the improvement in working conditions. It also provides the assessment that the multimedia age will be effective in resolving the issues of the aging of society and over-concentration of the population in the Tokyo area. Further, the report indicates the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] will provide support for such programs by preparing a multimedia construction program and conducting leading-edge research. The MPT will publish the white paper in printed form as well as in CD-ROM (compact disk, read-only memory) format. Release of the white paper will be on a nonprofit basis and in the form of loans to interested parties beginning in July. The most recent version of the white paper is characterized by the fact that all of Chapter 3 is devoted to the review of multimedia. The paper introduces multimedia systems already in use or being developed and refers to television broadcasting enabling the selective reception of images and accompanying audio data, use of interactive cable television (CATV) to reserve tickets and on-line shopping and technological experimentation using virtual reality techniques to engage in four-party remote design of aircraft through computer terminals. The paper identifies four issues which must be addressed in the commercialization of these services: 1) nationwide construction of an optical fiber network; 2) development and standardization of data communication technology and formats; 3) development of application software; and 4) revision of social systems and customs such as intellectual property ownership systems and protection of privacy. The MPT stresses implementation of policies aimed at the realization of such services. It also summarizes the status of construction and usage of data communication infrastructure and equipment as of 1992. It mentions that contracts for cellular telephones increased by 18.8 percent over the prior year and conspicuous growth in use of paging systems and household use of facsimile machines. The paper also mentions that class-1 telecommunications operators that operate independent communications facilities and offer telecommunications services total 80 companies and have experienced an increase in revenues of 4.7 percent, which was better than other industries.
