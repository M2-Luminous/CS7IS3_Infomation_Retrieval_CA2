Like nervous stock exchange operators, they follow the Russian exchange rate movements. The irreversibility of the reforms used to be a dogma. But now, trying to convince oneself no longer works -- the load is tipping over. When he meets President Clinton, Kohl will be very concerned. Bonn gets the impression that the Western superpower is about to change its course: The shift toward subsidizing the huge arms industry, Kozyrev's move toward a Tsarist-Stalinist policy of spheres of influence, the deliberate destabilizing of Ukraine, and the return of the nomenclature in Belarus have led to heated discussions in the United States. Has Kohl's forecast of the reforms been any better? This is rather doubtful. Who kissed Yeltsin? What worries the chancellor are the abrupt shifts in U.S. judgment. Under the State Department's influence, Clinton opted for a strict "Russia first." The Central Eastern Europeans were kept at a distance from NATO with the airy Partnership for Peace program. In Moscow, Clinton gave a blank check to the policy of spheres of influence: He said that Moscow's interference in Georgia could have a stabilizing effect, just like the United States' interference in Panama and Grenada. That was tempting. When Kozyrev added to this with his comment on Russian spheres of interest, Washington warned of a new hegemony. Clinton's friend Talbott had to swallow his words. First he said that Russia needs "less shock, more therapy." After the fall of the reformers, he said: "Reforms first, then assistance." Contradictions bring confusion into politics. Will Kohl be able to fix anything?
