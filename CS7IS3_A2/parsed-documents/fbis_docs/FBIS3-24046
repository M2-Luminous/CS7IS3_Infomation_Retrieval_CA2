And indeed, conversation revived right away, because everyone had something to say on this issue. A similar situation, it seems, exists in the public at large. It is annoying, though, that the scolding we receive is sometimes simply invalid, or that sometimes the most absurd accusations are levelled against us. Some maintain that nothing has changed at Lithuanian Radio and Television, that the "Landsbergisites" are in charge and running things, just as before. Others, on the contrary, are angry that the LDDP is running things as if it owned the place, while opposition politicians are not even allowed in through the door... I admit that I react to all this shedding of tears much more playfully: if both sides are dissatisfied, well then, that's not bad, we are probably succeeding in maintaining a balance and in trying to achieve the goal we have set for ourselves--above all else, to provide information that is objective and free of any partisan politics. With respect to political broadcasts, we intend to seek a balance and to do our best to ensure that the representatives of all political forces are able to express their opinion on Lithuanian Radio and Television. We want to structure our broadcasts so that that there is dialog instead of accusations made in the absence of one's opponent. And let the viewers decide who is right. But maybe these are just our wishes? How are things in reality? Let's look at the numbers. Last year, 247 LDDP representatives, 218 members of the right opposition, and 175 members of parties with a centrist orientation spoke on Lithuanian radio. The proportion on television worked out to be pretty much the same: LDDP - 93, the right - 98, the center (social democrats, Center Union, liberals, etc.) -64. Among individual politicians, those talking most frequently on the radio were C. Jursenas (46 times), V. Landsbergis and G. Vagnorius (34 times each), G. Kirkilas (30), J. Karosas (25), A. Kubilius (18), V. Jarmolenka (17). On television, the viewers most frequently saw V. Landsbergis (8 times), R. Ozolas and G. Pavirzis (7 times each), J. Bernatonis and S. Peceliunas (6 times each), etc. This statistical compilation does not include those politicians who spoke briefly in our informational broadcasts, nor does it include President A. Brazauskas or Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, who spoke not as representatives of a political force, but as the highest officials in Lithuania. How might one assess these numbers? Keeping them in mind, it is difficult to understand the short-tempered statements made both here and abroad by the National Harmony-Conservatives of Lithuania party to the effect that it is not able to make use of the national radio and television. I could more readily say--in self-criticism--that it is not normal that a group which lost the elections in devastating fashion spoke on television even more frequently than the representatives of the ruling party. Simply giving in to noisy protest campaigns--and in the name of peace--our producers apparently invited the conservatives to appear on radio and television more frequently than ought to have been done on the basis of their political weight in the Seimas. This is even more valid with respect to the people from the small moderate political parties, who had the opportunity to use the airwaves not very much less than the two large parties. A few words should also be said about the relationship between the national government and Lithuanian Radio and Television. I could characterize it as normal. Neither the government leadership nor the Seimas meddled in our affairs or tried to direct us, palm off their opinions on us, or call us "on the carpet", something which was entirely customary two or three years ago. And still, the fact that our relations are businesslike and normal today does not yet mean that they will remain that way tomorrow, nor that at some time after a change in government, the new leaders of Lithuania will not want to take advantage of the charter for state radio and television. This is why I am uneasy. And even if the government does not make any big demands directly, the constant danger of this happening will always remain, because the financing of radio and television will depend on the governing structures, and even on the views of a single high official, who might say: "You criticized the government and didn't do what it wanted, and we're cutting several million litas from your budget..." In other words, state radio and television and their programs will depend on the government whether they want to or not. Avoiding this kind of dependence, our colleagues in western Europe changed to a public status for radio and television a good 10 years ago. That is also the direction in which all of the post-communist countries of Central Europe are headed, and some (e.g., Poland), have even already gone through the legal steps to make this status official. And what is this public radio and television? First and foremost, it is an entity independent of government structures, and this independence is guaranteed by law. The government neither approves nor dismisses the administrative leadership running radio and television. This leadership tries to work in a way that satisfies the public interest and it is accountable to a collective body composed of representatives from all segments of society and various political forces, representatives who are elected in accordance with the law and without any interference by the government. But most important is the fact that public radio and television is nowhere financed out of a government's budget. In most European countries, the funds are accumulated from subscriber fees and advertising. I doubt that this method of financing would be acceptable for Lithuania, given its difficult economic situation. Supplemental taxes (20-25 litas per month for a family) would be difficult to bear for our people, which is why we are suggesting that we take advantage of the experience of Turkey, Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, and other countries whose economies were quite unstable just a short time ago. In those countries, the budget of the national public radio and television is composed of direct and legally defined deductions from revenues received for electrical energy. An individual family scarcely notices such taxes, and the radio and television have a stable budget that is independent of inflation and allows them to plan at least a few years in advance without worrying about the whims of this government or that. In its "Signs of the Times" column on 2 January 1993, LIETUVOS RYTAS asks whether public status "would help improve the quality of broadcasts on Lithuanian television?" I am not so naive that I would immediately rush to respond: "yes!" With the Lithuanian cinema and theater dying, in view of the fact that literature, music, and art are going through a crisis, and with envy, anger, and intolerance having spread out into society, it is hard to imagine that the day after its change in status, radio and television would begin to shine with sublime, inspired, and interesting broadcasts... That's not the way things are, that's not the way things can be. Our radio and television are as we ourselves are. And still, in preparing a program, if we wouldn't have to keep one eye out for the government, if we would have enough technical equipment, if we could afford to pay the actor or the writer who was invited to be on the broadcast a decent fee, and not a miserable 3-4 litas, then it would be possible to demand a different quality of broadcast. In this regard, a public status for Lithuanian radio and television could really help quite a bit.
