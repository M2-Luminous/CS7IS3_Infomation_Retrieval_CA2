The gap is not yet significant, but the development trend is alarming from the standpoint of prospects for membership. The percentage of respondents uncertain of where they stand on the issue was noticeably large throughout this period, nearly a fourth of them. Opposition to EU membership in Sweden and especially in Norway is still considerably stronger than here among us. This is why the change might have been anticipated. While it is premature to speak of a lasting change on the basis of a single poll, public opinion seems to be seriously confused with regard to the wisdom of EU membership. The number of opponents has not very significantly increased during the past year, but many supporters have at least become doubters. The EC Commission's harsh stance on agriculture certainly led to an increase in the percentage of both doubters and opponents. It is hard to say how much the different Aho government ministers' wavering or contradictory positions on membership or the superficiality of the debate have influenced the development of public opinion. Opposition to it has grown in Sweden, even though the government as well as the opposition single-mindedly support the membership negotiations. In Sweden the reason for the increase in opposition to the EU has been sought in the fact that [in the negotiations] they have gotten too bogged down in various problematic details and can therefore no longer see the forest for the trees. Citizens' confusion at this point in the negotiations is understandable. If their confusion is prolonged, more of them than before may switch to opposition to membership. The government must convince citizens that it knows what it wants and do everything it can in the nation's interests in the negotiations. This does not mean inflexible intransigence. Hopefully, it will suffice for the end result of the negotiations to be "reasonable," that is, as favorable as it is possible to achieve. There has been much too little discussion on alternatives to EU memberships.
