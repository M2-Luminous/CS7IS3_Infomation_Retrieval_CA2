In fact VEGA uses technologies that have been perfected by BPD for other national and European projects (these being the boosters for the Ariane launchers, the Zefiro propulsor and the perigee engine IRIS [Italian Research Interim Stage]) and uses the same philosophy as the San Marco Scout launcher, designed some years ago by Prof. Luigi Broglio of La Sapienza University in Rome. The first piece of good news came from the Italian Space Agency (ASI). ASI Commissioner Prof. Giampietro Puppi appears to have signed a contract valued at about 10 billion lire that would allow BPD and the other subcontracting companies, Contraves Italiana and Riva Calzoni, to acquire the necessary sophisticated technologies for the development of the new launcher. Secondly, another go-ahead for the VEGA, that is no less important, seems to have come from the commission of experts nominated last summer by University and Scientific Research Minister Prof. Umberto Colombo to definitively settle the question of the realization of a national light launcher and what has become the violent contraposition of the two programs that have been launched by the ASI in this sector. On one hand there is the San Marco Scout, proposed by Rome University, using mainly technologies and subsystems that have been produced by the U.S. company LVS, and on the other hand there is the VEGA, that initially started as a progressive industrialization and Italianization of the San Marco Scout, but that has slowly acquired its own form, proposing itself as a valid alternative. The commission of experts, presided over by Dr. Sergio Ristuccia, a magistrate from the State Audit Court, has recently ended its work and delivered its conclusions to Minister Colombo. According to some indiscretions, the Ristuccia commission has expressed a negative evaluation of the San Marco Scout project, mainly because this carrier would use technologies that are now obsolete, and because the public funding that would be necessary to update it would largely be spent in the United States, without a valid economic and technological return for our country. Vice versa, the report of the commission would have expressed a favorable opinion on the development in Italy of an industrial project (this being the VEGA). It also confirms that there are real market possibilities for a light launcher able to launch small scientific, applications, and commercial satellites, weighing between about 400 and 1,000 kilograms, into low orbits. According to some estimates, the current BPD project, which has been derived directly from the so-called "F configuration" of a study of an optimized national launcher, that was put forward by the ASI would have global development costs of about 400 billion lire. The most important market opportunity for the VEGA, apart from the eventual launching of small scientific satellites for the ASI, such as the CESAR [Central European Satellite for Advanced Research], would today seem to be flights to put the Iridium satellites, developed by the U.S. Motorola company for the Motorola global personal communications system, into orbit. This business involves between two and four launches each year for at least 10 years. The VEGA, which could be sold at about $14 million, should be the ideal candidate. This depends on whether Italy, the ASI, and BPD quickly manage to demonstrate (some say before 1996) that they possess an effective and reliable launching system and that they do not just have one of the many "dreams in the drawer."
