The view could also be heard that the minister of foreign affairs rather backs Vaclav Havel's statements in support of air strikes, made during the president's visit to Thailand. In this context, we asked Josef Zieleniec a few questions: [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is your view of possible NATO air strikes in Bosnia? [Zieleniec] First, it must be realized that the world is still at a loss about what to do about this conflict and that a solution can come only from within the former Yugoslavia, perhaps with help from international organizations. Second, however, we also have to realize that the NATO countries' ultimatum is meant, first and foremost, as some kind of relief for the citizens of Sarajevo. It is an attempt to prevent the city from being strangled. It was very hard for the NATO states to arrive at this decision, which is not only militarily intricate but also politically risky. I believe that, at such a moment, our place is by their side. If we use the word "allies" in relation to these countries, we should be taking this term seriously in good times as well as in bad--that is, even when decisions that are painful and difficult for them are at stake. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Prime Minister Klaus does not believe that there will be any air strikes. What is your opinion? [Zieleniec] I have been in politics for too long to let myself be dragged into forecasting. Nevertheless, I hope they will not occur. Everything suggests that NATO issued its ultimatum with all due responsibility, and it seems that the warring parties, too, realize this. If the ultimatum is accepted as a serious warning, there need not be any air strikes, which is certainly the wish of all people who care about peace in Europe. [LIDOVE NOVINY] Should we back the allies only with regard to the ultimatum, or should we back them also in the event of actual air strikes? [Zieleniec] The ultimatum cannot be detached from its fulfillment, for otherwise it would be empty rhetoric and a political mistake. Minister of Defense Antonin Baudys, too, spoke with LIDOVE NOVINY about the possibility of air strikes. He said, among other things, that the NATO Council's decision on whether to intervene in Bosnia has its pros and cons. "The NATO analysts and strategists have enough information and are sufficiently qualified to know how to decide. I believe that their decision was correct. It is true, and it is also my opinion that a solution does not lie in air raids or other acts of military intervention but only in negotiations. As the negotiations still have not produced any results, however, it was necessary to exert stronger pressure on the parties to the Bosnian conflict to sit down at the conference table with a greater measure of goodwill to seek a compromise. This is how I perceived the ultimatum and the NATO Council's agreement to the possible bombing of the Serbian artillery positions. As far as our attitude is concerned, I do not want to foist upon our representatives ulterior motives in the sense that, when we want to be in NATO, we must agree with it. NATO surely will not request our cooperation now because we are not a member."
