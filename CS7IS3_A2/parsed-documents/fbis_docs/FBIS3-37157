Amongst the most often cited sins in this regard was the absolute secrecy surrounding the personal life of the country's top officials, their health... Since then only six or seven years have passed. But how much has changed! (Admittedly, we won't specify here in which direction this has been). However, the changes have scarcely really affected the aforementioned "delicate" question. People may object to this by saying that only last week the Russian president's administration reported that the president was working in his out-of-town residence because he was suffering from a cold. All true: A report was issued and requisite explanation furnished. But this can hardly be regarded as adequate or exhaustive in a situation where the head of state is involved, particularly as we Russians have been continually urged by top officials in recent years to follow the example of "civilized" countries. Let's look at how such questions are resolved over there in the West and the United States, in particular. The president's health, I read in an publicity handout specially prepared for President Clinton's visit to Moscow, is a significant indicator to Americans. When they vote in elections for a particular candidate they want to see not just that the future head of state's election manifesto meets their interests, they also want to see, the authors of the publicity handout specially stress this, a new White House incumbent who is vigorous, active, and undoubtedly healthy. It is not surprising when the U.S. president is ill that journalists lay siege to the physicians who are treating him. And they answer numerous questions. Experts on American life claim that medical confidentiality does not exist in this instance. However, while citing the American example I have no doubt at all that in a matter of days Boris Yeltsin's health will be restored and he will be delivering a message to the deputies of the Federal Assembly. So there would seem to be no special need to blow up the topic of the Russian president's suffering from a cold, there wouldn't be but for a radio report: Speaking to journalists, the American president complained that for some unknown technical reasons he had been unable to speak to Boris Yeltsin by telephone for two days. The conversation between the presidents did, as you will know, eventually take place. However, it was somewhat late, in my opinion: After all, just a few days ago Bill Clinton was still wondering whether it was worthwhile for NATO to bomb Serbian positions near Sarajevo, while now it seems he is ready to support the NATO decision. And the question is a really crucial one. If NATO starts bombing the Serbs, this will inevitably lead to heavy civilian casualties. Many military specialists, including Russian ones, have pointed out this danger. Moreover, there are serious fears that the possible bombing could be the start of World War III... Incidentally, the (U.S.) White House press secretary already knows by 0800 hours the president's whole schedule for the next 24 hours and can comment on much that is of interest to journalists. And I have no doubt that if circumstances forced Clinton to leave for his out-of-town residence at Camp David, his press secretary would promptly and as fully as possible satisfy the far-from-idle interest in this event on the part of the mass media. But what about in our country? In Russia we are beset by a very grave socioeconomic crisis; the number of strikes is growing; miners, gas, communications, agricultural workers and representatives of other sectors are demanding that the government settle its debts; conflicts are blazing in danagerous proximity to our country -- and we have silence! No one in the president's large administration takes the trouble to explain whether these questions come within the president's purview or whether they are being resolved.
