Israel is demanding that the current municipal boundaries, determined in 1967, be maintained. In recent discussions in government forums, a proposal was made to ease the restrictions imposed on the entry of Palestinians from the West Bank into the city in return for a PLO agreement to make changes in the municipal boundaries in order to reduce friction between Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem. In a previous discussion on Jerusalem, held on 26 May, Prime Minister Rabin decided to prevent the establishment of new Palestinian political bodies and ban their policing activity in the city. The prime minister instructed the Israel Police and the Shin Bet to closely monitor Orient House, the seat of the Palestinian delegation in East Jerusalem, and to immediately put an end to any illegal activity uncovered there. Over the past several days, security elements have reported that the preventive activity undertaken by the police and the Shin Bet regarding Orient House has led the Palestinians to "lower their profile" and curbed illegal activity in the building. [passage omitted] In recent discussions between Police Minister Moshe Shahal and Faysal al-Husayni, the minister proposed that the parties draft a joint list of Palestinian institutions operating in East Jerusalem to serve as a basis for maintaining the status quo in the city, as promised by Israel in Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' letter of 11 October 1993. Israel promised to protect the functioning of all the Palestinian institutions in the city. [passage omitted]
