He asserted that the government will not tolerate any interference "under the facade of the defense of human rights" in the measures that have led to the achievement of peace in Peru. Speaking about his administration, Fujimori stressed that he will not revise any of the trials of terrorists who killed dozens of innocent Peruvians. He said: "Those who perpetrated these killings were tried in compliance with the emergency laws promulgated after 5 April 1992." Fujimori on 15 April dedicated the second stage of the Yanamayo penitentiary, a maximum-security prison. In his speech, the president stated that in honor of the thousands who were killed and the hundreds of thousands of orphans, Peruvians have the moral duty of never forgetting this horrible tragedy. In view of this, he asserted that although the laws will be readjusted as peace is achieved, he will not yield an inch regarding antiterrorist issues. Fujimori said we will not allow Peruvians to again experience the violence of the 1980's. Also present at the ceremony were Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa Gadea, Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila, Energy Minister Daniel Hokama, and Chief Justice Luis Serpa Segura and other Supreme Court members. President Fujimori insisted Peru enjoys a promising future today in view of the peace that has been achieved. Speaking to journalists from Argentina, France, and Spain and representatives from some international news agencies, Fujimori warned he is not being patronizing when he said Peru has achieved an unprecedented deed. He stated: "International experiences on terrorism have shown that Peruvians have defeated this scourge in a short period and at a minimal social cost." Also present at the ceremony were 10 inmates facing terrorist charges, two of whom were serving 20-year prison sentences. President Fujimori stated: Before, certain countries recommended not travelling to Peru but that today an ever-increasing number of delegations are arriving to assess which antiterrorist measures have been adopted by the sovereign government of Peru. He said: "People compare the French, German, and Italian legislation to our own and they say that some principles are violated in Peru, but they forget to mention that the situation in those countries is completely different from ours." He said it was incoherent for some to try to make suggestions when "they left us to our fate" during 12 years of subversive violence. Fujimori said: "No government-run or private human rights organization or international organizations ever reported at the proper time the human rights violations committed by Shining Path [SL] or Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement terrorists. He harshly criticized the fact that the SL was allowed to make propaganda in Europe and America during those past 12 years, when in truth what they were doing was collecting funds to finance guerrilla activities in Peru. Without mentioning any organizations, Fujimori commented that some people have even drafted reports assessing and then disqualifying his administration's judicial and prison system. Fujimori said: "They have no right because a reform of the Civil and Penal Code that took experts on the Peruvian situation years to draft cannot be assessed in three or 10 days." The chief of state admitted the existence of isolated cases of human rights violations and corrupt government officials. "But this is the case in every country of the world, including the most developed ones, but the institutions, as such, have revealed a high degree of professionalism, high moral standards, and respect for the law. He then added that the soldiers and policemen in charge of guarding the Yanamayo prison will safeguard the inmates' safety in an honest manner. He emphasized: "The change that has taken place is that they will not allow anyone to corrupt them." The prison's second phase -- considered the most secure in the country -- was built in nine months and is divided into five wings with almost 300 inmates. The building, which has 80 individual cells and 108 cells for two inmates, cost 4.7 billion Peruvian soles. A total of 260 terrorists are lodged in the area built first. The chief of state visited this part of the prison accompanied by foreign journalists. SL leaders Maritza Garrido Lecca, Osman Morote, Martha Huatay, and other high-ranking terrorist leaders are in this part of the prison. It was learned that the aforementioned made some requests to Fujimori. During his visit, the chief of state also went to a children's home where he made some donations.
