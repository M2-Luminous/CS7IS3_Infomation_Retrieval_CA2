He said the Russian Constitution requires two thirds of votes to adopt a law. According to the Fundamental Law, regular laws should be adopted by the majority of State Duma deputies, which is 223 Duma members in its current composition. A law can be returned for improvement if the upper parliament chamber does not approve it or the law is vetoed by the president. The veto can be annulled by only two thirds of votes. Thus, the deputies should learn to overcome faction differences. "The State Duma may be turned by the opponents into a useless body, and the constitution carries a mechanism of its dissolution," said the vice-premier. He is sure the lower parliament chamber should turn into a "normal efficient body and abandon extremism". Cold War elements evident in the very second day of Duma functioning should be stopped. "If the Duma manages to overcome faction ambitions and learns to predict behavior of the upper chamber, it will be able to influence the legislative power," he stressed. Shokhin stated with regret some factions did not manage to protect interests of the Duma minority. A proposal to organize 20- deputy factions was voted down. The vice-premier expressed the assurance the more independent territorial deputy groups are formed they would be considered potentially conciliatory mechanisms. In the opinion of the vice-premier, some small factions have agreed with large ones on certain distribution of posts in the lower chamber. "This cannot be viewed as a mere expression of will, it is rather a normal parliamentary agreement between factions. It is a good lesson to other parties in the ability to reach an agreement," said Shokhin.
