(NHK). The Electronic Industries Association of Japan issued a statement expressing regret over the policy switch by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau at the Ministry, announced the policy switch at a news conference earlier Tuesday, saying that if NHK stuck to the analog HDTV system, it could become a new source of trade friction. The industry group comprises major Japanese electronics manufacturers, which are already selling analog HDTV systems based on NHK technologies. The statement said the ministry decision would cause unnecessary confusion for consumers and for the electronics industry. NHK has been experimenting with analog HDTV broadcasting, known as hi-vision, since 1991. The government-backed Hi-Vision Promotion Association said in another statement that the hi-vision broadcasts will not be discontinued in the immediate future. It urged the ministry to continue promoting hi-vision broadcasts to protect hi-vision television owners.
