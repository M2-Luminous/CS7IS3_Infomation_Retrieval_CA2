Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central Political Bureau in charge of cultural affairs, fiercely criticized some local officials who thought that "wealth would not be increased without prostitution." At present, some newspapers in Beijing have been strongly denouncing this opinion. Reportedly, in Guangxi, from Nanning and Beihai to Qinzhou, Fangcheng, and Dongxinng, people may find prostitutes everywhere. They publicly solicited in the streets without any scruples. The scenes startled tourists from other localities and seriously affected their mood. A more surprising fact was that some local officials regarded this as a "sign of prosperity and opening," and held that "this would greatly improve the soft environment for investment." Some local officials even more boldly advocated the "new conception" that "wealth would not be increased without prostitution." It seemed to them that setting up a red-light district would be a "new way to get rich." In fact, there already exist red-light districts without signboards in some coastal cities. Yin Dakui, vice minister of public health, was indignant at such a "new conception." Recently, he pointed out that the establishment of "red-light districts" would certainly lead to the legalization of prostitution, and the appearance of licensed prostitutes would not indicate the disappearance of unlicensed prostitutes, which would just further increase. The legalization of prostitution would bring about extensive debauched and promiscuous conduct in society, and venereal disease would spread to an out-of-control degree. The main measure for controlling venereal disease is still to ban prostitution. The idea of "legalizing sexual services" is inadvisable and is unsuited to China's national conditions. In the past, Li Tieying also issued an instruction, saying that China's prestige was built up on the basis of national prosperity and the people's wealth and on the basis of the country's economic, scientific, and military strength. China should rely on the stable and united environment to attract foreign investment and to develop the tourist industry. It must never rely on selling out national and personal dignity and using vulgar interests to attract foreigners. Recently, Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, strongly denounced, through the mass media, some local and departmental leaders for "showing an indifferent attitude toward" banning prostitution and "not taking effective measures" for doing this. He said that they were afraid of affecting external investment and local economic development if they thoroughly banned prostitution. As a result, "they did not act resolutely, and just turned a blind eye to prostitution activities. This inevitably left prostitution unchecked or even allow such activities to spread freely." Liu said: In some localities, the authorities "only inspected prostitution and did not actually ban it, because those who performed the duty of inspection would gain benefits by imposing fines on prostitutes and their visitors." As a popular saying goes, "detaining prostitutes may increase income, and prostitute visitors may be released." Liu revealed that "a small number of law enforcement personnel are prostitute visitors themselves, and they did not pay by using their official functions because prostitutes have to seek their protection." He said: "Such ineffective management was the key reason why prostitution could not be effectively checked and banned." The mainland official mass media also revealed that according to statistics kept by the information department of the Ministry of Public Health, up to the end of 1992, registered patients contracting venereal diseases numbered 836,835 people. The incidence of venereal diseases increased from 0.00002 percent in 1981 to 0.01724 percent at the end of 1992. Up to the end of November last year, AIDS patients and people infected by the AIDS virus numbered 1,159 people, with 14 people being dead. In addition, according to statistics by the Ministry of Public Security, 201,000 prostitutes were found and detained in 1991; and 242,000 prostitutes were found and detained in 1992. If 50 percent of the prostitutes contracted venereal diseases, then more than 200,000 people were infected through this channel.
