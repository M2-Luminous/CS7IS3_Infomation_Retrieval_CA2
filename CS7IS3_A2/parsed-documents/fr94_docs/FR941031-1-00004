FR941031-1-00004 FR941031-1-00002 FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION 12 CFR Parts 611, 618, and 620 RIN 3052&hyph;AB43 Organization; General Provisions; Disclosure to Shareholders; Technical Assistance and Financially Related Services; Member Insurance AGENCY: Farm Credit Administration. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), proposes to amend the regulations governing Technical Assistance and Financially Related Services and Member Insurance. Subpart A of the proposed regulation defines what constitutes technical assistance, financial assistance and financially related services and what types of activities the Farm Credit System (System) institutions are authorized to provide. The proposed regulation allows greater flexibility in this area, while maintaining the FCA's ability to regulate safety and soundness risks. The FCA's existing prior approval requirement is eliminated and replaced with a post-review process for all services, except for those that have never been authorized by the FCA. The FCA also proposes to amend the Member Insurance regulation to clarify existing rules and reduce regulatory burdens wherever possible. DATES: Comments should be received on or before December 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed or delivered (in triplicate) to Patricia W. DiMuzio, Associate Director, Regulation Development, Office of Examination, Farm Credit Administration, McLean, Virginia 22102&hyph;5090. Copies of all communications received will be available for examination by interested parties in the Office of Examination, Farm Credit Administration, McLean, Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda C. Sherman, Policy Analyst, Regulation Development, Office of Examination, Farm Credit Administration, McLean, VA 22102&hyph;5090, (703) 883&hyph;4498, TDD (703) 883&hyph;4444, or Joy E. Strickland, Senior Attorney, Regulatory Operations Division, Office of General Counsel, Farm Credit Administration, McLean, VA 22102&hyph;5090, (703) 883&hyph;4020, TDD (703) 883&hyph;4444. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background and Statutory Authorities Under title I, section 1.12; title II, sections 2.5 and 2.12 (15); and title III, section 3.7 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), the FCA is responsible for promulgating regulations governing the offering and administering of technical assistance, financial assistance, and financially related services by banks and associations (hereinafter referred to as ``related services''). System institutions have offered credit life insurance and a variety of other credit-related services over the past 40 years. Pursuant to regulations adopted in 1984, the FCA is responsible for the review and approval of bank financial services policies and must also approve each new related service program on a case-by-case basis before it is offered by a bank or its affiliated associations. The FCA took no further Systemwide action until 1993, when the Board adopted a policy statement (58 FR 36410, July 2, 1993) and subsequently issued a bookletter (366&hyph;OE, September 3, 1993) authorizing the providing of related services outside an institution's chartered territory, under certain circumstances. On December 2, 1993, FCA Board Chairman Billy Ross Brown completed a study entitled ``The Farm Credit System's Authorized Services'' and directed staff to use it as a basis for revising the existing regulations. The proposed regulation also incorporates the intent of the FCA Board's Policy Statement on Regulatory Philosophy published in the Federal Register on February 17, 1994 (59 FR 32189). II. Regulatory Burden Comments and Petitions for Rulemaking On June 23, 1993, the FCA Board published a ``Statement of Regulatory Burden'' (58 FR 34003) that requested comments regarding how the FCA could lessen the regulatory burden on System institutions. In response, the agency received three comment letters on related services, including one on Member Insurance. These comments are addressed in this proposed regulation and are referred to as ``Regulatory Burden Comments.''
