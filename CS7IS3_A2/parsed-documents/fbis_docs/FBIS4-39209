As of 24 May, the number of commercial banks that had been registered amounted to 210, of which 138 were set up during the last year and a half. According to specialists, such an increase in the number of commercial banks has been due to the inflation of the coupon. The exchange rate of the coupon is increasing constantly whereas the minimum capital fund for newly created banks remains, as before, 500 million coupons. If, in January, this amount was equivalent to $3,000, it was worth $480 by mid-May. It is unrealistic to open an enterprise with this amount, yet it is wholly possible to open a commercial bank, which Georgian businessmen, moreover, are using to their advantage. It is precisely for this reason that commercial banks have sprung up like mushrooms; the National Bank has put a temporary halt to their further increase until new rates are established for the minimum capital fund.
