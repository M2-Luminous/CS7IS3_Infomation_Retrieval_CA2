[Spring] I would characterize them as being very good, even excellent. I fully agree with my colleague, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, who said that the Declaration on Principles of Relations Between Ireland and Russia, which was signed in December of last year in Dublin, has not remained merely as an expression of our good intentions. Rather, it has become an important starting point for further specific work. During the visit by the Irish delegation to Moscow, we concluded an inter-governmental agreement on avoiding dual taxation between Russia and Ireland. This is very important for expanding our business ties, and especially trade. Despite its small size, in volume of trade with Russia Ireland has surpassed all the countries of the African continent combined. The trade turnover has grown most significantly during the past year--by approximately 7-8 times. Moreover, this has been due to Russian export. We are very proud of the achievements of Irish business in your country. The "Irish House" on the Arbat, the "Duty Free" stores in the airports and hotels of Moscow and St. Petersburg, the "Garden Ring" chain of Moscow supermarkets and other joint Russian-Irish enterprises are operating and have won popularity among Moscow residents. And, most importantly, Irish businessmen have an optimistic outlook and are ready to expand their activity in Russia. Thus, at the end of May the "Eire Rianta" company, together with its Russian partners, is opening one of the largest trade centers in the capital, the "Valday Center," next to the "Irish House." [Correspondent] Can you name specific new projects of economic cooperation between Russia and Ireland within the framework of inter-state agreements? [Spring] We are planning to step up our cooperation with Russia on the program of technical aid by the EC [European Communities] to the CIS country--TASIS [not further expanded], in which Irish consultants and experts are already actively engaged today. First of all, this concerns the development and modernization of such sectors of the Russian economy as management, banking, the food sector, municipal management and the sphere of services. During our meeting with Russian Vice Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov, he told of the steps which Russia was taking to enter GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], and we offered our expert assistance. I believe this offer will be accepted. [Correspondent] What are the political results of your visit to Moscow? [Spring] Although our countries are located at opposite ends of the European continent, the positions of Russia and Ireland are very close on a broad circle of international problems. In the course of negotiations with Andrey Kozyrev, with whom, I might add, I also have good personal relations, we tried to strengthen the existing mutual understanding. In our opinion, Russian will play a very important and constructive role in the future of the European continent and, as I understand from the remarks of Mr. Kozyrev, Russia intends to do this specifically through peaceful regulation of conflicts, economic cooperation and active participation in the work of the CSCE [Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe], which we, naturally, support in every way. [Correspondent] Upon completion of the negotiations in Moscow, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs thanked Ireland for its help in finalizing preparation of the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation Between Russia and the European Union. Of what, specifically, did this help consist? [Spring] I believe that I will not be committing a sin against the truth if I say that, in regard to this agreement, Ireland took a very active position within the framework of the European Union. We understand its great importance from a political and economic standpoint, primarily for stability in Europe. We worked very actively in the Council of Ministers of the EC and KEC [not further expanded], striving to conclude this agreement. Now, we are hoping that its signing is just a question of a few weeks. Of course, we should not exaggerate the role which little Ireland is capable of playing in international affairs. But, as a participant country in the European Union, where the rule of consensus is in effect during voting, we are sure that our voice will be heard at the decision-making table, and that we can make our contribution to achieving general accord and mutual understanding. [Correspondent] The chairman of the Russian government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, recently announced Russia's intention to enter the European Union. What can you say in this regard as a representative of a EC participant country? [Spring] I believe that this is an interesting proposal. At the present time, a process of consolidation, or strengthening, is taking place in the European Union. We are hoping that in January of 1995 there will be an expansion of the EC--it will be joined by Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Then, a period of consolidation will inevitably follow once again. Of course, we are conducting negotiations on acceptance with the countries of the Vyshegradskiy group and other East European countries. If we speak of the long-term prospects, then, when the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation with the Russian Federation is signed, then, based on it and having normal trade relations, we will be able to increase our ties. And after an appropriate interval of time we will make the decision as to subsequent steps. [Correspondent] Considering the sad experience of the religious-ethnic conflict in Ulster, do you believe that the European states will be able to regulate the conflict in Bosnia and other inter-ethnic conflicts on the continent? [Spring] I believe that today there are sufficient grounds to believe that the partnership between the EC, Russia, the United SA and the UN will bring the desired peace to the former Yugoslavia. Ireland was one of the first to support President Boris Yeltsin's proposal on holding talks on Bosnia at the highest level with the participation of these four parties. It is important to sit down at the negotiating table as soon as possible. When a direct discussion of the problem begins, it will not be too difficult to reach a general international position.
