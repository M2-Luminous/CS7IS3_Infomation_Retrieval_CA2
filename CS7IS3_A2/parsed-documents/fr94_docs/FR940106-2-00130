FR940106-2-00130 FR940106-2-00076 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. 93&hyph;34; Notice 2] American Honda Motor Co., Inc. Denial of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Honda) of Torrance, California determined that certain passenger cars failed to comply with 49 CFR 571.208, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208, ``Occupant Crash Protection,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573. Honda also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq. ) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. Notice of receipt of the petition was published on May 21, 1993 (58 FR 29689). This notice denies that petition. Paragraph S4.1.4.2 of Standard No. 208 requires that motor vehicles be equipped with seat belt assemblies that comply with Standard No. 209, ``Seat Belt Assemblies.'' Paragraph S4.3(j)(3) of Standard No. 209 requires that An emergency locking retractor of a Type 1 or Type 2 seat belt assembly *␣*␣* shall not lock, if the retractor is sensitive to vehicle acceleration, when the retractor is rotated in any direction to any angle of 15 degrees or less from its orientation in the vehicle *␣*␣* Honda determined that the seat belt assemblies for the rear outside seating positions of approximately 1.2 million model year 1990, 1991, 1992, and early 1993 two-door and four-door Accords do not comply with S4.3(j)(3), the emergency locking retractor requirements of Standard No. 209. When the vehicle in which the noncomplying belt is installed is in certain parking positions such as on a steep uphill grade, the rear seat occupants are sometimes unable to pull the belt out of the retractor, and thus cannot fasten their belts. The vehicle must be moved to a more level position for the rear seat occupant to be able to put on the seat belt. Honda supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following arguments: In the petitioner's opinion, the noncompliance does not affect the occupant protection performance of the subject seat belt assemblies. To verify this, Honda tested the belts to determine whether they meet the locking requirements of Standard No. 209. All the belts complied with these requirements. Further, Honda performed dynamic sled test comparisons of the noncompliant belts to complaint belts at a test speed of 30 miles per hour. Honda found that the performance of the noncompliant belts was almost the same as that of the compliant belts. Honda stated that the primary effect of the noncompliant seat belts is inconvenience due to the rear seat occupant's inability to pull the belt out from the retractor under certain parking conditions, as when the vehicle is in a significant uphill parking position in excess of 11 degrees, or when the vehicle has been parked such that one side of the vehicle is substantially higher than the other (at least nine degrees). Honda argued that the opportunities for parking an affected vehicle in this type of situation are very uncommon and would present a high level of discomfort to rear seat occupants from sitting at this angle. Honda has found that when the vehicle is parked on ground at lesser angles than previously noted, the noncompliant belts work completely normally. Honda reviewed its consumer records for complaints relating to the noncompliance. It found that consumers had registered a total of 173 complaints regarding the 4-door sedan and 34 complaints regarding the 2-door coupe. These complaints are known to be related to the subject noncompliance, as the problem is clearly described in the complaint. In addition, Honda received 168 complaints regarding the 4-door sedan and 46 complaints regarding the 2-door coupe which were not clearly defined and may not be related to the subject noncompliance. The consumer complaint ratios, taking into account only the known related complaints, are 0.026 percent for the 4-door sedan and 0.014 percent for the 2-door coupe.
