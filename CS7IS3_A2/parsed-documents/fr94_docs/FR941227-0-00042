FR941227-0-00042 FR941227-0-00011 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;67&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9096; AD 94&hyph;25&hyph;12] Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A series airplanes, that requires modification of the galley feeder cables and toilet services fuse. This amendment is prompted by a report that the gauge size of the existing galley feeder cable is not compatible with the rating of the currently used toilet services fuse. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure that the subject cables are compatible with the toilet services fuse in order to prevent overheating of the cables, which could result in smoke and fire in the cabin. DATES: Effective on January 26, 1995. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 26, 1995. ADDRESSES: The service information references in this AD may be obtained from Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., 3 Bishops Square Street, Albans Road West, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL109NE, United Kingdom. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on July 5, 1994 (59 FR 34396). That action proposed to require modification of the galley feeder cables and toilet services fuse. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour. The economic impact information, below has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate. As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA has determined that this addition will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. The FAA estimates that 4 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $5,840, or $1,460 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
