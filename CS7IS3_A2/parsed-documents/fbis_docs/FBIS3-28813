At the consultative meeting of NAM foreign ministers that ended on Thursday, they uged the international community to take serious steps in stopping the human tragedies that have claimed thousand of innocent lives. With regard to the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ministers agreed to seek the implementation of resolutions by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) including enforcing "safe areas" and limited air strikes on the Serbian troops in Bosnia. [passage omitted] Another human tragedy that was called to attention during the meeting was the protracted conflict that spawned famine, anarchy and massive loss of lives in Somalia. Foreign Minister Alatas said that the problem today was made more complicated by the intended pullout of US, French, Italian and Turkish troops that formed the bulk of UN peacekeeping forces in Somalia. The withdrawal of the troops, he said, would aggravate problems in the region since NAM's troops from India, Pakistan and Malaysia would be caught between the warring factions. "An undermaned and underarmed UN force may not be able to forestall renewed factional fighting," Alatas stressed. He also assured NAM's continued support for the UN effort by offering meeting places for constructive consultations among the politcal factions in Somalia to achieve a comprehensive solution. "It is up to Somali people and their leaders to bring their country out of the abyss, but we remain hopeful that they will respond positively to the declaration issued last December by the 4th coordinating meeting for the establishment of a committee to launch the reconciliation process," Alatas said. On the issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Alatas said that NAM welcomed the sigming of the declaration of principles on interim self-government arrangements between the PLO [Palestinian Liberation Organization] and Israel. Alatas said the peace accord, together with the mutual recognition by the PLO and Israel, constitutad the first essential step in tha long journey toward a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict. "Since then, however, there has been a significant measure of disillusionment as further negotiations to flesh out its basic provisions have encouraged numerous obstacles," he added. He said the remaining obstacles to end the conflict were mainly inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the declaration. "We are deeply concerned that the terms of Israeli withdrawal to designed areas by December 13, 1993 set up during the September peace accord has not yet materialised," Alatas said. Every effort, according to the minister, must be exerted to ensure Israel's compliance with the previsions of the September agreement which constituted the first step toward a comprehensive solution which involve the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Palestinian and Arab territories.
