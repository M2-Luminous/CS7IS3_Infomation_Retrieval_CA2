Panov was nominated to his post on December 30, 1993. In his words, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is expected to visit China in late January to discuss preparations for a Moscow visit of the Chinese leader. Russian relations with China same as with Japan "should not be a sensation but a norm; they should be relations of normal neighbours - two great powers," which interact in each other's interests, in the interests of the region and the whole world, said the official. In the opinion of Panov, it is symbolic that 1994 starts for Russia with a visit of the U.S. President and a Chinese trip of the Russian foreign minister. Being different, these visits prove the well-balanced Russian foreign policy equally oriented to the west and to the east. Russia has broad possibilities of cooperation with China, said Panov. Russia has not fully studied Chinese economic transformations to use them in domestic conditions, especially in the area of special economic zones. This idea is being considered in Russia, but China has done it more swiftly and the zones have boosted Chinese economic development. The two countries are holding border negotiations. In his opinion, pronouncements of some politicians, especially in the Far East, claiming Russia is making unilateral unjustified concessions to Beijing are ungrounded. All the concessions are bilateral and mutual. As for military cooperation, Russia and China are discussing the reduction of their armed forces in the border area. The negotiations "are not a sensation as it is clear no military preparations are underway or even possible on the borders, which increasingly become friendship frontiers". Russian-Chinese trade is mutually beneficial and does not infringe Russian economic interests. It will constantly expand. The official called for informing the public of all aspects of the Russian-Chinese relations. In his opinion, the January Beijing visit of the Russian foreign minister will do a lot of good in this respect.
