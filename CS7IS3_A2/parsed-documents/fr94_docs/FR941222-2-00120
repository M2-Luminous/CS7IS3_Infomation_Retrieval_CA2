FR941222-2-00120 FR941222-2-00096 National Bank Appeals Process The following is the OCC's Proposed Appeals Process: I. Policy The OCC is responsible for fostering the safety and soundness of the national banking system, monitoring, and enforcing national banks' compliance with laws, and encouraging competitiveness, integrity, and stability of financial services. In fulfilling this mission, it is the OCC's policy to maintain open and ongoing communication with the institutions it supervises and to foster the fair and equitable administration of the supervisory process. If a disagreement arises during the supervisory process, the OCC will resolve the dispute fairly and expeditiously in an informal, amicable manner. If disagreements cannot be resolved through informal discussions, national banks and Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks (collectively referred to as ``national banks'' for purposes of these guidelines) are encouraged, and the examiner involved in the dispute should specifically encourage the national bank, to seek a further review of the OCC decisions or actions that are in dispute. These guidelines establish a mechanism through which a national bank can seek such a review. A critical element in this appeals process is the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman is outside the bank supervision area and reports directly to the Comptroller of the Currency. With the prior consent of the Comptroller, the Ombudsman may supersede any agency decision or action during the resolution of an appealable matter. The procedures established in these guidelines provide national banks a fair and expeditious review of agency decisions and actions while ensuring that no one is disadvantaged by the filing of an appeal. If a national bank has a question as to whether it should make use of this appeal authority, it should contact the Ombudsman. II. Procedures A. Filing An Appeal A national bank may seek review of appealable matters by filing an appeal with either its immediate supervisory office or with the OCC's Ombudsman. All communications with the Ombudsman may be sent to 1000 Louisiana Street, Suite 950, Houston, Texas 77002&hyph;5008. The choice of where to file is a matter within the sole discretion of the bank, except as indicated below; all appealable matters can be received in either location. However, in cases where the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller directly or indirectly participated in making the decision under review or directly or indirectly reports to the agency official who made the decision under review, the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller must transfer the appeal to the Ombudsman. In addition, in cases where the Ombudsman should be recused from reviewing the decision under appeal, the Ombudsman shall transfer the appeal to the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy in the OCC's Washington DC Office. The procedures for filing an appeal under the two options are outlined below. 1. Supervisory Office Appeals. If a disagreement concerning an OCC supervisory decision or action cannot be resolved informally, a national bank may file an appeal with its immediate supervisory office. Community banks and regional banks seeking appeal under this option should file such appeals with the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller of the OCC District in which the bank is headquartered. Banks in the Multinational Banking or Special Supervision programs using this option should file appeals with the Deputy Comptroller for the program in the Washington Office. In cases where the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller directly or indirectly participated in making the decision under review or directly or indirectly reports to the agency official who made the decision under review, the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller must transfer the appeal to the Ombudsman after advising the appellant. An appellant national banks must submit information in writing fully describing the matter in dispute and setting forth its basis for requesting an appeal. Upon receipt of an appeal, the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller, or a designee who has not directly or indirectly participated in making the decision in dispute nor is directly or indirectly responsible to the agency official who made the decision under review, will contact the OCC employee(s) involved in the matter under appeal. The OCC employee(s) shall submit written or oral information concerning the basis of the appeal. If requested by a senior official of the national bank filing the appeal, the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller shall arrange a meeting or a telephone call to more fully discuss the appeal and related issues. In the absence of any extenuating circumstances, the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller shall issue a written response within 45 calendar days of the filing of the appeal. Immediately after the response is issued, the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller shall forward to the Ombudsman copies of all relevant materials considered in the preparation of the response, including all written submissions by the bank. If the national bank disagrees with the response from the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller, a senior official of the bank may further appeal the matter to the Ombudsman. The bank must file written notice of this second-tier appeal within 15 calendar days of receiving the response from the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller. After receipt of a second-tier appeal, the Ombudsman shall review all materials considered by the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller in the preparation of the initial response. The Ombudsman shall contact the national bank to ensure that the OCC is in possession of all relevant materials. If requested by either OCC management involved in the dispute or a senior official of the national bank filing the appeal, the Ombudsman shall arrange a meeting or a telephone call to more fully discuss the appeal and related issues. In the absence of any extenuating circumstances, the Ombudsman shall issue a written response to the second-tier appeal within 30 calendar days of the filing of that appeal. 2. Appeals to the Ombudsman When disagreements concerning OCC supervisory decisions and actions cannot be resolved informally and a national bank chooses not to file an appeal with its immediate supervisory office, a national bank may file an appeal directly with the Ombudsman. In cases where the Ombudsman should be recused from reviewing the decision under appeal, the Ombudsman shall transfer the appeal to the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy in the OCC's Washington DC office. In such cases, the procedures outlined below will apply.
