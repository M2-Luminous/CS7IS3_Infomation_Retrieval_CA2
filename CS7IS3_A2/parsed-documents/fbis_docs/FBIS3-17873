At a press conference devoted to the visit's results the chairman reported that he had met with Catherine Lalumiere, secretary general of the Council of Europe, in Strasbourg. "Past Russian parliamentarians," Shumeyko said, "have insisted that Russia must become a Council member because it is so big and great and must therefore have an exception made for it. We structured the discussion differently. If Russia meets the necessary criteria for admission, we will be glad to be accepted into the Council." The Council president replied that this question would most probably be decided after the parliament's summer recess. Shumeyko said in response to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent's question about Boris Nikolayevich's health that certain circles needed a campaign to discredit the president in order to destabilize the situation. According to him the president is a real "workaholic." He can get up at 0200 and work.
