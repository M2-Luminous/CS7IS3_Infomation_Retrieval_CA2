FBIS4-34958 "drlat124__a94016" FBIS-LAT-94-124-A Daily Report 25 Jun 1994 ANNEX Cuba Canada Signs Nickel, Cobalt Agreement Canada Signs Nickel, Cobalt Agreement PA2706215294 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1422 GMT 25 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PA2706215294 Havana PRENSA LATINA Spanish BFN [Text] Havana, 25 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuban and Canadian companies announced their decision to establish a joint enterprise to extract, refine, and market nickel and cobalt on an international scale. This major agreement was signed by the General Nickel Co., Inc., owner of the shares of the nickel and cobalt production plant in Moa Bay in eastern Cuba, and by Canada's Sherritt Inc. The basic agreement confirms the intention to establish a jointly-owned enterprise backed by the Cuban Government. This joint enterprise is considered one of the best operations worldwide for the production of nickel and cobalt, the two parties indicated in a joint news release issued today. Everyone knows that Cuba has one of the world's largest reserves of nickel and cobalt and that it conducts preliminary processing of these metals at an installation in Moa Bay. Sherritt Inc. is already getting a large part of the production of nickel and cobalt sulfides extracted from Moa Bay to use as raw materials at its refinery in Ft. Saskatchewan, Alberta. Under the agreement, the plant in Moa Bay, as well as the above-mentioned refinery, will be included as assets of the joint enterprise. The news release signed by the two companies adds that a corporation to market the products will be included in the assets. The Cuban state will grant mining concessions to the joint enterprise. These rights will include more than 60 million tons of nickel marsh ore -- with an 80 percent of the reserves classified as confirmed reserves -- and will guarantee the operation of the plant in Moa Bay for 25 years. The news release says there are concessions available for more than 15,000 hectares with additional reserves to maintain production in Moa Bay for 25 additional years. This major operation thereby links Cuban reserves with the plant in Moa Bay and the Canadian refinery, and it will enable the joint enterprise to begin a broad effort to expand the installations located in eastern Cuba. Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal stressed that his country holds in high esteem the relation established with Sherritt Inc. in the production of nickel and cobalt, as well as in oil and gas -- areas in which cooperation is under way. The Cuban Government believes that the expansion of our relations will result in a commercial activity that will strengthen Cuba's position within the international industrial community, Portal added. Ian W. Delaney, Sherritt's president and director, said his company is pleased with the new enterprise because Cuban and Canadian installations are compatible and because Cuban reserves of nickel and cobalt are abundant. Our previous relations with Cuba have been very successful, and we believe that our new association will lay the foundations for a new type of business in Cuba, he asserted. The conclusion of the new agreement, the news release stressed, will depend on a thorough examination and review of the plants, the signature of legal documents, and the necessary regulatory approvals.
