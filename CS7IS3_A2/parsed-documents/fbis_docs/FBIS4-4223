The spokesman revealed, for the first time, the details of the contacts between the Central Government and the Dalai Lama's personal representatives in order to pave the way for the talks between the two sides. The Chinese Government's willingness to hold talks with the Dalai Lama because it hopes that he and his followers will return to the motherland, terminate their lives of exile, and do something beneficial to the motherland's unification and the well-being of the Tibetan people. For the past more than 40 years, substantial progress has been made in the economic development of Tibet Autonomous Region, which has not be obstructed by the Dalai Lama's fleeing and the separatist activities he has plotted abroad. Tibet previously pursued the backward feudal serf-owning system but great social and economic changes have already occurred. The Tibetan population has increased from some 1 million in the 1950's to over 2 million today. The fine cultural tradition of the Tibetan Nationality has been maintained and developed. In the past, Beijing has not revealed anything about contacts with the Dalai Lama's personal representatives because there was a mutual promise to keep such things confidential and not publicize the contacts. However, the Dalai Lama's side has violated the promise many times, not only making public such contacts but also distorting the contents of the talks. Thus, Beijing could not but come out and make a clarification. According to the spokesman for the CPC Central United Front Work Department, since 1979, the departments concerned in the central government agreed to allow the Dalai Lama's personal representatives to return to China and have also received them many times, seriously listening to the Dalai Lama's opinions conveyed by his envoys. The central leaders also attended the meetings personally. Deng Xiaoping was present at one such meeting in 1979. The contacts were suspended for a certain period for reasons concerning the Dalai Lama's side. In 1992 and 1993, the central departments concerned again received the Dalai Lama's personal representatives on two occasions. Although contacts were made many times, they did not successfully lead to holding talks. The crux of the problem was obvious: The Dalai Lama refused to acknowledge that Tibet is an inalienable part of China. The central government insisted that the principle was the foundation for the talks and the guarantee for achieving results but the Dalai Lama denounced this as setting "a precondition and obstacle" to the talks. When receiving the Dalai Lama's personal envoy in 1979, Deng Xiaoping said: "The fundamental issue is that Tibet is part of China. The rights and wrongs should be judged according to this criterion." This is a major issue of principle. All Chinese people, no matter what political position they may hold and no matter whether they are Hans or Tibetans or other national minorities, they all share the same sacred responsibility to safeguard the country's unification and territorial integrity. The Dalai Lama must acknowledge that Tibet is an inalienable part of China. If he is willing to do this, the talks on anything else will be easy. If he refuses to acknowledge this, how can talks be possible? However, the Dalai Lama was only keen to advocate "Tibetan independence" and even described Tibet as an "occupied country." Even so, the central government is still waiting patiently for the Dalai Lama to come around. The international community generally acknowledges that Tibet is China's territory but some people in the West, such as some of the British mass media, are still unwilling to "lose" Tibet and continue to assert the "Chinese people's occupation of Tibet" in their news reports. Some other people in the West have tried to seek mental comfort, taking it as chic to discuss Tibet's Lama religion and to worship the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure. Over a long period of time, he has been a political exile engaged in the activities of splitting the motherland. Therefore, the Chinese Government and the Chinese people resolutely oppose audiences granted to the Dalai Lama by any officials of foreign governments.
