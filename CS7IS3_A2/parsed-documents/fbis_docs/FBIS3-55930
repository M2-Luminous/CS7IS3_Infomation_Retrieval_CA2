Whom Will the Premier Invite?"] [Text] Boris Yeltsin recently signed an edict on the structure of the organs of executive power. The document provides for the presence of four vice premiers in the Cabinet of Ministers, two of whom should be first vice premiers. Viktor Chernomyrdin must give their names within a week. Obviously the premier will choose the new vice premiers from the nine who are already working now. Here he will have to be guided not only by his personal sympathies and antipathies but also by the disposition of political forces and the results of the elections to the State Duma. Government analysts, who have already run through many options, believe that it is to Chernomyrdin's advantage to set out his game of cadres patience in such a way that he himself is in the center and can thus strengthen his own positions. Otherwise, if a homogenous government is formed the premier runs the risk of coming under fire from the criticism of the offended side. So that to all appearances no radical changes in the government are predicted. The main question is who will occupy the first four seats in the government, or rather the two first seats and the two second seats? Obviously Oleg Soskovets will not be competing. Today, too, he is the first among the first three vice premiers (Soskovets, Gaydar, and Shumeyko). Chernomyrdin left him "in charge" when he went on vacation. Oleg Nikolayevich's staying power is explained by the fact that it is he who in the government symbolizes the large army of industrialists and state officials. It will not be without interest also to recall the fact that Mr. Soskovets, who had been about to run as a deputy, withdrew his candidacy at the height of the election campaign. It is entirely possible that even then the premier had guaranteed him a leading place in the new government. By analogy with Soskovets, the premier will obviously leave Aleksandr Zaveryukha among the four vice premiers as well. Behind him there is a large and influential Duma faction of agricultural experts and the Cabinet of Ministers leader cannot disregard him. Through Zaveryukha the premier will be able to influence not only the agricultural experts but also some of the Communists close in spirit to the collective farms' champion. Actually, regarding this candidacy, Viktor Stepanovich will probably not have to go through any internal struggles: The premier's sympathies toward Mr. Zaveryukha can be felt quite clearly. You cannot confidently say the same about Chernomyrdin's attitude toward Gaydar. But the premier will hardly dare not to leave the young father of the Russian reforms and the leader of the largest duma factions among his vice premiers. Moreover Gaydar is a very convenient figure who can be blamed for all blunders in the work of the cabinet of ministers. You only have to use the standard and uncomplicated formula: "The reforms are proceeding somewhere in the wrong direction..." -- and everyone will immediately understand that Gaydar is to blame. And who will be the fourth? Probably not Shumeyko. It is even more likely that Shakhray will not be the fourth. The elections showed that there are not substantial enough forces behind the party that he conceived. Probably the fourth could in theory be Anatoliy Chubays, were it not for the powerful and vigorous figure of Boris Fedorov. Much now depends on Fedorov. No one can any longer hold the budget together -- even Chernomyrdin probably understands that now. Removing Fedorov would mean getting hyperinflation within three months. But there is a suggestion that even Fedorov could be bypassed. And by none other than the present vice premier Yuriy Yarov, a politician distinguished mostly for the fact that he is the only vice premier who has not managed to distinguish himself by any action or if worst comes to worst by any statement for the press. Having such a vice premier to hand would be far more peaceful for Chernomyrdin than having the irrepressible Fedorov. By an irony of fate Mr. Yarov entered the Duma on the "Russia's Choice" list so that party formalities will be observed if he should be appointed. Who will Chernomyrdin appoint as his second "first vice premier?" Most likely Gaydar -- the leader of the "Russia's Choice" movement. Actually, it is not out of the question that the matter may end most unexpectedly. It is no accident that one high-ranking government official who wishes to remain anonymous stated in a talk with your correspondent: "If a government that does not suit the reformers is proposed, we shall not stay here as whipping boys."
