FBIS4-21263 "jptdd018___94021" JPRS-TDD-94-018-L JPRS Narcotics 21 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA BRAZIL General Confirms 1982 Report on Drug-Numbers Game Link General Confirms 1982 Report on Drug-Numbers Game Link PY2204021694 Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television in Portuguese 2300 GMT 21 Apr 94 PY2204021694 Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television Portuguese BFN [Text] A secret military document could be the key to new disclosures for the prosecutors investigating the corruption scheme set up by the numbers game kingpins. The first probe into the numbers game-drug trafficking link was conducted in 1982 by the Military Police intelligence service itself. The Army and the now-defunct National Intelligence Service, SNI, received copies of the report. It was in a meeting held then that the numbers game leaders decided to invest in drug trafficking because they considered it a promising business. The numbers game kingpins then allied themselves with drug trafficker Antonio Jose Nicolao, aka Toninho Turco, who started to serve as a liaison between the numbers game and the drug trade. General Newton Cerqueira, who was commander of the Military Police [PM] at that time, confirmed the report's existence: [Begin recording] PM officers, who at that time helped us considerably in that specialized sector, drafted documents and I became firmly convinced that there was a close connection between the numbers game bankers and the drug trade. [end recording] The prosecutors want to compare the information contained in that report with both the documents seized from Toninho Turco's house during the Mosaic Operation and with the accounting books and diskettes seized recently from the numbers game operations center. They believe that by comparing all these documents, they will be able to prove for the first time the numbers game kingpins' involvement in the drug trade in Rio de Janeiro. The prosecutors do not know, however, that that report -- which they describe as being highly significant -- has disappeared from the PM intelligence service's files.
