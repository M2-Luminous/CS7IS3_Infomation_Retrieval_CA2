FBIS4-56371 "drlat085_m_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-085 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Brazil Secretary Flores: Executive Branch `Handcuffed' Secretary Flores: Executive Branch `Handcuffed' PY0205133694 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 29 Apr 94 p 8 PY0205133694 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO Portuguese BFN [Text] Irritated with the slowness of the constitutional revision, Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario Cesar Flores on 28 April predicted the risk of a rupture between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches during the next administration if the legal order does not change. For him, whoever wins the elections will "be suffocated by the legal order, opposed by the congressional majority." In a categorical speech he delivered at BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social Development] headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, the minister asserted that the executive branch is currently "handcuffed, limited in its actions by the legal intervention of the other government branches." "With the juridical order we have, this administration, the former one, the one before that, and the next one cannot govern. The federal government was depleted while the states and municipalities benefited. This will not change with the elections. I fear that the situation may become worse after the elections because whoever wins the elections will hardly hold a majority in Congress." Flores labeled the rural congressional bloc corporative, and, in protest against the maneuver that prevented the voting session on the provisional measure creating the URV [Real Value Unit], the admiral sent a message that seemed to include a threat during the "Governability and Political System" debate: "We have been living for the past 10 to 12 years under an agreeable armistice that is part of our political culture, but it is not an unconditional surrender. We need a longlasting armistice that will lead us to peace." The energetic speech by Flores, who also said the political parties have become "hostages of corporations within a suicidal congressional mechanism," surprised the rest of the speakers who, although admitting the governability crisis, wanted to avoid preaching chaos: "I feel horror over those catastrophic forecasts," said former Minister Joao Paulo dos Reis Velloso, superintendent of the National Higher Studies Institute, after the debate. Deputy Paulo Delgado (PT-MG) [Workers Party-Minas Gerais] thought Flores "exaggerated somewhat in his speech:" This demonstrates a difficult situation: the impasse in Congress as a result of the explosive combination of the stabilization plan, the constitutional revision, and the elections.
