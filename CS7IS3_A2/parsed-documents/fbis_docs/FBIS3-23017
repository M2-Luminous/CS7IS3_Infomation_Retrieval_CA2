At a clandestine press conference held at a remote spot in southern Corsica, an FLNC spokesman flanked by about 100 heavily-armed and hooded militants, announced the end of the truce declared on June 22 last year. Most of the FLNC leadership was present, seated at a table beneath a banner reading "FLNC: The people has risen up. It must go forward." The Corsican nationalist movement said its decision to resume its military activities "reflects our determination not to be fobbed off with dud promises or satisfied with a few concessions involving institutional gadgets or a heap of cash." The FLNC said a visit by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on February 1 had "dissipated any ambiguity" about government policy. It said government policy in Corsica was "stamped with the seal of colonialism." In view of the government's "intransigence" the FLNC said "we will resume our fight at all levels."
