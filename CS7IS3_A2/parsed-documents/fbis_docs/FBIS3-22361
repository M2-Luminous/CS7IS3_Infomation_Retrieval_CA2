There is "nothing to hide" in this matter, Toepfer said today in Bonn. The Hanover firm of Schmidt-Cretan has exported pesticides from the former GDR to Albania as "humanitarian aid" from 1991 to 1992. Greenpeace accused the Environment Ministry of "hindering the due process of law." An experts' report last year spoke of an "explosive risk situation" and recommended that the German Government see to the "immediate securing" of the toxic waste freight. Neither the German criminal investigation authorities nor the Albanian authorities were given access to the report. Toepfer said that the Lower Saxony criminal investigation office and the Federal Criminal Investigation Bureau has been informed about the report by phone. Experts from the German Technical Support Service established in situ in Albania that there is no immediate danger to the environment. Moreover, the export is legal. However, efforts are to be made to find a "national solution." Greenpeace expert Andreas Bernstorff said that the toxic substances are a danger to the population. If Toepfer wants a national solution, he will have to bring the toxic freight back to Germany as quickly as possible to dispose of it here. Greenpeace has itself secured the greater part of the toxic waste against the risk of explosion and leakage. Moreover, it organized the return transport of around 1,000 kg of the pesticides. The truck will arrive in Germany in the next few days. Further return transport is not planned, however, contrary to other statements made by Greenpeace staff.
