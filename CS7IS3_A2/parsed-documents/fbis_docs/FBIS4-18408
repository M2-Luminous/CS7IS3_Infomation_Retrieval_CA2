When the DVU did not manage to get into the local parliament at the elections in Hamburg, it renounced participation in the Landtag elections in Lower Saxony. Now the party is calling for an "agreement" with the Republikaner. Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber, however, rejects any cooperation.
