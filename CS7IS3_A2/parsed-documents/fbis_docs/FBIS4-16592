In this statement, the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry is accused of conducting a policy based on Moscow's directives, reads a statement by this ministry, disseminated by its information and press department. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not discuss the accusation, which is not based on any arguments, and stresses that such statements, which had more than once been publicly distributed abroad, harm the prestige of the Lithuanian state. Lithuania's stance on Russia's membership in the Council of Europe is based on the following principles: Russia must fulfill the conditions of the Council of Europe on the membership in that organization; Lithuania will support Russia's membership in the Council of Europe only after Russia fulfills international obligations on the withdrawal of troops from Latvia and Estonia, respects the sovereignty of the neighboring states, human rights, and those of national minorities; The support of the Council of Europe to Russia's democratic forces is a weighty contribution to the processes of democratization and the development of reforms in that country, says this statement in conclusion.
