This is something that we do not like, Mr. Stanislav Daskalov declared after his return from a meeting of foreign ministers from neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia. We are against the interference of any Balkan country whatsoever in the conflict because it might lead to an escalation of tension in the Balkans, he stated. The minister of foreign affairs returned visibly depressed from the Geneva meeting. No decisions whatsoever were adopted at the meeting; however, that was not the purpose. An official report on how the Yugoembargo is affecting the neighboring countries was released. The participating countries should provide their own remarks on the document. Stanislav Daskalov was not aware of President Zhelev's stand on being inclined to agree with air attacks over Bosnia. I cannot comment on something that I have not heard, the minister declared. Bulgaria has always declared to be in favor of a peaceful settlement of the conflict. If air raids should be applied as an extreme measure, then several conditions should be fulfilled in this connection. The first condition, in our view, is that there should be no victims among the civilian population and that the air strikes should not lead to an expansion of the conflict likely to affect neighboring countries. The question was discussed in Geneva, but none of the sides dared to commit itself with providing guarantees. In Suleyman Demirel's letter to President Zhelev, there was no mention of an air corridor through Bulgaria, Mr. Daskalov said in confirming the statement of the Turkish ambassador in Bulgaria. As far as the foreign minister remembers, the letter called for support in case of military intervention or in connection with lifting the arms embargo. Stanislav Daskalov reported that he had agreed with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Office on the participation of Bulgarian business companies in humanitarian deliveries for former Yugoslavia and the Caucasus.
