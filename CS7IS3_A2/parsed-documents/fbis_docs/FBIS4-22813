Thus the rate of zinc sulfide formation at constant magnetic field stress, was found to be significantly affected by the presence of iron impurities in the solution. Also, the strength of the magnetic field affects the structure of the water and the zinc salt complex becomes a factor. As the field strength increases, old structures break down and new ones are formed. Increasing the concentration of iron ions in the solution only increases the overall rate of the reaction. Particle size data on zinc sulfide powders shows that raising the pH from 11.40 to 11.44 results in a marked improvement in structure and mirror finish of the film.
