FR940524-1-00034 FR940524-1-00010 Section 84.4␣Respirators For Mine Rescue or Other Emergency Use In Mines This section would be new, and would maintain MSHA's role in the approval of respirators designed for mine rescue or other mine emergency use. Under the proposal MSHA and NIOSH would conduct joint review and certification of respirators used for mine emergencies and mine rescue. This provision recognizes MSHA's expertise in identifying the special needs and considerations for respirators used in the mining environment. This role would replace MSHA's existing role as a joint approver of all respirators. Paragraph (a) specifies that NIOSH and MSHA would jointly certify any respirator designed for mine emergencies, mine rescue or other emergency use in mines. This joint review and certification would include any associated service-life plans, user's manuals, and other supporting documentation. This paragraph further specifies that certifications for these respirators include any identified use limitations related to mine safety and health as a condition of certification. Paragraph (b) specifies NIOSH and MSHA would jointly address recall and retrofit matters arising from field complaints or identified deficiencies concerning any respirators used in the mining environment. The new Memorandum of Understanding would further delineate MSHA's role in such matters, including participation in any related field or manufacturing site audits. Subpart B_Application for Approval Section 84.10␣Application Procedures This section would be redesignated from existing §11.10 with only paragraph (e) modified. Paragraph (e) would retain the existing requirement for inspection, examination, and testing by MSHA of electrical and electronic components to be permissible in accordance with 30 CFR part 18 for respirators intended for use in mining environments and having permissible electrical or electronic components. MSHA would continue to conduct this testing and issue a separate MSHA approval number for those respirators found acceptable. The process for conducting the permissibility evaluation of these components and their identification would remain unchanged from the existing policies and practices. Subpart C_Fees Section 84.20␣Examination, Inspection, and Testing of Complete Respirator Assemblies; Fees This section would be redesignated from existing §11.20, and modified only to reflect the new particulate filter classification scheme. Subpart D_Approval and Disapproval Section 84.33␣Approval Labels and Markings; Approval of Contents; Use This section would be redesignated from existing §11.33. Paragraph (b) would specify the use of the NIOSH emblem on the approval label, replacing the MSHA emblem. Paragraph (e) of this section would be modified to identify the existing ``dust, fume, and mist'' class of respirator as a ``particulate'' respirator. The new designation is consistent with the proposed testing criteria under which these respirators are certified. The table in paragraph (e) identifying the approval label requirements would be modified by the removal of references specific to paint spray and pesticide respirators, also consistent with the changes associated with the instantaneous penetration tests. Subpart F_Classification of Approved Respirators; Scope of Approval; Atmospheric Hazards; Service Time Section 84.52␣Respiratory Hazards; Classification This section would be redesignated from existing §11.52. It would be modified only to delete paragraph (d). Reference to the pesticide ``classification'' would no longer be appropriate with the introduction of the ``particulates'' classification with the new instantaneous-penetration test. Subpart G_General Construction and Performance Requirements Section 84.61␣General Construction Requirements This section would be redesignated from existing §11.61. The provision for respirator components to meet the permissibility requirements of 30 CFR part 18 [paragraph (e)] would be deleted because MSHA's workplace regulations separately and independently establish this requirement for certain mining applications. This change would be consistent with existing practice, whereby, MSHA conducts the evaluation and testing of these components and issues a separate approval to cover this aspect of respirator design.
