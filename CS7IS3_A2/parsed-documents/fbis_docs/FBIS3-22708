The report said the figure indicates that the Health and Welfare Ministry's attempt to encourage a nationwide system of base hospitals as a key element of its anti-AIDS strategy is still incomplete. A ministry team studying the epidemiology of AIDS made the finding after compiling results from 688 responses received by mid-January to questionnaires sent out in November to the 848 centers. The ministry found that 688 centers or 81 percent of the total responded to the survey. Of the respondents, 675 or 98 percent offered an AIDS-related telephone inquiry service and 633, or 92 percent, offered AIDS-related interviews. But the ministry said only 555, or 81 percent, of the centers knew of hospitals to which they could refer AIDS patients or people who were infected with the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The ministry has requested each prefecture to stipulate at least two hospitals which can serve as centers for the treatment of AIDS but by late January only four prefectures had complied.
