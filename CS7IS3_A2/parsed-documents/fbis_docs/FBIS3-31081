Human Rights Commission Tadeusz Mazowiecki, in his latest report, that more than 3,000 Moslems had fled the Raska area, the southwestern part of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia. Addressing the participants in the 50th session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva from January 31 to March 11, the Yugoslav Government underscored that many Moslems in the Raska area had been fighting in the war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The most murderous Bosnian Moslem units are those in which the "Sandzak" Moslems i.e. Moslems from Raska (Sandzak being the Turkish name for this area) are fighting for the interests of Bosnian Moslem hardline leader Alija Izetbegovic, the Yugoslav Governement stressed. In Raska, an area consisting of eight communes -- two of them being in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia and six in the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro -- Moslems account for one half of the population and Serbs and Montenegrins for the other half. Moslems constitute the majority population only in three communes. Raska borders with the Bosnian Serb Republic (S.R.) against which Bosnian Moslems are undertaking offensive actions with a view to seizing the S.R., joining Sandzak and thus creating a large Islamic state in Europe. Last week a trial of a large separatist group who had made an attempt to detach Raska from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia commenced in Novi Pazar, the largest town in this area. The Yugoslav Federal Government pointed out that a large number of Moslems, as well as Serbs, had left Raska for economic reasons and gone to live abroad or in other, more developed parts of Yugoslavia. The government stated that "only a minority of population has left the Raska area because of the disturbed national relations", resulting from the "extremely aggressive Moslem fundamentalism," and the immediate vicinity of the brutal war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Yugoslav investigating officers have done their best to shed light on the kidnapping of the Moslems from Sjeverin and Strbac, places in Raska, but they have been unsuccessful so far since "a major part of investigation has to be carried out on the foreign territory, over which the investigating officers from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have no jurisdiction," the Yugoslav Government pointed out. Several Moslems from Sjeverin were kidnapped in a bus taking them to their work over the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and their compatriots from Strbac were kidnapped in a train passing also through part of the territory of this neighbouring republic, in February 1993.
