This is part of Japan's undisguised intention to produce nuclear weapons any time by securing large quantities of plutonium by itself, and thus become a nuclear power. The annual capacity of Japan's reprocessing factories is 800 tons, largest in the world. Japan has reportedly stockpiled 26 tons of plutonium and will secure 100 tons by 2010. This amount is enough to make far more than 10,000 nuclear bombs. Japan, which has already been possessed of electronic destructive device and other devices and technology of nuclear bombs, developed in February this year even long-range, large roket H-2 which can be used as inter-continental ballistic missile. The facts show that Japan's nuclear armament has reached a danger line. With the nuclear armament being accelerated in real earnest in Japan, a neighbour of the Korean peninsula, we cannot but cope with such a situation with vigilance. The accelerated nuclear armament of Japan throws a snag in the way of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The Japanese reactionaries must give up their criminal nuclear design, clearly mindful of the grave consequences to be entailed by their moves to turn Japan into a nuclear power.
