Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260&hyph;266, 268, 270, and 279. B. Nevada Nevada initially received final authorization for the base hazardous waste program on November 1, 1985. On June 29, 1992, Nevada received final authorization for revisions to its hazardous waste program, which included substantially all the Federal RCRA implementing regulations published in the Federal Register through July 1, 1991. On May 9, 1994, Nevada submitted an application for additional revision approvals. Today, Nevada is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). EPA has reviewed Nevada's application, and has made an immediate final decision that Nevada's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to approve final authorization for Nevada's hazardous waste program revisions. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until June 27, 1994. Copies of Nevada's applications for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses section of this notice. Approval of Nevada's program revisions is effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. Nevada is applying for authorization for changes and additions to the Federal RCRA implementing regulations that occurred between July 1, 1991 and July 1, 1993, including the following Federal hazardous waste regulations:
