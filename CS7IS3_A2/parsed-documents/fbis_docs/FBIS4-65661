A vanguard of 33 soldiers took off on Monday morning for Zagreb (Croatia), from where they will travel to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, a military spokesman informed the BELGA agency. On the return journey, the aircraft will be bringing back some 50 blue helmets who have completed a four months tour of duty in this former Yugoslav Republic. Three other flights are planned to relieve the other members of this engineering company, most of whom were drawn from the 11th Battalion from Burcht, near Antwerp. These will take place on 20, 24, and 27 May, the spokesman added, stating that on each occasion the relieved soldiers will be returning to Belgium on the same flights. The third "Bosnia Road" contingent since the start of the operation last September consists principally of soldiers from the third Engineering Battalion from Westhoven, near Cologne (Germany), and from the 15th Engineering Battalion. The "Bosnia Road" members are stationed in Kakanj, north of Sarajevo. In addition to these 170 engineers, two other Belgian units are also in Bosnia. A transport company (consisting of around 100 men and code-named "Moving Star") which is delivering humanitarian aid and an infantry company (also of around 100 men and known as "Belbos" by the Army) which is responsible for ensuring respect for the cease-fire concluded at the end of February between Croats and Muslims.
