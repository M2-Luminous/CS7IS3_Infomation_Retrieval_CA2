FR940127-1-00055 FR940127-1-00015 The Ohlone tiger beetle is not currently protected by any regulatory mechanism. The California Endangered Species Act does not apply to insects. The available information suggests that the species' restricted range and small population size increase the chance of extirpation resulting from stochastic (i.e., random) or localized events, such as rock slides, erosion, disease, or predation. The petition and supporting information have been reviewed by staff at the Ventura Field Office and the Portland Regional Office of the Service. The Service finds that the petition presents substantial information indicating that listing the Ohlone tiger beetle may be warranted. The Service requests any additional data, comments, and suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested parties concerning the status of the Ohlone tiger beetle. Of particular interest is information regarding: (1) The existence and status of additional populations; (2) Environmental factors determining distribution, including specific habitat needs; (3) Early life history; and (4) The response of populations to disturbances such as fire, clearing, or mowing. This decision is based on information contained in the petition and scientific and commercial information otherwise available to the Service at this time. References Cited Freitag, R., D.H.
