FR941220-2-00057 FR941220-2-00036 The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest by providing both a more appropriate expiration date for 3D options when the expiration date falls on a holiday. (b) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others No written comments were either solicited or received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act of the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). 3 The PHLX state that the Exchange created 3D options with a Monday expiration in order to attract investors seeking an option that captures weekend risk. Under current rules, however, if Monday is a holiday or designated bank holiday, the 3D options will expire on the preceding business day, which is usually the preceding Friday. By amending its rules to provide that 3D options will expire on the following business day when the regular expiration Monday is an Exchange holiday or designated bank holiday, the Commission believes that the proposal will accommodate the investment objectives of market participants and facilitate transactions in 3D options by providing investors with a means to capture weekend currency risk. 3 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(50 (1988). The Commission believes that 3D options, as amended, should provide investors with greater flexibility to tailor foreign currency options positions to satisfy their investment objectives. In this regard, the Commission notes that the PHLX has stated that foreign currency options provide a strategic investment tool for sophisticated retail options customers, multi-national corporations, and proprietary traders who manage and hedge foreign currency exposure, as well as banks, which trade short-term FCOs to hedge the risks of trading in the foreign currency forward and cash markets. 4 In addition, the Commission continues to believe that 3D options broaden the hedging opportunities of foreign currency market participants by providing them with an alternative to using futures contracts, forward contracts and/or off-exchange customized derivative instruments to satisfy their short-term currency investment needs. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33732 (March 8, 1994), 59 FR 12023 (March 15, 1994) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;93&hyph;10). The Commission believes that the proposal to revise the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' clarifies the definition in the context of 3D options by reflecting the fact that the OCC delivers the cash value, rather than the underlying currency, upon exercises of a 3D option. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register in order to allow the Exchange to implement the new holiday expiration procedure prior to the January 2, 1995, expiration, an Exchange holiday. The Commission believes that the proposal to amend the holiday expiration procedure for 3D options will allow investors to continue to use 3D options for the purpose of hedging weekend currency risk. In addition, the Commission notes that the PHLX has notified its members of the proposed change and that the Commission has received no comments on the proposal. The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to grant accelerated approval to the proposal to revise the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' because the proposal clarifies the Exchange's rule without making any substantive change. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. IV.
