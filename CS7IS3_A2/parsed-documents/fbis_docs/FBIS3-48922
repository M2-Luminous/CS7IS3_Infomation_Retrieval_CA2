The river station border crossing alone issued 70 entry visas and 8,640 transit visas for vessels sailing the Danube. Romanian nationals most frequently pass the border into Bulgaria (over 690,000). Macedonians and ethnic Albanians rank immediately after with 320,000, said the regional directorate of the interior chief Nikolay Dechev. The authorities of these border crossings barred 503 foreigners from entering Bulgaria. A total of 17,620 Deutsche Marks and $1,250 were collected from fines paid by 46 foreigners upon their exit from this country on account of expired visas. Forty trespassers were caught on Bulgaria's western border. Over 2-kilometer lines of vehicles are waiting on the Serb side to enter Bulgaria by way of the Bregovo and Vrushka Chuka border crossings. Over 7,000 Serb nationals pass daily via the border crossings in both directions. Most of them go to Kulata, Vidin and Bregovo, which are situated near the border, to do their shopping for the holidays. The information that Serb citizens will have to pay taxes -- 10 Deutsche Marks per person and 50 to 100 per vehicle -- upon exit from Serbia brought about a busier passenger traffic. The introduction of exit taxes for Serb citizens is unprecedented in the international practice, customs officers say. The number of people passing through the two Bulgarian border crossing doubled after the Serb authorities informed about the envisaged taxes, BTA learned from the customs officers on duty.
