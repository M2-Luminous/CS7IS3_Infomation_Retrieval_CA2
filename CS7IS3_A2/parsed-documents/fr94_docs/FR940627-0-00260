(i) Results shall be evaluated in terms of the extent of change in the amount of GFAP as a function of treatment and dose. GFAP assays (of any brain region) from a minimum of 6 samples typically will result in a standard error of the mean of +/^ 5 percent. In this case, a chemically-induced increase in GFAP of 115 percent of control is likely to be statistically significant. (ii) The results of this assay shall be compared to and evaluated with any relevant behavioral and histopathological data. (e) References.

The Salmonella typhimurium histidine (his) reversion system is a microbial assay which measures his ^ c his + reversion induced by chemicals which cause base changes or frameshift mutations in the genome of the microorganism Salmonella typhimurium. (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: Base pair mutagen means an agent which causes a base change in DNA. In a reversion assay, this change may occur at the site of the original mutation or at a second site in the chromosome. Frameshift mutagen is an agent which causes the addition or deletion of single or multiple base pairs in the DNA molecule. Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay detects mutation in a gene of a histidine-requiring strain to produce a histidine independent strain of this organism.
