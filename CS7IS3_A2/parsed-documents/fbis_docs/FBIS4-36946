'Allamah Fadallah, in his answer to questions during a lesson on the Koran, said: "This stage revolves round the Lebanese-Syrian- Israeli negotiations. The Syrian-Israeli negotiations revolve round two contrary demands because Israel wants to normalize relations first, then establish diplomatic relations and security, and then withdraw in stages over eight years. On the other hand, Syria wants withdrawal first, then the establishment of diplomatic relations. It wants normalization to be left up to circumstances. Fadlallah believes that the objective of Israeli attacks on Lebanon is to put pressure on the Syrian-Lebanese stand and the mujahidin, and to create new issues over which negotiations can take place to delay the basic negotiating issues. This is especially true since Israel is monitoring Palestinian autonomy and working on finalizing the autonomy negotiations over the West Bank. This prevents it from moving in two directions. Therefore, we believe that Israel wants to play upon the time factor--perhaps wait for some changes from one party, or some pressures from another party. It seems that the United States still falls in line with Israeli policy. We believe, therefore, that settlement will not take place very quickly. Answering a question, Fadlallah said: We do not trust the PLO and we have in our possession some documents on relations between the PLO and Israel since 1982. We know that the PLO used to make things easy for many European intelligence agencies and give them opportunities. They used to offer them a great deal of information about the Islamists in Lebanon and about many of those groups opposing Western policies in the region. Therefore, we fear the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in the region. We fear that the Palestinian officials will cooperate and coordinate with Israeli intelligence to strike the Islamic and liberation movements in the region. We also fear that the autonomy agreement will constitute a bridge for the Israelis to cross into Arab economy using the Palestinian element which could be a cover behind which the Israeli element hides. As regards Israeli threats, 'Allamah Fadlallah believes that "there are no Israeli, American, or Arab circumstances that provide Israel with the opportunity to do what it did last year or to occupy new Lebanese territory. The whole issue is that Israel is working on planning qualitative strikes, either security or military, every now and then because it fears the reaction of the Islamic Resistance."
