Financial and managing hardships hamper repairs in Latvia's sole nuclear waste depot in the Radons enterprise while its exisiting storing capacities are exhausted, Salmins said. To solve the problem, the ministry will consult the Finance Ministry's experts to calculate the sum needed to finish the reconstruction and find a building organization to complete the works. The approximate sum is 150,000 lats, but the state budget earmarked only 50,000 lats for the enterprise's reconstruction. In addition, the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Inspectorate has until Jan. 24 to draft a program for ecological research in Radons and its vicinity. The Riga Radioisotopic Research Institute also nears the brink of bankruptcy. This institute, like Radons, stores radioactive waste. The institutes' scientists are commissioned to forward proposals on the use and storage of radioactive substances. They should also determine which substances to keep and which to sell. The National Environmental and Social Health Center will compile a resolution on work with radioactive waste and prepare a program for monitoring the residents' health in Radons' vicinity.
