In this interview, UDF [French Democratic Union] President Valery Giscard d'Estaing explains why he believes the fight against unemployment cannot wait for the procedural reform required to consult the French on such a topic in a referendum. [Jarreau] What do you think of Philippe Seguin's proposal with respect to a referendum on employment? [Giscard d'Estaing] I am delighted to see that the debate on unemployment and employment has regained momentum. There is one point I regret, however, and that is the fact that no one has dared to utter the word "full employment," and that we are still only looking for means to curb the growth of unemployment. The referendum proposal has to do with form, not with content. One could envision extending the scope of Section 11 of the Constitution to include issues such as education or employment, but this would imply that the government needs to draft a bill of law to that effect before the French can be consulted. The experience of the five-year employment act passed earlier this year showed that this legislative approach is probably not the most efficient method. We need to go about it differently. Asking the public to voice its opinion on a controversial issue is not an intrinsically bad idea, but we need to know which concrete measure would be embedded in the bill subjected to a referendum. [Jarreau] Do you think that such a proposal for a referendum may take away a number of responsibilities from elected officials and members of Parliament? [Giscard d'Estaing] That is a real danger. Charles Millon [president of the UDF caucus in the National Assembly] was right to emphasize it. The best way to avert it would be to have Parliament discuss the bill first. A referendum held pursuant to Section 11 can only be decided during a parliamentary session or on a joint proposal from both houses. One can hardly imagine that the public would then be consulted on a bill against the will of the National Assembly. Concretely, such an approach would go like this: parliament would be given an opportunity to discuss the bill and to indicate that it does not oppose it, and then a referendum would be held. In my opinion, a debate in parliament is essential to improve the bill, to lessen the excessive influence of senior civil servants, and to help French people understand the bill. The extension of the scope of Section 11 on referenda is a reform that must be carried out thoughtfully and seriously. The urgency of the unemployment problem does not allow us to wait for such a reform to come to pass. [passage omitted]
