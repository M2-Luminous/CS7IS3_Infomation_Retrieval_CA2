A statement by Chechnya's State Security Department says that it is with this aim that Russia is redeploying its troops around the republic. According to Groznyy, an elite Russian air assault unit has taken up position at Mozdok (North Ossetia). Russian Interior Ministry special troops are reported to be moving toward the Chechen borders following Moscow's decision to extend the state of emergency to the zone of Ossetian-Ingush conflict.
