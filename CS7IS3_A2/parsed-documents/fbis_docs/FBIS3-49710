FBIS3-49710 "dreeu010__a94031" FBIS-EEU-94-010-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Ministry Protests `False' Hungarian Information AU1401083494 Prague CTK in English 2349 GMT 11 Jan 94 AU1401083494 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Jan 11 (CTK) -- Slovakia's Foreign Ministry said today it was concerned about the "unobjective information" on the meeting of Hungarian elected representatives in Komarno, south Slovakia, on January 8, spread by the Hungarian Government Office for Hungarian Ethnic Minorities Abroad. The ministry handed the protest to the charge d'affaires of the Hungarian Embassy in Slovakia, Ferenc Boros. The protest says that the information, destined for foreign diplomatic missions, is provided "out of context" and is "unobjective and misleading." Providing false information on developments in Slovakia by Hungarian authorities does not serve good neighborly relations, the protest says. It warns that misleading information on the ongoing process of the territorial administrative arrangement of Slovakia could assume the character of interference in Slovakia's internal affairs.
