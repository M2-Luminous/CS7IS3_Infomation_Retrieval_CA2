[Vranitzky] We believe the date will still be early March. Although this goal is considered to be optimistic, we believe it can be achieved. After the talks in Athens in particular, we have set out the prospects for concluding the accession negotiations within the timeframe scheduled originally. [Polikhroniadhou] Are you optimistic about the outcome of the referendum on accession that will be held in your country? [Vranitzky] Yes, I believe the outcome will be positive. But we must conclude the negotiations first. The next step is the referendum. Of course, some people in Austria say that perhaps the referendum should have been held first. But when someone wants to conquer a 2,000-meter mountain, he is first interested in conquering the first 400 meters and then the rest. [Polikhroniadhou] Do you believe that during the Greek presidency, our country can play a more substantive role for stability in the former Yugoslavia? [Vranitzky] I hope so, because Greece is the EU country with the best knowledge and experience of the Balkans, and if war spreads, it will be the one at the greatest risk of getting immediately involved. This is why we must seriously consider the Greek presidency's positions on resolving the crisis in the region. But no one can be so optimistic that they believe the problem could be solved during the short Greek presidency. What frequently happens when we discuss a Bosnian solution is that many sides suggest various solutions that cancel each other out. Relations [Polikhroniadhou] After meeting Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and based on your statement afterward, you have created the impression that you share the Greek concerns about the former Republic of Macedonia.... [Vranitzky] Papandreou presented the issue of the former Republic of Macedonia calmly and explained well enough the Greek position about the state being recognized under the current conditions. On this issue, the possible dangers may be weighed up. One reason for these dangers could be that the country's population consists of a variety of people (Serbs, Albanians, etc.), which means it would be easy to receive outside influence. We understand the Greek positions, which stem from your country's history and your geographical position. Austria decided to recognize this state within the UN framework but did not decide to establish bilateral diplomatic relations with it. But I am optimistic that with the expanding European Union and the finding of a mutually acceptable solution on accession within the European framework, this issue will be resolved soon. [Polikhroniadhou] Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras asked the government not to rule out the possibility of our country exercising its veto right on the expansion of the European Community if the Community appears to be indifferent to the Greek positions on Skopje. Did your Greek interlocutors mention this during your official meetings? [Vranitzky] This is the first time I have heard this view. Allow me not to comment, because neither the president nor the government has raised such an issue. They haven't even made the slightest comment during our talks. We are interested in what the official side says, and we are not concerned with views like those of Samaras.... Past Problem Discussing Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos' remarks and the atmosphere of Greek-German relations, German Deputy Foreign Minister Helmut Schaefer said: "Pangalos' remarks are history and couldn't affect Greek-German relations. I do not believe it is useful to reiterate rumors of problems because we are confirming them in some way. Following my visit and talks with my Greek counterpart Yeoryios Papandreou, I would describe the atmosphere as positive and the similarity of views on many issues as significant." Referring to Germany's Balkan policy, he said: "There is no German Balkan policy. The German side's interest is purely humanitarian. We want things to be stable and we need everyone to contribute to that. The wrong impression was once created -- and we believed it too -- that the Serbs were responsible for continuing the clashes and that if Serbia stopped fighting, the problem would be solved. "The problem is more complex. We must persuade all former Yugoslav parties involved that every side must take steps to resolve the crisis, because Europe will run out of patience at some point. A new initiative must be undertaken to end the prevailing situation. We are waiting for the U.S. secretary of state to move." Germany seems to be running out of patience on Skopje as well. This can be seen in a response to a question on the hasty opening of a German diplomatic delegation in Skopje. "No one can claim that we hurried to recognize the former Republic of Macedonia. We waited two years before establishing diplomatic relations. During these two years, the country became a UN member and was thus recognized by international law. "The Greek side must get rid of its sentimentality on this issue. It would be much worse for the Greek side if there was instability in the region. Papandreou agreed with that. So, Athens and Skopje must continue their dialogue and Germany is ready to help resume the talks." Referring to the Cyprus issue, Schaefer said: During their visit to Turkey, the German and British Foreign Ministers Claus Kinkel and Douglas Hurd discussed the Cyprus issue. We said both sides involved must show greater flexibility. Asked how he describes a common European policy for resolving the Bosnian crisis, the minister said: "In one sentence, it's common European desperation...."
