Let me introduce those who are on the balcony before we introduce the person we have come to see. We want to introduce the state president and deputy state president-elect, Mr. F.W. de Klerk -- give him a warm hand. [applause] Thank you. And then we want to introduce the deputy state president-elect, Thabo Mbeki [applause], and Mrs. Zanele Mbeki. [applause] I want to introduce to you the chief justice, Mr. Justice Corbett, and Mrs. Corbett. [applause] And then we want to introduce Her Worship, the Mayor of Cape town, Alderman (Patricia Cryner), and the Mayoress, Mrs. (Di Barrell). Friends, this is the day that the Lord has made, and we will rejoice and be glad in it. This is the day for which we have waited for over 300 years. This is the day of liberation for all of us, black and white together. This is the day of celebration. My fellow citizens -- hey, I can rightly call you fellow citizens, for on 27 and 28 April South Africa voted, and millions of us voted for the very first time, and a miracle happened. We discovered that we were South Africans, and we have discovered that we are proud of that fact. Yesterday at the FNB [First National Bank] Stadium I sang "Die Stem" ["The Voice"] for the very first time in my life, and I loved it. Who will ever forget the picture of Tokyo Sexwale taking the salute as the SAP [South African Police] and the SADF [South African Defense Force] filed past? A new South Africa has come to birth. We have said a resounding no to racism. What have we said to racism? What have we said to injustice? What have we said to oppression? What have we said to hatred? What have we said to violence? What have we said to alienation and division? And we have said a loud and reverberating yes to freedom. What have we said to freedom? What have we said to reconciliation? Yes. What have we said to forgiveness? What have we said to peace? What have we said to unity? We of many cultures, languages, and races are become one nation. We are the rainbow people of God, and one man embodies this new spirit of reconciliation and unity. One man inspires us all. One man inspires the whole world. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, fellow South Africans, I ask you, welcome our brand new state president -- out of the box -- Nelson Mandela.
