The threat was contained in U.S. Foreign Affairs Spokesman McCurry's statement according to which the United States "views all actions that might ease Serbia's isolation with deepest concern." Before saying this, McCurry listed "plans" to broaden communication between Budapest and Belgrade. Plans that are known to Washington and condemned by it. We know that it is not usually inconsequential when a very large country says to a very small country that it is "deeply concerned" about what the latter is doing or is preparing to do. The lightest of such consequences is a reprimand. Foreign Minister Jeszenszky (or the Hungarian Government) has received this. In nearly four years, it has not had such a conflict with any western power, so this in itself indicates the gravity of the event. However, after all this introduction, what I have to say is that the Government of the United States is acting unjustly when it calls the renewed Hungarian-Serbian dialogue a source of danger that might "undermine" the UN embargo policy afflicting Yugoslavia. Washington's strictness with us is nothing other than camouflage of its own (many times proved) lack of a concept, a kind of searching for responsibility elsewhere. So, who is actually "undermining" the embargo policy here? Hungary, which is heroically adhering to the embargo policy that is far too costly for it, was only an observer, rather than a participant, in the German-French efforts that actually held out the possibility of ending the sanctions, providing that the Serbs fulfill certain conditions. However, without expressing its opinion, the United States itself was also an observer. (At that time, Clinton was very much occupied with NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement], APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Community], and GATT....) Therefore, the end of the sanctions policy did not even originate in Hungary. This makes it even more interesting that, at the time, Washington did not reprimand Paris and Bonn, and why it did not later reprimand the Bosnian Muslims who swept the entire promising German-French plan (including the already implemented Serbian and Croatian allowances) off the table, and this is how the sanctions policy remained in force. Well, ever since, we have not seen any viable ideas from Clinton and his team as to what should really be done. (We now know what we should not do. As if the outcome of the south Slav crisis depended on Hungarian-Serbian customs and border cooperation....) What is even worse, America proved to be completely unable to form or coordinate the West's and NATO's Bosnia policy. This whole issue is a tale of the appearance and widening of gaps between the U.S., French, British, and German viewpoints. Seemingly, the Americans have always been more radical than the Europeans but, in reality, they would not for anything have moved away from the periphery of events. Whatever happens now, the American role would not become better in retrospect.
