These include a treaty on legal aid, accords on ecological problems and on the transit of special cargoes through Latvia, and a trade agreement for 1994. In addition, Vyacheslav Kebich and Valdis Birkavs signed a document on forming commissions designed to demarcate the border between the two countries and ease the rules for its crossing for those who live in the border areas. As Prime Minister Kebich said at the news conference given after the meeting, the document on the transit of special cargoes through Latvia "is very useful for Belarus," since it grants Minsk the opportunity to transport through Latvia its weapons exported to different countries. According to Kebich, the document also makes it easier to resolve problems connected with oil imports from the United Arab Emirates and other countries in the Middle East. "Belarus will buy the oil which is cheaper," the prime minister stressed. In his view, Belarus should not get tied to the Friendship oil pipeline. Prime Minister Birkavs told the news conference that ethnic Belarusians living in Latvia will be guaranteed all human rights, even though dual citizenship will not be introduced in his country.
