FR940524-1-00009 FR940524-1-00004 Utah proposes revisions to Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;232 and Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;235, which are its performance standards for roads and other transportation facilities and protection of the hydrologic balance for coal exploration operations. Specifically, Utah proposes several editorial revisions to make the language used in its coal exploration rules consistent by (1) referring to coal exploration where 250 tons or less of coal is to be removed as a ``notice of intention to conduct minor coal exploration,'' and (2) deleting those phrases distinguishing either ``within an approved permit area'' or ``outside an approved permit area'' that showed a relationship between the proposed exploration and the approved permit area. Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;232, which provides performance standards pertaining to roads and other transportation facilities used for coal exploration, by referencing Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;527.240 to require that a road damaged by a catastrophic event be repaired as soon as practicable after the damage has occurred. Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;235, which provides performance standards requiring that coal exploration be conducted to minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance, by referencing Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;532, 645&hyph;301&hyph;742.100 through 742.125, 645&hyph;301&hyph;744.100 and 744.200, 645&hyph;301&hyph;751, and 645&hyph;301&hyph;753 to address water quality and effluent limitations, sediment control measures, discharge structures, and impoundments. III. Public Comment Procedures OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Utah program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional revisions submitted. In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Utah program. Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issuers proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under DATES or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the administrative record. IV. Procedural Determinations 1. Executive Order 12866 This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). 2. Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. 3.
