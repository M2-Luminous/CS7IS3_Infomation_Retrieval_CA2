The horoscope refers to a widespread victory of the Right, or rather the three formations that form the Right only because they are set against the Left. In this case, the great defeated one is not Achille Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] but the center, which Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI] had hoped to turn into a force capable of influencing the other two by being essential to the formation of a majority. Instead the tri-part "front," as it seems, can make it alone. And perhaps this is better. Therefore, we will finally see what this facsimile of the Right is and what its men are worth. This will immediately give us an appraisal of them if, even without the absolute majority of the proportional representation votes but at least the majority of the seats, they can create a parliamentary majority finally capable of providing a stable government. Only on this premise can we speak of a Second Republic. If this premise is lacking, as [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi's broadsides against [National Alliance Secretary] Gianfranco Fini appear to foreshadow, this will mean that we are still in the First Republic: the republic of transformism and under-the-table maneuvers, and therefore the republic of frail majorities and paralytic governments that are based on the market of indulgence toward friends and the "exchanging of votes" with enemies. But let us not make any forecasts on the final results that could still hold some surprises. For the time being let us limit ourselves to making two simple observations: The first is the decrease in the percentage of voters despite the extension of the voting period. We think that this can be attributed to an election campaign that was based almost exclusively on reciprocal accusations and defamations; that instead of throwing light, threw dark upon the minds of the voters, and dissuaded many who were at a loss and did not know where to turn. The second is the increase in invalid voting slips. This is the unavoidable outcome of the confusion created by an electoral system that was prepared precisely with the intention of creating confusion. When we foresaw this, they contradicted us. But LA VOCE was right.
