FBIS4-5456 "dreas070_m_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Thailand Malaysian Police Join Hunt for Bombing Suspects Malaysian Police Join Hunt for Bombing Suspects BK1104031094 Bangkok THE NATION in English 11 Apr 94 p A1 BK1104031094 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [By Manit Siwayasirot] [Text] A fifty-man police task force is being joined by Malaysian special branch police in the border hunt for six men believed responsible for two recent bomb attacks in Songkhla, the southern provincial police chief said yesterday. Pol Maj Gen [Police Major General] Pricha Saengwan said the Malaysian police had pledged cooperation in the search for the suspects, who may have already sneaked into Kelantan state. "We have deployed about 50 officers for the operation," said Pricha. "They will coordinate with our own special branch police and Malaysia's special branch, which operates in Kelantan." The Songkhla governor had endorsed police warrants for the arrest of the six suspects, whom Pricha said have connections with southern Muslim separatist guerrillas. "They have links with Pulo (the Pattani United Liberation Organization). That's all I can say, otherwise the information may affect the police hunt for suspects," Pricha said. The suspects were believed to be responsible for a bomb explosion in Hat Yai's main shopping area early last month that injured three Thais and four foreign tourists, and a later blast that derailed a southern passenger train in Songkhla's Na Mom subdistrict. No serious injuries were reported in the derailment, but the sabotage triggered protests by railways workers and resulted in stepped-up security on the southern railroad. Police will begin regular helicopter patrols of southern rail routes in a few days, Pricha said. Pricha said it would take at least two more weeks before he will be able to report the progress of the joint Thai-Malaysian dragnet. Pol Lt Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Michai Nukunkit, assistant police director general responsible for the South, confirmed that Malaysia's special branch chief had promised to help hunting down the six suspects.
