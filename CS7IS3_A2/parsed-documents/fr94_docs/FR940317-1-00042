Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 58. As required by section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. No 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq . (1981)), the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the expected impact on small entities of the proposals suggested in this document. The IRFA is set forth below. Written public comments are requested on the IRFA. These comments must be filed in accordance with the same filing deadlines as comments on the rest of the Notice, but they must have a separate and distinct heading, designating them as responses to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Secretary shall send a copy of the Notice, including the IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Reason for Action This rulemaking proceeding is initiated to obtain comment regarding the Commission's proposed implementation of newly enacted Section 9 of the Communications Act in which Congress directed the Commission to establish rules for the collection of regulatory fees. Objectives The Commission seeks to implement the collection of regulatory fees, as contained in Schedule of Regulatory Fees, in the most efficient manner possible and without undue burden to the public. Legal Basis The proposed action is authorized under sections (4)(i) and (j), 8, 9, and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i) and (j), 158, 159, and 303(r). Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements The Commission is developing an FCC Remittance Advice form (FCC Form 159) for submission to the Commission with single regulatory fee payments and an FCC Supplemental Remittance Advice Form (FCC Form 159S) for submission with multiple regulatory fee payments. Federal Rules That Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With Proposed Rule None. Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved This proposed implementation of the collection of regulatory fees will affect permittees, licensees and other regulates in the cable, common carrier, mass media and private radio services. After evaluating the comments in this proceeding, the Commission will further examine the impact of any rule changes on small entities and set forth our findings in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent With the Stated Objectives The Notice solicits comments on a variety of alternatives. Authority 59.
