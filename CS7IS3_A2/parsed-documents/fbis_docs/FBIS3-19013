The pattern of electors that emerged from the survey by CNEL [National Council for Economy and Labor], Unioncamere, and the Tagliacarne Institute was likened to "a harlequin's suit" by CNEL's Chairman, Giuseppe De Rita, presenting the results yesterday. The survey looked at criteria such as age, employment levels, and the number of businesses in order to gain an overall impression of the economic and social make-up of each of the 707 constituencies. For the Lower House ballot, which will assign 475 of 630 seats, the survey found that 12 per cent of the population live in areas of "weak" economic power; 40 per cent live in areas of "semi-weak" economic power; 33 percent in "semi-strong" areas; 15 per cent in "strong" areas. Instead of reinforcing the traditional divide between North and South Italy, the results exposed numerous "marked differences found in the constituencies within each region." The first three positions of the strongest socio-economic category are occupied by constituencies in Lombardy, but eight other Lombard areas are to be found in the "semi-weak" category. Alongside Lombardy in the top five is Emilia-Romagna. Although the lower economic categories are still occupied almost totally by the Southern regions of Campania and Sicily, three constituencies in Campania have a "semi-strong" economic strength, the study showed. The poorest zone of all Italy is that north of Aversa, in Campania. De Rita, commenting on the findings, stressed that their importance must not be over-exaggerated. Despite declaring himself to be "an old proportionalist," he said that the first-past-the-post system, voted for by 85 percent of Italians in last April's referendum, "will enable a new political class at a general as well as at a local level" to come into being.
