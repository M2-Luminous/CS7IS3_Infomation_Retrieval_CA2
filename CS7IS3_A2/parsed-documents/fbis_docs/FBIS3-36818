There was a creative and active examination of those issues that could open up the way to implementation of everything agreed by the presidents of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the United States at their tripartite meeting in January this year." Yuriy Dubinin, the head of the Russian Federation state delegation to the talks with Ukraine, said this in an exclusive interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. "As a result of the talks a package of documents on this matter was agreed. The drafts of these documents are now being submitted to the presidents of Russia and Ukraine. We have an understanding with our Ukrainian colleagues that until the presidents consider and, we hope, endorse these documents, we will not reveal the details of these agreements." On the whole, however, Yuriy Dubinin stressed, "these agreements are highly positive and promising."
