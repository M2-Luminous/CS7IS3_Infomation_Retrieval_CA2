He said that the Government of Cambodia has expressed its wish for the essential goods from Indonesia to be dispatched directly to Phnom Penh instead of going through a third country. In the past, Indonesian goods exported to Cambodia were delivered through a third country. The leaders had also reached an agreement on the banking and trade procedures to be observed by the two countries. Murdiono said that Indonesia is still in great demand for the supply of soybeans to fulfill its domestic needs. For this, President Suharto suggested that if Cambodia could produce the commodity, bilateral trade between the two countries could be stepped up. Meanwhile, speaking at a news conference at Wisma Negara [State Guest House] today, Prince Norodom Ranariddh said that Cambodia will not seek military assistance from Indonesia but wants to learn more about Indonesian military's experience in handling the communist and separatist movements. According to Hun Sen, the only problem that Cambodia faces now is its internal politics, because the Khmer Rouge group still wants to remain isolated.
