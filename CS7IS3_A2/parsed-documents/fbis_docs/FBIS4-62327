FBIS4-62327 "drsov094_a_94019" FBIS-SOV-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Duma Deputies Comment Duma Deputies Comment LD1305171594 Moscow Radiostantsiya Ekho Moskvy in Russian 1500 GMT 13 May 94 LD1305171594 Moscow Radiostantsiya Ekho Moskvy Russian BFN [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Russia must unilaterally halt its participation in implementing the international sanctions imposed against the Republic of Yugoslavia. This is stated in a law that deputies passed in its first reading today. In the opinion of one of those who drew up the draft law, Deputy Vladimir Isakov, this document is important from the internal political viewpoint, as well as from the international viewpoint. [Begin Isakov recording] This is the first time that we have moved into the sphere of foreign policy, although, according to the Constitution, we do have this right, precisely in the form of adopting a law. This was a very difficult step for the Duma, too. It is possible that there will be reaction not only to the content of the law, but also to the Duma's display of independence on this question. You know that the president reacts very painfully to any display of independence by other state bodies. [end recording] [Announcer] It must be said that the law has yet to undergo its second reading and also to receive approval from the Federation Council and the president. If this approval is not received, the State Duma can adopt the law by a constitutional majority, that is by two-thirds of the votes. Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the International Affairs Committee, told our radio station about the possible consequences if this law is approved. [Begin Lukin recording] It is an extremely incompetent, declarative, and demagogic law. Moreover, it is also anti-Serbian. If this law is adopted it will mean the unilateral lifting of sanctions on our part. Naturally, no one will join in with us. On the other hand, it will also mean the automatic lifting of the embargo on the delivery of weapons to Bosnia. This will, naturally, mean massive economic, military, and all sorts of other aid--a sharp increase by the Western side. Well, if you compare our economic potential with the West's economic potential, then you will understand whom this law will benefit. [end recording]
