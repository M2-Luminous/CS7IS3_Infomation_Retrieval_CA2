FBIS4-7093 "dreas082__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-082-A Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan `High Hopes' Placed on Hata's Leadership `High Hopes' Placed on Hata's Leadership OW2704045894 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 23 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 7--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2704045894 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The new Hata administration will take off early next week. The business sector and major government ministries and agencies have high hopes in the new prime minister's strong leadership--since he has rich experience as a cabinet minister--and expect him to pass the draft 1994 budget as soon as possible. Deliberations on the budget have been delayed considerably. However, during the coalition's recent consultations on the key policy of tax reform, the allergy of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to the consumption tax surfaced once again, thus revealing the coalition government's weak point. Furthermore, there are a multitude of other issues which may shake the very foundation of the government, such as the amendment of the Food Control Law in line with the liberalization of the rice market. Tax Reform, Budget The Ministry of Finance [MOF] believes that as far as tax reform is concerned, "while the coalition's policy accord represents major progress, the SDPJ still holds the key to tax reform" (according to the Tax Bureau). During the recent consultations, the SDPJ again showed an allergy to a consumption tax increase. The new administration will have to make a final decision on the extent of the tax hike along with considering the issue of amending or abolishing the consumption tax. It is said that even if the tax hike is limited to a small margin or the old tax rate for foodstuffs is retained for the SDPJ's sake, "a rekindling of discord in the SDPJ is inevitable; even if a bill is submitted, the SDPJ might rebel at the last minute" (according to the Tax Bureau). The new administration will probably face a major challenge in June. On the other hand, deliberations on the budget for the new fiscal year, which has remained untouched for 50 days since its submission on 4 March, will probably begin after the Golden Week holidays [29 April-5 May]. The prevailing view is that, "at worst," enactment of the budget by the new administration will come "in late July." The passage of the budget is also deemed hopeless before the provisional budget expires on 20 May. The MOF intends to start compiling another provisional budget while taking into consideration the outcome of consultations between the ruling and opposition parties on the deliberation schedule for the budget. Deregulation: Concern About Resistance From Bureaucrats and the Business Sector With regard to deregulation, a major component of the Hosokawa administration's economic reform program and also a key to a breakthrough in Japan-U.S. relations, Hata says "this should be implemented steadily." He shows enthusiasm to promote deregulation as one of his major policies. However, the relaxation of regulations "is a difficult problem bearing on the issue of employment" (according to a senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] official). There are concerns about how far Hata, who is criticized for "listening too much to the bureaucrats," can put down the resistance of the bureaucracy and the involved business sectors. Economic Management: Economic Planning Agency Sees No Need for Further Pump-Priming Since the economy is in a very delicate condition, all eyes are on what economic policies the Hata administration will come up with. The Economic Planning Agency [EPA] says, "At this point, we are not in a position to formulate new stimulation measures, and there is no need for that" (according to Makoto Kobayashi, director general of the Coordination Bureau). This is because the impact of the third fiscal 1993 supplementary budget compiled to implement the 15.25 trillion yen economic package announced in February will be felt soon. The EPA stresses that it would be more important to pass the draft 1994 budget--which has been submitted to the Diet, but deliberation on which has been long delayed--rather than formulate new economic measures. Agricultural Policy: Concern Already Voiced on Possible Obstruction by the LDP and SDPJ Ratification of the Uruguay Round accord will be the focal issue at the extraordinary Diet session this fall. Amendments to the Food Control Law and measures to assist domestic farmers as a result of the partial liberalization of the rice market are likely to be the major issues. Since there is serious concern about the effect of rice imports on domestic farmers, senior Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries officials are wary that "the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ, which are opposed to ratification, may come up with arbitrary demands on measures to assist farmers in return for ratifying the Uruguay Round accord." There is also growing demand among consumers for a drastic revamping of agricultural administration. The key issues will be how to formulate policies on food reserve and rice acreage reduction to satisfy both producers and consumers, and how to go about revising the Food Control Law. Japan-U.S. Frictions The Foreign Ministry has high hopes on Foreign Minister Hata's premiership. It says, "The continuity of foreign policy can be maintained. He will be able to exercise leadership in mending Japan-U.S. economic relations" (according to a senior official). At Hata's meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Morocco, the United States demanded implementation of further measures to expand domestic demand, such as continued income tax reduction, and concessions with regard to objective criteria as conditions for resuming the economic framework talks. While the government intends to come up with a second economic package to expand domestic demand and open the market in June, the SDPJ has persistently shown an allergy to the issue of a consumption tax hike, which is expected to be the main revenue source to finance extended income tax cuts and additional public investment. Whether Japan is able to come up with substantial results at the ruling coalition parties' consultations on tax reform, and thus conclude the economic framework talks before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting scheduled for July will be the critical issue in bringing about a breakthrough in bilateral economic frictions. Vice-Ministerial Level Official May Be Sent to the United States To Work for Resuming the Framework Talks A top MITI official disclosed on 22 April that a vice-miniterial level official may be sent to the United States as early as immediately after the Golden Week holidays to start unofficial negotiations to reopen the framework talks. According to this official, at the Hata-Kantor meeting in Marrakech, the United States presented three conditions for resuming the talks. Japan intends to consider its response after the inauguration of the new administration in the hope of using this as a step to reopening the talks.
