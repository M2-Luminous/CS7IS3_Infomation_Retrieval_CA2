Gustavo Franco, director of the Central Bank Foreign Department, said on 28 February that the URV will be the Central Bank's dollar sale indicator. "If the dollar reaches a specific value, which will be the URV, the Central Bank will begin selling dollars," he explained. That will be the basis of the exchange policy, which will keep the dollar and the URV at the same value, preventing shifts between both currencies. Economic team members believe the level of Brazilian cash reserves (immediately available) -- of $33 billion -- permits implementation of the exchange policy. Economic Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch said on 28 February that "with such a reserve level, I do not think anyone should challenge the Central Bank." In practice, the exchange level will be coupled with the URV. "The exchange rate will follow the URV," Finance Ministry Executive Secretary Clovis Carvalho has said. Central Bank President Pedro Malan denied that the dollar has been adjusted below inflation for the last five months. "This has not happened with the IPC [consumer price index], the IGPM [average general price index], and the IPCA [expanded consumer price index], which are used for calculation of the URV," he said. Malan blamed such reports on exporters.
