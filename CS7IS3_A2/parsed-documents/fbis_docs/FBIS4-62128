According to him, one of the reasons behind the recession is the mass reciprocal nonpayments that have led to stoppages in production. The debts of Belarusian enterprises to the republics of the former USSR already exceed 1.3 trillion rubles and they themselves are owed 890 billion rubles. The total amount of the deficit is not in the Republic's favor. Sergey Ling underlined that "at present, there is no economic mechanism that could smoothly, without ruining production, regulate the problem of nonpayments, nor do measures exist to ensure that payments are made. What is happening is that a process is taking place when old debts are being gradually pushed to the back into the background. At the same, new debts are being incurred." The Republic's economist also noted that Russia' is responsible for the lion's share of mutual nonpayments. It constitutes half of the total debt. That is why one can reckon that the treaty on the merging of the monetary systems will make it possible in general to take this problem off the agenda. At the same time, "the National Bank should react more actively to the situation. At present, it is spending too much time on criticizing others, and is adopting a duplicitous position regarding the unification of the monetary systems. What is needed here, first and foremost, is a constructive committed work that will make it possible to extricate the economy from its present situation," Sergey Ling underlined.
