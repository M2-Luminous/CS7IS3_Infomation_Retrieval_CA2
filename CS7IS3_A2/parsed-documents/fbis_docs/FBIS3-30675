During his meeting with his American counterpart Mike Espy they had agreed that it was impossible for these steps to be unilateral, but had to have some response from the European Union. On developments in agriculture after 1990 Lux said that there was a rather naive opening up to the world, followed by the realization that the world had not opened up to us so much. We must attempt to reduce protectionist policies, but it has to be in the context of European Union policy, he said. Given the size of land areas and the concentration of production, and assuming that the redressal [as received] of property relations would be an important motivating factor, Czech Agriculture could be competitive in two or three years' time, Lux said. Espy and he had talked about their common view of negotiations with the EC, and about how they had a common interest -- to aim at reducing the high level of protectionism in the EC, Lux said. He told Espy he welcomed the support of American exports to the Czech Republic, and asked that they be aimed at those commodities of which the Czech Republic had insufficient supplies. Lux also told World Bank representatives about the state of Czech agriculture. As the World Bank lacked information about the state of Czech agricultural transformation, it was agreed that an information system would be quickly established so enough information could be provided. He said he had met with Californian entrepreneurs, who expressed concrete interest in "agrobusiness" contacts. "I realized there that our export policy has to be strengthened by the physical presence of our people in particular places, such as the United States. One and a half business attaches working in the United States is not really enough," he said.
