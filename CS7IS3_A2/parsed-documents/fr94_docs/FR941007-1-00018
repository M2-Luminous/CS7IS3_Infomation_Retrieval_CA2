FR941007-1-00018 FR941007-1-00001 (4) Terms of trade effect: Decreased oil imports would improve the balance of trade and strengthen the U.S. dollar. This would leave U.S. consumers unambiguously better off. This balance-of-trade effect is not considered in private decision-making. However, like the monopsony effect, counting this as an externality raises broader issues regarding free trade. DOE intends to consider whether there is anything special about oil that justifies an externality value for it, while excluding one for other products. (5) Financing of government strategic stockpiles and military operations associated with oil: Some analysts have suggested that the costs of stocking the strategic petroleum reserve and, more importantly, maintaining the military power needed to minimize oil supply disruptions are an additional source of externalities. DOE intends to study this source of externality in more detail, with particular emphasis on whether the size of the change in import dependence that might be attributed to alternative appliance efficiency standards would have any effect on government expenses. In addition to these quantifiable aspects of energy security externalities, some analysts contend that reduced oil consumption will increase U.S. flexibility in conducting foreign policy. DOE intends to consider this issue, recognizing that any benefit here would again relate to the size of the impact of the efficiency standards. Issue 19: The impact of incremental appliance efficiency standards on oil consumption. A central issue in trying to estimate the energy security value to reduced oil imports is the quantitative effect of incremental efficiency standards on domestic oil consumption. The appliances being considered in this rule affect oil consumption either directly, as is the case with oil-fired furnaces, or indirectly by reducing the use of oil to generate electricity. In 1990, according to the Annual Energy Outlook for 1993 (AEO93), about 2 percent of total U.S. oil consumption was used for residential space heating. By 2010, the same source projects that oil used for residential space heating will decrease significantly, and account for only about 1 percent of a higher total oil consumption. The current efficiency standard for residential oil-fired furnaces is 78 percent. Moving from the current standard to 95 percent, for example would after complete stock replacement, reduce oil consumption in this category by less than 20 percent, and by less if there is a ``rebound'' effect. Marginal changes in this standard could have only an extremely small effect on total oil consumption. In the case of appliance standards that affect electricity consumption, the amount by which oil consumption is reduced depends upon the fuels used to generate electricity. According to the AEO93, about 4 percent of the primary energy consumption used for electricity generation in 1990 was oil-based. That percentage is projected to remain approximately constant through 2010. Because oil's share of electricity generation is so small, changes in appliance efficiency standards for electric appliances will not significantly alter total oil consumption in the nation. Based on the national fuel mix used in 1990, each kilowatt hour of electricity saved will reduce oil consumption by 0.000072 barrels. Given this ratio, each dollar of externality value attached to a barrel of oil translates into only 0.007 cents per kilowatt hour on a national average basis. Oil-based electricity might be significant in some regions of the country. Additionally, oil tends to be used for peaking power. DOE intends to study whether regional and peak-load considerations might cause significant divergences from the national ratio of barrels of oil per kilowatt hour. However, because the national ratio is so low, it seems unlikely that even taking into account regional and peak-load considerations could result in large energy security externality values for electric appliances even if a high per-barrel externality value were deemed appropriate.
