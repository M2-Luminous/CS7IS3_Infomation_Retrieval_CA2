Commenting on the inclusion of three priority sectors discussed at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks in the annual report, he stated, "If the Super 301 provision is applied to the three sectors, the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks would collapse. Both Japan and the United States need to work to avert such a situation. They should resume the framework talks to discuss bilateral economic issues in a calm atmosphere and work for a conclusion of the framework talks. This is the way to expand and balance Japan-U.S. trade." In this way, Mr. Kumagai urged the United States not to abuse the annual report and stressed the need for resuming the framework talks.
