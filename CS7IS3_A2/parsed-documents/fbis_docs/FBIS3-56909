This has been reported by the commission chairman, people's deputy Volodymyr Pylypchuk. According to him, the budget document, although submitted as a balanced one, is unrealistic both in practical and theoretical terms because it envisions that 73 percent of the gross product or 91 percent of the national income should be distributed through the budget. Besides, the draft budget envisions such a tax pressure which will reduce the index of the producers' business activity, believes Volodymyr Pylypchuk.
