That is how Ruslan Khasbulatov's close relative, who wishes to remain anonymous, commented on a rumor in the press alleging that the former chairman of the Russian parliament has virtually headed the opposition in Chechnya. In a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, he admitted that Ruslan Khasbulatov has frequent meetings with his compatriots, but "these meetings are always held at the request of the residents themselves and they practically do not touch on Chechnya's domestic political problems." An ITAR-TASS correspondent did not succeed in meeting Ruslan Khasbulatov himself. The former chairman avoids journalists or answers with one and the same phrase: "I have come to Groznyy to meet relatives and have a rest." According to information from Ruslan Khasbulatov's immediate entourage, he is preparing to resume not his political but his scientific activities.
