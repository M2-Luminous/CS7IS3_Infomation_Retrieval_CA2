"The bill wanted to base the place names in the ethnically mixed Slovak territory on the old Hungarian and Horthyite-Hungarian names. In doing so, it would provide a basis for the official and territorial autonomy and further directive Magyarisation of the Slovak south, regardless of the views of the local people, including more than one million of Slovaks," Stanislav Bajanik, a Matica secretary, told radio today. South Slovakia was annexed by Hungary between 1938 and 1945 when Admiral Miklos Horthy ruled in Hungary. Bajanik said it was a satisfaction to Matica's activities that the law had not been passed. He praised the deputies "who understood the causes and consequences of the Magyarisation-aimed steps." According to Bajanik, Matica is ready to help settle the language order in Slovakia as it has prepared a draft law on protecting the state language which would resolve the rights and duties of the Slovak and minority languages.
