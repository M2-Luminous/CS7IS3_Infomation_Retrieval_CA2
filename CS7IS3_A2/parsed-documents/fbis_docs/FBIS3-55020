The continuing story of Lithuanian oil terminal construction proves that Lithuania's energy system is still dependent on other countries, he said. Landsbergis said energy prices in Estonia are going down because it imports fuel from the West, while Lithuania makes up the "Lucoil myth" to justify the absence of alternative fuel sources.
