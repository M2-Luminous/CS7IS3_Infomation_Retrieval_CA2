They realized that if we do not discuss and control costs, if an economic analysis on the basis of costs is not conducted, the goal of increasing profitability and reducing losses and state subsidies to enterprises is not feasible. What has to be done first is to identify and measure our expenses. These expenses, material and labor, are reflected in the cost. This concern you said the workers have, which is true, is being expressed even as a mandate. Nowadays, there is a trend which I believe is very healthy: The workers are demanding of the management that a cost system, even a minimal one, be established and made known, especially where the expenses are incurred -- the workshop, department, shift, and the smallest unit. This is based on the concept that those who can do the most to reduce costs are those who incur the expense. I believe that it is very important to analyze a phenomenon typical of our economy in the last few decades. I dare to advance the following opinion: In general, we in Cuba have underestimated the importance of the financial elements of the economy. By this I mean the following: We have worked above all on the basis of material balance. We have balanced consumption values and material values in terms of their productive function. However, we have frequently dismissed the importance of financial factors and, above all, the problem of determining, controlling, and reducing costs. [Santana] Yes, there have been other priorities. As you said, material production has been a priority. However, material production per se has not had a quality, a use value. Despite these concerns, it has not always had an appropriate use value. [Recio] There are things we cannot separate at this time. I have used this chemical image: If you separate hydrogen from oxygen, you no longer have water. Likewise, if you separate the material value of things, in terms of their utilitarian and social value, and take away the financial element reflected by that value, then you are simply canceling the entire quality of the economy. [Santana] Of course. You were referring to cost as a financial factor. I think we need to speak next of the elements comprising cost because I think that is very interesting. It is something not frequently discussed. Many people are surprised to find that there is not a single cost, but many. The issue of cost has been discussed by the workers on the recently concluded process of Parliaments in the Workplaces. [Recio] First of all, I do not believe this process has concluded. I insist on the idea I have stressed before: This is only the beginning of the process. We have to maintain everywhere that style of frank language, open discussion, and realistic analysis of the economic problems at each workplace. I believe the union movement is committed to maintain that work style and method. Therefore, I do not speak of its conclusion. I said that it is only beginning. [Santana] Therefore, it is a process that has completed its first round, its first phase. You were saying that there are many ways of expressing cost and that there are several components to cost. [Recio] I prefer to mention the two main elements: salary costs and material costs. Those resulting from the work force expenses and those from the consumption of raw material, energy, etc. Most workers are aware that this is expressed in the phrase: Cost per peso of consumer goods production. What is happening today in Cuba -- highly affected by economic decline -- is that the cost per peso of consumer goods production exceeds the peso. This is no good. In order to produce a peso you have to spend more than a peso in resources. [Santana] There is the fact that 69 percent of Cuba's enterprises are unprofitable. [Recio] That means that in those enterprises it costs over a peso to produce a peso's worth of goods. Expressed in this manner, one can see that if this situation were to be sustained for long, life would become almost unaffordable because you are consuming more in production than you are producing. This is in financial terms. It is good to explain this here. It can be expressed in financial terms. However, the list of material expenses is unending. Thus, no one can express it in terms that consuming such and such things produces such and such a thing. Therefore, the financial, monetary, cost expression is the shorter and more objective way to determine whether one is expending more or less in production than the value of the goods produced. I believe that should be constantly the focus of the Cuban workers, as owners of the means of production. [Santana] You also mentioned the cost of salaries. You spoke of material expenses. Undoubtedly, the large personnel roster in almost every workplace in Cuba cannot continue to exist if we want 69 percent of the enterprises to become profitable. It is clear that excessive salary cost is an unjustified expense of production. I believe this is under discussion today. Many think they can solve their problems by reducing the number of workers. I believe that is part of the problem. You said this was one of the elements of cost but not all of it. There are other elements, such as material costs, and many others such as efficient production, maximum use of the machinery, compliance with all the technological requirements, etc. I believe this is an element that has to be stressed. [Recio] All this, obviously, promotes cost reduction or, if improperly done, increased costs. I want to warn about something which is my opinion. We should not exaggerate the importance of the salary factor in our highly elevated costs. I believe that inflated rosters at the workplaces have very negative consequences for productivity and work organization. However, not always, everywhere, does the main factor determining elevated costs lie in salaries. I believe this always requires a casuistic analysis, an analysis place by place in order to reflect in situ what portion of the costs is determined by personnel salaries and what portion results from poor use of material resources. I believe we have to insist on this idea in order to avoid confusion. We also make extremely poor use of the material elements consumed in the productive process. We do not have to go far. We are once again linking finances and production: The problem discussed recently -- the lack of payment among enterprises -- also contributes to the pilfering of resources, which results in cost increases as a result of unfulfilled material consumption. I believe this also deserves analysis. [Santana] You were speaking of something very important: payment among enterprises. [Recio] I believe that in the previous National Assembly session this issue was highlighted. This is very interesting because it is unthinkable that there are enterprises subsidized by the state whose failure to charge other enterprises for production is also being subsidized. There are also enterprises that refuse to pay. I have spoken with many managers who tell me, yes, they try to collect but their counterparts do not want to pay. Within this there is a whole bureaucratic apparatus, the bank, etc., which complicates payment. I believe this issue is very interesting. In no other system is it acceptable that you deliver a product and are not paid for it by the receiving enterprise. As you said, this is the main tool of those who steal and pilfer, since there are no controls. [Santana] Also a tool of those who are inefficient and negligent. [Recio] All I have to add is that this absurd, truly absurd situation of those selling goods not getting paid, and those purchasing not paying, takes place only because of the break we had -- which was intensified at the beginning of the special period -- between the financial and production factors of production. Fortunately, we are undergoing the process of a new mentality, of rethinking economic logic and rationale. The struggle for efficiency has become an essential element to save the fatherland, nation, socialism, and its accomplishments. I believe that all -- workers, administration workers, managers, political organizations, and people in general -- have to get involved with the issue of cost. [Santana] Yes, I believe it is very important that all workers get involved in this problem. I believe it is essential to the Cuban people, not only in production but also in terms of state finances where we should try to make costs a constant concern. [Recio] That sector speaks primarily of expenses because they have no production. They do get a profit, in general, for production. However, in health as well as in education and culture, we have seen a willingness to reduce costs, to measure how much is expended on primary level education and how much on each disease treated at hospitals. I believe that all these concerns and interests may result in an improvement in the Cuban economy.
