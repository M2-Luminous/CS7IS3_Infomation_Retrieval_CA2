[UNIAN] With your support, the approved 1994 budget does not contain a deficit. The National Bank of Ukraine estimates that the deficit in the first quarter of this year came to over eight trillion [karbovantsi] against the background of the whole of last year's deficit of 9.5 trillion. Are you still in favor of the idea of a budget without a deficit? If not, how soon can we expect emission [emisiya] as a source of deficit elimination and of what size? [Zvyahilskyy] To have a budget without a deficit is an aspiration of every state. I backed the no-deficit budget in the first quarter in order to see whether it would be possible to lose money gradually. Given the complex economic situation, a way out is strict control over the budget's revenue and expenditure. The policy of a no-deficit budget, in my view, is justifiable. However, we noted in the Law on the Budget that we would make corrections as the result of each quarter. This is what we are doing. I think that an analysis of the first quarter's results will be ready by 20 May and will be submitted for consideration by the Supreme Council on 20-25 May. I am convinced there will be no emission in the near future. [UNIAN] Subduing hyperinflation is considered to be your greatest achievement. Is not a 38 percent slump in production in the first quarter too high a price to pay for this? [Zvyahilskyy] That depends on how you look at the production slump. From the standpoint of the generation of electricity on Ukraine, for instance, the slump in that sphere's production is 18 percent. I cannot trust statistics. There is an instruction and we are in the process of making an in-depth analysis. Considering the list of other items, there is a 1- to 3-percent increase in certain articles. It can also be said today that our steel workers are gradually raising the volume of production too, which could be accounted for by the fact that many enterprises have been demanding larger quotas and licences on top of the state contract or state order, to reequip themselves technologically, using proceeds from the goods sold. Analyzing the data on the rate of production growth in metallurgy in March compared with February 1994, the figures are follows: The extraction of iron ore rose by 3.8 percent, the production of cast iron by half a percent, steel by six percent and steel pipe by 2.3 percent. True, though: Ready rolled metal was down 2.8 percent. You are right in saying that there is a production decline in machine building, etc. However, the production of foodstuffs was also up. [UNIAN correspondent] Ukraine's legislation guarantees the repatriation of profit for foreign investors. In practice, however, where can investors who have set up production in Ukraine and are earning karbovantsi, repatriate their income? When will the work of the currency exchange resume? [Zvyahilskyy] I have instructed our professionals to work out that issue and find ways of settling it. There are many options, but what is most important now is to find one acceptable and beneficial both for Ukraine and the investors themselves. We are working on this problem and I think it will be resolved in the very near future. I would like to emphasize that the work of the Ukrainian Interbank Currency Exchange [UICE] was only halted rather than having been closed down. But should there be an attempt to resume the activity of the UICE forcibly, I shall resign. I believe that the work of the currency exchange at the transitional period of crisis is only good for a small number of individuals, but detrimental to millions of ordinary people. [UNIAN] Of what will financial and credit support for enterprises, to be provided according to the resolution "On Urgent Measures To Overcome the Payments Crisis and Normalize the Work of Enterprises" signed by you on 4 May, consist? [Zvyahilskyy] The government will only be granting financial and credit support to the enterprises that produce competitive goods and have a sales market (Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers, in Yefim Zvyahilskyy's words, has already gathered the information required from ministries and departments, in order to identify those enterprises), whereas the enterprises that do have a sales market will only be able to receive money having a realistic clear-up and production realignment program. [UNIAN] Has the concept of a future monetary reform been developed? What will it be like, a parallel or confiscatory one? [Zvyahilskyy] A new banknote factory has been commissioned in Ukraine. The money is very good. We can print an unlimited amount of it and also some for other countries. As for the reform, a working group has been set up and there will by all means be the introduction of the hryvnya. The issue of banning the circulation of foreign currency in Ukraine, which does not apply to the Ukrainian karbovanets, is also under consideration. This move will not be to everyone's liking but it would be justifiable. This is one of the elements of hryvnya introduction. [UNIAN] You said on the eve of the elections to the Supreme Council: "The government officials that stood and failed to get elected, have to resign from civil service". Does it mean now that over twenty highly qualified bureaucrats have to go? [Zvyahilskyy] This is a matter of personal conscience and depends on the officials themselves. When Labor Minister Mykhaylo Kaskevych, a professional I greatly respect, came and wrote a letter of resignation, I could do nothing but endorse it. Others, however, have not yet written anything... Although I have told Economy Minister Roman Shpek about a few of his deputies who failed to reach parliament, no pressure can be applied to those people. This, I repeat, is a matter of their conscience. [UNIAN] In connection with various reports of your participation -- and that of your relatives -- in entrepreneurial structures, are you and your relatives now prepared to fill in a declaration of incomes? What is in your way? [Zvyahilskyy] I filled in such a declaration when I decided to stand for a member of the new parliament. As Yefim Zvyahilskyy, I have taken part in no commercial structure. Nor am I taking part in them. I shall fill in the declaration, when need be. The participation of the Zasyadko mine in Donetsk, where I was director, in the institution of the first Ukrainian international bank, cannot be regarded as personal commercial activity. [UNIAN] There is an ever-increasing amount of talk about wider-ranging regional economic independence. Where do you think is the boundary the regions cannot be allowed to overstep? What are the main differences on the development of the Crimean Peninsula you and Crimean Vice Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov have? [Zvyahilskyy] On my initiative, I met Yevgeniy Saburov on 4 May. First of all, I asked Saburov whether he could see Crimea within Ukraine. The vice prime minister said: "So, and only so." Afterwards, there began negotiations, with the agriculture, economy, and external economic relations ministers taking part in them. In the course of the conversation, I voiced the opinion that Crimean presidential decrees in many respects contradicted the Constitution of Ukraine and that working in this manner was, of course, no longer possible. The Crimean side, in its turn, expressed understanding that one could have done without decrees in settling many issues. Yevgeniy Saburov also acknowledged the reasonability of arguments by the chairman of the board of the National Bank [NBU], Viktor Yushchenko. I also emphasized: "A state can only have one national bank." The only thing that I guaranteed for the Crimeans, was transferring financial aid from any state by a purposive allocation to Crimea without delay: The money that will be received by the NBU, will in an hour's time be transferred to Crimea down to the cent." We reached understanding that actions by the Crimean Government should not affect the interests of Ukraine. We agreed on a meeting between Ukraine's Government delegation and the Crimean president on 7 May. It is not worthwhile to stage confrontation. It is better to lend assistance to Crimea in resolving its problems. My opinion is that the decision only to provide Ukrainian language textbooks for Crimean schools is ill-considered. [UNIAN] What is your attitude towards the Black Sea Fleet issue? [Zvyahilskyy] The government is preparing specific proposals on this issue. This problem cannot be left unresolved, which is why all options are being made ready, including the possibility of rent. A preliminary accord has been reached on a meeting in the very near future with the head of Russia's government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, to work out all contentious issues on the Black Sea Fleet. Yefim Zvyahilskyy then answered questions from representatives of other mass media. Answering the question whether Ukraine would accept IMF conditions for the receipt of credits, Yefim Zvyahilskyy said he would not agree to the condition of cancelling the fixed currency exchange rate. "We, by all means, shall come to this but it will not happen in 1994. The thing is that once we free the rate, we shall have all prices for food, housing, gas, and electricity rising several-fold. We then will have to raise wages and pensions without, however, having the money for this in the budget. This is exactly why this road cannot be taken or the economy will crumble." As for the question on the attitude towards dividing powers between the president and the prime minister and his personal preferences for any presidential candidate, Yefim Zvyahilskyy declined to answer. "I am an industrialist and a businessman. I am not aware of politics although, of course, I know what is what in it." He also spoke in favor of a professional parliament and pointed out that the Cabinet of Ministers would be formed. As for his personal future, he said he cold not envisage any tragedy for himself. "I shall be a rank and file people's deputy," he said. "However, if the president deems it necessary for me to remain in the Cabinet of Ministers, I shall remain," Yefim Zvyahilskyy told the UNIAN correspondent.
