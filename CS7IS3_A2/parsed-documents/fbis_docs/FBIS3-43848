The two peoples have been united in very difficult and complex circumstances. That was said today by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina prior to his departure for Harare at the end of a two-day working and friendly visit to Angola. [Begin recording] [Reporter] Mr. Minister, I would like to know what Cuba expects from your visit to Angola and other African countries? [Robaina in Spanish] Cuba expects from Angola and other African countries what we expect from the world. When someone thinks that we expect a solution to our problem from Angola, the world or any particular country, please, the solution to Cuba's problem depends first and foremost on the Cubans themselves and a mechanism that it maintains with many in the world. There is nothing in particular, least of all Angola in view of the difficulties we know it is facing, which holds the solution to our problem. The solution to our problem does not lie in those quarters only. Cuban expects from Angola and the world what Cuba also advocates to the world -- understanding and (?sincere) respect. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, would you like to characterize the current state of relations between the Cuba and the United States, bearing in mind that despite the blockade the United States has an interest office in Havana? [Robaina] Well, relations with a country can be characterized when they are in place. When that is not the case, it is very difficult to characterize relations because there are no relations between Cuba and the United States. (?Like the United States,) Cuba has always stood (?for legal) [words indistinct] Cuba is willing to deal with the whole world, including the United States, but only on one condition -- absolute respect. If there is no absolute respect, we will have nothing to do with the United States. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, we have also learned of a certain exodus of Cubans to the United States. The latest case to be widely reported in the Western media was about the Cuban sportsmen who took part in the Central American Games. What prompts such an exodus? [Robaina] I think my country is a Third World country. It is the same thing that prompts poor countries of the world, the difference being that none of them is as famous as Cuba. None of those countries (?is as politicized) as Cuba. Cubans have the same difficult reasons like other peoples. They have been capable of giving in to a degree of pressure and to promises, but they are insignificant when compared to the millions of people who continually cross the U.S. border, namely Haitians [words indistinct] I do not think any of them is as famous as a Cuban. It is sufficient to have a Cuban and have scandal, a show [preceding word in English]. [end recording]
