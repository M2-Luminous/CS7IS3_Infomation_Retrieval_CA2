These political negotiations were only "stage-managed by the Zairian political class" comprising "90 percent of Mobutu supporters," Matanda added at a news conference. He described Monsignor Monsengwo, under whose auspices the negotiations took place, as a "traitor". According to Matanda, the bishop "betrayed the civilian, military, and religious population's confidence," adding that the negotiations also served to get rid of Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi. The Zairian opposition is capable of "overthrowing President Mobutu," and they do not need troops to do so. "They only have to paralyze the sensitive areas by blowing up fuel pipelines, the rail lines or the high tension pylons." Matanda said "Mobutu has an army which has been reduced to its simplest form, in a miserable state." He said "Mobutu can be overthrown, the most important thing is to start it." Jacques Matanda, however, admitted the existence "of divergent views within the opposition." Matanda also spoke about the support given by the Angolan authorities to Zairian "nationalists" who had launched an armed attack on the province of Shaba (extreme south of Zaire) in March 1977. Nathaniel Mbumba's National Front for the Liberation of Shaba had the "blessing of the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola and particularly that of the defunct President Agostinho Neto," Matanda pointed out. Luanda had several times denied Kinshasa's accusations of the presence of Katangese maquisards in Angola. Furthermore, Matanda said that soldiers from the Zairian president's special division unit fought on the side of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] for the capture of the oil town of Soyo (northern Angola). "Most of the soldiers fighting in northern Angola" with UNITA come from Zaire, Matanda added.
