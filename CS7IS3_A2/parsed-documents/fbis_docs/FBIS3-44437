Having closed the book, I could not help pondering deeply: Although I have read or heard about some of the articles in it before, yet the publication of this epoch-making works as decided by the party's Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core according to its extremely farsighted strategy is just like a magnificent theoretical building distinctly and completely towering aloft before me with the dazzling splendor of the age. This is the scientific system of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which has been unfolded to us in this book. This foundation works of contemporary China's Marxism has profoundly revealed the historical tendency and inherent law that governs Chinese socialist development; has charted the only correct course toward the prosperity of the country, the rejuvenation of our nation, and the happiness of the people; and has pointed out the only correct direction for the energetic advance of China's socialist cultural undertaking under the new historical conditions. At present, we are concentrating our efforts on intensifying the building of the cultural market, which is a burgeoning domain that has been developing rapidly over the past 10 years or so. As an indispensable component part of China's socialist material and spiritual civilizations, the building of cultural market must be persistently guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. I. Over the past 10 years or so, the vigorous rise and rapid growth of China's socialist cultural markets, and the impact and role brought about by these markets, which serve as links and intermediaries for promoting socialist cultural prosperity and the two civilizations, have almost become the most spectacular cultural and economic phenomenon in China since the early 1980's. With varying views, people are either pleased, worried, or half-pleased, half-worried at this phenomenon. However, the impact of economic restructuring on the cultural structure is a reality independent of man's subjective will. That is why we should give a Marxist answer to it in conformity with China's national conditions. The establishment of a socialist market economic structure is a major content of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. With extraordinary theoretical courage and realistic spirit, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "There is no contradiction between socialism and the market economy, so the question is--what methods we should apply to develop the productive forces of society more energetically." Aiming at the shackles in people's minds that have been formed under the planned economic structure for a long time, he repeatedly stressed: "We must make it clear in theory that the difference between capitalism and socialism does not lie in such an issue as planning or market. There is market economy in socialism, and planned control in capitalism." Over the past dozen years, the growth of China's commodity economy and reform of the economic structure have brought changes to various areas of China's social life in varying degrees, including the development of the socialist cultural markets. As the welfare pattern of "mass entertainment at the expense of the state" under the previous planned economic structure has been broken, and cultural markets have been the principal places of the people's consumption of culture, the sluggish cultural markets for several decades have been vigorously activated. Particularly after the objective of establishing a socialist market economic structure was defined at the 14th National Party Congress, cultural markets have encountered new development opportunities and motive forces again and advanced by leaps and bounds. Just take the entertainment markets as an example. Various kinds of cultural and recreational places across the country have grown from 80,000 in 1990 to 200,000. Today, cultural markets have become important sites for people to engage in cultural activities. After we have read through the Selected Works, it is not difficult for us to understand that the fundamental objective of establishing a socialist market economic structure is to accelerate the development of productive forces. Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly pointed out: "The basic tenet of Marxism is to develop productive forces," and the "most fundamental task at the socialist stage is the development of productive forces." Just as the development of socialist market economy will certainly bring about comprehensive changes in China's economic structure because of the necessity to develop productive forces, the prosperity of socialist cultural markets will certainly bring about opportunities and challenges for change in China's cultural structure because of the necessity to develop culture and art. The report of the 14th national party congress pointed out: "The establishment of a socialist market economic structure involves a number of areas in China's economic base and superstructure and calls for a series of appropriate structural reforms and policy readjustments." This has clearly told us that the changes will not only vigorously shake China's economic field and reform China's basic mode of economic operation, but also vigorously shake China's cultural field and launch a powerful onslaught upon the primary creation, the organizational modes, and the pattern of supply and demand of culture and art. Therefore, we should note that reform to abolish the old cultural structure and establish a new one so that it is suited to the socialist market economic structure has undoubtedly become a historical necessity. Although changes will get things straightened out, yet if the cultural structural reform is to push literature and art as well as cultural workers into the markets, or to be carried out at the costs of losing the spirit of cultural workers and lowering the quality of literature and art, as some people think, then, the cultural structural reform will deviate from the correct path. The cultural structural reform must be suited to the socialist market economic structure and at the same time conform with the requirements of socialist spiritual civilization and the laws governing the self- development of culture and art. We should both note the internal relations between cultural and economic structural reforms and their generality in some aspects, and at the same time fully understand their own laws and specific properties. Only by accurately grasping this point can we attain healthy and smooth development in the cultural structural reform. As an important part and parcel of the socialist market economy, China's cultural markets will certainly abide by the rules and general laws governing markets in development. However, as the creation of cultural products is complicated mental labor, its rise and fall as well as success and failure cannot be totally decided by market rules. Besides, as relations between long-term development and short-term consumption of the cultural undertaking must be correctly handled, the regulation of their proportions cannot be totally decided by material gain and conduct of markets. What is more, as products that are put into the cultural markets have both the properties of commodity and ideology, selection of them cannot be totally decided by the commercial gains and losses of the markets. These characteristics of our socialist cultural market calls for us to exercise even more direct and powerful regulation and control of these markets through policy, legal, economic, and administrative means. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has put forth the scientific criteria for judging the nature, gain, loss, success, and failure of reform, which have provided us with theoretical bases for judging the gain, loss, success, and failure of cultural structural reform. Specifically speaking, there are three criteria for judgment-- whether or not reform is beneficial to fully mobilizing and displaying the initiative and creativity of the vast number of literary and artistic workers, to turning out literary and artistic works and qualified personnel for the prosperity of the socialist cultural undertaking to satisfy the increasing demands of the people's cultural life, and to promoting economic development and comprehensive social progress. II. In 1985, in light of the tendency of bourgeois liberalization and money worship which emerged on the ideological and cultural fronts at that time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Ideological, cultural, educational, and public health departments should take social effectiveness as the only criterion for all activities, and enterprises which they belong to should also take social effectiveness as their highest criterion." As these expositions have made unequivocal judgment on specific characteristics, they not only seized hold of the primary issue of ideological and cultural work, but are of tremendous guiding significance to the building of China's socialist cultural markets. Just as Marx said: "The difficulty lies just in the general expression of these contradictions. Once their specific characteristics are defined, they are clearly explained." Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Marxist mode of judgment, we might well see how practice has revealed the specific characteristics of China's socialist cultural markets. First, contemporary China's cultural markets are part and parcel of the socialist market economic system on one hand, and a major area of the socialist spiritual civilization on the other. Their healthy development can only be achieved by serving the socialist material and spiritual civilizations. Such dual properties of China's socialist cultural markets have determined that they cannot under any circumstances simply and passively adapt themselves to the general rules and modes of market operations, but that, while correctly reflecting circulating and regulating functions, they should fully display functions in various aspects including recreational appreciation, exchange of information, education through propaganda, cultural accumulation, and so on, with a view to satisfying people's demands at different levels in their cultural life; promoting socialist spiritual civilization; pushing forward cultural structural reform; augmenting the self-developing vitality of cultural units; giving impetus to the development of community- run cultural industries; improving investment environment and tapping tax sources to bring about economic prosperity; enhancing the competitiveness of national culture in the international cultural markets; facilitating the cultural exchange with foreign countries, and so on. Second, as major objects of circulation in cultural markets, intellectual products have their specific patterns which are different from ordinary material products. This has likewise conditioned the specific characteristics of China's socialist cultural markets as follows: 1) The creation of cultural products is different from that of material products. In a strict sense, the production of commodities is solely for the purpose of exchange. Objectively, all cultural products in the true sense are also for the purpose of exchange but, fundamentally speaking, they are personal creations of literary and artistic workers, and vivid reflection of their great enthusiasm and true strength. 2) Compared with material products, it is more difficult to accurately calculate the time of labor necessary for cultural products. It is also very difficult to compare the time taken to create literary and artistic works by different persons even in the same category of cultural work. 3) In the economic area, the more developed the commodity economy is, the more necessary it is to abide by the principle of exchange at equal value. Now, as in the past, it is difficult for cultural products to realize universal and real exchange at equal value even in the most developed country in the world which practices commodity economy. 4) The difference in the value of utility. The value of utility for ordinary commodities should play a similar part in satisfying the demands of different customers. As consumers have an identical yardstick for commodities, it is possible to compete on an entirely equal footing. But the value of utility in cultural products is closely related to subjective elements of consumers, that is, people have very different measurements and attitudes toward the value of the utility of cultural products with ideological tints owing to consumers' varying stands, views, and cultural standards. In face of the social and economic effectiveness naturally brought forth by commodity properties and specific characteristics pertinent to intellectual products, we must work hard to achieve the dialectical unity of social and economic effectiveness in our socialist cultural markets, while persistently placing social effectiveness in a primary position. Since reform and opening up, trials and hardships in China's construction of socialist cultural markets have undoubtedly shown that the crucial link of fundamentally placing social effectiveness in a primary position and really achieving the dialectical unity of effectiveness in the two aspects is what kind of intellectual products we should use to occupy the socialist cultural markets and give positive and healthy guidance to the masses in their cultural market consumption. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "With regard to our literature and art, greater efforts should be made to depict and foster new socialist individuals to yield fruitful results. We should portray the pioneers of the four modernizations, reflect their brand new appearance with revolutionary idealism and a scientific approach, lofty sentiments and creativeness, and a broad vision and realistic spirit. Through the images of these new individuals, we should inspire the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses and promote their activities of historic creation for the four modernizations." Here, proceeding from the overall situation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Comrade Deng Xiaoping advanced the issue of how we should loudly raise the main melody of the spirit of the age in contemporary China's socialist spiritual civilization, which actually exists. As far as literary and artistic creation is concerned, it is the issue of how we should loudly raise the main melody of the creation of literary and artistic works. Comrade Jiang Zemin said that reflection of the spirit of the age should be the main melody of our literature and art. He pointed out: "Patriotism, socialism, and collectivism should become the main melody of our society." There is always the spirit of the age which holds a leading position in the comprehensive ideological and cultural development in any society at all times. As a reflection of aesthetic views in social life, literary and artistic creation must also have its own main melody. In contemporary China, this melody is identical with that in actual life. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, principles, and policies, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism are the main melody of the actual life in contemporary China. Therefore, in literary and artistic creation, the main melody we refer to should be the mainstream of creation formed by art and literature with artistic charm and healthy content, which take great pains to reflect the spirit of the age and encourage people to positively dedicate themselves to the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The more resonant this main melody of art and literature is, the more powerful it will be at serving the people and socialism and the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. The actual social life and the people's demands for culture are rich, colorful, and diversified. Our literary and artistic creations, including the works of main melody, should also be rich, colorful, and diversified in theme, form, style, and method of expression. In other words, while stressing to loudly raise the main melody, we must encourage this diversity. This is the practical and dialectical view of correctly handling relations between the two aspects. Only by achieving this dialectical unity of integrating theory with practice can we create fine literary and artistic works which are suited to both refined and popular tastes, and which are worthy of the great age without precedent; fill the socialist cultural markets with intellectual products having artistic charm and healthy content, which particularly sing the praises of reform, opening up, and modernization; guide the people in their consumption of culture; and push forward the healthy advance of cultural markets. III. The idea of "doing two types of work simultaneously" is a major component part of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the concrete application of dialectical materialism in the process of our socialist modernization with great creative spirit. With regard to the overall building of the country, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We must pay special attention to the building of material civilization. Meanwhile, we must build socialist spiritual civilization as well." On the issue of handling the relation between reform and stability, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We must grasp reform and opening up with one hand, and the crackdown on various kinds of criminal activities with the other." On the issue of the production of art and literature, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Cultural circles should create more quality intellectual products, and resolutely check the production, importation, and circulation of harmful products." There is another prominent point in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea of "doing two types of work simultaneously"--we must not stress material progress at the expense of cultural and ideological progress, but attach equal importance to both. The stand, view, and method of "doing two types of work simultaneously" not only play an important guiding role in controlling at macro level the overall situation of China's socialist modernizations, but also serve as powerful weapons in building socialist cultural markets with Chinese characteristics. Since reform and opening up, China's cultural markets have developed very rapidly to include markets of entertainment, audio- visual equipment, press and publication, fine arts, performances, films, historical relics, cultural exchanges with foreign countries, training in art and culture, and others, in a comprehensive way, from the previous simple markets of cinemas, television shows, theaters, book stalls, newsstands, and booths for folk performances. The present markets have played an irreplaceable role in promoting the economy, satisfying and enriching the people's life, and developing socialist cultural undertakings. At present, however, China is in the developmental period, the growth of cultural markets has not yet matured, and there are very chaotic phenomena in the course of rapid development. In this regard, we must acquire a sober understanding and adopt resolute and powerful measures to resolve them. To sum up, there are six major serious problems in cultural markets: First, in the press, publication, and audio-visual markets, illegal business activities such as smuggling, trafficking, stealing of copyrights, reselling of publication numbers at a profit, and others, are increasingly rampant. Illegal publications of inferior quality and low prices are flooding in, disrupting markets and throwing state-owned publishers into an extremely dire predicament. In the meantime, some state publishing units also engaged in very serious activities such as reselling publication numbers at a profit, and so on, thus providing chances to illegal elements for their wrongdoings. Recently, concentrated efforts have been made to crack down on them and, although they have pulled in their horns for the moment, yet the matter is far from being solved. Second, markets are flooded with pornographic books, periodicals, and audio and video tapes in increasingly large volume, extensive circulation, and open forms. Owing to the repeated failure of banning them, they have seriously polluted the social environment and impaired the physical and mental health of the broad masses, young people in particular. Third, pornographic activities in some entertainment sites have gained ground to a certain extent, and some of them even solicit customers with sex services to reap exorbitant profits in an imposing manner. In this way, they have poisoned the social atmosphere and damaged the image of the party and country. Fourth, some operators of video game centers are engaged in gambling under cover of lucky draws, complying with relevant state regulations overtly but opposing them covertly, and turning entertainment sites into gambling houses, which is absolutely incompatible with our socialist system. Fifth, in the performances of overseas film and television stars and singers, the abnormal tendencies including enterprise sponsorship with public funds, high ticket prices, expensive admission fees, andf tax evasion, among other things, are very serious. Sixth, the film market has shrunk, and the targets for shows, audience, issues, and income continue to decline. In order to contend for audience with the centers of video shows projected by laser compact discs, some individual localities even disregard relevant regulations and vie with each other to show "documentary films" and "category III films," which has produced an adverse effect in society. There are complicated reasons for the emergence and spread of the above problems. They are problems of ideological understanding, operating direction, improper management structure, ineffective macroscopic regulation and control, unsound policies and statutes, relaxed law enforcement, and defiance of law. The basic idea of resolving these problems is to adhere to the principle of "doing two types of work simultaneously" proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in building socialist material and spiritual civilizations. To implement concretely the principle in the cultural markets, we should persistently intensify management to eliminate cultural garbage on the one hand, and occupy and enrich cultural markets with flourishing, healthy, and useful cultural products on the other. Moreover, we should adopt powerful measures to guide and rectify cultural markets to exercise the positive role of cultural markets and check their negative role to the maximum. To be specific, the following tasks are extremely necessary: First, laying equal stress on purification and prosperity. At present, there are a number of problems in cultural markets where the good is mingled with the bad and the sham with the genuine. We make great efforts to rectify and purify the markets. Certainly, this is a long-term and arduous mission. We must take control of it constantly and unflinchingly. Our attitude is very definite: Never allow phenomena of sexuality, pornography, murder, violence, feudal superstition, and gambling to exist in our cultural markets. With regard to spiritual civilization, stress should be laid on the building of it. Apart from intensifying management and rectification, it is all the more important to concentrate our efforts on prosperity, let more healthy, useful, rich, and colorful cultural products which reflect the main melody of the age and appeal to both the more and the less cultured occupy cultural markets and satisfy the masses' increasing demands for diversified culture, so that the pernicious cultural rubbish will not gain a foothold. In this sense, prosperity is a matter of vital importance in changing the current condition of the cultural markets. Second, laying equal stress on bringing about a temporary and a permanent solution. In recent years, the party Central Committee and the State Council seriously heeded the struggle of eliminating pornography and cracking down on criminal activities in the area of illegal publications. Through several concentrated actions and comprehensive management, problems in the cultural markets have been resolved to some extent. This is absolutely necessary. However, after the concentrated crackdown, we must adopt effective measures to put an end once and for all to deep-rooted problems of the cultural markets. The national cultural market work meeting, which has just ended, put forththe following: While carrying out their annual examination, cultural and administrative departments in all localities must check all dancing halls and karaoke saloons again, and issue licenses for carrying on cultural business printed by the Ministry of Culture to those that meet with approval. As for those that do not come up to requirements, their business permits will be withdrawn. During this winter and the coming spring, video show centers (including those using laser discs) must be reexamined once, and priority should be given to banning the video show business which is privately operated or which is in a disguised form of private operation. Besides, conditions should be created to practice a system, under which video show centers must submit a monthly show schedule to the local competent departments. As regards the press and publication market, it is necessary to continue taking firm control of "eliminating pornography" and dealing blows to illegal publications. Apart from the aforementioned measures, we must accelerate the process of legislation, and perfect laws and regulations on the management of cultural markets, which are the fundamental guarantee for promoting the healthy growth of these markets. Third, laying equal stress on adopting protective preferential measures and exercising restrictive tax control. China's cultural markets are both an important part of the socialist economic system and a major area of the building of socialist spiritual civilization. Their socialist nature has conditioned that it is impossible for them to emerge and perish of themselves or to rise and ebb of themselves as in some capitalist countries. Government departments must adopt protective and restrictive means to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control to indicate the state's intention of guiding cultural markets. At present, the decline of elegant artistic performances has formed a sharp contrast to the overheated performances of singers and "stars" in the markets. In view of the above facts, we should adopt a fostering attitude toward the former, and pertinent departments nationwide should formulate policies as quickly as possible and provide preferential policies to them in terms of performance tax, management fees, transportation charges, and site charges. On the other hand, they should employ economic and administrative means to guide social sponsorship to prevent loss of public funds and to limit performance fees and ticket prices of the performances put on by singers or "stars" to prevent the phenomenon of the inferior winning and the superior being eliminated in cultural markets. In addition, it is necessary to use economic policies, tax policies in particular, to curb the blind pursuit of high-grade entertainment sites calling for high consumption and to concentrate efforts on developing some medium- and low-grade entertainment sites to meet the demands of the broad masses. What needs to be pointed out is that to regulate the markets we cannot help but adopt protective and restrictive means aimed at checking in good time some major deviations that have arisen in cultural markets because of their inability to regulate themselves, so that cultural markets as a whole will be able to operate in an orderly and healthy way and will incrementally advance toward higher levels. Fourth, laying equal stress on government conduct and social supervision. Along with the rise and growth of cultural markets, appropriate management organs have been set up, a contingent of law enforcement personnel have been formed, and a national management network at central, provincial, prefectural, county, and township and town levels has basically taken shape boasting ranks of 150,000 full- and part-time personnel. This is the precondition as well as guarantee for managing cultural markets by government departments. Alongside the development of cultural markets, management tasks are more and more heavy and difficult. Hence, it is imperative to mobilize social forces to supervise markets. Very useful experience has been gained by Shenzhen in this respect. The method of "management by three parties" has been adopted by this city, that is, 1) management by the state--exercising regulation and control, giving guidance, conducting examination, and meting out punishment according to relevant administrative rules and regulations; 2) management by the trade--assisting government functional departments to exercise self-management by the trade association according to relevant laws, rules, and regulations; and 3) management by society--mobilizing people in society to exercise supervision and management, and through the information provided by part-time checking personnel to promptly report the lawbreaking and discipline-violating acts of operators. In this way, management channels for cultural markets have been broadened so that government departments have had management "assistants," thus forming a management pattern of "small government, large society." Moreover, we must also use social and mass supervisory instruments such as public opinion, morality, and so on, to promote the healthy growth of China's socialist cultural markets. Lenin said: "Without revolutionary theory, there would not be revolutionary movements." Judging from the course of reform and opening up over the past dozen years, the process of China's socialist modernization, as a changing movement in the development of things, has never for a moment deviated from the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, both the building of material or spiritual civilization, and both the prosperity of the socialist literary and artistic undertaking or the development of the socialist cultural markets, have called for the entire literary and artistic workers, leading cadres at all levels on the literary and artistic front in particular, to master comprehensively, accurately, systematically, and scientifically Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics through in-depth study of the Selected Works. Only by so doing can we have the reliable guarantee for fulfilling the heavy responsibilities we are shouldering. Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed: "If our party has a large number of comrades who systematically, rather than fragmentarily, and practically, rather than superficially, master the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and who are able to apply this theory to the study and solution of major problems, then our party's ability to lead reform, opening up, and socialist modernization will be substantially enhanced."
