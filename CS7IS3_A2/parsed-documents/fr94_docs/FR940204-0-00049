FR940204-0-00049 FR940204-0-00020 The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect; or attempt any of these), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities, and for economic hardship under certain circumstances. Requests for copies of the regulations on listed plants and wildlife and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Permit Branch, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181, telephone 503/231&hyph;6241, FAX 503/231&hyph;6243.
