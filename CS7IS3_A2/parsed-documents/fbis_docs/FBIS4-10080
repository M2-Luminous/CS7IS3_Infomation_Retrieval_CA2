Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais said the report "does not accurately reflect" the Nicaraguan situation, and "the U.S. State Department told Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry officials that Nicaragua was not a country that caused concern" regarding drug trafficking. "Furthermore," it added that since the date of the report until today, "Nicaragua has shown important progress in cooperating to confront international narcotrafficking problems." The U.S. document, to which BARRICADA gained access, states the National Police has delayed the antidrug-trafficking struggle and conducted its first operation "with the DEA" in early 1994. Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar recalled that John Maisto, U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua, sent a letter congratulating the police corps for its antidrug-trafficking struggle. The annual report also states "the extension and importance of drug trafficking in Nicaragua is not fully known," but "there are hardly any doubts about Nicaragua's tremendous financial and political problems make the country an obvious target" of narcotrafficking. A ranking police source has agreed that undoubtedly a large amount of drugs passes through our country, air space, and across our sea. The source added: "Concerning Nicaragua, one cannot speak, however, of official authorization of narcotrafficking flights or official protection groups for cocaine-unloading operations." The report criticized Violeta de Chamorro's government for not progressing as the United States wants "in fulfilling the UN Convention of 1988, not passing new counternarcotics laws, not adopting measures against government corruption, and not progressing in bilateral and regional agreements signed in previous years. It recognizes as facts, however, that Nicaragua is part of the executive secretariat of the Central American Antinarcotics Commission, that the Banco Central demands documents verifying transactions exceeding $10,000, and that a counternarcotics police unit has been created." Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar said "there is no evidence of money laundering in Nicaragua," as the U.S. State Department claims. A police source agreed with Cesar. "We cannot certify there is money laundering in Nicaragua." The source added the police cannot conduct an investigation "as long as there is no law authorizing us to do so." Luis Humberto Guzman, National Assembly president, said that so far, the legislative branch has not conducted an investigation on money laundering due to a lack of economic means. He said: "If one examines the amount of financial activities in Nicaraguan banks, we cannot speak of money laundering." The U.S. report adds that "although the Nicaraguan Government promised in 1992 to present a law, according to the UN Convention of 1988, it decided not to use any political capital for it." The report added Nicaraguan legislation on the topic is "obsolete" because it defines the problem as a "health" problem. The National Assembly has learned of a draft bill which, because of its complex nature, is taking awhile. It is hoped the law will be ready in eight weeks. Guzman said the U.S. State Department "has false information" on the narcotrafficking situation in Nicaragua, and the deputies are "doing what we must regarding this topic (of narcotrafficking)."
