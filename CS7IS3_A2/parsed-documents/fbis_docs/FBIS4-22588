We Await the Elections"] [Text] In order to report on the trip to the Central Election Commission in Moscow and answer questions that had accumulated during their absence, Chairman of the Kray Election Commission S. Knyazev and Ye. Khrustalev assembled journalists in the White House the day before yesterday. It appears from what they said that the decision of the governor of the kray concerning delaying the elections to the kray Duma until autumn made sense to the Central Election Commission. They also did not fail to pay attention to the financial needs of Maritime Kray regarding the conduct of elections. The necessary amount of money was released. Thus, the kray election commission was able to return half a billion rubles [R] to the kray budget, from where the money was borrowed to finance the initial stages of the election campaign, and which the governor also promised to release for social programs. S. Knyazev dispelled the concerns of journalists about the safekeeping of the money allocated for the elections postponed until autumn. But so that the millions will be safer, he will probably even cancel a trip to Moscow, where on 20 April the Supreme Court plans to examine an appeal filed by Messrs Gilgenberg, Kandarakov, and Isayev concerning the, in their opinion, improper cutting up of electoral districts. According to the law, the complaint can be examined even in the absence of representatives of the kray election commission. As for the Supreme Court finding on the essence of the complaint, the delay of the elections to a later date only contributes to objectivity. In the words of S. Knyazev, such a subjective factor as an already elected kray Duma would complicate the work of justice. Mentioning that we all walk under God, the visitors explained the situation regarding the candidates for deputy who are already registered. This is how matters stand: If 55 days before the scheduled date of the elections there are less than two candidates for deputy in any electoral district for any reason whatsoever, a prenomination mandatory collection of signatures will be held as before. It was decided not to change the composition of the kray and district election commissions. They will continue their work.
