FBIS4-40018 "drsov113_r_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-113 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Azerbaijan Aliyev on Possible Russian Military Presence Aliyev on Possible Russian Military Presence LD1006163294 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1437 GMT 10 Jun 94 LD1006163294 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev believes that settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict cannot be carried out without introduction of the separating forces to the conflict zone. However, the Azerbaijani leader stressed in an interview with Interfax that this military contingent must have the CSCE mandate. Aliyev admitted that Russian troops could participate in the peacekeeping action, however, they must also bear the CSCE sign. Aliyev underlined that his position on the conflict remained the same, seeking a peaceful political solution to the issue. "The war must be halted since it has no perspectives both for Azerbaijan and Armenia," Aliyev pointed out. He was certain that settlement must be carried out on a fair basis, this is to say on the basis of Azerbaijan's sovereignty, territorial integrity, inviolability of the borders and taking into consideration the generally recognized international standards. Aliyev emphasized poor efficiency of the two-year efforts put by the Minsk group on settlement in Karabakh. However, he said he was interested that the talks be held right within the scope of the Minsk group (which includes Russia with its independent peacekeeping initiatives). Aliyev recognized Russia's special role. He suggested that Russia was interested in the Caucasian region more than any other state. The consultations which the Azerbaijani leadership has conducted with Russia and the Minsk group prove the value of parallel mediation by the CSCE, Russia and the CIS in settlement of the conflict, Aliyev underlined. Speaking on possible direct talks with the leaders of the self- proclaimed Nagorno Karabakh Republic, Aliyev said, "In what concerns this, I have many plans in my head. Something may be carried out along." Commenting on possible participation of the Azerbaijani military contingent in the peacekeeping action in Abkhazia, Aliyev stressed, "In principle, I stand against introduction of troops of one country to the territory of another one. However, taking into account the persistent requests made by Eduard Shevardnadze and the Abkhazian party, we gave our consent. We regard the issue with understanding. However, as far as I know, only Russian troops will act there."
