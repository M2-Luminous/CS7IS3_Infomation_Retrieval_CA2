When we say the Security Council, we in fact mean the U.S. Administration that has imposed its full control and hegemony over the international organization since the Gulf crisis in 1990 and the subsequent host of unjust resolutions adopted, in record time, against fraternal Iraq. The Iraqi people are still suffering from the effects of these unjust and unprecedented resolutions even though their alleged justifications are over. Within less than two weeks, the Security Council adopted some 13 resolutions, including a resolution that allowed the launching of a brutal aggression against Iraq, in addition to the imposition of an all-out siege. On the other hand, the council has spent two full weeks on consultations on the most brutal and unprecedented massacre in contemporary history. These consultations have been subject to strange U.S. bargaining. This bargaining has once again shown the hypocrisy, double-standards, and blatant contradictions in U.S. political behavior. It has exposed the allegations about eagerness to implement international legitimacy and UN resolutions. The final straw in this U.S. bargaining was the humiliating condition set by Christopher in his telephone contact with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat last Thursday. Christopher emphasized his administration's position, which forms a link between any proposed international resolution condemning the massacre and the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, despite the fact that the U.S. position on the draft resolution is not far from what Israeli wants. Washington insists on a diluted resolution that does not contain any serious measures to deter the Israelis from their repressive policy in the occupied Arab territories. We have never had a good opinion of U.S. intentions toward our just Arab causes. We have never ignored the nature of the strategic alliance between the United States and Israel, which has continued for decades, or the unlimited U.S. support for Zionist aggressiveness against the Arab nation. We are fully aware that restoring respect and dignity to this nation cannot be realized through the emotions of the United States, because politics and interests do not know emotions. There is no alternative for Arab solidarity, even the minimum of this solidarity.
