However, Chinese representatives were denied these rights. The fact is that, last year, Chinese fishing vessels were often involved in poaching in the Russian Federation's economic zone which includes the territorial waters of Kamchatka. Justifiably, their crews were repeatedly detained by fishing protection vessels and coast guard ships.
