FR940216-1-00003 FR940216-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of International Investment 31 CFR Part 800 Regulations Pertaining to Mergers, Acquisitions, and Takeovers by Foreign Persons AGENCY: Department of the Treasury. ACTION: proposed rule. SUMMARY: These proposed regulations implement amendments to section 721 of title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (the ``DPA''), as added by section 5021 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, relating to mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers of U.S. persons by or with foreign persons, and as amended by section 837 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993. That amendment requires that the President or his designee undertake an investigation under section 721 of certain acquisitions which could result in control of U.S. persons by foreign government controlled entities. It also expands the factors the President must consider in making a determination under section 721, modifies the existing congressional reporting requirement under section 721, and requires that any designee of the President under section 721 share with any other designee a copy of an assessment made in a particular case of the risk of diversion of a defense critical technology. These proposed regulations implement only those provisions relating to mandatory investigations, and also make a few technical and conforming changes to the existing regulations. The statutory amendments pertaining to the factors for Presidential decisionmaking and report sharing, which do not directly affect the behavior of parties filing under section 721, were deemed sufficiently straightforward not to require any implementing regulations. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before March 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to: Donald Crafts, Director, Office of International Investment, Department of the Treasury, room 5100, 15th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20220. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marilyn L. Muench, Deputy Assistant General Counsel for International Affairs, or Francine McNulty Barber, Attorney-Adviser, Department of the Treasury, 15th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20220, (202) 622&hyph;1947. For further information regarding procedures for giving notice, contact Donald E. Crafts, Staff Chairman of the Committee and Acting Director, Office of International Investment, room 5100, Department of the Treasury, 15th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20220, (202) 622&hyph;1860. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 136 of the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 (P.L. 102&hyph;558) amended section 709 of the DPA by requiring that any regulation issued under the DPA be published in the Federal Register and that opportunity for public comment be provided for not less than thirty days. Although the Treasury Department elected to provide a sixty day comment period for the regulations originally proposed to implement section 721, it has decided to provide thirty days for these proposed regulations, which, with a few exceptions, are of a relatively routine nature. The preamble to these regulations, once published in final form, will be preserved with the preamble to the original regulations as an appendix in the Code of Federal Regulations. Executive Order 12866: These regulations are not subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12866 because they relate to a foreign and military affairs function of the United States.
