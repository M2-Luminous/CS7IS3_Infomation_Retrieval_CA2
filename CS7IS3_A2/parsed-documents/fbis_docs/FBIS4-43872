Hans Haekkerup said in a written reply to parliament's Defence Committee that "these radars were set up in Tuzla, Sarajevo, Bihac and Mostar, after Tuzla airport was shelled on May 17." At the time, Denmark had complained that the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] had not responded to requests for air support by the Danish contingent, which was being attacked, had made. The radars, which have a 30 kilometre (19 mile) range with 20 metre (66 foot) accuracy, can pinpoint the location of guns and canon and thereby enable the United Nations to riposte.
