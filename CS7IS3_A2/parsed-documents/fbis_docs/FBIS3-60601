As we reported earlier, on November 19, the Ukrainian parliament ratified the START-I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol with numerous reservations which, in Moscow's opinion, undermines the regime of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. To quote Meyers, these reservations disappointed President Clinton. The Ukrainian president's Staff informed Interfax that the telephone talks between Clinton and Kravchuk had lasted for 30 minutes and that no one had been informed of the details. Besides the ratification of the START-I Treaty, the two leaders discussed "the economic situation in Ukraine," said a representative of the president's Staff. He also said that Clinton had proposed searching for ways of implementing the START-I Treaty and expressed readiness to help Ukraine solve its economic problems. The Ukrainian and U.S. presidents discussed ways of attaining agreements on U.S. financial and economic assistance in Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, on compensation for the nuclear materials and on guarantees of Ukrainian security," he told Interfax. He also said that the two leaders had discussed details of Kravchuk's forthcoming visit to the U.S. during which Ukrainian-U.S. economic cooperation will be discussed.
