As Volodymyr Klymchuk, the party's leader told a UNIAN correspondent, the "LDPU is cautious about forming blocs with other political forces. It is, above all, afraid of the efforts that have been announced by some blocs to form excessively rigid structures that could hinder the opportunity to operate independently. However, this does not mean that the liberal democrats will halt contacts and consultations with other parties." According to Klymchuk, the communists and socialists are the only ones considered by the LDPU to be opponents.
