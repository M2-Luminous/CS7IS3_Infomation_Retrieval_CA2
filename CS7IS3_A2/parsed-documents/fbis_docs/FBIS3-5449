Prasong said his Burmese counterpart, U Ohn Gyaw, has endorsed Thailand's initiative for the construction of the bridge to link Tak's Mae Sot district with Mywaddy. The Cabinet last week agreed to the Foreign Ministry proposal that Thailand take responsibility for funding construction of the bridge, because Burma is not prepared to do so. However, it asked the ministry to make sure Burma wants the bridge. "U Ohn Gyaw informed me during my official visit to Rangoon for a Joint Commission meeting that Burma wants the bridge," Prasong said. The bridge is expected to boost border trade and tourism in the area. Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem yesterday informed Burmese Ambassador to Thailand U Phone Myint of the Cabinet resolution last week to fund construction of the bridge. Thailand initially considered other options related to the project, including a proposal that Tak province's private sector construct a temporary bridge at the same location. Tak's private sector wants the temporary bridge immediately, while waiting for a decision on the main bridge by the two governments.
