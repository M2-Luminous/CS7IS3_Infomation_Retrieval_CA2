FR941122-2-00133 FR941122-2-00098 Tuesday November 22, 1994 Part VI Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration Federal Transit Administration Axle Weights of Public Transit Buses; Extension of Exclusion Period; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 224␣/␣Tuesday, November 22, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Highway Administration Federal Transit Administration Axle Weights of Public Transit Buses; Extension of Exclusion Period AGENCIES: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA), DOT. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to study and provide recommendations to address the matter of public transit buses that exceed Interstate System axle weight limits. The Congress also excluded public transit buses from Interstate System axle weight limits for 2 years (until October 6, 1994) and provided that the Secretary could extend the exclusion for an additional year. The study was transmitted to the Congress on September 20, 1994, but legislation would be required to implement its recommendation to allow higher bus axle weights until lighter buses can be developed and this will require additional time. Therefore, renewing the exclusion for 1 more year will allow public transit buses to continue to operate on the Interstate System at axle weights authorized by each state while a permanent solution is implemented. DATES: The exclusion of public transit buses from the Interstate System axle weight limits is extended to October 6, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Thomas Klimek, Office of Motor Carrier Information Management, at (202) 366&hyph;2212, or Mr. Charles Medalen, Office of Chief Counsel, at (202) 366&hyph;1354, Federal Highway Administration; Mr. Bart W. Mancini, Office of Engineering Evaluation, at (202) 366&hyph;0224, or Mr. Richard Wong, Office of Chief Counsel, at (202) 366&hyph;1936, Federal Transit Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 341 of the FY 1993 Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;388, 106 Stat. 1520, at 1552) amended section 1023 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, at 1951) by adding a new paragraph (h). Paragraph (h)(2) required the Secretary to conduct a study of the maximum axle weight limits of ``public transit vehicles'' on the Interstate System. Paragraph (h)(1) excluded ``any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger bus'' from the single- and tandem-axle weight limits imposed on the Interstate System by the second sentence in 23 U.S.C. 127 for 2 years from the effective date of the legislation, October 6, 1992, and authorized the Secretary to renew the exclusion for an additional year. States that fail to enforce the Interstate System weight limits could be penalized by the loss of their Federal highway funds under 23 U.S.C. 141(c)(2). Before the exclusion became effective, buses were, on occasion, stopped by State enforcement personnel and forced to unload passengers until they were no longer overweight. The study required by paragraph (h)(2) was transmitted to the Congress on September 20, 1994. However, action to address overweight axles of public transit buses on the Interstate System will require additional time. A 1-year extension will allow public transit buses to continue to operate on the Interstate System without the threat of possible funding sanctions or the removal of passengers while a permanent solution to the problem is implemented. Therefore, any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger bus is excluded, until October 6, 1995, from the second sentence of section 23 U.S.C. 127 relating to axle weight limitations for vehicles using the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Authority: Sec. 1023, Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Pub.
