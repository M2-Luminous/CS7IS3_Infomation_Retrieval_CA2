In an interim report on the government's activities to ensure Germany's attractiveness as an economic base, published on Tuesday [28 December], Rexrodt expressed confidence that the process of recovery will continue and intensify next year. However, a rise in unemployment and "considerable employment problems" are to be expected. It became increasingly clear at the end of the year that the economy has bottomed out, the minister stressed when he presented the report. A growth of 0.5 to 1 percent is possible in west Germany next year, and a growth of 7.5 percent is possible in east Germany. Yet employment will certainly drop in the old laender. Even once the recession is overcome, a relatively high level of unemployment is to be expected, in particular because of the structural problems. Germany's economic policy will concentrate on these problems in 1994. Profitable new jobs be created in Germany only by overcoming the structural difficulties. An efficient labor market policy continues to be absolutely necessary. It must accompany the "tremendous structural changes" in the new laender and ease the impact of the economic stagnation on the western labor market. Rexrodt vehemently rejected initiatives to shorten working hours. Efforts to solve the employment problem by redistributing the existing work are the "wrong economic concept." The program of action to fight structural unemployment, adopted by the cabinet in September, will be given "absolute priority" in the next few years. The Federal Government alone will implement about 80 measures in this legislative period. One-third of the work has already been completed. Substantial progress has been achieved in numerous spheres. To create a broad social basis for further measures designed to ensure Germany's attractiveness as an economic location, Rexrodt plans to organize a "location forum" in Bonn on 8 and 9 February to "overcome the prevailing thinking in terms of old rights and group interests." Hans Peter Stihl, president of the Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, strongly criticized the initiatives that the Federal Government has taken so far. He demanded "clearer signals of the world economy" for next year. The super election year must not become a "year of economic rhetorics but a year of deeds." If the government's report on efforts to ensure Germany's attractiveness as an industrial location remains pure theory, the enterprises will not receive stimuli and become frustrated. A reversal of the current economic trend will only take place if the readiness for investments increases in the economy. However, so far there can be no talk of a reversal. The government must not shy away from "very painful cutbacks," particularly in the sphere of social benefits. The German Association of Savings Banks has rejected general economic pessimism. The opportunities for a recovery in the middle of 1994 have improved, but the recovery will not be very strong. It is decisive for Germany to become internationally more competitive again as far as costs and products are concerned. Over the short term, a moderate wage policy is also necessary. A policy aimed at ensuring the level of real wages in 1994 would certainly endanger jobs in the industry and have a negative impact on investments at home, the association stressed.
