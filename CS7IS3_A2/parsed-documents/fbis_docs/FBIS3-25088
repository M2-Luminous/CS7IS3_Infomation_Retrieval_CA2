There is increasing talk of insecurity in the capital city, Conakry. What steps are you taking to put an end to this increase in banditry? My second question, Mr. President, is this: You have just been elected for a new five-year term. What are your priorities in the implementation of your manifesto? And my last question, Mr. President, what will the role of the Army be in the new Guinean democracy? Thank you. [Conte] It is true that in our country today there is a lot of insecurity. Measures have been taken by the Ministry of Interior and Security to deal with this plague. You might have heard on the radio the measures that the Ministry of Interior has just taken to curb the activities of the bandits who represent a scourge in our cities. I think it is a long-term project. Insecurity in our country is so developed that it cannot be eliminated in one day but we have, in fact, made it a priority among our priorities in order to curb it. Even if it cannot be eliminated completely, we aim at least to drastically reduce the insecurity prevailing in our country, especially in the city of Conakry. Now if you want to know the details of these measures, you can contact the Ministry of Interior, but I believe we do not even have to tell you the type of measures being taken because we should not warn these bandits of all the measures we are taking against them otherwise, as you know, they will take the appropriate countermeasures. So there are certain things we are keeping secret. Now, concerning my priorities during my five-year term, they will first include the security we have been talking about, national unity, and the need for Guineans to work hard. They will also include the economic development of our country. We will use all the means at our disposal for our country's development beginning with the basis for development, agriculture. In regard to the Army's role, it will maintain its traditional role. Under the First Republic, the Army was authorized to be involved in the political life of the country. The Army as we know has its own role that all soldiers know. It is this role that we are going to revive, that is, defending the territorial integrity of the country, therefore, defending our country. This is the task to which the Army will devote itself. The Army will not only defend our country but we should ensure that we are present anywhere we are needed in the West African subregion. We should be present anywhere in Africa, wherever we are needed, to defend the cause of peace. So our role is quite clear. We shall leave politicians to fight on the political field, and we shall fight in the military field. I believe if we carry out our work correctly in the Army, it will enable politicians to also carry out their work correctly. [passage omitted] [Maiga] Mr. President, does this mean therefore that the Army will henceforth return to the barracks? [Conte] But the Army has always been in the barracks! [Maiga] I mean, Mr. President.... [Conte, interrupting] Even in the First Republic the Army was always in the barracks; only a few soldiers were given civilian functions. Even in very developed countries, there are generals and colonels who assume civilian responsibilities. That does not mean that the Army is not in the barracks. You are always talking of barracks, barracks...do you think they are prisons? [laughter] The barracks are not prisons. They are places where soldiers live; but they are not obliged to shut up. They are free citizens like anyone else. [passage omitted] [Pamissan] My name is Edouard Pamissan of the LE BUCHERON newspaper in Gabon. Mr. President, I would first like to highlight an exceptional event which is the one we are witnessing, that of a head of state holding a news conference with opposition reporters. I believe this does not happen often and needs to be highlighted. In your introductory speech, you dwelled at length on the media. You spoke on the role of journalists. This means you have confidence in the role of the media in a democratic regime. I would like to highlight a few points. One of our colleagues of the national radio was molested by a soldier for participating in a march organized by the opposition. The other point is that when one listens to the national radio and television, one realizes that there is very little participation by the opposition. Talking about pluralism, which is one of the basic tenets of democracy, you said you would gradually set in motion an already existing mechanism. My question is this: Would it not be better to rather start with pluralism, which is the very basis for democracy and which allows for the expression of various ideas? Would it not be better to start the democratic process by the liberation of the media and the development of free expression, which are the basic tenets of democracy? Thank you. [Conte] How should start the democratic process? By pluralism? [Pamissan] Yes, I mean when one talks of democracy, one speaks of pluralism. Is pluralism not the very basis for democracy and freedom of expression? Would it not have been better to start from there? [Conte] The essential thing is to attain one's objective. Whether one starts with pluralism or with freedom of expression, the essential thing is that we attain the objective we have assigned ourselves. We want freedom for everybody, especially the media. The media have been writing, the media have been talking. We do not see any inconvenience in what the media writes or talks about. We want our country to be genuinely democratic so that everyone can express himself freely. You have just said a soldier beat up a reporter because he was with the opposition. Did you ask the soldier and the reporter why they were fighting? [Pamissan] No, Mr. President. [Conte] Why do you judge people without listening to them? I am sure the reporter said something to the soldier that did not please him but he did not beat him up because of politics. [passage omitted] [Unidentified moderator] Thank you Mr. President. Now, (Pierre Florent) of the Voice of America. [(Florent)] [passage omitted] Are you going to invite the opposition to form a government of national unity? [Conte] I have told you that I am not going to invite anybody. I am not going to call on anybody. Do not expect Africans to do what you do not do in your country. In your country when the president is elected he choses the men he likes. Leave us to choose the men we want to choose. Do not try to impose on us the people you want to see in government. [passage omitted] [Moderator] A question of economic interest from the foreign media by the Africa No. 1 correspondent. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, I wonder whether the fact that Guinea does not belong to the franc zone today is a good policy or a bad one. That is my first question. My second question, Mr. President, is this: You have decided to personally ensure probity in the management of public property. Last year there was a scandal at the Ministry of Finance. Do you personally intend to follow up on the outcome of this scandal? [Conte] You are referring to the CFA franc. You are asking whether it is good or bad to be outside the franc zone. I think you should ask the ordinary Guinean in the street what he thinks of it. I personally do not find any (?inconvenience) in being outside the zone. If the people ask us [words indistinct]. Concerning probity in the management of public property, I believe we are going to continue to ensure that but I believe it is not management itself that needs moral probity. It is the people in charge of management who need it. [passage omitted]
