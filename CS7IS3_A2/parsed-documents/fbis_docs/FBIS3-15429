A few minutes ago, we phoned him in Washington. Mr. Ioseliani said that he has had very important meetings in the UN Security Council, chiefly pertaining to a peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian problem. Asked whether the United Nations will be sending peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia, Ioseliani said: [Begin Ioseliani recording] I have just been to the Security Council. It is not a simple thing for America and neither is it for others. It must be clear why and for what reasons. It should be decided whether America and other Western countries will participate in this action. It costs 100 million [currency not specified] to carry out this operation. No one wants to spend this amount. Why should I spend this money and send you troops if you fail to manage your own business and the United Nations does not have that money? Deputies, members of parliaments, congressmen are against this. But this time the attitude is a little bit different and if Shevardnadze's visit influences congressmen and others, especially senators, whose concern this allotment of funds is, then everything will be all right. [end recording] We regret that the quality was poor due to the telephone line. Finally, an official document about the UN peacekeeping forces can be received but, according to the United Nations, these forces will comprise Russian servicemen only. Today, at the Security Council, there will be a discussion pertaining to the extension of a peace mandate for the UN observers in Abkhazia. Jaba Ioseliani has been planning to make a speech on recent developments in Gali rayon. Asked what significance is attached to Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to the United States, Jaba Ioseliani said that Shevardnadze's authority could have a decisive influence on the handling of the issue of sending UN peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia. During these very days, it will possibly be decided whether the United States and the European countries will take an active part in the handling of current processes in the Caucasian region.
