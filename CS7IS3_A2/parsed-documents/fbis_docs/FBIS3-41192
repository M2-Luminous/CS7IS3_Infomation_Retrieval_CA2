(NAN) -- The flag officer commanding Western Naval Command (WNC), Rear Admiral Jibril Ayinla, has directed the immediate withdrawal of all naval personnel attached to private jetties in the areas of operation of the command, the NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reports. Disclosing this in an interview with NAN today in Lagos, Rear Admiral Ayinla, said that the decision was necessitated by the need to re-appraise naval strategy of policing private jetties in the Western and Delta coastal areas to enhance effectiveness. The flag officer commanding [FOC] said that the current practice of stationing naval personnel to police and verify cargoes at private jetties would be replaced with naval task forces, to effectively combat the menace of smugglers, illegal bunkerers [as received] and ferrying of hard drugs. The task forces, he said, would be set up at different locations in the areas of operations of naval units where such jetties were located. Members of the task forces each of which would be under the command of an officer, Rear Admiral Ayinla said, would undertake regular patrol and conduct raids and inspection of vessels at the private jetties. The FOC said that the current move, was part of naval efforts to sustain and intensify battles against misuse of private jetties for economic sabotage and anti-social purposes, particularly as the federal government was striving to revive the nation's economy. He said that the Navy, had earlier observed that some of its personnel posted to man some private jetties were being corrupted, hence, the need to change strategy. On the state of the operational readiness of the ships in the arsenal of the Western Command, Rear Admiral Ayinla said that though most of the ships were behind in their maintenance programme, the command was going to "improvise, innovate and use initiative to make the best of a very bad situation." He said that ideally, naval ships should be taken out of water every nine months for maintenance, but pointed out that this had not been possible due to non-availability of funds. Rear Admiral Ayinla advocated increased funding of the Navy, to enable the force [to] effectively discharge its duties of protecting the nation's coastal resources, particularly oil.
