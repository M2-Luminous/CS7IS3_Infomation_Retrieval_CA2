Semenchenko: ``What Do Statistics Know?''] [Text] Out of 7,927 surveyed industrial enterprises, 12 percent exceed the permitted levels of exhaust and hazardous waste dumping. Over the past year, 30 emergency cases of waste dumping were reported, most of which ended up in the Black Sea basin. The ``Tsentrolit'' oil refinery and the pulp and paper mill in Ismail remain major contaminators of the environment. However, this cloud of exhaust has its own silver lining. The drop in production spared us 17,500 tonnes of dirty emissions into the atmosphere and some 115,000 tonnes of toxic waste. Vast damage has been inflicted by illegal logging. The growing number of hotbeds of disease and pestilence has obliterated 36 hectares of forest. However, employees of ``Odessales'' do not just sit around twiddling their thumbs. Already concluded prevention measures covered an area of 12,100 hectares--more than in the previous year. Unfortunately, there were fewer saplings planted this year. The reason remains the same: deficient fuel supplies. The oblast's 37 hunting enterprises work to protect, breed, and control the quantity of wild animals and birds. In the ``Dunayskiye Plavni'' reserve, rare species of wildlife and flora are watched and protected.
