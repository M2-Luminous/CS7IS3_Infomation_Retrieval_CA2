In a statement, Mr Terreblanche reacted to Mr Mandela's remarks on a joint Agenda/Newsline TV programme on Tuesday night that he would meet Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg. The talks would be a follow-up to last Friday's meeting with the CP leader and one with Freedom Front leader Gen Constand Viljoen. Mr Mandela said he wanted to meet rightwing leaders in a bid to address fears of rightwingers, who have strongly advocated setting up an independent Afrikaner homeland. It has been confirmed Mr Mandela will meet Dr Hartzenberg at his official residence Westbrooke about midday on Wednesday and Gen Viljoen later in the day. Mr Terreblanche's statement said the AWB wished to place on record that it had not had any discussions whatsoever with the African National Congress. "Further we have not given any person, persons or body outside the AWB authority or mandate to have discussions with any other person, party or body for and on behalf of our organisation." Mr Terreblanche said the AWB was not prepared to even consider holding talks with the ruling African National Congress unless "at the very least" the pre-condition of amnesty to all rightwing political prisoners was met. This was the only condition under which we would consider having talks, Mr Terreblanche said. Mr Mandela had said he wanted to start afresh, the AWB leader said, adding that therefore the slate had to be wiped completely before any other options could be explored. "We wish to point out that no government can oppress or banish the ideal of freedom which burns in the hearts of our people. Unless the above questions are addressed, our people will continue with their struggle until they are free."
