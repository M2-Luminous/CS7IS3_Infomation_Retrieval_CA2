The high commissioner, who was appointed at the beginning of April and had protested against the "genocide" there when he visited Rwanda last week, came to Vienna on Monday [16 May] on his first official visit abroad. Foreign Minister Alois Mock promised the 62 year old diplomat from Ecuador Austria's full support, since the protection of human rights is "an important part of our foreign policy" and the "high commissioner is, casually speaking, a product of last year's UN Human Rights Conference in Vienna." Asked by DER STANDARD how he plans to react to human rights violations, Ayala Lasso said he wants to "take a new path of seeking dialogue" with the governments concerned. If this does not help, there is still the traditional way of "pointing out and condemning violations and publicizing them."
