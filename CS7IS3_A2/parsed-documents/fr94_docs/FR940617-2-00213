FR940617-2-00213 FR940617-2-00117 In reference to Section IV.M.1., EPA will not fund construction activities such as the acquisition of real property (including buildings) or the construction or modification of any building. EPA may, however, fund activities such as creating a nature trail or building a bird watching station as long as these items are an integral part of the proposed project. In reference to Section IV.M.4., EPA will fund only environmental education projects as opposed to projects that are solely designed to develop or disseminate environmental information. The long term goal of environmental education is to increase public awareness and knowledge about environmental issues as well as provide the public with the skills necessary to make informed decisions and the motivation to take responsible actions. Environmental education enhances critical-thinking, problem-solving, and effective decision-making skills and may take place in formal or informal settings. Environmental education engages and motivates individuals, and enables them to weigh various sides of an environmental issue to make informed and responsible decisions. Environmental information provides facts or opinions about environmental issues or problems, but does not enhance critical-thinking, problem-solving, or effective decision-making skills. Although information is an essential element of an educational effort, environmental information is not, by itself, environmental education. N. What kind of projects will EPA consider funding? EPA will consider funding only those proposed projects which meet the criteria specified under #1 and #2 below. Any proposed project which does not meet these criteria will not be funded. 1. As required under the Act, all projects must develop an environmental education practice, method, or technique which meets all three of the following criteria: a. Is new or significantly improved; b. Demonstrates the potential for wide application; and c. Addresses a high priority environmental issue. EPA defined the terms ``new or significantly improved,'' ``wide application,'' and ``a high priority environmental issue'' in ``relative terms'' (i.e., applicants must define these terms as they relate to their individual projects). For example, in reference to Section IV.N.1.a., EPA may consider a project new or significantly improved if it reaches a specific community or audience for the first time, develops a new or improved teaching strategy, or uses a new or improved method of applying existing materials. In reference to Section IV.N.1.b., EPA may consider a project to have wide application if it targets a large and diverse audience in terms of numbers and demographics. It may also have wide application if it can serve as a model program elsewhere such as another school, community, state, or region. In reference to Section IV.N.1.c., EPA may consider that a project addresses a high priority environmental issue if the applicant demonstrates that a particular issue is important to the community, state, or region being targeted by the project. For example, one community may have significant air pollution problems which would make teaching about solutions to air pollution important to that community. In another community, unplanned development may threaten a nearby wildlife habitat, thus, making habitat or ecosystem protection a high priority issue. In still another community, urban decay may make education about lead poisoning from paint or lead pipes important, especially for culturally diverse or low-income residents who often live in inner-city communities. 2. All proposals must also focus on one of the following types of projects: a. Projects that improve educators' environmental education teaching skills (e.g., through workshops); b. Projects that build state, local, or tribal capacity to develop and deliver environmental education programs; c. Projects that educate members of a community through a grassroots community-based organization; or d. Projects that motivate the general public to be more environmentally conscious in making informed decisions and taking responsible actions through vehicles such as print, film, or broadcast media. All pre-applications must clearly identify which type of project, described under Section IV.N.2.a, b, c, or d above, the proposal will focus on. Note that these types of projects have been chosen precisely because they reach different audiences through different means. EPA believes that requiring you to focus on one of the above types of projects will help ensure that your proposal has a clear target audience and a well defined vehicle for reaching that audience. Although your proposal may include more than one of the types of projects described above, doing so will not likely improve your chance of being funded (unless focusing on more than one strengthens rather than dilutes the focus of your proposal). EPA's overall goal is to fund a balanced range of projects to increase environmental literacy throughout the country as described under Section VI.V.1&hyph;6. In reference to Section IV.N.2.a., the term workshop refers to training activities that better prepare educators to utilize existing or new environmental education materials. Such workshops may be directed toward young people and/or adults in formal and/or informal settings. A formal setting is a school or other similar institution devoted to learning and an informal setting includes institutions such as museums, nature centers, parks, and community centers. Workshops should emphasize the process, problem-solving, and investigative approach to learning that is a fundamental aspect of most established environmental education materials and curricula. Workshops should, in all cases, use a ``hands-on'' process approach to learning that leads to the development of problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. Workshops may be specific to a particular set of environmental education materials and may include youth leaders and other professionals who work in the environmental education field. In reference to Section IV.N.2.b., the term building state, local, or tribal capacity refers to the development and implementation of plans designed to improve the coordinated delivery of environmental education at the state, local, or tribal level. Pre-applications addressing this priority should involve a coordinated effort by the primary environmental education providers from the respective state, local, or tribal government in the planning and implementation of the project. Examples of primary environmental education providers includes State Departments of Education or Natural Resources, local school districts, and state, local, and tribal environmental education coordinating councils or associations. Examples of how an applicant may propose to build state, local, or tribal capacity includes the development of plans for: •Identifying and assessing needs as well as setting priorities for environmental education; •Creating grant programs or identifying funding sources for environmental education providers; and/or •Identifying environmental education teacher training needs. In reference to Section IV.N.2.c., the term grassroots community-based organization refers to organizations in which local problems are addressed by individuals who reside in the community being served. Section V. The Pre-Application O. What is a pre-application? The pre-application contains three parts: (1) The ``Application for Federal Assistance'' (Standard Form 424/SF 424, attached), (2) the ``Budget Information: Non-Construction Programs'' (Standard Form 424A/SF 424A, attached), and (3) a work plan (described below). To ensure your pre-application is completed properly, carefully follow the instructions on the SF 424, SF 424A, and those provided below. The SF 424, SF 424A, and the completed work plan contain all the information EPA will use to evaluate the merits of your pre-application. Applicants will not be asked to submit additional information to support their projects unless applicants are identified as finalist. Finalists will be asked to submit various other forms necessary to complete formal application.
