In the course of the next two weeks the entire apparatus will move here from Staraya Ploshchad. [Former Interior Minister] V. Barannikov's office has been given to First Vice Premier O. Soskovets, and Minister of Agriculture A. Zaveryukha has been accommodated in A. Rutskoy's former apartments. The building, which was 30 percent destroyed, has been repaired in record time. A total of 7,500 persons were involved in the restoration work, according to information given by Petr Surov, deputy chairman of the government commission. Eight foreign firms, selected on a competitive basis from 209 commercial structures which expressed the desire "not just to earn money but also sincerely to help," were involved in the whole program. For example, the Turkish firm Gamma undertook to restore the facade of the building and accomplished this within 85 days. Whereas Russian construction organizations would not agree to start the work before April. Members of the government commission officially put the total damage caused to the building at 170 billion rubles [R]. As of 1 January 1994 the state had already spent R56 billion and $50 million on the restoration work.
