France is "concerned" at the failure of a UN peace bid in Arusha, Tanzania, and "deplores the RPF's refusal not only to enter talks with the other party but above all to envisage an end to fighting," Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said. The government "reiterates its support" for peace initiatives in the region, particularly that of Tanzania, and calls on the "actors on the Rwandan stage to face up to their responsibilities" and "end the massacres," he said.
