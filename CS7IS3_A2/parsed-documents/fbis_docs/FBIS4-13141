After losing both its credibility and international reputation, and after appearing as a terrorist state that supports terrorism, the Rabin government has become nervous and upset and has begun to blame others for its impasse. When the Israeli Army's collusion with the racist settlers in committing the crime of the age at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque was confirmed, the Rabin government chose to move its political battle outside Israel. It did so particularly after its clear-cut failure to confront the escalating intifadah and fedayeen operations, represented by the 'Afula and Hadera operations. This escalation embarrassed and confused the Rabin government before the Israeli public opinion. It also doubled the Israeli opposition's activity against the government and the demand to topple it. In order to calm the onslaught of the Likud opposition and decrease the indignation of influential settlers, the Rabin government leveled false accusations against Jordan, claiming that Jordan supports terrorism, and using as a pretext a statement made by a Hamas information spokesman, during his stopover in Jordan, about the 'Afula and Hadera operations. This is despite the fact that the Rabin government is fully aware of the true principled Jordanian position. As His Majesty King Husayn said while chairing part of the Council of Ministers' session, Jordan does not recognize any organization other than the PLO. Jordan also condemns terrorism and has offered sacrifices and blood in confronting terrorism and terrorists; the blood of Jordan's sons was shed in Arab and foreign capitals at the hands of terrorists. Since the very beginning, Jordan has believed that terrorism does not make a just and comprehensive peace; on the contrary, terrorism, as King Husayn said, kills peace and foils peace initiatives. Now that the Palestinian people--who are frustrated and on the verge of despair over the possibility of achieving a just and comprehensive peace and regaining their national rights--have determined to continue their struggle and escalate their fedayeen operations and intifadah until the occupation is removed. The Rabin government itself is the party responsible for creating this frustration and despair among Palestinian circles, political forces, and organizations. Therefore, our kinsfolk in the occupied territories, as King Husayn said, are determined to continue struggle and resistance until occupation is removed. Also as King Husayn said, Jordan--which condemns and fights terrorism because it conflicts with the principles of our true religion, Islam, and with our Arab values and ideals--acts according to its own conviction, and will not accept to implement the convictions of others or receive instructions from any party whatsoever. This is because Israel is primarily responsible for the Palestinians' frustration and despair and for the escalation in the acts of violence and counterviolence.
