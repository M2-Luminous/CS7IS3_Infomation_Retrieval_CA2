The EU communique stressed: "This violence endangers the institutional order in Burundi that has been patiently and courageously established by the democratic forces of the country." The worsening of the situation in Bujumbura comes as the result of confrontation "between certain civil militia and the forces of order," the communique notes, adding that this violence had resulted in many victims "especially among the unarmed and innocent populations of the two ethnic groups." The EU appealed to all sections of Burundi society, urging citizens to stop the violence and do everything necessary to ensure national reconciliation and to maintain the security of all Burundians in the democratic order.
