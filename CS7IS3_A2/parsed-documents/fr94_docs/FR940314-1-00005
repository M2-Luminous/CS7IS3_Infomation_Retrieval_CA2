FR940314-1-00005 FR940314-1-00002 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;222&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 (CL&hyph;601&hyph;3A) Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspection to detect chafing of the wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), modification of the wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness. This proposal is prompted by a report that the wiring harness on certain airplanes were produced in a configuration that is subject to chafing and electrical shorting. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of ADG power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed during an emergency situation. DATES: Comments must be received by May, 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;222&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;222&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;222&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On August 23, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8026 (56 FR 45893, September 9, 1991), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12, and CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes. That AD requires inspection to detect chafing and modification of the wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), and repair of any chafed harness. That action was prompted by reports of chafing of the ADG electrical output harness against the backshell of the connector on the turbine generator assembly. Although the chafing occurred while the ADG was in the stowed position, when the ADG was deployed, the chafed wires shorted to the airplane structure and prevented the ADG from powering the essential bus. This essential bus provides electrical power to the hydraulic flight control system and to the essential flight control equipment. In these instances, the shorting also damaged the ADG output harness and its support structure. This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of emergency power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed. Since issuance of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, notified the FAA that the same unsafe condition addressed in AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 may exist on certain additional Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes. Transport Canada Aviation advises that, during production of Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive, the wiring harnesses of the ADG's were not modified to preclude chafing against the backshell of the connector on the turbine generator assembly. (AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 is applicable only to airplanes having serial numbers 5001 through 5098, inclusive.) Therefore, these airplanes are also subject to losing ADG power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed during an emergency situation. Canadair has issued Alert Service Bulletin A601&hyph;0370, Revision 1, dated April 15, 1993, that describes procedures for a one-time inspection to detect chafing and modification of the ADG wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness. This modification entails replacing two existing harness support brackets with redesigned brackets that would preclude chafing of the harness. The effectivity of this service bulletin includes Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131 only. Transport Canada Aviation classified this alert service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;91&hyph;21R1, dated May 6, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require inspection to detect chafing and modification of the wiring harness of the ADG, and repair of any chafed harness. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. This proposed AD would apply only to airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive.
