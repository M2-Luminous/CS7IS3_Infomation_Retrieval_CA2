FBIS4-999 "drafr075_c_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IEC on Arrangements for Voting Stations Security IEC on Arrangements for Voting Stations Security MB1904083994 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0656 GMT 19 Apr 94 MB1904083994 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 18 April] [Text] The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] met today with all security structures to finalise plans for securing voting stations. The final number of venues for voting stations will be approximately 8,200, because there can be more than one voting station at a single venue. The SAP [South African Police] have conveyed that they will be able to secure this number of venues. Certain problem areas remain, such as Lebowa, Ciskei, Soweto and Athlone in the Cape. The IEC has planned specific meetings with the regional offices of the SAP, and SADF [South African Defense Force], and local police forces where relevant. It is hoped to resolve these issues by Wednesday. The SADF will act as support to the SAP, and where the deployment of SAP forces is insufficient, the SADF presence will become more visible. The Transkei police force will be patrolling voting stations in the Transkei.
