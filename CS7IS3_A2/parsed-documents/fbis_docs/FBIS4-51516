FBIS4-51516 "dreas084__a94020" FBIS-EAS-94-084-A Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Business Leaders `Concerned' About Hata Cabinet Business Leaders `Concerned' About Hata Cabinet OW3004014594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3004014594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Business leaders are concerned about the formation of the Hata government lest the Hosokawa government-initiated "reform policy lines," such as political reform, take backward steps. Takeshi Nagano, chairman of Nikkeiren [Japan Federation of Employers' Associations], commented: "It is true that the base of the minority ruling parties' government is insecure." Masaru Hayami, head of Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives], said: "The important thing for business circles is to see the 1994 budget passed without delay." Where the budget is concerned, as the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is willing to support its passage, business circles are relatively optimistic. On other matters like taxation system reform, however, a staff official of the Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] said: "We cannot draw a picture." Ken Moroi, a vice chairman of Nikkeiren, noted: "What concerns us most are actions on international issues like Japan-U.S. relations and North Korea." He added: "The nation is now in a state of difficulty. I hope the coalition will deal with these international issues in consultation with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ. It is necessary for the coalition parties to be humble." Even as far as administrative reform, including deregulation, is concerned, Nagano said: "The SDPJ should cooperate since it was part of the team that prepared the Hiraiwa report during the Hosokawa government." Another top business leader said: "The coalition parties are basically weak; I hope they and opposition parties like the LDP and SDPJ will cooperate and tackle pending issues together." For a while after the SDPJ bolted from the coalition, there were voices in business circles saying: "The coalition parties should seek cooperation with the LDP." But since then it has been learned that the LDP and SDPJ have decided to cooperate in parliamentary operations, and business circles have not been able to follow the swift shifts and shuffles within and among the parties. Tadahiro Sekimoto, a vice chairman of Keidanren, holds a severe view, saying, "I hope this cabinet will achieve visible results within the next two months. Otherwise, it will turn out to be a short-lived government." Business circles do not like the prospect of the lower house being dissolved and the next general election being conducted under the current medium electoral district system. As such, all that business leaders are saying essentially is: "This is no time to talk about who the ruling parties are or who the opposition parties are. All of them should get together to deal with policy matters."
