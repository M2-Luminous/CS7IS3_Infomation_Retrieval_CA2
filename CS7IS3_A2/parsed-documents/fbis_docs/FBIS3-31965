They greeted him and reasserted their support for the way in which he has conducted the democratic transition process. The PS leadership reiterated its proposal for the adoption of measures leading to the prompt resumption of full diplomatic ties with Cuba. Aylwin and the PS leadership share an optimistic view of the future of Chile in view of the strength of the CPPD [Coalition of Parties for Democracy] and the projected positive social and economic development indicators. The PS leadership is headed by Camilo Escalona, who assumed his duties on 15 January. A one-hour meeting was held with Aylwin yesterday afternoon at Government House. Also present at the meeting were PS Vice Presidents Isabel Allende, Jaime Perez de Arce, and Marcelo Schilling. PS Under Secretaries Anibal Palma and Hernan del Canto also attended. Prior to this meeting, Aylwin held separate meetings with newly appointed PS Vice President Ricardo Solari and Secretary General Gonzalo Martner, who will assume their party posts in March. They are currently working as presidential under secretary and regional development under secretary, respectively. Speaking about the issues discussed with Aylwin, Camilo Escalona said they held a very cordial meeting during which they exchanged points of view about the administration's experience over the past four years. The PS reasserted its support for the progress achieved toward the consolidation of democracy. Escalona stated that the PS agreed to extend its recognition to Aylwin for his relevant role during a friendship meeting to be held after 11 March 1994. The new PS leader added that they discussed with the president the future of the nation, concern over the recession in Europe, and its possible impact on Chile. He said: "We are all reasonably optimistic about the future of Chilean politics, particularly because of the CPPD, which is an alliance that continues to govern the country in the same way it has for the past four years." The PS also discussed the party's interest in promoting specific steps toward the prompt restoration of diplomatic ties with the Cuban regime. Camilo Escalona said: "The president is now studying the issue." On several occasions the PS has stressed the need to reestablish full diplomatic ties with Cuba, which were severed by Fidel Castro's regime in September 1973 following the rupture of institutional order in Chile. The Aylwin administration has reestablished ties with Cuba at the commercial and consular levels but the PS leadership insists on the need for full diplomatic ties with Cuba for humanitarian reasons and the pragmatic nature of Chilean foreign policy.
