FR940127-2-00143 FR940127-2-00081 1. Each class of shares of a Portfolio will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and be identical in all respects, except for differences related to: (a) Certain Class Expenses, which are limited to: (i) Transfer agent fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expense of the Funds' administrator and other administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; (vii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; and (viii) organizational expenses incurred to establish a particular class of shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Administrative Plan; (c) voting rights as to matters exclusively affecting one class of shares; (d) dividend and net asset value differences reflecting different Plan Payments and Class Expenses; (e) class designation; and (f) exchange privileges. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. 2. The directors of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors will approve the offering of different classes of shares pursuant to the Multi-Class System. The minutes of the meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the directors' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of the Funds, the Portfolios, and shareholders. 3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Portfolio to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of directors, and the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. 4. On an ongoing basis, the directors, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor the Portfolios for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The investment adviser and distributor of the Funds will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the investment adviser and the distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. 5. The Distributors will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards. 6. The Administrative Plans will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 7. The directors will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Administrative Plans and 12b&hyph;1 Plans and the related Plan Agreements complying with paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
