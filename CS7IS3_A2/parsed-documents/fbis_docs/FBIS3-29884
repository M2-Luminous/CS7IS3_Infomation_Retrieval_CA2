The consortium of eight Korean companies had drilled in B-district of the mining area from Nov. 6 to Jan. 20, finding 3,419 barrels of oil and 22 million cubic feet of gas per day. The mining area is located between 70 and 110 meters below the sea, 280 kilometers southeast of Ho Chi Minh City. The Korea Petroleum Development Corp. (KPDC), Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, Lucky-Goldstar, Ssangyong, Samhwan and Daesung are participating in the project, in which Shell Co. of the Netherlands has a 30-percent interest. The discovery has significance in that KPDC participated to find oil overseas as an operator, but the area's economic viability will not be known until further exploration is conducted. If the area proves to be economically feasible, KPDC will spend 1 million U.S. dollars along with the Vietnamese Government. However, more funds and materials are necessary, KPDC officials said. The consortium will therefore start further drilling in the mining area in mid-August. The consortium signed an agreement on sharing oil from the 11-2 mining area with the state-owned Petro Vietnam Co. on May 19, 1992. The area is estimated to contain 600 million barrels of oil.
