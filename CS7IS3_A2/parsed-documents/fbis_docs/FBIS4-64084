The rejection was largely inspired by the draft's lack of a mechanism for creating an investment market in the country. The Finance Ministry has been given a week to resubmit an improved draft programme. Investment in Russia continued to decline in 1993, due to the overall fall in production, high inflation rates, and the high risk level for private investors. Despite the government's efforts to stimulate investment by cancelling the tax on profits which are reinvested, offering subsidized credits, and reassessing basic assets, the rate of decline was only slowed somewhat. In 1993, the value of investments declined by 16 per cent, compared to 40 per cent in 1992, according to the report presented to the government today by First Deputy Finance Minister Yakov Urinson. Urinson pointed out two priorities for the government investment policy. The first is the more effective use of investments provided by the state budget, with a transition away from credits "on demand" towards those given out only to the most promising enterprises after examining their business plans. The second priority stresses the formation of a more attractive investment climate drawing on funds from enterprises themselves and private investors. The Finance Ministry feels that the implementation of those measures will improve the investment climate already in 1994, and have its greatest effect in 1995. However, Urinson pointed out, overall investments from all sources into the country's economy have declined by 10 per cent in 1994. Government centralized investments have gone down by 40 per cent. The remaining funds will be directed towards easing the most serious problems. The draft presented by the Finance Ministry included the suggestions of many ministries and departments. In particular, the state construction committee suggested that a point be added to the draft about opening special accounts for amortization deductions and advancing up to 30 per cent of the yearly limit to companies working on contract. The Russian Agricultural Ministry protested that the draft did not envisage the financing of branches of the agro-industrial complex from the federal budget, whose funds are handed out only for the support of the most important sectors of the economy.
