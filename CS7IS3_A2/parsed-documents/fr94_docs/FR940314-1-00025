FR940314-1-00025 FR940314-1-00007 Mobile Earth Station Licensing The Commission proposes to license gateway and tracking, telemetry and control (TT&C) stations as fixed-satellite earth stations under part 25 of the Commission's Rules. It also proposes a blanket licensing approach for mobile user transceivers under which a service vendor would hold the authorization for a specified number of technically identical units. The Commission's proposals for earth station licensing are contained in §§25.115(d) (applications for earth station authorizations); 25.130(b) (filing requirements for transmitting earth stations); 25.133(b) (period of construction; commencement of construction); 25.136 (operating provisions for earth station networks in the 1.6/2.4 GHz mobile-satellite service); and 25.213 (technical requirements for the 1.6/2.4 GHz mobile-satellite service). The Commission requests comment on these proposals. To help maintain an interference-free environment, the Commission proposes to require an end user to obtain the authorization of the space station operator, either directly or through an authorized service vendor, before the user may transmit to that system. The Commission believes that this approach will facilitate roaming by international user while still protecting the domestic electromagnetic environment. The regulatory treatment of earth station licensees will depend upon whether they will be providing CMRS, although the Commission expects that they will. Earth station licensees that provide CMRS must be regulated as common carriers. International Coordination All space segment licensees will be required to provide the Commission with all information required for international coordination. The Commission will follow the coordination procedures prescribed by the International Telecommunication Union and will work with the global community to promote mobile satellite services through the development of sharing techniques and the exploration of other technical issues. The Commission will also require United States licensees to meet all international obligations any national requirements imposed by other licensing administrations regarding operations within their borders. All decisions relating to implementing 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS within a country's territory will remain solely within that country's jurisdiction and control. Procedural Matters This is a non-restricted notice and comment rulemaking proceeding. Ex parte presentations are permitted, except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided that they are disclosed in accordance with Commission rules. See generally 47 CFR 1.1202, 1.1203 and 1.1206(a). Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 603, this proceeding could affect the marketing opportunities of potential new service providers or equipment manufacturers, who may be small entities, in the voice mobile-satellite services. As this is a new service, the number of such small businesses is unknown. Public comment is requested on the initial regulatory flexibility analysis set out in full, in the Commission's complete decision. Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in §§1.415 and 1.1415 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 1.415 and 1.419, interested parties may file comments on or before May 5, 1994, and reply comments on or before June 6, 1994. All relevant and timely comments will be considered by the Commission before final action is taken in this proceeding. Ordering Clauses Accordingly, pursuant to authority contained in sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i) and 303(r), we hereby give notice of our intent to adopt the regulations and licensing policies described above. It is ordered that the Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (1981).
