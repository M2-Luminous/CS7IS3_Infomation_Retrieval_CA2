He rejected such concerns. Environmental protection was not a beauty contest, he said, or a football match of everyone against everyone else; so there would be winners on both sides, once the chapter on environmental issues in the membership negotiations was concluded. This is what Brinkhorst and Environment Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat stressed, who added that she assessed the environment package of December as ``gratifyingly favorable.'' Brinkhorst spoke about the changed significance of the environment, which manifested itself in the European Commission's Whitebook of December. According to this study, environmental protection was no longer considered an obstacle but was viewed as a condition of lasting economic development, as progress in the area of competition, and as a job creating instrument. Environmental protection in the European Union was a dynamic process, which in recent years had made considerable progress and in which the European Union needed Austria as a partner, said Brinkhorst. The director general, who is also responsible for nuclear safety, said that a country's decision for or against nuclear energy was not influenced by the European Union, whereas nuclear safety was a common affair. Environment Minister Rauch-Kallat cited this EU task to justify the fact that any contribution made by Austria, which rejects nuclear power in its government policy, will flow into Euratom's nuclear research.
