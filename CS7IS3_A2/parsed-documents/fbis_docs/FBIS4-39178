[Bauer] Hold your horses. Neither the Economy Ministry, nor the State Committee for Construction, nor the Moscow trade unions are in a hurry to leave the premises that are being transferred to us, thereby showing their contempt for the president's edicts and the government's decrees. In the end they even organized pickets. [Skukin] Maybe there is simply nowhere for them to go? [Bauer] All these organizations have been given sufficient space. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin promised to personally supervise their move. [Skukin] But when they finally go, will the deputies have all they need for their work, what they were so badly lacking in the former CEMA building? [Bauer] Of course, we will not achieve the conditions the old parliament had in the White House. The State Planning Committee building is a purely ministerial building; what you don't have here, for example, is the facilities to receive visitors and for deputies to relax properly. But it will be more comfortable than it was! When we get the full 28,000 square meters of space each deputy plus assistant will have a separate room measuring 17-18 square metrrs, with a telephone and internal communications. In short, working conditions are perfectly suitable for the transitional period. [Skukin] There are many and various rumors about the extraordinarily high cost of the upcoming refurbishment of the building. Would it not be cheaper to put up a new building? [Bauer] We are very well aware that the construction of a new parliamentary center would be a very expensive luxury. So we are moving here without any refurbishment, and the Duma adopted a special decision on this, for the express purpose of avoiding any misapprehension. We only had to sort out the conference hall: Install the electronics and all that is needed for work. [Skukin] But what did it cost? [Bauer] The total cost was set at $8 million. The planned cost of a new parliamentary center was around $500 million. I believe both the president and parliament will return to this question in time, because the country, of course, needs a proper, modern parliamentary center. At the moment we simply cannot afford one. [Skukin] The State Duma is accused of adopting too few of the laws everyone wants. [Bauer] More than 50 laws are waiting in the wings. They have already been scrutinized at committee level, and all the necessary consultations have been conducted. But need we be hasty in such crucial work? Anyway, the task is impossible: To adopt 200 laws in two years. It is unrealistic. Nonetheless, I believe the Duma has the potential to fulfill the hopes pinned on it by the voters. The main thing is that the documents we adopt should not be divorced from life and should be fully functional. [Skukin] But the Duma law on the procedure for media coverage of the activities of the organs of authority was seen by many journalists as a blatant assault on their right to comment freely on the power structures' activities. [Bauer] I am opposed to regulation of press activities. Anyway, you have the courts, which are supposed to be the real regulators of interrelationships. But that is something we are not used to at the moment. As a result, the press's financial dependence on the organs of power, without any law, has already made them totally subject to the executive authority. Most provincial papers are becoming toothless. I fear that the same fate lies in store for the central press. Attempts to criticize the administration are blocked by the editorial collectives themselves, worried about their survival. But I believe there must be criticism of state authority; not abusive, though. Abroad, for example, there is a very high level of criticism of parliamentarians, but there is also a high level of media responsibility. Here, social consciousness acts in one sphere only -- ferreting out the deputies' shortcomings and revealing their inadequacies. In so doing I believe journalists are demeaning themselves: The deputies were elected by the Russian people with the help of those very same Russian media. But I hope that now, with the move to what is for us a new building, we will see a new stage in the State Duma's work. And the media will not only record this in their pages but will do their utmost to promote it. [Skukin] Vladimir Anatolyevich, the president's letter commenting on the law on the status of deputies talked of certain privileges that would be unlikely to meet with the approval of voters and taxpayers. At a recent Duma session, Georgiy Satarov, the president's assistant, listed a number of privileges current deputies have which former deputies did not have. [Bauer] The president's letter was commenting on the law on the status of deputies adopted by the State Duma and, I stress, approved by the Federation Council. It is a bicameral decision, so we have a common view of all the law's provisions. Accordingly, all these norms relate to the deputies of both chambers. But the general tenor of the comment suggests that the privileges are excessive, and the criticism is directed mainly at the State Duma deputies. [Skukin] OK, but let us deal with the facts cited by the president's assistant. The status of the former deputies did not stipulate, for example, that parliamentarians should be paid for the entire term of election in the event of the dissolution of the legislative body. [Bauer] True, that norm was not in the standing orders of the former Congress of People's Deputies. But our former mentality did not even contemplate the possibility of the enforced dissolution of parliament. The makers of this law were merely reacting to the changed situation. Incidentally, we did not exceed by much the normatives for state employees dismissed in line with staff cuts or as a result of reorganization. It is a morally justified norm. A deputy was elected for two years and this became part of his life plan -- on giving up what was in many cases an important post. [Skukin] In the old law there was nothing about government-level medical services.... [Bauer] But the old deputies certainly had use of them. Anyway, why shouldn't a deputy, elected by hundreds of thousands of people, ask for the same medical services as a government official? [Skukin] According to G. Satarov, the payment of expenses for travel to Moscow is a new privilege, and if a deputy is not provided with an apartment he gets a loan in order to be able to acquire and own accommodations. [Bauer] I can definitely say that most deputies elected to represent the provinces are living in conditions that are demeaning for a parliamentarian. Knowing the practice in some foreign countries in this matter, I can say that nowhere are out-of-town deputies treated in this way. Despite the norms of the law -- the granting of official housing for a three-month period, without privatization rights -- out-of-town deputies have practically no prospect of living in normal conditions. It will soon be six months since we were elected. You get family men with children living in hotels. And anyone who has lived in a hotel will know full well that there are no conditions there for relaxation, for preparing food, for the children to do their homework. Finding ourselves in a difficult situation, we were forced to seek a solution. In my view, if a deputy were to be allocated compensation within the bounds of what is spent on a hotel and the state were to be spared the worry of housing him, it would benefit both the state and the deputy. [Skukin] Vladimir Anatolyevich, how do you see the increase in the number of deputies' assistants? [Bauer] Yes, the number has increased. But it should not be forgotten that the electoral district is three or four times bigger. There used to be seven or eight districts per million inhabitants, but now there are only two. Some deputies represent around 20 rural rayons and others were elected to represent cities with populations of 500,000 and more. Without assistants it is simply impossible to keep in touch with the people while doing a professional job in the Duma. The umbilical cord, figuratively speaking, will be cut. And that's that, the deputy is finished. Incidentally, we clearly pointed out in the law that up to five assistants were permitted, but with only one working in the State Duma and the rest in the provinces. This is not a privilege at all, in fact it is now much easier for voters to contact a deputy. [Skukin] How are events developing at the moment? [Bauer] I am impressed by the fact that the president found a mutually acceptable procedure, signed the law, but asked the State Duma to take a sympathetic view of his comments. The conciliation commission, on which both chambers and the president are represented, is now functioning. I am head of its Duma part. If we fail to persuade the president's side that the particular norms are adequate, we will incorporate the president's comments in the law as amendments. Incidentally, so far there have been no complaints about unrealistic privileges from the State Legal Administration under the president. Comments have been made mainly in connection with certain changes in constitutional norms.
