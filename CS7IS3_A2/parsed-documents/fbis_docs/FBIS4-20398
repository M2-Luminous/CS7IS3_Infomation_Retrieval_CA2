As the new tax system has now been in effect for nearly two months, all areas are reporting that it has successfully entered a state of normal operation, having made a basically smooth transition. Since the NPC Standing Committee approved the new individual income tax law on 30 October 1993, the State Council has published interim regulations on the six taxes of value added, consumption [excise], business, enterprise income, land value added, and resource. By now, except for the detailed implementation rules and regulations for the land value added tax, the application regulations and detailed application rules and regulations on the other of the six tax categories have been published and put into effect. Most recently, the State Council has issued another circular, deciding to abolish the rural market transaction, livestock transaction, cooking oil special, bonus, and wage reconciliation taxes, and to devolve authority to lower administrative levels for the animal-slaughtering and banquet taxes, showing that the major substance of China's overall tax-reform plans, particularly the reform measures on key tax categories, is in full effect. Revenue reform is the focus of China's current overall related reforms, with tax reform being the "priority focus" of revenue reform. This smooth implementation of the new tax system is providing solid grounds for the accelerated establishment of China's socialist market economy. As this tax reform is comprehensive, overall, and structural reform, involving an adjustment of the interests of every enterprise and individual, it is harder, more full of conflict, and subject to great risk if not done well. The Party Central Committee and State Council have paid great attention to this tax reform, with the State Council leadership personally guiding the work and repeatedly providing key instructions. To ensure the smooth implementation of this tax reform, tax department cadres and employees at all levels have done much work. Beginning in October 1993, tax organs at all levels have conducted training work in many forms for the large numbers of tax cadres and enterprise factory directors, managers, accountants, taxhandlers, and even sales and purchasing agents, ensuring that the majority of tax cadres and enterprises recognized the importance of this tax reform, so that they could basically grasp its key substance and operating essentials. In addition to the great attention paid to this tax reform by the Party Central Committee and State Council, it has also received much attention and support from the leadership in all areas and sectors. Many key leaders of provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and sectors gave speeches publicizing the new tax system and asking their subordinates to cooperate in its implementation. At the "National Tax Publicity Day" activities organized by the State Administration of Taxation [SAT] for 23 January, hundreds of thousands of tax cadres and enterprise accountants took to the streets under the guidance of the local Party and Government leadership, publicizing the tax laws and seeking public advice. Meanwhile, in order to implement well the new tax system and promptly resolve all issues, the SAT intensified its command and control. During the nearly two months since the beginning of the year, the SAT sent out over 60 documents and faxes of all types, as well as holding two national telephone conferences for tax bureau directors above the county level, conveying the pertinent spirit and demands directly to grass-roots tax bureaus, thus ensuring national accessibility to government decrees. Tax-reform success will be shown by several very important signs: whether it touches off price volatility and sharp rises; whether it brings stable growth or decline to revenues; whether it causes much disorder through the counterfeiting of value-added-tax special invoices and the exploitation of filled-in invoices to evade taxes; whether its impact on production is positive or negative. --As to its implementation in the last two months, the most concerning price problem is not sharp price volatility or rises due to tax reform. While the consumption tax was misunderstood by some for a time as an additional tax added onto prevailing commodity prices, thus causing brisk sales of commodities, such as home electronics, publicity and explanation brought this disturbance to a very quick end. And after the value-added tax went into effect, while some misunderstood the 17-percent non-price tax as an additional 17 percent on top of the original tax-inclusive price, repeated explanations and additional joint checkups with concerned sectors by tax organs essentially cleared up and rectified this matter. --Revenues remain in a high-growth trend. By 20 February, national business-tax revenues had reached 40.7 billion yuan, up 27.3 percent from the same period in 1993. --The implementation of the new tax system has not generally had a negative impact on production and circulation, with industrial production remaining in a state of rapid growth. Data from the State Statistical Bureau for January show our national industrial output value at the township level and above at 290.3 billion yuan, up 33.2 percent from the same period in 1993. While the widespread implementation of the value-added tax caused certain problems for a time for small-scale taxpayers and production operations, the tax sector took very quick and effective steps to improve this situation, solving the problems. --The value-added-tax special invoices were all distributed before 1 January, with no major problems in any links, such as printing, delivery, sales, or use. Moreover, we made improvements in light of realities in areas such as invoice-column design, invoice size, and anti-counterfeit markings and, according to enterprise request, added a seven-link style to the four-link style invoices. The SAT has also decided beginning on 1 May 1994 to use on a nationwide basis anti-counterfeit invoices printed uniformly by printing plants, to prevent counterfeit invoices. It could be said that all public circles and most enterprises have responded well to the implementation of the new tax system. Foreign firms with investments in China do not have added tax burdens due to the the new tax system, which has cleared up their misgivings about it. But it also needs noted that the new tax system has been in operation for less than two months, and that certain frictions will also unavoidably exist in the course of dovetailing the new and old tax systems. So SAT Deputy Director Jin Xin [6855 9515] [former SAT director] told reporters the other day that the current results are merely initial, not yet enough to state that the implementation of the new tax system has been a complete success. As many new problems and conditions have not yet fully surfaced, we need to keep cool heads to promptly study and deal with all problems as they arise. It should be emphasized that China's current tax reform is aimed at establishing a tax system suited to the needs of our socialist market economy, or one that conforms to both international practice and China's national conditions. Our reform guiding ideology is uniform taxation, fair tax burdens, a streamlined tax system, a rational division of powers, orderly distribution relations, and a standardized distribution form. While our reform plan was designed to adhere to the basic principle of maintaining the overall tax burden unchanged, the former tax-burden inequality means that the widespread implementation of the value-added tax will make it impossible for every taxpayer's vested interests to not be affected. This means that all will have to take the overall situation into account, by proceeding from overall and long-range interests to support the implementation of the new tax system, instead of driving prices up because the tax burdens of certain enterprises are somewhat heavier. It needs to be seen that as tax reform is the grounds for our establishment of a socialist market economy, so that the implementation of the tax reform and the achievement of its anticipated results will sharply speed up the pace of our establishment of a socialist market economy, a long-range view is of advantage to all.
