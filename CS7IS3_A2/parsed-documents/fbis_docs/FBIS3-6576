In the eighth round of inter-Korean dialogue, which opened in the Southern side's peace house at 10 AM, the South urged the North to agree to an immediate exchange of special envoys, noting that the envoy negotiations are merely marking time because of Pyongyang's "insincere attitude toward the contacts." In response, the North Korean delegation abruptly walked out 55 minutes after the meeting opened, leaving a cloud of uncertainty hanging over possible meetings in the near future. Chief South Korean delegate Song Yong-tae, accusing the North of hampering the envoy exchange by making four "unjustified" demands since the contacts started last October, requested that Pyongyang focus on procedural matters related to the exchange and discard all unrelated issues. North Korea's refusal to allow full inspection of a key radiochemical laboratory, believed to be a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility in violation of an agreement with the United States made in February, has aggravated the situation, he noted. "We've not much time left for negotiations and we can't say what will happen if the nuclear issue is not resolved immediately." Song then urged his North Korean counterpart Pak Yong-su to agree to a proposal on procedures for an envoy exchange made by the South at a previous meeting. Pak, saying recent developments have justified the four demands made at previous meetings, claimed the South is using inter-Korean dialogue to impede the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. "We can't help taking serious note of the South's attempt to break this working-level contact and hinder an envoy exchange while creating a new North-South confrontation," North Korea's chief delegate said. "This confrontation will eventually lead to a collision and further to a war. We're fully prepared to meet any challenge, a word with a word and a weapon with a weapon." Song then demanded that the North immediately stop slandering President Kim Yong-sam and instigating the South Korean people to struggle against the government, while expressing Seoul's determination to realize the proposed envoy exchange to resolve the nuclear issue.
