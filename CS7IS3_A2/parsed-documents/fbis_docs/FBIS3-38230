Kwasniewski insisted that "the government's priority is the development of the economy and the growth of gross domestic product. The main elements of reform are to be, and must be, continued. There is no other road for our country to reach democracy, the market economy and an integrated Europe." He described the September 1993 election victory by leftist parties as proof of the maturity of the Polish political system, and not as a rejection of the process of reform. However, the result showed that personal hopes and expectations were also important. Kwasniewski stressed that the government was seeking to maintain a very disciplined budgetary policy. He hoped that it might be possible to increase pensions and other social programmes, but only when the state had first earned the financial resources for those aims. At the moment, however, it was impossible to fund all such programmes, he said.
