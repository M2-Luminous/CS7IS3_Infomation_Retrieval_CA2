The northern forces are also on the move on three other fronts to blockade Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's stronghold of the southern port-city of Aden, and force him and his followers to surrender. Northern ground forces, including tanks and heavy artillery, were trying to reach Aden in an pincer movement from the north, along the Sanaa-Aden road, Zanjibar to the west, and Abyan to the east. The spokesman said the fighting in Shabwah, 300 kilometers (180 miles) northeast of Aden, is centered on northern attempts to capture the main city of 'Ataq, and another town, Bayhan. Al-Bid's forces are using extensive air power to check the advancing troops, including firing long range Scud missiles, the spokesman added. A defeat for the southerners in Shabwah would deprive them of Massila oil field revenues, set at 170,000 barrels per day. Massila's output is shipped by pipeline to the southern port of Mukalla. It would mean that all of Yemen's oil resources would be in the hands of Salih, since his troops already control the other key oil province of Ma'arib, 200 kilometers (120 miles) east of Sanaa. It produces 140,000 barrels per day. Elsewhere, the northern forces are trying to clear the way to the southern Al-Anad air base, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Aden, defended by more than 20,000 soldiers and militiamen. A southern military commander on Sunday said the northern troops were spotted 30 kilometres (18 miles) away from the base. In Abyan, 55 kilometers (33 miles) east of Aden, the northern crack brigade al-'Amaliqah was trying to capture the heights surrounding Aden. The brigade commander, Colonel 'Ali al-Jayfi, said his forces were between 15 and 20 kilometers (nine and 13 miles) from the southern port. The northern forces are also trying to drive their rivals from the coastal road linking Aden to Kharaz, to the west. Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad al-Basindwah, who is loyal to the president, said that the northern forces want to blockade Aden to force the surrender of al-Bid and his followers, but not to take the city, in order to "save lives and facilities." The southerners made a new ceasefire offer on Sunday, proposing a national unity government. The northern leadership has demanded that the southerners surrender before halting fighting, which began almost two weeks ago.
