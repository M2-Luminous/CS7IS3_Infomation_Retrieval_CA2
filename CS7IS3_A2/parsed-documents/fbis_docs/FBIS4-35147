According to sources in the Attorney General's Office, the attack took place at 0400 (1000 GMT) in the municipality of Mazapa de Madero, 10 km from the Guatemalan border. The rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) has its base of operations in the northwestern region of Chiapas, some 150 km from this area. Authorities have begun investigating the killing of the two immigration officials, Luis Alonso Cordova, 46, and Lindolfo de Leon Castillo, 37. After the two were killed, their bodies were burned along with the outpost and two vehicles. The authorities confirmed the area has been cordoned off since 1500 by members of the Army's 25th Infantry Battalion, which is based in the town of Motozintla, some 10 km west of the site of the attack. A placard was found near the area with a slogan painted in red: "We do not want any more clowning around with your electoral circus -- MPLN." Some 10 km from there, another placard was found with a slogan that read: "If the government does not fulfill its promises here and there, the struggle will continue -- MPLN." According to Jose Santiago Garcia, mayor of Mazapa de Madero, the attack could have been staged by groups of drug traffickers or by traffickers of illegal Central American aliens who operate in the region. The Interior Secretariat has asked the relevant authorities to conduct investigations to find those responsible for this criminal action. Up to now, the existence of this guerrilla group was not known. Authorities have been unable to confirm if the attack was carried out by guerrillas or by criminals linked to drug trafficking. Last week, the self-styled Mexican Southeastern Revolutionary Peasants and Workers Front announced its demands. It threatened to stage an uprising if it was not included in the peace talks between the EZLN and representatives of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's government.
