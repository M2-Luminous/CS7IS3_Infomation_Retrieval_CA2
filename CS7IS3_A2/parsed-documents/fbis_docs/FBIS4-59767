As such, the Army is the party to which our Yemeni masses naturally turn when they seek to hasten the inevitable end of the cheap separatists' saga, led by the war criminal 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his renegade, perfidious gang. That hope is reflected by the worthy citizens in our southern governorates rallying behind the army of legality, democracy, and unity. That all-important moral support has enabled our valiant Army to fulfill its patriotic duties with remarkable success and efficiency and score successive victories over the forces of apostasy and secession and pursue the sacred advance on the remnants of apostasy, perfidy, and treachery. The unsavory rumors spread by the gang of secession within the Socialist Party about the army of legality, unity, and democracy furnish eloquent proof of the panic with which it reacted to the support the victorious Republic of Yemen's military enjoys with the public. It is not surprising that our great Yemeni people should stand shoulder to shoulder with the courageous protectors of the homeland as they defend the sanctities of the Yemeni homeland. Just as the Yemeni people displayed exemplary sacrifice in defeating their enemy in conjunction with the military, they are now striving to rout the remnants of the enemies of legality, unity, and democracy. This courageous pro-Army and pro-unity posture on the part of our determined people has dealt a stinging blow to the gang of apostasy and secession. It was natural that the people should take such a stand, given the gang's criminal bloody record. Certain facts have now come to light and may be summed up as follows: The personnel of the Republic of Yemen's military, now engaging the secessionist gang in battle for the cause of legality and unity and democracy, hail from all the Republic's governorates, without exception. Thus, every inch of Yemeni territory is a trust held by all members of the Armed Forces. A Yemeni views every Yemeni drop of blood that runs through the veins of fellow Yemenis as if it were his own. The Republic of Yemen's military has earned the support of the entire population of the country by its loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity. Our enlightened and vigilant people are now certain that the leaders of secession in the Socialist Party stage-managed the crisis to advance their goal of scuttling the union of the country and then reinstating their terrible, totalitarian regime in the south. Monitoring the evolving crisis from the beginning, Yemenis are now certain beyond a shadow of doubt that the secessionist gang had been planning for secession for quite some time. Toward that end, they had detached some military units from the Army of the Yemeni Republic. With their rallying cries of power or death, secession or war, they had also stacked weapons and military hardware in homes and warehouses and even with some street hawkers. That was enough [word indistinct] all people with their heroic Army that has proved its true affiliation to a united Yemen, thus haunting the secessionists, who are now spreading ludicrous rumors to undercut the cohesion between the people and the Army as they push ahead with the firmness of believers to uphold the cause of unity, democracy, and legality and hunt down the adventurous killers -- the gang of apostasy and secession, who are now having to endure the disgrace of defeat. Yemen's unity shall remain a crown on the heads of our worthy citizens and their victorious army, God willing.
