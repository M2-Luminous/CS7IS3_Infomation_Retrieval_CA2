The first issue he considered necessary to emphasize was that he will not fight with his opponents by collecting compromising materials against them. Henadz Dzmitryyevich briefed on his meetings with company staffs in Brest and Kobryn. Even though high officials were trying to obstruct these meetings -- since, according to Karpenka, they had been requested to support [Prime Minister Vyacheslaw] Kebich, the talks were constructive. In general, Karpenka believes, the interests of the working class remain undefended. Which problems does Karpenka consider most urgent? The first most painful problem is the lack of housing (the candidate has his own proposals in this regard); second -- stabilization of enterprises' work; third -- reasonable reorganization of the taxation system. When the conversation touched upon the ruble zone and the agreement signed in Moscow, Henadz Dzmitryyevich quite sharply criticized eulogies published in the press in this regard, since such a campaign has only one goal -- to support Kebich. Karpenka said that the document should have been signed three years ago. At that time however, Vyacheslaw Frantsavich had a different opinion and wanted to create a "financial zoo" [relates to nicknames of the Belarusian currency] in Belarus. He has currently renounced this idea. It was not the first time Karpenka publicly stated that the Cabinet of Ministers is stuck in a political mire and neglects economic issues, which is the reason behind the current economic collapse. The Cabinet of Ministers has wasted three years on blabbing and now it is describing the signing of the Moscow agreement as an astonishing achievement. Continuing to answer the questions concerning the ruble zone, Henadz Dzmitryyevich voiced concern over the fact that the methods of establishing the zone do not conform to Belarus' interests, but are dictated by Russia's powerful economic organizations. However, as Karpenka believes, in two or three months, everyone will see that we have received another "useless scrap of paper," as has already happened before. The people have heard many sweet promises of Kebich. Where are those promises now? The presidential candidate provided examples of Minsk Oblast officials who have been neglecting agricultural problems, conducting a smear campaign against the Molodechno City Council chairman instead, which vividly describes the rotten administrative system and its immorality. Karpenka also presented his opinion on the agricultural sector. Perhaps Vasil Staravoytaw, the well known chairman of the Rassvet kolkhoz, whom Karpenka highly respects, has something to do with that. His agrarian program envisions a unique approach and advocates support for large and medium-sized kolkhozes; small ones can be transformed into farms. It is impossible to relate all topics addressed at the news conference. Karpenka provided comprehensive answers to all questions, including those concerning his family. His adversaries used to claim that he is the son-in-law of this or that secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus [KPB] Central Committee. As a matter of fact, Karpenka's father-in-law has nothing to do with the KPB Central Committee. Unfortunately, attempts to drag someone through the mire have not disappeared, but have become even more frequent. Karpenka won journalists' sympathy thanks to his openness, erudition, and ability to deeply analyze the state of affairs.
