Brazauskas, Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, Seimas [parliament] Deputy Chairman E. Bickauskas, Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas, Justice Minister J. Prapiestis, Supreme Court Chairman M. Losys, V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas National Security Committee, many state officials, and leaders of police stations in towns and regions. The criminal situation in Lithuania is complicated. The police have registered 12,848 crimes over the first three months of this year alone. Interior Minister R. Vaitekunas expressed his delight with the fact that the crime rate in the first quarter of this year has dropped by 18.8 percent in comparison with the same period last year. The situation is stabilizing. However, the number of grave crimes increased in the beginning of this year and reached a total of 2,239. The only consolation is that a large number of these crimes -- 44.5 percent -- have been solved. Criminals have used firearms 105 times this year. It is difficult to predict what will happen in Lithuania now that the official permit to buy firearms for self-defense came into effect on 1 April. Incidentally, the rate of thefts of personal, state, and stockholders' property has declined. Minister Vaitekunas' assessment of the law on preventive detention was very positive. It may be this law that helped disclose a larger number of grave crimes. For example, 75 people have been detained under this law this year. However, there is no place to hold detained people. Currently, there are 1,400 suspects in confinement cells. Jails are overcrowded with prisoners. The meeting addressed the expansion of new confinement facilities. [passage omitted] The last speaker to address the meeting was President A. Brazauskas, who assessed the work of the Interior Ministry favorably. After the restoration of independence, there were attempts to politicize the ministry. The president said that free market relations triggered corruption and led to a number of other problems in the country. The president placed emphasis on economic crimes. "We," said A. Brazauskas, "collect only about 60 percent of taxes from organizations. Private firms employ 55 percent of the population. Do they settle their accounts with the state? It is necessary to apply police measures here." Among other economic crimes, the president mentioned the "Sekunde" bank, which deceived 14,000 depositors. He also criticized self-governments that engage in politics instead of dealing with municipal problems. They should be a serious help for the police. Participants in the meeting also discussed contraband, border defense, and bribery. Successful attempts to suppress the surge of crime will depend on joint and resolute actions of all judicial institutions. This idea was voiced by all the speakers.
