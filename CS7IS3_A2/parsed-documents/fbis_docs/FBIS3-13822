This is because, among other reasons, he fears that the authorities will use firearms during his arrest. In a letter sent to his wife, Marzel asserted that he is unarmed and has no intention of resisting arrest. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that Marzel, one of the leaders of the Kakh movement, has been in hiding from the police for several weeks.
