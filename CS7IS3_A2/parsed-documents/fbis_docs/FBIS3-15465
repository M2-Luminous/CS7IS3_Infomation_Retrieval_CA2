[Stepashin] I will not take part in that, that's clear, and I'll tell you straight that the special services will not go through another such perestroyka or katastroyka [pun on katastrofa, catastrophe]. I would like to stress once again -- this is very important for those who hear me, for our colleagues -- there will be no such perestroykas. But clearly, we should try and prove our importance and constantly say that we're necessary and important, not only and perhaps not so much by public statements, but by concrete actions and putting things into effect. I think you'll hear about many of them in March. [Correspondent] Last week there was a meeting of the Security Council, and by all accounts you were given certain specific instructions for fighting corruption at the top levels of power. Could you reveal more specifically what kind of instructions these are, and is corruption really so strong that it has to be fought? [Stepashin] It's always necessary to fight it. Specific instructions were indeed given there for the organs of counterintelligence to wage a determined fight not only against corruption at the top levels of state power, which you asked about, but also against banditry. By the way, we already have a number of very serious things projected and implemented in these terms, especially for St. Petersburg. [Correspondent] In this regard, how will you cooperate with Primakov's department? [Stepashin] Just as before. By the way, we have a very good level of cooperation, especially in terms of intelligence from the territories. We are developing a general strategy. I would draw your attention to some of the things we have done recently. We have agreed to hold a joint meeting this month with Boris Nikolayevich -- that is, our service, the intelligence service, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff, Starovoytov of the Federal Agency of Government Communications and Information, and the border troops -- in order to reach agreement on closer cooperation, together with the national security adviser, and to create, if you like, a kind of prototype intelligence community.
