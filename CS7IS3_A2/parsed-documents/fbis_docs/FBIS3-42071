"Our country has been maintaining three nonnuclear principles and our use of nuclear energy is limited to peaceful purposes," Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "It is impossible for us to develop nuclear weapons," the top government spokesman said. Japan has long adhered to a policy of not possessing or producing nuclear weapons or allowing them into Japan. Takemura's comment was intended to refute reports by a British newspaper that Tokyo might alter its nonnuclear policy and opt to possess nuclear weapons. The SUNDAY TIMES reported Sunday that Britain's Defense Ministry has warned Prime Minister John Major that North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program may compel Japan to give up its nonnuclear policy. Takemura said the British Government has acknowledged it has no reason to doubt Japan's nonnuclear stand. He also denied a report carried Monday by another British paper, the independent, that Tokyo plans to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles in connection with its imminent launching of the first all-Japanese satellite-launch rocket. "I want to emphasize our nation's space development activities are strictly limited to peaceful purposes," Takemura noted.
