This follows the postponement of a date for legislation to be introduced by the Transitional Executive Council on establishing the Independent Broadcasting Authority, to allow for the submission of more nominations to the body. Mr. Schutte said earlier that the broadcasting authority would have to decide on a license for Radio Pretoria. Eleanor Momberg reports: The chairman of Radio Pretoria's management committee, Reverend Mossie van den Bergh, says that an urgent application was lodged against the minister of home affairs and the postmaster general in the Pretoria Supreme Court, in which they requested that the radio station be allowed to continue its broadcasts. Late yesterday an opposing application was lodged in court by the minister and the Postmaster General to prevent Radio Pretoria from continuing its broadcasts. The minister of home affairs, Mr. Danie Schutte, said yesterday that the radio station is contravening the Broadcast Act of 1964 by continuing its broadcasts. Reverend van den Bergh says that an agreement was reached with government legal representatives, that no action would be taken against the station until the court case had been completed. He said he regards the legal procedure as an application for a temporary broadcast license and added that the station would continue broadcasting.
