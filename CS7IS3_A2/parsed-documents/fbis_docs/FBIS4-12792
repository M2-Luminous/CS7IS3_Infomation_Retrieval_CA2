One week after adopting an amendment to a draft bill providing for the preventive suspension of publications and detention of journalists ahead of any court judgment, the government on Monday back-pedalled. It decided to scrap the restrictions and reduced by half fines proposed last week against publications which carried stories deemed libelous to the head of state and presidents of friendly countries. The respected AL-NAHAR daily said in a banner headline on Tuesday: "The government retracts: The press triumphs" -- words which summed up the satisfaction in newsrooms across Beirut. The restrictions against the press triggered an outcry in newspapers, at the press syndicate and in parliament where dozens of MPs signed a petition calling on parliament to open a debate on freedom of expression. The government also eased a ban imposed two weeks ago on private radio and television stations. [passage omitted]
