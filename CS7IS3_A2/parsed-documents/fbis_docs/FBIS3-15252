"To Ukraine's honour, it has no mounting debts concerning payments for oil since September 1, last year. Only pre-September debts remain to be settled," Shafranik said, pointing out that a joint scheme is being worked out to enable Ukraine to repay debts on time. Touching upon Ukraine's default of payment for gas, the Russian minister said "we have to take measures with regard to Ukraine just as to any other user. It is a question of responsibility between the user and supplier, not an exacerbation of inter-state relations."
