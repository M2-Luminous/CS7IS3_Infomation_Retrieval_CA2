Azerbaijan's law-enforcement bodies blocked the building after they found ammunitions and uniforms in the building's basement. The APF leadership declared that part of the building is occupied by the apparatus of the executive power of Baku's Sabaylskiy Region and announced that they have nothing to do with the discovered objects. The APF representative declared that after the Front was removed from power last summer, the headquarters has remained under actual supervision of the police and was repeatedly subjected to searches. The source expressed fear that the authorities would take the APF building situated in the center of Baku. He reported that the APF signboard was removed from the building on March 9. Azerbaijan's ex-president Abulfaz Elchibey who is hiding in his native village of Keleki in the Nakhichevan autonomous republic now is chairman of the Front. Interfax interlocutor also underlined that normal work of the Front has been paralyzed due to the fact that the headquarters building remains under police control. He reminded that the last sitting of the APF majlis was held under illegal conditions. The Majlis of Azerbaijan's Popular Front made a decision to abstain from mass actions of protest despite the authorities' attempts to draw the Front into confrontation.
