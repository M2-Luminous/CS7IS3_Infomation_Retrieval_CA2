Castillo said his party repudiates and demands an investigation of the assassination of party member Jose Federico Benitez Lopez, municipal public security director in Tijuana, and Benitez' bodyguard Ramon Alariz. [Begin Castillo recording] First, we repudiate the crime. Second, we demand a thorough investigation. Third, we appeal to the citizens of Baja California, who apparently have been selected as the target for intimidation, to behave civilly, politically, lawfully, and peacefully. [end recording] Speaking to this station, Castillo said Benitez had given information to the Special Deputy Prosecutor's Office in charge of investigating Colosio's murder and that on 29 April he planned to talk to deputies and senators who are members of the commission created to investigate the crime. [Begin Castillo recording] It is surprising, worrisome, and alarming that Benitez was assassinated the day before that meeting would have been held. [end recording] Castillo added that the violence in Mexico provoked by some groups is an attempt to create a climate of insecurity and fear in the country. [Begin Castillo recording] Cardinal Posada's assassination, the outbreak of violence in Chiapas, the kidnappings with which we are all familiar, Colosio's assassination, and now this murder all look like an attempt to create a climate of fear and terror in Mexico, which runs contrary to all civilized coexistence and the interests of those of us who are fighting for democracy from many angles. [end recording] Castillo said the people should do everything possible to defeat crime, terror, unlawfulness, and violence.
