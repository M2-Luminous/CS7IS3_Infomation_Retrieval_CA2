Hopefully we will be spared behind-the-scenes politics. I pay no attention at all to whisperings in the lobbies." So said Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, who is well on the way to making history. She is the first woman in Finland to have a real chance of becoming president -- the highest office in political life in Finland. A month ago few would have guessed that she would do well in the presidential election. Few believed this only two weeks ago, but then came the boom. Her star moved into the ascendant in opinion poll after opinion poll; she became a phenomenon. Her pet name of "Lillan" gave this boom the name of the "Lillan phenomenon." Suddenly many people realized -- and women in particular -- that there was a possibility of getting a woman placed at the absolute political summit. And this in a country where the president is not a ceremonial figure, but a person with real power, as in the United States and France. The Finnish president controls foreign policy and can do so without any interference. In the past the president alone could appoint the government and demand its resignation; now this happens to an ever increasing extent in consultation with the political parties and the Eduskunta. However, even today the president can express a wish for particular ministers. The choice of prime, foreign, and defense ministers normally happens in consultation with the president. Today the president no longer has the power to dismiss the government and dissolve the Eduskunta. The initiative must come from the prime minister. "Very different views are taken of the powers the president has, depending on who is the president. Some, in harmony with the constitution, have exercised great power. Others have not made use of the opportunities in the same way and have been relatively modest in their exercise of power," Elisabeth Rehn said in a special interview with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. Rehn has followed the debate on whether Finland should have a woman president with some amusement and puzzlement, particularly that section of the debate which has speculated that a woman would would make less use of power than a man. "Power has nothing to do with a person's gender. The way in which you use you power might be different, more feminine and softer," she pointed out, adding that she will involve more people in the different decisionmaking processes. "In today's world it is no longer possible to sit there as chief and make your decisions alone. The more people there are involved in the decisionmaking process, the better. "But the person making the decision must do so very concisely and clearly on the basis of experience," Rehn said, promising that she will do more to make use of the Eduskunta's Foreign Affairs Committee than outgoing President Mauno Koivisto and his predecessor, Urho Kekkonen, did. Rehn is not interested in any major limitations on the powers of the president. The election of the president will take place in two weeks' time, on 6 February. The choice is between nonsocialist candidate Rehn and the Social Democrats' candidate, Martti Ahtisaari. It was last Sunday that these two candidates went through to the second round in a first round which included 11 candidates. Rehn made history as a woman, as a Finland Swede, and as a representative of a small party. In the last few years her party, the Swedish People's Party, has enjoyed support of around 5 percent -- her personal support in the presidential election's first round was all of 22 percent. In the first analyses that have been published since the first round it has been claimed that her success is not due to the fact that she is a woman, but to the fact that she is defense minister -- a ministerial post she has held for almost four years. Today when many people feel unease about Finland's huge neighbor to the east most people would like to have a president who can help to create security. Rehn assumes that she is seen as a "safe [tryg] figure" who has several times referred to the uncertainty factors inherent in developments in Russia. Then there is her pro-EU [European Union] attitude, and the fact that she has always stressed the security which EU membership gives: "Not military security, but the security that comes from being part of a broader community." EU membership will be decided in the final analysis by the people. The referendum that will be arranged around a year after the results of the membership negotiations are clear is not formally binding, but Rehn considers that it is absolutely binding morally. That is why it is the people who will decide Finland's destiny vis-a-vis the European Union. Rehn's attitude to Partnership for Peace is also unreservedly positive, even though here too she does not see it as military security: "There will in no way be any changes to our defense policy, if we decide to participate in this partnership." Earlier this week the Finnish Government decided that in collaboration with the defense minister the foreign minister will investigate what Partnership for Peace will mean. The point of departure is that Finland would like to take part in the creation of peacekeeping troops, but not in possible future military actions. "This is definitely not the first step toward membership of NATO," Rehn said. Of the Baltic countries Elisabeth Rehn views Estonia in particular as important from the Finnish viewpoint. Our most important neighbors are Sweden, Russia, and Estonia, in that order," she said, without downgrading Latvia and Lithuania as neighbors in the process. "Estonia is a natural cooperation partner for us. "What Finland can do for Estonia is to reinforce its capacity to maintain surveillance over and guard its own territory and to help in the creation of commercial ties." Elisabeth Rehn does not try to hide the fact that she is where she is today because as a woman defense minister she has achieved a very prominent position in the mass media, both at home and abroad. She also admits that it would not have been so easy to get as far if she had been development aid or social affairs minister, for example. "As soon as I have done something as defense minister it is on the front pages of all the country's newspapers," she said, regretting the fact that her ability to make an impression as equality minister -- which she also is -- is not as great. Elisabeth Rehn said that as president she will be able to promote Finland in the world. In this she will be different from a male president. "A woman can exploit her gender in a different way. Sell and promote Finland in a positive way. And attract the attention Finland deserves." She also noted the commentaries in the foreign press to the effect that Finland now has a real chance. Even though she is not wild about being called "Lillan," something that only family and friends call her, or "the queen," it is something that she has had to get used to in the last few years. When she visited the United States a good two years ago, REUTER reported on "Queen Elisabeth of Finland's visit." She has also been called president and prime minister. Now she really does want to be president and sees this as an chance for Finland. "Which will probably be lost," she said pessimistically two weeks before the decisive round of voting, even though today she is leading in the opinion polls. The new president will take office on 1 March.
