FR940916-1-00118 FR940916-1-00016 Section 232.805. This section contains the operating requirements for monitoring train brake systems. FRA proposes to require that railroads develop written operating requirements for monitoring the performance of the train brake system while the train is en route. This section lists several specific monitoring activities that should be included in these procedures. As brake system sensor technology continues to improve, many more en route monitoring capabilities will become available to railroads. Procedures need to be developed to take maximum advantage of the ability of this technology to improve train safety. Close attention to the en route condition of the train brake will allow the train crew to take action to mitigate the effects of train brake system failures. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section requires an engineer to monitor the air flow rate on locomotives equipped with air flow indicators. As stated earlier, FRA encourages the use of air flow indicators on all locomotives as a means of providing additional information regarding the brake system to the train crews. Although FRA is not mandating the use of air flow indicators in this proposed rule, FRA reserves the right to reconsider the issue when drafting the final rule. Consequently, FRA requests comments on the costs and benefits of requiring air flow indicators on all locomotives, especially new or rebuilt locomotives. Section 232.807. This section outlines the operating requirements for air brakes. This section contains general requirements regarding the setting and releasing of handbrakes prior to releasing the air brake and after the air brake is charged. This section also imposes on railroads the responsibility for determining maximum air brake system working pressure and maximum brake pipe pressure. FRA plans to continue to allow individual railroads the wide latitude currently permitted in determining these pressures. Section 232.809. This section details the operating requirements for trains equipped with tread brakes. The intent of these operating requirements is to minimize the potential for thermal damage to wheels due to continuous or drag braking to counter the acceleration due to gravity when a train descends a grade. A second set of operating requirements for tread brakes is given for non-emergency stop braking. These requirements should keep the thermal stresses in wheels caused by frequent stop-and-start cycles typical of commuter operations below the threshold for the development of thermal cracks that lead to wheel failure. The maximum average brake horsepower limits were determined by research done at the Transportation System Center and are in general agreement with the guidelines provided by the AAR to its member railroads. Section 232.811. This section contains the operating requirements for trains equipped with dynamic brakes. The operating requirements contained in this section attempt to address the controversy over the role of dynamic brakes in overall train safety. Most railroads commented that dynamic brakes are a secondary system that plays no role in train safety. However, most railroads admitted that dynamic brakes are an integral part of their safe train handling procedures. For the reasons presented previously in the discussions of §§232.111 and 232.803, FRA does not plan to require dynamic brakes on conventional trains, nor does FRA plan to require that the dynamic brakes be functional if a conventional train is equipped with them. However, since railroads have become somewhat dependent on dynamic brakes for normal train handling procedures, and this dependency gives rise to the likelihood of overreliance, FRA proposes to require that railroads using dynamic brakes have written operating requirements governing how dynamic brakes are to be used to safely handle trains under the operating conditions and over the territory covered by that railroad. These operating requirements must sufficiently cover the loss of dynamic brakes or other non-friction brakes and must be fundamentally based on the use of friction brakes to safely stop a train under all operating conditions. Consequently, the railroad, in its operating requirements, can provide for the continuation of such trains to the next point where a Class 1 brake is required after an en route failure of the dynamic brake or other non-friction brake component. Furthermore, as explained earlier in the discussion of §232.113, FRA proposes to require dynamic brakes on intermediate speed and high speed trains due to the need for increased brake system retarding force as train speed increases.
