Now there are 15 kinds of newspapers compared with four in 1987. There are also 37 periodicals and 73 professional journals of various kinds and two audio-video presses. "There was no modern press industry in Tibet before liberation," said Lopsong Phuntsog, director of the Press and Publication Bureau of Tibet. Even in 1987, there were only six periodicals and one publishing house in the whole region. According to Lopsong, the regional government has used state subsidies mainly for publications in Tibet. All the presses have done well to provide sufficient textbooks for primary and middle schools. The Tibet education press is to be established within this year to better support Tibet's education. Buddhist scriptures used to be printed only in the monasteries and only in wood engravings. Now, 26 printers of various kinds have been set up in the region and all the big monasteries have their own printing houses. Laser photographic techniques used in printing have been popularized in Tibet and offset printing is gradually replacing letterpress printing. The state has made a series of preferential policies in support of the development of the Tibetan press. The XINHUA bookstores in Tibet enjoy a tax-free status. The state gives Tibet's publications industry a subsidy of four million yuan annually.
