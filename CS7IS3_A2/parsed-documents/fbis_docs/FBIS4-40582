The seriousness of the situation in central Asia and the Transcaucasian region cannot but worry the Russian leadership. The governments of Western countries should be equaqlly interested in the settlement of armed conflicts, specifically, in the Transcaucasian region, the newspaper writes. "However, quite unexpectedly for us, the West assumed a negative stand on the issue," ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA points out. According to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Buturs-Ghali, the U.N. would not object to Russia's peace-keeping efforts in the Transcaucasian region, but Moscow will not be given the status of U.N. troops. The newspaper quotes the words of Russian Deputy Defence Minister Georgy Kondratiev, now visiting Abkhazia, who emphatically refuted reports saying that the peace-keeping operation had already been started, and stressed that "the planned reconnaissance of the terrain is now under way, which should ensure the preparation of the peace-keeping operation." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA also carries a material on this subject, specifically, an interview with Gennadiy Fedosov, ambassador at large of the Russian Foregn Ministry, who believes that it is necessary to move Russian peace-keeping troops to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. "The whole experience of the conflict shows that it is impossible to maintain peace, which is shaky enough, without a peace-keeping force," the newspaper writes. According to Fedosov, Russia needs peace in Abkhazia in no smaller degree than the conflicting parties. "Another outbreak of bloodshed in Abkhazia is fraught with the threat of a dramatic expansion of the conflict. It may easily spread across Georgia's borders," the newspaper stresses. Aleksandr Livshits, head of a group of experts of the Russian president's administration, comments in ROSSIYSKIE VESTI on the president's decrees dealing with housing loans, housing certificates and the sale of unfinished apartment houses. In his opinion, the decree on housing certificates is the most important one, because it gives a chance to all those who want to buy a flat on the instalment system. "of course, additional instructions of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank will be needed. However, a way to bringing down the acuteness of the housing problem has been cleared," Livshits writes. TRUD carries a statement of the Russian union of industrialists and entrepreneurs, who express concern over the growth of crime and violence against Russian business people. "It is necessary to understand clearly that the situation is getting out of control, which means that extraordinary measures should be taken. On their part, Russian industrialists and entrepreneurs are ready to support any resolute steps of the president, the federal assembly and the government, aimed at imposing law and order and ensuring the guarantee of the individual safety of Russian citizens," the statement says. "A criminal terror has swept Russia. The presidential decree alone is not enough to put an end to it," KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes. The newspaper points out that crime is threatening today not only the safety of individual citizens, but also the very foundations of Russia's statehood. This is why society is demanding resolute actions from the authorities. "The president's decree, whether it is good or bad, is actually the only real step taken by the authorities in this direction," the newspaper stresses. PRAVDA continues to discuss the crime problem in the country and the president's decree "on urgent measures for protecting the population against gangsterism and other manifestations of organised crime." The newspaper carries an article on this subject by A.Murashev, former head of the Moscow Interior Ministry department and now deputy to the State Duma from the Russia's Choice Movement. According to Murashev, "the decree will not affect in any way the organised crime. It will affect, in the first place, ordinary business people and will become an extremely dangerous weapons for settling scores between them." Touching upon this subject, NOVAYA EZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA quotes the opinion of Issa Kostoev, chairman of the committee for constitutional legislation and judicial and legal issues at the Federation Council. He points out that "some of the provisions of the decree are obviously at variance with the Constitution and the criminal procedure code of the Russian Federation" and expresses hope that the prosecutor-general's Office, the Interior Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence Service will issue instruction, which will rule out a possibility of the abuse of power by the authorities.
