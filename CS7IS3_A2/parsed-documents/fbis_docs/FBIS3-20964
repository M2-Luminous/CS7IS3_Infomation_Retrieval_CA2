Shot-blasting, which consists of propelling small metal, glass, or ceramic pellets against the surface of metal parts to increase their resistance to fatigue, is finding wider applications. Teknoson, a new PMI (small and medium-sized enterprise) in the Paris region, has perfected a new method of propelling the pellets to their target. The parts to be processed are suspended in a metal bowl containing a handful of steel pellets. The bowl is connected to an ultrasonic generator which makes it vibrate at a frequency of 20,000 Hz. The pellets thus set in motion will impact the parts in a totally random way at approximately 20,000 times per second. Whatever its shape, the part is treated evenly. It is even possible to shot-blast hollow parts such as inlet tubing, where the shot enters through one opening and exits at the other. The depth of the process can reach 0.8 mm, depending on the diameter of the pellets, the length of processing, and the power of the ultrasonic transducer. Jian Lu, an engineer at the Cetim materials department who has tested numerous samples prepared by Teknoson, emphasized that "the shot used comes from ball bearings. It is therefore very hard and perfectly spherical. As a result, the surface condition obtained is better than the one achieved with standard shot-blasting where the particles are not always round." The technique developed by the PMI in Saint-Soupplets (Seine-et-Marne) is patented and was invented by a Russian scientist for the particular purpose of shot-blasting aeronautics parts and gun barrels. In addition to these functions, the technique has the advantage of being very economical: it does not require much shot, does not need the installation of a shot-sorting system, and does not use up much energy. Prestress shot-blasting applications are very widespread: turbine blades, compressor vane footings, springs, tubing, and so on. Furthermore, shot-blasting can be used on steel or aluminum as well as on titanium. Because of the excellent homogeneousness of the process, thin parts do not warp. To achieve the same result, standard machines must use two nozzles at the same time. By adapting the shape of the ultrasonic transducer, it is also possible to process hollow shapes such as rifle barrels. A part can very easily be partially shot-blasted if so desired. The surfaces to be protected just need to be covered with masking tape, which will absorb the energy of the shot without transmitting it to the metal. Teknoson specialists are already formulating further developments for their process. For example, by adding a powder to the bowl, parts could conceivably be plated. But in this field, everything has yet to be invented. Measuring particle velocity is one factor in predicting the efficiency of a shot-blast operation. Until now, this parameter was very difficult to establish. To solve the problem, the Wheelabrator Allevard company, world leader in steel shot-blasting, has joined Helispire, a startup company specializing in measurement systems design, who has come up with the solution: an optical process called Travel. Yves Lecoffre, head of technology at Helispire and inventor of Travel, explained that "until now, the only technique available was Doppler laser anemometry, a very complex method that is much closer to laboratory techniques than to industrial ones." Not to mention that the laser-based device is costly and must be operated by experts. At present only enterprises like Snecma have invested in such an installation. Lecoffre pointed out that "our system makes it possible to efficiently measure shot particle velocity by simple means and at reasonable cost (about 120,000 francs)." His method consists of illuminating the measurement area with a rectangular beam of white light. When a particle crosses the beam, it sends the light back to a lens that is placed perpendicular to the light beam. This lens is fitted with a mask featuring two narrow slits of different dimensions. The travel time of the reflected light across the slits gives the speed and direction of motion of the particle. Better yet, by doubling the beam through a semi-transparent mirror and adding two more perpendicular slits, two components of velocity are obtained (one horizontal, the other vertical). The Travel device thus makes it possible to measure particles whose diameter size is of the order of 0.5 mm at velocities between 1 m/s and 100 m/s with a precision of the order of one percent. A computer system collects all the results and calculates an average velocity for the particles. As is only fitting, the first shot-blaster equipped with the Travel system is in operation at Allevard Wheelabrator, but future customers have already expressed interest in a machine equipped in this manner.
