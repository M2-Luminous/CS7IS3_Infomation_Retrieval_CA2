He said: Despite the difficulties of the present period we managed to preserve our republic' main asset -- public and political stability, civil and interethnic accord. This is the cornerstone on the basis of which we succeeded in avoiding economic and political upheavals and we can confidently face the future. Maintaining such an atmosphere is most valuable and we can be proud of this. It could facilitate the process of reforms in our society. I am grateful to you, my compatriots and like-minded people, for your support. By the powers, that have been given to me by the Constitution and you, I guarantee observation of the principle of equality and liberties of all people, irrespective of nationality, religion, and social status. Kazakhstanis should not worry about their future and the future of their children. All of us have a common motherland, the Republic of Kazakhstan, and we should think about its prosperity. The current year should become one of the more important stages on this path. I wish optimism, wisdom, and strength to each Kazakhstani and each family so as to undergo all the trials with credit. Happy New Year, my dear compatriots.
