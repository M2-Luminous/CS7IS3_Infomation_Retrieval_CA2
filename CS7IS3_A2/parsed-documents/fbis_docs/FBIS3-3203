That there are serious misunderstandings and misimpressions in the U.S. as to what the real situation in China is and these are endangering MFN renewal, he said. "Americans need to hear about and appreciate the tremendous advances that China has made in recent years on human rights and to understand the improvements in the standard of living that China has achieved for its citizens," he said. China deserves to be given credit for their accomplishments in these important areas, Goodman said, as it "has, after all, managed to employ, feed and house one billion people." furthermore, "no one could dispute that the booming Chinese economy is providing unprecedented economic opportunities for its citizens," Goodman added. the council chairman argued that America has heard more through the media about the small numbers of dissidents and not from the millions of ordinary working people in China who are satisfied with and enjoying the improved living standard. "this silent majority also has a right to be heard," he stressed. he predicted the voice of the average Chinese workers, who have a stake in the MFN issue, would be even more influential to the U.S. Congressmen. to facilitate this effort, Goodman suggested a special Sino- American cultural exchange fellowship program, calling on all groups and firms concerned to finance visits by ordinary Chinese people to meet congressmen in Washington and broaden their understanding. "I am convinced that China is very much committed to improving human rights, but would do so within the context of their own social environment," he said. Goodman said he was also impressed by China's commitment to broaden and strengthen its relationship with the U.S. and to promote bilateral trade opportunities. His council would be recommending to President Bill Clinton and the U.S. Congress to grant permanent renewal of MFN for China, Goodman added. The Sino-American Trade Development Council, founded in early 1993, is a non-governmental organization which acts as a bridge between China and the U.S. to promote trade contacts and cultural understanding, especially for small businesses of the two countries.
