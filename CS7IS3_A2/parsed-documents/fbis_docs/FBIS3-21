Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-9MAR94-JAPAN MITI Moving Away From Voluntary Export Restraints In an apparent effort to demonstrate that Japan is advancing toward full compliance with GATT rules, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is reportedly moving away from bilateral voluntary export restraints on textiles and toward adoption of more fixed textile import restrictions based on the Multilateral Fiber Agreement. According to the 17 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun, MITI is currently formulating the criteria it plans to use to justify restrictions on future textile imports from China, Pakistan, and Taiwan as early as May 1994. MITI is also reportedly planning for the first time to apply dumping duties consistent with GATT rules to textile products and is, according to the 18 February Mainichi Shimbun, investigating the alleged dumping of Pakistani cotton yarn based on a complaint filed by the Japan Spinners' Association in December 1993. MITI is also reportedly considering whether to move away from voluntary export restraints in other sectors, such as automobiles and forklifts, where Japan has agreed to limit its own exports. According to the 21 January Asahi Shimbun, MITI is officially maintaining that it has not decided whether the current voluntary restraints for car exports to the United States will be renewed. However, it reportedly wants to abolish such restraints, calculating that now, when Japanese car exports to the United States are down, would be a good time to abolish the voluntary export restraints for automobiles.
