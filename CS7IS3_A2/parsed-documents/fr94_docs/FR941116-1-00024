A detailed description of the specific revisions to the regulation is contained in the Docket for this Federal Register document. Based upon the reasons stated below, EPA is approving the State's non-CTG rule for its strengthening effect on the SIP. Areas of the country which requested extensions of the attainment date for the ozone NAAQS beyond the initial 1982 target specified in the CAA, as amended in 1977, were required to submit SIP revisions by July 1, 1982 (46 FR 7182, January 22, 1981). This requirement applied to the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area. The 1982 submittal was required to include RACT regulations for all sources of VOC covered by a CTG and for all remaining stationary sources in the nonattainment area with potential to emit VOC emissions (before control) of 100 tons per year or greater (``major non-CTG sources''). This 1982 Ozone SIP revision was submitted to EPA on June 24, 1982. Among other deficiencies, the SIP did not contain regulations requiring RACT on major non-CTG sources of VOC. EPA noted this deficiency in February 3, 1983, but proposed approval of the submitted SIP revision (48 FR 5030). The State responded by committing to adopt RACT for any VOC sources covered by a CTG and EPA approved this revision on December 12, 1983 (48 FR 55284).
