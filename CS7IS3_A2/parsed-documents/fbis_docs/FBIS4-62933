Participants in the meeting discussed the main problems which caused the basic sectors to end up on the verge of stoppage or bankruptcy. Speakers opined that crediting enterprises without indexing circulating assets has not achieved anything and removed social tension only in the period of the election campaign. The directors of enterprises appealed to the government and president to place the payments made on the basis of special-purpose credits, issued in February, March, and April, beyond the bounds of 1994, and to adopt a decision to turn them into interest-free payments. Their argument was the "entirely interlinked nonpayments between enterprises", the nonpayment of wages for February, March, and April at mining enterprises, and so on. "It is precisely nonpayments which oblige one to take credits, but as a result of inflation the interest to be paid becomes several times higher than the total credit, which we were obliged to take because of the nonpayments," said Valentyn Illyushenko, general director of "Donetskvuhillya". Participants in the meeting sharply disputed information from Mykola Surhay, chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for the Coal Industry, that the plan for deliveries of coal to the metallurgists has been almost fulfilled (by 93 percent), and that "Ukraine would have enough of its own coal, and that it would be shameful to buy it from Poland." Participants observed that the plan of deliveries has been considerably understated, and that there will only be sufficient coal extracted in the Donbass for energy but not for coke and metallurgical production. National Bank Chairman Viktor Yushchenko, replying to the demands of enterprise directors to liberalize the currency market as soon as possible, maintained that the National Bank's point of view is the same as theirs. In his speech, which lasted almost one and a half hours, Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk maintained that he has a program of economic reforms "in all aspects", and that "the time has come when one can begin a new radical stage in the economy." In the president's opinion, two lines of approach are noticeable. The first is the regulation of mutual settlements. According to him, restraining the fixed exchange rate is explained by misgivings about a possible social explosion as a result of price increases. Maintaining that he has an appropriate decree, which envisions a floating currency exchange rate and the free sale of currency by enterprises (which was also proposed in the draft decree proposed by the organizers of the meeting), Leonid Kravchuk expressed himself in favor of "currency regulation by the practice of: increasing the exchange rate of the dollar by 1,000 karbovantsi every five days." "If we do not have any sharp changes in pricing, a final decision will be made without fail," the president said. Leonid Kravchuk said the next step is to decrease the quantity of goods subject to licenses and quotas. Speaking about regional policy, the president expressed himself in favor of the broadest regional independence. According to him, however, in order to implement the decree on the legal and economic experiment on four oblasts it is necessary for the Supreme Council to make approximately 20 amendments to the legislation. Speaking about the Donbass, Leonid Kravchuk expressed his conviction that "it will survive in market conditions only in Ukraine, because coal is a lot cheaper in Russia and the stores are swamped with it." Leonid Kravchuk dwelled in detail on his stand regarding the needlessness of holding presidential elections on 26 June. His arguments were supported by all the participants in the meeting. A consequence of the discussion was the appeal to Ukraine's Supreme Council on behalf of the employees of the metallurgical, coal, and coke by-product industries on the need to postpone these elections. The decision was not adopted by voting, but no one expressed any objections. The proposals and draft decree on overcoming the economy crisis, which were proposed to the president and government representatives at the meeting (UNIAN reported them in its first bulletin on 16 May) did not on the whole evoke any objections. Ukraine's highly placed officials assured the participants that these documents will be analysed in order to hold another meeting in the near future (around 23 May) to adopt them.
