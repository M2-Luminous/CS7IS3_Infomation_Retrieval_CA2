According to our information, contrary to previous promises, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will only receive four ministerial positions: The Interior Ministry, the Cultural Ministry, and the newly established ministry in charge of issues of infrastructure seem to be certain; negotiations are still going on regarding the Justice Ministry. The political state secretaries will probably emerge from the party that provides the minister too, but the other party can nominate the chairmen of parliamentary committees. Alajos Dornbach will probably be the chairman of the Parliament. After agreeing on the political guarantees of the future coalition, the issue of distributing the ministerial positions, including the personnel decisions, can no longer be delayed. Although after winning the elections, the Socialists said that, as a gesture toward their coalition partners, they will not divide up the ministries according to the number of mandates but will give 40 percent of them to the liberals (at least five ministries), no one mentions this anymore. According to our latest information, the SZDSZ can count on four ministerial positions at most, and only one of them is a really strong position. The fact that Gyula Horn will be the prime minister has been clear for quite some time. After the leading players of international politics and the big capital recognized the victory of the chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] with a spectacular gesture, the SZDSZ is forced to forget about Balint Magyar's statement that there will be no coalition under Gyula Horn's premiership, a statement confirmed by the executive body. This, as well as the position that it would be a mistake to restore the institution of minister without portfolio, something that would also require the modification of the Constitution, designed the place of Gabor Kuncze, who was professionally "sold" in the course of the campaign, as head of the Interior Ministry. The only problem here is that Gabor Kuncze is an economist, and not a legal expert. The fate of the head of the Foreign Ministry is also most probably decided. Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, the travelling ambassador of the liberals, could not even be considered, so this position will most probably go to Laszlo Kovacs, the former MSZP head of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. According to the rumors, Laszlo Bekesi will become the head of the Finance Ministry. This shows some contradiction, because if the Bekesi-program is the basis of the common government program, then Bekesi should lead the economic top ministry. And the Finance Ministry can hardly be this top ministry if, along with it, a centralized ministry will deal with the economy, a top ministry that will incorporate the current Industry Ministry, the Ministry of International Economic Relations, and the National Technological Development Committee. The privatization issue could also be incorporated here, namely the National Property Agency. The debate is still going on on whether to also incorporate the Treasury Property Management Organization into all this. The MSZP supports the idea, but the SZDSZ opposes it. There is not yet a sure candidate for this mammoth ministry but, according to our information, the MSZP would prefer Laszlo Pal in this position, but he still lacks the support of the liberals. The Justice Ministry is the other critical point. The SZDSZ candidate is Peter Hack, but the MSZP would also like to see their own man in this position, and Pal Vastagh is the person considered for this position. According to the current state of affairs, the MSZP seems to win the debate. The fate of this ministry can be important, all the more so because both parties came up with the proposal to eliminate the position of minister without portfolio in charge of the intelligence services. In that case, the civil intelligence services could only get under the control of the Interior Ministry or the Justice Ministry. However, the former could bring bad memories because of the Danube-gate scandal. If the Justice Ministry gets it, the person who gets this will obtain two ministry seats simultaneously. It is true that MSZP Deputy Chairman Ferenc Baja has also been considered for supervising the Intelligence Services, but the SZDSZ does not support his nomination. SZDSZ's Andrea Szolnoki ran for the position of welfare minister, but it is almost a fact that MSZP's Pal Kovacs will get this position. The idea of transferring social policy issues from the Welfare Ministry to the Labor Affairs Ministry seems to be fizzling away. Mrs. Kosa Magda Kovacs is the plausible candidate to head the Labor Affairs Ministry. There is full understanding regarding the Culture Ministry: Both parties support the nomination of Gabor Fodor, who changed places from the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] to the SZDSZ. The position of MSZP's Laszlo Lakos as head of the Agricultural Ministry seems to be similarly sure. There is not yet any agreement on the fate of the Defense Ministry. It will probably also remain under the control of the MSZP. Gyorgy Keleti has repeatedly been mentioned as a possible candidate. The same applies to the issue of environmental protection. The parties also discussed establishing two new ministries. One would be in charge of issues connected with European integration; the other would deal with matters of infrastructure (transport, urban development, investments, the world expo). The latter should go to the liberals, but there is not yet a concrete candidate. The MSZP is also urging the establishment of a third ministry, or more precisely a position of minister without portfolio. This would deal with national minority issues. Their candidate is Csaba Tabajdi, but the SZDSZ supports neither the position nor the candidate. The delegations have already agreed that the head of every ministry can also bring the political state secretary with him. To counterbalance the expected two-thirds MSZP advantage, Gyula Horn and his party offered the position of head of the relevant parliamentary committee to the representative of the other party. There will also be some counterbalance if Alajos Dornbach receives the position of parliament chairman. There is also agreement on the candidate for the National Bank chairman. Both parties would welcome Gyorgy Suranyi in this position.
