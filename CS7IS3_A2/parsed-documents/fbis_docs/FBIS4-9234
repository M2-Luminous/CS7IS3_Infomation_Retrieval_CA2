The Israeli minister reminded that Israel had recently established diplomatic relations with the Vatican and appreciated that as an event of the category of those occurring once at two thousand years. This model of understanding with the Catholic world could be followed by closer relations with the Moslem world, said Shim'on Peres. "The historic decision" taken by Yasir 'Arafat to negotiate the peace with the Israeli was not an easy decision to make in a world dominated by hatred and suspicion, said the Israeli foreign minister. Shim'on Peres added that Israel could not afford to remain an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty because only a new standard of living must be the answer to the fundamentalism. This is the moment to finalize the peace and not the war, said Shim'on Peres, who added further that one could not win through battles, but rather through toils in schools. The Israeli minister concluded that the "hunting season" was over and it was high time that the "creation season" should start. Shim'on Peres said he thought the peace bay was near.
