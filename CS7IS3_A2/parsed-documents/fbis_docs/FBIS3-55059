Preparation for parliamentary elections was discussed. The elections are due on February 27. Independent experts believe that Drutse's arrival in the republic at the peak of the election campaign may tangibly affect its outcome. The writer is immensely popular in Moldova, so many observers predict that he will be able to win thousands of extra votes for the centrist agrarian-democratic and social-democratic parties. IF [INTERFAX] Note: Snegur declared in a recent exclusive interview with INTERFAX that he was not going to stay neutral, and resolutely supported these centrist parties in their advocacy of state sovereignty and aversion for reunion with Romania. The opposition parties and movements which advocate reunion with Romania have been holding rallies in protest against the guilty verdict passed on a group of Christian Democratic Popular Front supporters by a court in Tiraspol. Snegur administration officials regard these actions as part of an anti-presidential campaign to charge their chief with betrayal and duplicity. The president's spokesman, Vasile Grozavu, told INTERFAX that Snegur emphatically rejects allegations that "he has kept a conflict in Moldova's east from the world public. However, it was Snegur who invited a CSCE mission to monitor the situation in the region and help to remove the differences there. In a statement released in Rome, the foreign ministers of the CSCE participant-states pledged to spare no further effort to secure a settlement. More than that, Snegur has repeatedly urged reactivating a four-sided mechanism to resolve the region's problems. The issue re-surfaced at a recent summit with Ukraine's President Kravchuk. Grozavu dismissed as improper an assertion by some media that Snegur is responsible "for an economic disaster." It is common knowledge, he noted, under what conditions the ministers were nominated and appointed in parliament and how many pledges were made by certain parliamentary factions behind the scenes and otherwise to win some ministers' approval. It was this and nothing else, Grozavu added, that prompted the president to back up the initiative to dissolve parliament and elect a new legislature with representatives of one party or a coalition apt to run the country. Grozavu reported that the president was preparing a special statement "about the conflict on the Dniester and its true culprits." "The document," he stressed, "would be a convincing response to irresponsible charges by those who are making patriotism their trade."
