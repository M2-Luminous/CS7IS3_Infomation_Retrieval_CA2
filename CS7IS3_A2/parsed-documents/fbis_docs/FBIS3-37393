He added that no extremist slogans targeting Russian military could be heard during the protest action. The organizers of the picket had warned the Tallinn base command of it in advance. Gavrilov said the pickets, which will be repeated every Monday, are "designed to put pressure" on Russian politics. He linked them with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's recent statements. "Judging by the speeches and the behaviour of the participants, it was clear they gathered in order to reassure themselves, not to express hostility toward us," Gavrilov told BNS.
