FR940617-0-00068 FR940617-0-00015 Corps of Engineers 33 CFR Part 209 Administrative Procedure_Shipping Safety Fairways and Anchorage Areas, Gulf of Mexico; Guidelines for the Industry Capability Program AGENCY: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DoD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Corps is revoking the regulations in 33 CFR 209.135 and 209.147. The regulations in §209.135 prohibit structures within shipping safety fairways in the Gulf of Mexico and prescribe certain conditions for nationwide permits issued by the Corps for temporary anchors and chains for floating or semisubmersible drilling rigs. Similar rules were promulgated in 33 CFR 322.5 and through an oversight, the rules of Section 209.135 were not revoked at that time. Section 209.147 which establish the Guidelines for the Industry Capability Program is no longer needed and these guidelines are removed. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: HQUSACE, CECW&hyph;OR, Washington, DC 20314&hyph;1000. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Ralph T. Eppard at (202) 272&hyph;1783. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Corps published rules pertaining to shipping safety fairways in 33 CFR 322.5(1) on November 13, 1986, (51 FR 41206&hyph;41260) to consolidate all permit matters under the same section. These rules replaced the rules in 33 CFR 209.135 and the Corps intended to subsequently revoke the rules in §209.135. The rules in §209.135 are duplicative and unnecessary. Pursuant to its general authorities to operate and maintain Federal navigation projects, the Corps conducted a study to determine the capability of the dredging industry to accomplish the Government's dredging work at reasonable costs and in a timely manner. The Guidelines in 33 CFR 209.147 provided uniform procedures to evaluate Corps/Industry roles over a four-year period. That study has been completed and accordingly, these Guidelines are no longer needed. The Corps has determined that notice of proposed rulemaking and public procedures thereto are unnecessary and impractical in this instance since this action will only remove obsolete materials from the CFR. Economic Assessment and Certification Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), it is certified that the removal of these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The removal of these two regulations will not have any effect on the public, any private enterprise or any Government agency. This action will result in the removal of two obsolete regulations from the CFR. Executive Order 12866: This document does not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action as specified in E.O. 12866. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 209 Electric power, Navigation (water), Water pollution control, Waterway. In consideration of the above, 33 CFR Part 209 is amended as set forth below.
