FR941026-0-00006 FR941026-0-00001 The commenter criticized OPM for using old consumer expenditure information to weight commissary and exchange prices. OPM acknowledges it is using older information. As evidenced in this final rule, however, OPM has been researching commissary and exchange usage to discern which Federal employees have such access and in which areas. OPM plans to continue and expand this research, as appropriate. The commenter assumed that employees who are paid the commissary and exchange COLA rate would have commissary and exchange access if stationed in the Washington, DC, area. He recommended, therefore, comparing commissary and exchange prices in the allowance areas with commissary and exchange prices in the DC area. Executive Order 10000 requires OPM to ``*␣*␣*make appropriate deductions when *␣*␣* commissary or other purchasing privileges are furnished as a result of Federal civilian employment at a cost substantially lower than the prevailing costs in the allowance area concerned.'' Commissary and exchange prices in Guam are significantly lower than prevailing prices. Therefore, a reduction in the COLA rate is warranted. The methodology used to calculate the Commissary and Exchange COLA rate involves the comparison of a weighted average of local retail prices and commissary and exchange prices in the allowance area with local retail prices only in the Washington, DC, area. This methodology was reviewed and upheld by the court in Joseph E. Curlott, Jr., et al. v. Robert E. Hampton, et al. and Charles R. Kester, et al. v. Alan K. Campbell. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the regulation will affect only Federal agencies and employees.
