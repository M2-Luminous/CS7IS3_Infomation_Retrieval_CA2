Applicants intend to provide a one time credit for any CDSC paid upon redemption of any shares, the proceeds of which are reinvested in the same class of shares of a Fund within 90 days of redemption. The Distributor will provide this credit from its own assets. 8. Class B shares of a Fund held for a specified number of years (including any Class B shares issued upon the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares of such Fund) will convert automatically to Class A shares of such Fund at the relative net asset values of each of the classes. For purposes of calculating the holding period, Class B shares will be deemed to have been issued on the sooner of: (a) The date on which the issuance of Class B shares occurred; or (b) for Class B shares obtained through an exchange, or a series of exchanges, the date on which the issuance of the original Class B shares occurred. 9. A given class of shares will be exchangeable only for shares of the corresponding class of other Funds. The exchange privilege will be subject to the eligibility criteria applicable to the class of shares of the Fund into which the shareholder wishes to exchange. Applicants will permit exchanges into shares of money market funds managed by Adviser, and the CDSC will not be imposed at the time of any exchange of shares into the money market fund. Applicants will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 as to all exchanges. 10. Additional classes of shares created in the future will differ from Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class Y, and Class Z shares only in the following respects: (a) Each class of shares would have a different designation; (b) each class of shares might be sold under different sales arrangements ( e.g., subject to a front-end sales load, a CDSC, or a combination of a front-end sales load and a CDSC, or at net asset value); (c) each class may bear any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan payments related to that class (and any other costs related to obtaining shareholder approval of the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan for that class or an amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan; (d) each class of shares may bear expenses determined by the board of directors to be allocated to that class (``Class Expenses''), as described in condition 1 below; (e) only shareholders of the affected classes would be entitled to vote on matters pertaining to the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan relating to their respective class of shares in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1; (f) each class of shares would have different exchange privileges; and (g) classes that impose a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee may convert into another class. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares representing interests in the same Fund might be deemed: (a) To result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g); (b) to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (c) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i). 2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Funds to meet the competitive demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multi-class arrangement, an investor will be able to choose the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks. 3. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the rule 12b&hyph;1 plans in the manner described is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, such arrangements should not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially identical. 4. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 of the Act was designed to address. The multi-class arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the Fund. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure.
