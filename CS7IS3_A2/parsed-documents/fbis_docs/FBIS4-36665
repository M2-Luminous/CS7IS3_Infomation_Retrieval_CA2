He noted that Yemen is one state in terms of land and people and that the Yemeni people adhere to their unity which is an expression of their will. In a statement to the Qatari radio broadcast yesterday evening, Basindwah noted that the secessionist gang violated the cease-fire announced by the Yemeni Government before the arrival in Sanaa of brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general. He added that this gang intensified naval and aerial bombardment of the forces of unity and legitimacy to call in international observers, something which is unacceptable. He said the military confrontation is not between sides, but between the legislative government and a gang rebelling against legitimacy and seeking secession.
