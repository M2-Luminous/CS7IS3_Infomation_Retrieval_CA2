FR940622-1-00027 FR940622-1-00009 8. Does NEPA apply to the trustee's selection of restoration alternatives? At what point is restoration planning a ``major federal action'' or ``irretrievable commitment of resources'' for purposes of NEPA compliance? Is it appropriate to postpone NEPA compliance until the trustee has received the money damages? Is it practical to combine NEPA compliance with the development of the DARP? 9. If an administrative adjudication process conducted by an administrative law judge were set up for the review of the administrative record and the trustee's demand for damages, would transaction costs be reduced from the present system? Would the trustees be forced into a disadvantage by providing all of their data and basis for decisionmaking on the record while the responsible party waited until the administrative trial to attack the record with expert witnesses and extra-record evidence? Who would bear the costs of setting up and operating administrative adjudication system? Would state or tribal trustees be required to use such a system? Compensable Values Issues Much attention has been given to valuing damages to natural resources. This attention has been directed, for the most part, at the controversial economic valuation method of contingent valuation. However, given the expense and time associated with designing and implementing site-specific studies, such as contingent valuation, natural resource trustees have turned to alternative methods for the majority of oil spill damage assessments. Two alternative methods have been included in the natural resource damage assessment regulations promulgated pursuant to the OPA: 1) the benefits transfer method and 2) the habitat or species replacement cost method. These alternatives allow the trustee to estimate compensable values or estimate damages for interim lost services at a lower cost than with site-specific studies. A third alternative may also be considered that would involve government expenditures on a resource as a lower bound for the ``value'' of that resource. Benefits Transfer: The benefits transfer method uses existing estimates of use values or of valuation functions that were developed in one context to address a similar resource valuation question in a different context. Where resource values exist that have been developed through an administrative or legislative process, or where other values are appropriate, use of these values may allow a less time-consuming and less expensive damage estimation than original valuation analysis. Habitat or Species Replacement Cost: The habitat or species replacement cost method may be used to estimate damages for lost services from the injured habitats and/or biological resources, when human services provided by the habitat or species are difficult to quantify. This method involves estimating damages in terms of the cost of obtaining from alternative services the equivalent of the resource and/or services. In order to ensure that the scale of the compensatory restoration or replacement project(s) on which the cost calculation is based does not over- or under-compensate the public for injuries incurred, the proposed OPA rule suggests that the trustee must establish an equivalency between the present discounted value (PDV) of the quantity of lost services and the PDV of the quantity of services provided by the replacement project(s) over time. Contingent Valuation: NOAA's proposed rule allows the use of contingent valuation (CV) to produce assessments of interim lost value, including lost passive use value, based on its preliminary finding that such methodology is reliable enough for use in a judicial or administrative determination of natural resource damages. To achieve the reliability necessary for this purpose, however, NOAA has proposed a set of requirements to which the studies must adhere. This proposal was based on the guidance provided by the report of the NOAA Blue Ribbon Panel on Contingent Valuation (chaired by Professors Kenneth Arrow and Robert Solow) as well as other comments submitted to NOAA. NOAA worked closely with The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) in drafting and refining the contingent valuation (CV) language for the rule and in outlining the scope of a possible CV guidance document. DOI and NOAA agreed to propose similar language for both the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Oil Pollution Act (OPA) rules, thereby providing consistent approaches to CV in the two regulatory schemes.
