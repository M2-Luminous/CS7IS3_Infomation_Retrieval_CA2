The maximum sentence for Vaticano was commuted by the Supreme Court of Military Justice (CSJM) because although it believed Vaticano cooperated with terrorist groups, he never participated directly in murders. The CSJM, which also sentenced Chavez to pay $50 million in compensation to the government, reported that it has been proven that Vaticano maintained close links with terrorists, and exerted influence on armed groups, especially the Shining Path, based on his economic power. "That allowed the Shining Path to intensify actions in that zone (the Huallaga Valley) and in several other parts of the country, with the resulting selective murders," a document released by the CSJM states. The document says Vaticano's influence reached, among other zones, the Cuchara Valley, where since 5 April security forces have been carrying out a great antisubversive offensive. The Shining Path protected the illegal airports and the landings and takeoffs of the airplanes in which Vaticano had been sending drugs to Colombia since 1990, the document states. In exchange, the drug trafficker gave the Shining Path weapons, ammunition, communications equipment, and from $10,000 to $20,000 in cash for every airplane that took off with 500 kg of cocaine. Demetrio Chavez was arrested on 28 February in Cali, Colombia, during an operation coordinated between the Colombian and Peruvian authorities, and expelled on the same day to Peru as an "undesirable."
