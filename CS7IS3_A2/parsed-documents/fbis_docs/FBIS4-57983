This solid foreign trade front faces, however, two problems that might complicate the situation. Nearly two-thirds of foreign exchange reserves today consist of short-term commercial loans that are renewable every six months. Furthermore, there has been a heavy rush to collect export revenues in advance and to delay import-related debts. This has resulted in a significant gap between accounts concerning actual shipments of merchandise and financial accounts. The actual foreign trade balance should stand at $4.9 billion by the end of May. Foreign trade balance figures, however, are expected to reach $13 billion. The $8.1 billion difference comprises commercial loans to finance imports and export revenues collected in advance. In other words, because there has been such a major increase in this financing, the figures include a great deal of exports that will not bring revenues in the next few months and imports that will have to be paid for later. As it is unlikely that commercial loans will continue to grow at the same pace as they have since the last quarter of 1993, the reserves will drop even if the level of the trade balance is maintained, which is unlikely if a fixed exchange rate is established upon the implementation of the real in July. All these figures and analyses were supplied by economist Fernando Montero of the MB Associates consulting firm. His conclusion is not catastrophic, but it serves as a warning. Irrespective of the political situation, foreign currency reserves will decelerate during the second half of 1994 because of the financial advances already reflected in the trade balance. Montero estimates that reserves currently stand at $40 billion -- an all time record. The other possible conclusion is more delicate. If Montero's figures are correct, short-term commercial loans today total $27 billion; that is, they account for two-thirds of the foreign currency reserves. These loans are renewable every six months and are obviously sensitive to the degree to which the country is trustworthy. If the presidential succession raises serious distrust regarding the debt issue, these loans could rapidly decline as happened in the past. Montero notes that the latest report released by the Central Bank (BC) on short-term commercial debt is dated March 1992. This report officially estimates that the short-term commercial debt would total $15.7 billion by December 1992. According to BC figures, short-term loans increased by $5.4 billion in 1992. This figure is quite close to Montero's estimate of $5.2 billion for 1992. Comparing the trade balance figure with the total amount of foreign currency used in foreign trade operations, the difference should account for foreign financing of foreign trade. These short-term commercial loans have increased substantially since 1991, but the largest increases began in October 1993. Exporters have good reasons for wanting to collect their revenues in advance, while importers seek to finance their costs. Montero cites three of these reasons: First, the sudden increase in real domestic interest rates. This has made it very advantageous to transform dollars into cruzeiros and to invest them on the financial market. More recently, another reason is the fear of a delay in correcting the exchange rate if, as expected, the government decides to fix the exchange rate for three or four months after the implementation of the real, or for as long as there is residual inflation. The third reason suggested by Montero is the restriction imposed last year on foreign investment in fixed-term certificates in Brazil through the so-called Annex 4. As a result of this, banks have had greater levels of funds available to finance foreign trade. Moreover, it is obvious that the international banks had the funds available and were interested in granting commercial loans to Brazil. This can be explained by the large profitability and guarantees offered by these loans. Montero's figures show there has been an increase of nearly $16 billion in the volume of short-term commercial loans since the end of 1991. This explains roughly two-thirds of the increase in foreign reserves during that same period. Montero believes the net balance of financial investment within the framework of the exchange operations market has been relatively small since 1991: $200 million in 1992; $1.3 billion last year; and $600 million from January to May. This falls short of explaining the sudden increase in foreign reserves, even if we consider financial investments and the trade balance separately. The difference between the overall commercial exchange operations and the effective trade balance (shipments) totalled $4.1 billion in 1991; $5.2 billion in 1992; and a surprisingly high $8.1 billion from January to May of this year. It is very probable that the enormous volume of export revenues collected in advance will begin to decrease as of July. Changes in the amount and type of commercial loans to be granted will depend on several factors. Before the debt crisis, the volume of short-term commercial loans totalled nearly $15 billion. By the time the creditor banks' obligation to maintain these credit lines ended as a result of the old "Project 3," which was part of the negotiations held with the banks, this volume had decreased by a little more than 50 percent. The recovery of the country's credibility in the international financial community and the extremely high profitability of these operations since then has prompted the international banks to resume granting short-term commercial loans. These loans will continue to be granted for as long as the international financial market trusts Brazil. The fact that they are renewable after an extremely short term, however, makes the situation rather vulnerable to substantial changes in the market evaluation of the risks involved in investing in Brazil.
