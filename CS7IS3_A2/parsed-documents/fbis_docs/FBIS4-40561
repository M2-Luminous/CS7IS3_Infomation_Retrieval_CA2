"The crux of the matter is that," the Vietnamese leader recalled, "the agreement dates back to the period, when the Soviet Union still existed. That is the reason today we are signing a new interstate treaty with the Russian side, renewing and improving previous accords." Vo Van Kiet did not elaborate on details of the agreement, but he noted that the principles it is based on "will conform to conditions prevailing in our both countries today." The Camranh base on the Vietnamese coast of the South China Sea was modernized during the years of war waged by U.S. forces in Vietnam. After America's retreat from Vietnam this facility was changed into a material-technical support centre for the Soviet Union's Navy. Currently the Camranh Bay is being used by Russia on the basis of the agreement signed by the former Soviet Union and Vietnam in 1981. The validity of the agreement expires in 2004. The strength of the servicing Russian personnel has been reduced to almost the one-fourth compared with that in 1980, and coordination with the Vietnamese side has been converted to commercial basis.
