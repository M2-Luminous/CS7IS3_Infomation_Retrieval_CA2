Yeltsin Prepared To Meet With D. Dudayev and Include New `Party People' in Government"] [Text] A routine briefing by V. Kostikov, the Russian Federation president's press secretary, 19 May in the Kremlin confirmed Moscow's intention to begin serious contacts with Groznyy officials. In view of the acute economic and political crisis there are indications from Chechnya of the desirability of unofficial talks with the Russian leadership. The indications are coming both from the Chechen opposition and from Dzh. Dudayev. There has been no reaction from Russian power structures so far. But B. Yeltsin no longer sees any insuperable obstacles to talks with Groznyy, and the appointment of N. Yegorov to the post of new leader of the Ministry for Nationalities Affairs is meant to step up work in this sphere. We do not yet know whether S. Shakhray will participate in the talks with the Chechnya representatives. The press secretary announced that the president has not accepted his resignation. V. Kostikov once again explained the president's position on the actions of the intransigent opposition in the shape of A. Rutskoy and his associates. B. Yeltsin is keeping a close eye on the way the "intransigents" are beginning to raise their heads, remembering the unfortunate experience of collaboration with the former Supreme Soviet. He is aware how far they might go. The events of 9 May showed that the opposition does not always engage in civilized ways of achieving its ends. So the president intends to take a tough line on any actions outside the Constitution. At the same time, as the press secretary noted, B. Yeltsin is not against all activity by the opposition, as shown by his words: "We do not want to create some kind of police state. But as far as uncivilized methods of political struggle, crime, and corruption are concerned, in such cases the authorities will take a tough line." At the end of the briefing, when I asked whether the president was afraid of Khasbulatov's returning to big-time politics (some analysts are forecasting his "resurrection," saying that he will grab power in Groznyy), the press secretary indicated that the president did not see this as a serious danger. Nonetheless, it is probable that certain changes in Moscow's stance on Groznyy are linked to this factor. I was able to talk recently on this topic with other members of the president's immediate entourage. Summing up what they said, I can construct the following scenario. Dzh. Dudayev has undergone his own political evolution. The Kremlin, aware of the need to strengthen the Federation, is now inclined to acknowledge Dudayev as the legitimate president of Chechnya and hold talks with him. There may be talks in the very near future, leading to a meeting between B. Yeltsin and Dzh. Dudayev. At the briefing the press secretary made another curious admission, citing the president's opinion (he had talked with B. Yeltsin the day before). According to him, the president intends to employ the practice of expanding party representation in the cabinet of ministers. This pronouncement should be seen as a signal, if you consider what the other representatives of the power structures said on the topic in conversation with me. Although the idea of including N. Travkin in the cabinet of ministers came from V. Chernomyrdin, the president described it as fitting in perfectly with the process of achieving accord and he is prepared to discuss the inclusion of representatives of other parties in the government. As my interlocutors stressed, this does not mean that the process will snowball and posts will be artificially made available for "party people." V. Kostikov denied rumors that S. Filatov and A. Chubays are about to resign.
