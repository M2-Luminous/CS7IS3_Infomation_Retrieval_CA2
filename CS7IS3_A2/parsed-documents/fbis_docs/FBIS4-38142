At the same time, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister, Yosi Beilin, in an interview with LIBERATION during a visit to Paris, confirmed the prime minister's statement, after having given a very positive report on Israeli-Palestinian relations. A member of the labor party's left wing, of which he is one of the most active cadres, Beilin also provides a progress report on the implementation of the Oslo agreement, of which he was one of the main authors. [Sabatier] What have you to report, one month after Gaza and Jericho gained their autonomy? [Beilin] We are very satisfied. The most important result is the significant drop in the level of violence. There may be people who want to resort to violence, and we cannot be sure there will not be such people in the future. However, the inhabitants of the West Bank are pleased with the new situation. They do not encourage those who want to violate the agreement and act against Israel. They do not provide terrorists with asylum, which has made terrorist activities more difficult than before. The people of Gaza go to the beach and to the restaurant, the curfew is over, and they feel that they can decide their future. An important change has been made. So far, autonomy has been a success. [Sabatier] Is the Palestinian police force efficient and is it cooperating well with the Israeli Armed Forces? [Beilin] I was hoping for this cooperation without being absolutely certain that it was possible. The fact that it has come is very encouraging. It proves that people accept the orders of the Palestinian police force, rather than proving the efficiency of this force. The joint patrols and committees have been very effective. The fact that we are talking to try and find solutions on the ground is one of the most important results of the agreement. It shows that, on both sides, we are capable of implementing what we have signed. [Sabatier] What are the chances for success of the negotiations on the second stage of autonomy that start on Monday [date not specified]? [Beilin] Our timetable is very clear. We must discuss a permanent solution before 4 May 1996 and implement it before 4 May 1999. I am not sure that we will be talking about the second phase as of Monday. First of all, we have to see whether the Palestinians are ready for the elections that would pave the way to complete autonomy in Gaza and the whole of the West Bank, or if they prefer to wait and implement a partial devolution of authority in just five domains out of 19. This second option would mean two levels of autonomy. That is one possibility, but I would rather there were elections. [Sabatier] Will the Israeli Army be redeployed outside of the urban centers in two months time, as planned? [Beilin] That depends on the elections. The agreement provides for this redeployment to take place on the eve of the elections. If there are no elections, we will have to decide unilaterally whether or not we will do this. The feasibility of this redeployment does not pose a problem. The decision will depend on the level of violence... [Sabatier] Negotiations for Gaza and Jericho took six months. Are you not afraid that the negotiations on the rest will not be much longer and harder, given the close proximity of the peoples? [Beilin] The hardest thing has been achieved -- mutual recognition and direct dialogue with Yasir 'Arafat. In addition, the Gaza-Jericho agreement has created a precedent and many problems have been resolved in this area. However, it is true that the geographical configuration is harder for the West Bank. [Sabatier] Will you not be obliged to settle the issue of the colonies in this stage of negotiations? [Beilin] We will only settle this issue in the framework of the final settlement. Despite the problems, the colonies will remain in place during the interim period. [Sabatier] What about Jerusalem? Will you talk about it earlier than planned? [Beilin] This will be the last point to be discussed, because it is the hardest point to settle. Anyone raising the issue now will pay dearly for it. It is better to settle the easy issues first, as we have always done in the past. [Sabatier] Last year, you mentioned the possibility of granting some form of autonomy to the inhabitants of East Jerusalem. Are you still considering that? [Beilin] Yes, but that is a personal idea of mine. We must keep Jerusalem a united municipality, under Israeli sovereignty and the capital of Israel. However, we cannot ignore the rights of non- Jewish people. From a religious point of view, there must be free access for all denominations and arrangements to satisfy them. On the political level, the Palestinians must be granted, just like the other communities, the right to administer the zones they live in and to elect representatives to a council placed under the authority of the municipality of Jerusalem and empowered to settle day-to-day issues. [Sabatier] What will happen to the Palestinian institutions of Jerusalem? Do you want to close the "Orient House" (LIBERATION editor's note: PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem)? [Beilin] That depends on what the "Orient House" is. If it serves as a community center for East Jerusalem, then there is no reason to close it down. However, if it becomes the center of Palestinian authorities for the Occupied Territories, we cannot tolerate it since this would be a violation of the agreement. [Sabatier] Will the Palestinian leaders be able to visit Jerusalem, or will they be restricted to Gaza and Jericho? [Beilin] At the current time, anyone who does not live in Jerusalem cannot go there. However, Rabin has just said this very morning that 'Arafat has the right to come and pray in Jerusalem, as he has said he wants to do, on condition that he coordinates this visit with the Israeli authorities. This is an important statement. [Sabatier] Has the date for 'Arafat's return to Jericho been decided on? [Beilin] Not as far as I know. [Sabatier] Will you accept the presence of heads of state or foreign figures in Jericho for the event? [Beilin] If it does not cause any violence or meet with opposition, why should we prevent anyone from going to Jericho on that day? However, is it wise to make such a big deal of this return? Is it not, at the end of the day, more important to make progress in the negotiations? At the moment, everyone is talking about 'Arafat's return rather than the negotiations... [Sabatier] Why do you thank 'Arafat is delaying? [Beilin] I hardly ever wonder about that, and quite frankly it is not at the top of my list of questions...
