That day, a Pacific-based electronic jamming plane of the U.S. Seventh fleet, flying above Suwon, Hoengsong and Chunchon of South Korea, jammed the areas. Synchronising with this, an "EH-60" [expansion unknown] electronic jamming plane based in South Korea created electronic jamming in the areas near the Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line with the skies above Paju and Pochon as an operational theatre. In the wake of this, formations of Japan-based VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes and pursuit-assault planes staged a drill of an intensive surprise attack on targets in the areas under electronic jamming. This reckless war game reveals the bellicose nature of the U.S. imperialists as warmaniacs.
