Our correspondent put this question to Yevgeniy Saburov, a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, and to Doctor of Economic Sciences Vladimir Remyga, chairman of the Crimean State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations. [Answer: speaker not identified] Well, first of all, I see the top-priority strategic task in the foreign economic policy sphere as determining a place for our Republic on a federative basis with Ukraine, and in Kiev's giving us economic autonomy. Full autonomy, according to the pattern of mutual relations between the governments of Tataria and Russia, and the settlement of contradictions between the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992 and the legislative acts of the former Ukrainian parliament. But once these contradictions are definitively resolved by means of talks between Crimean and Ukrainian parliamentary commissions, then we will start to implement our own foreign economic program, which the Crimean Supreme Council has already submitted to us for ratification. [Ryabushev] But talks could go on for a month, or two months, and the reforms will remain on paper only. [Answer] No, we are not standing still. One of Yuriy Meshkov's first edicts was to open a trade mission in Moscow, and treaties on economic cooperation have been signed with Tatarstan and Krasnodar Kray. Not long ago the Crimean president flew out to Cyprus. We are now preparing to sign a similar agreement with Cyprus. In addition, a memorandum has been signed in Moscow with the trade representative of Taiwan, which wants to participate in the creation of a joint, transnational, "Kerch-Taiwan" free economic zone. A working group is already forming under the aegis of an international association for the development of free economic zones. In general terms, the priority concepts of our foreign economic program are: to attract foreign investment into Crimea and technical assistance within the framework of UN international programs; to secure the establishment in Crimea of an office of the agency for international cooperation with and investment in Ukraine, and offices of corresponding Russian and UN organizations; to organize cooperation with Ukrainian and Russian trade and economic missions; to establish telecommunications links and obtain the right of access to the information systems of the Russian and Ukrainian Ministries of Foreign Economic Relations; and to secure for Simferopol a regional office of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry consular administration. We are also planning to open a Crimean currency exchange and a center for clearing accounts for making payments between Crimean and Russian enterprises, and also to sign an agreement with Russia on a single certificate of safety for our output issued by the Crimean standardization service. As soon as political passions die down, we are planning to examine a project for the construction of a bridge linking Kerch with Krasnodar Kray. In a word, as is written on our Republic's emblem, prosperity lies in unity.
