It is particularly cheerful that General Secretary Jiang Zemin has written an inscription for us: "Guiding the People With Correct Public Opinions." This is a direction that the general secretary has pointed out for us, as well as an inspiration and encouragement to us. "Guiding the people with correct public opinions" is JIEFANG RIBAO's fundamental mission and the most important task and, as an official party newspaper, we will not shrink from our responsibility. "Guiding the people with correct public opinion" is a pressing need for seizing the opportunity; deepening reform; opening up wider to the outside world; promoting development; maintaining stability; unifying the people; lifting spirits; inspiring fighting will; enhancing unity; and nurturing and cultivating a new type of socialist citizen who has high ideals, moral integrity, a better education, and a strong sense of discipline. Presently, the efforts of establishing a socialist market economic structure are storming ahead as a whole and have made breakthroughs in some key localities around China. This is a great change and it certainly requires further emancipation of minds and renewal of concepts. To guide the people with correct public opinions, we must make the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics our basic guide and uphold the principle of serving the people and socialism; this is an official party newspaper's overall display of its adherence to the principle of the party's spirit. From discussions about the criteria of truth to Comrade Xiaoping's important talk during his south China inspection tour, we have profoundly felt, in the course of running this newspaper, that the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the driving force for reform, development, and stability. We should popularize Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in a scientific, overall, precise, and lively way and with high political enthusiasm. For the fundamental interests of the party and people, media propaganda should always unswervingly uphold the party's basic line; consciously subject itself to and serve the central work of economic construction; adhere to the principle of unity, stability, encouragement, and mainly making positive propaganda; and guiding the people's attention and creativity to the overall situation with socialist modernization drive as the focus. To guide the people with correct public opinions, we should popularize, support, and promote reform in a clear-cut manner to create a good media environment for the establishment of a new socialist market economic structure. Presently, Shanghai should take the lead in setting up a socialist market economic operating mechanism, while the Shanghai people are striving for the fulfillment of the strategic goal -- becoming "a leader of the Chang Jiang valley and a financial, trade, and shipping center." We should proceed from Shanghai's new historic position and be good at discovering and summing up new things and experiences created and found by the broad masses of cadres and people in practicing reform. To guide the people with correct public opinions, we should always eulogize the main theme of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; intensify the construction of socialist civilization; improve people's quality; raise the level of civilization in cities; and promote the overall progress in the society. As a part of the mass media and a textbook for the people, newspapers should not only guide the people in acquiring correct outlooks on the world, life, and values, but also transmit messages; pass on knowledge; offer guidance on life, consumption, and entertainment; and let the style of socialist spiritual civilization permeate through every page of the newspapers, so that they will become good instructors and friends of the people. Guiding the people with correct public opinions, we should correctly play a supervisory role in a bid to carry out a resolute struggle against ill practices, bad behaviors, as well as negative and corruptive phenomena. As a party paper, we serve as a party mouthpiece and represent the people's opinions. While sticking to the role as a party mouthpiece, we should also adhere to our stance as the people's servant, reflect the masses' weal and woe, uphold social justice, play a supervisory role by using the great power of public opinion and courageously exposing corruptive behaviors and adverse phenomena that damage the interests of the party and the people and smear Shanghai's image. In this way, we can cleanse all the trashes. Guiding the people with correct public opinions, we should strive to make our paper full of life so that our readers, who are our close friends, will like to read it and trust it. The task requires us to improve our paper. In the light of adhering to the party spirit, we should pay more attention to such aspects as informativeness, knowledge, service, and timeliness. We should bring our paper closer to the masses, to social realities, and to people's daily lives by being more humanistic and warmhearted. In recent years, our paper has increased the number of its pages from four to eight and then from eight to 12. On top of that, we issue color editions during the weekend. Every year, we come up with new treats because we want to provide our readers with a paper that is high in quality, informative in content, and attractive to the people. We have tried every possible way to meet the needs of our readers and provide them better service. In the final analysis, guiding the people with correct public opinions requires a good contingent of journalists. The fundamental key to maintaining a correct orientation of public opinions lies in building a good contingent of journalists. It is impossible to have a correct orientation of public opinions if such a contingent is corrupt. It is also difficult to do splendid propaganda work if such a contingent is of poor quality. We must conscientiously carry out the guiding spirit of the National Meeting on Propaganda and Ideological Work to build a contingent of journalists that is high in political awareness, professionally competent, upright in work style, ambitious in career, and has a pioneering spirit. In this way, we can serve as a herald for the drive of reform, opening up, and economic development and provide ample and colorful nourishment for the mind. The key to guiding the people with correct public opinions lies in strengthening the party's leadership over media work. Over the past 15 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and particularly since Comrade Deng Xiaoping delivered the important speeches during his south China inspection trip and the 14th National CPC Congress, the driving forces -- deriving their momentum from the emancipation of the mind, from the drive of reform and opening up, and from Pudong's development and its opening up to the outside world -- have invigorated the Pujiang's two banks. The country's prosperity makes all newspapers prosperous. The drive of reform and opening up promotes economic development, which in turn promotes the prosperity of all newspapers. Today, as we celebrate JIEFANG RIBAO's 45th anniversary, a brand new building equipped with modern facilities is basically accomplished. At the same time, the blueprint for a modern printing center is being drawn up. Looking up to the new building, we are excited to live in this times of prosperity. We are resolute to unite ourselves, under the leadership of the municipal CPC committee; gather around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core; and, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as our basic guidance, adhere to the party's basic line, follow the right course, and correctly guide public opinion. We will seize the opportunities and accelerate journalistic endeavors. We will try our best to return our thanks to the great chances the times have bestowed on us and the great expectations our readers have had of us.
