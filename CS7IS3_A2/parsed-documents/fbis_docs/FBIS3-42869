According to official sources, Russia's foreign trade turnover was $53.0 billion, including exports--$35.4 billion and imports--$17.6 billion.) and increased by 0.8 percent as compared to January-November 1992. Russia's exports were equal to $41.2 billion and increased by 14.2 percent, including to industrially developed countries--$24.7 billion, increasing 17.0 percent; to developing countries--$5.8 billion, 56 percent; and other countries (former CEMA countries, the republics of the former Yugoslavia, China, the DPRK, and the Baltic countries)--$10.7 billion, and they decreased by 4.9 percent. In November 1993 exports of products amounted to $4.2 billion or 3 percent more than in November 1992. Exports (according to official sources) of the most important goods during 11 months of this year were characterized by the following data: Quantity Value, In % of millions of January-November 1992 dollars Crude oil, millions 74 7,670 124 of tonnes Natural gas, 83 6,337 104 billions of cubic meters Petroleum products, 32 3,175 141 millions of tonnes Hard coal 18 589 110 Iron ore and 6.0 146 83 concentrates, millions of tonnes Mineral 9.7 742 79 fertilizers, millions of tonnes Ammonia, millions 2.6 205 124 of tonnes Methanol, thousands 774 627 82 of tonnes Synthetic rubber, 133 116 105 thousands of tonnes Round timber, 10 591 130 millions of cubic meters Paper pulp, 653 163 198 thousands of tonnes Iron, millions of 2.0 204 129 tonnes Aluminum, millions 1.2 1,058 151 of tonnes Machines and -- 2,492 77 equipment The prevailing tendency in foreign trade was expansion of the scale of exports abroad of natural resources (timber, petroleum fish), ferrous metals, mineral fertilizers, and electric energy against a background of reduction of exports in a number of other commodity groups. Imports during January-November 1993 amounted to $27.4 billion, which in current prices is 14 percent less than during the corresponding period of 1992, including from industrially developed countries--$17.0 billion (a reduction of 16 percent); developing countries--$5.2 billion (an increase of 26 percent); and other countries--$5.2 billion (a reduction of 31 percent). During November 1993 $2.9 billion worth of goods were purchased through imports, or 5 percent less than during November 1992. The reduction of imports was determined by the reduction of the amounts of centralized import operations. Imports (Footnote 2) (According to official sources) of the most important goods during January-November 1993 were characterized by the following figures: Quantity Value, In % of millions of January-November 1992 dollars Grain, millions 9.2 1,323 34 of tonnes Fresh frozen 70 102 25 meat, thousands of tonnes Raw sugar, 1,660 493 79 thousands of tonnes Refined sugar, 715 285 52 thousands of tonnes Fresh apples, 44 19 57 thousands of tonnes Coffee, thousands 12 30 44 of tonnes Tea, thousands of 46 104 100.4 tonnes Medications -- 224 24 Textile clothing -- 646 80 Knitted clothing -- 238 39 Leather footwear, 13 193 35 millions of pair Ferrous metals -- 142 50 Machines and -- 5,923 48 equipment Purchases through imports of fresh potatoes, wheat flour, soy oil, leather clothing, and fur clothing decreased more than 10-fold. There was an increase in the imports of butter (73 percent), citrus fruits (84 percent), and natural rubber (2.2-fold) but this was related to the low volumes of procurements of these products last year. Russia's foreign economic ties with its main trading partners during January-November 1993 were characterized by the following data: Exports Imports millions in % of millions in % of of January-November of January-November dollars 1992 dollars 1992 Germany 5,375 102 5,981 99 China 2,900 125 1,988 135 Italy 2,958 117 1,296 48 United 1,854 309 1,868 72 States Japan 1,814 132 1,530 100.3 Great 2,007 96 807 163 Britain France 1,643 90 1,183 97 Hungary 1,538 117 613 61 Austria 1,390 239 796 89 Finland 1,452 109 592 56 Switzerland 1,358 182 653 150 The foreign trade balance during 11 months of 1993 was positive in the amount of $13.8 billion (for the corresponding period of last year it was positive in the amount of $4.1 billion). The balance of payments of Russia (not including the CIS countries) during January-November 1993 was characterized by a positive foreign trade balance and growth of foreign assets of commercial banks and state reserves of Russia: billions of dollars Trade balance 12.8 export of goods 41.2 import of goods -27.4 technical aid -2.0 Balance of services -0.5 export of services 2.5 import of services -3.0 Revenues (interest on bank credit) -1.5 receipts according to schedule 3.5 payments according to schedule -5.4 Transfers 2.5 to Russia 3.0 from Russia -0.5 ACCOUNT OF CURRENT OPERATIONS 13.2 Direct investments 0.3 in Russia 1.5 abroad -1.2 Portfolio investments 0.1 in Russia 0.4 abroad -0.3 Other investments (credits) 0.1 attracted credits 4.0 payments on main debt (according to -13.0 schedule) granted credits 0.1 revenues on main debt (according to 12.0 schedule) other capital (assets and liabilities of -5.0 commercial banks) Delays and postponements of payments on 18.0 interest and main debt Delays and postponements of revenues -16.0 from interest and basic debt ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL 0.5 OPERATIONS RESERVES -3.0 OMISSIONS AND MISTAKES -10.7 OVERALL BALANCE 0.0 PRIVATE FOREIGN INVESTMENTS. As compared to 1992 the influx of foreign investments into the Russian economy during 1993 increased, although it remained insignificant as compared to the demand. Its declared volume exceeds $400 million as compared to $290 million in 1992. The number of registered enterprises with foreign capital (PII) will approach 12,000, that is, it will be approximately double what it was at the end of 1992. The investment of capital by foreign companies did not develop in a uniform way throughout 1993. A certain increase in investments during the summer period was followed by a decline beginning in October of this year as a reaction to certain political events: although the number of enterprises registered with the RASMiR [expansion not identified] in October stayed at the September level--390, the volume of declared investments dropped almost 10-fold (from $115.7 million to $13.8 million). In November of this year 442 enterprises with foreign capital were registered, whose volume of declared investments amounted to $65.3 million. During the course of the year there was a sharp change in the ratio between investments of Russian and foreign partners: During the first half the foreigners' share of the declared authorized capital remained stable at an average of 52.5 percent. During the subsequent period (July-August) it increased significantly--to 75-80 percent, and during October-November it decreased to 36 percent. The development of the aforementioned tendencies is predetermined above all by the crisis condition of the economy and also the instability and imperfection of the legal base for foreign investments and entrepreneurial activity as a whole. As before, it is mainly small enterprises that are being created. In spite of the doubling of the number of enterprises operating with foreign investments (to 6,239 as of 1 November) their share in the volume of industrial production is reaching no more than 2.5 percent, although their significance in the sphere of foreign economic activity is growing: according to estimates, during 10 months of this year they accounted for more than 6 percent of Russia's exports and about 13 percent of imports. The activity of enterprises with foreign investments is beginning to have an effect on the solution to the problem of employment: the number of people working at these enterprises as of 1 November of this year was 274,000, an increase of 110,000 individuals as compared to the beginning of the year. The branch priorities chosen by foreign capital investors and their Russian partners largely fail to coincide with the priorities of the structural policy of the Russian government. They are drawn mainly to the sphere of services and are not adequately represented in machine building, particularly in the production of science-intensive products. At the same time in 1993 foreign investments were more actively attracted to the sphere of conversion of enterprises of the defense industry, above all the aviation industry and the production of means of communication and medical equipment. In the volume of oil production, enterprises with foreign capital account for 3 percent. In the second half of 1993 there were signs of a livelier interest on the part of foreign partners in the process of Russian privatization of state and municipal enterprises, although the mechanism for attracting them remains imperfect in this case. Foreign firms or, on their instructions, Russian legal entities purchased blocks of shares in privatized enterprises of the tobacco, food, sewing, chemical, and certain other branches of industry. As a rule, the foreign firms are obligated to make large investments in modernization and expansion of production capacities. Thus the German concern Siemens acquired 10 percent of the shares in the Kaluga Turbine Plant and in August 1993 concluded an agreement with it for cooperation in the production and sale in Russia and abroad of steam turbines with a capacity of up to 35 megawatts. The transnational corporation Proctor and Gamble intended to acquire at an open trading session 14 percent of the shares in the Novomoskovskbytkhim Joint-Stock Company, the largest producer of means of chemical dry cleaning in the CIS. Over five years the corporation has invested another $50 million in this joint-stock company in exchange for an additional proportion of the shares. The English company Illingworth Morris purchased 49 percent of the shares in the Bolshevichka factory, the largest in Russia. The firm is investing 3.64 million pounds sterling in technology, personnel training, and licensing. The Swiss firm Nordwest AG has acquired 20 percent of the shares in the Cherepovets Amofos Joint-Stock Company and has made a commitment to invest about $8 million in this enterprise. The entry of foreign banks and insurance companies into the Russian financial market became more active in 1993. On 27 September of this year the president of the Russian Federation issued Edict No. 1466 "On Improvement of Work with Foreign Investments." The edict earmarks a program of measures for stabilization of the legal situation of foreign investors, considerable improvement of the activity of federal administrative organs in this sphere, the development and adoption of state programs for stimulating an influx of foreign capital into priority branches, and so forth. Thus real preconditions are being created for a marked improvement of the Russian investment climate. Preparations are being completed on proposals for making changes and additions to the Law "On Foreign Investments in the RSFSR" and the Laws "On Concessions" and "On Free Economic Zones." It should be emphasized that against the background of the overall decline of industrial production in the country, many enterprises with foreign capital managed to increase their production in 1993. Thus during the first three quarters of this year as compared to the corresponding period of last year they increased production as follows: oil (including gas condensate)--1.9-fold, secondary aluminum--twofold, and steel--43 percent. There was a significant increase in the volume of production of a number of consumer goods, especially sewn and knitted items. At the same time the output of footwear and fabrics decreased. There was a marked increase in the production of bakery items, meat and sausage items, and frozen fish. At the same time the decline in production in machine building did not bypass enterprises with foreign capital: the production of trailers for motor vehicles did not increase. In 1993 there was an appreciable increase in the output of personal computers--2.8-fold. The influx of foreign investments into the Russian economy is modest in scale and clearly does not correspond to the potential demand for them or the capabilities of the world investment market, where competition from other capital recipient countries is becoming stiffer. The RUBLE EXCHANGE RATE, which is established according to results of trading at the MMVB [Moscow International Foreign Currency Exchange], after stabilization during the first 10 days of November, began to drop gradually and by the beginning of December amounted to 1,231 rubles per U.S. dollar as compared to 1,181 rubles at the beginning of November. The demand for foreign currency exceeded the supply, which brought about a reduction of the ruble exchange rate. The volume of sales for November exceeded 1.6 billion rubles and increased by 29.5 percent as compared to October. By the end of the year a certain increase in the ruble exchange rate is expected in connection with the end of the fiscal year, which is confirmed by trading at the beginning of December. Dynamics of ruble exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar and evaluation of parity buying power of the ruble compared to the U.S. dollar 1990 1991 1992 1993* Ruble exchange 0.58 0.58 192.50 1,000.0 rate Parity 0.5 1.17 20.00 190.0 Growth rate of exchange rate of ruble parity and deflator (1990 = 1) 1990 1991 1992 1993* Ruble exchange 1.0 1.0 332.0 1,724.0 rate Parity 1.0 2.3 40.0 380.0 Deflator of GNP 1.0 2.3 39.6 395.6 of Russia *Predicted The figures for 1992-1993 show parity of buying power is coming closer to the ruble exchange rate. The ruble exchange rate was 9.5 times greater than the parity of buying power in 1992, and in 1993--5.3 times greater. FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH NEARBY FOREIGN COUNTRIES. This year, as in preceding years, mutual deliveries are not providing for the fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements. Still suppliers of the Russian Federation are fulfilling their commitments to their partners in nearby foreign countries at a higher level. The dispatch of fuel resources, the main commodity exported from Russia, during 11 months of this year amounted to 65-90 percent of the annual volumes. Coal delivery was ahead of schedule (160 percent). Deliveries from Russia to CIS countries were fulfilled during the 10 months of this year for oil--by 63 percent, gas--73 percent, gasoline--84 percent, diesel fuel--58 percent, and furnace fuel--71 percent. Deliveries of meat, cooking salt, and sugar from the Ukraine were fulfilled during this period at a level of 12-52 percent. Delivery shortfalls of MAZ and BelAZ trucks from Belarus amounted to 40 percent, and meat and meat products--44 percent. Of the 3 million tonnes of grain envisioned under the agreement, Kazakhstan delivered more than 800,000 tonnes and there were considerable shortfalls in the deliveries of wool, synthetic fibers, and nonferrous metals. During the aforementioned period the cotton growing republics of Central Asia delivered to enterprises of Russia 60 percent of the amount of cotton fiber (about 500,000 tonnes) that was supposed to be delivered on a mutually coordinated basis. In certain cases the delivery shortfalls were caused by the refusal of Russian enterprises to purchase products from nearby foreign countries because of the excessively high prices for them. The regulation of mutual settlements and payments is of decisive significance for the development of economic relations with CIS countries. The indebtedness of the CIS countries on state credit granted to them by Russia exceeds the Russian debt by 2.3 trillion rubles (approximately $5 billion). Moreover, the debt of enterprises and organizations of the CIS countries for goods and services received (according to figures as of the beginning of November 1993) exceeds creditor indebtedness by 3.5 trillion rubles. Of this sum, 1.5 trillion rubles is from indebtedness to enterprises of the fuel and energy complex.
