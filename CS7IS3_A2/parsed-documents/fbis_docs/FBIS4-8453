If the man ousted from the Slovak premiership by a March no-confidence vote were to become premier again, it "would only serve to strengthen Meciar's exceptional, almost superhuman abilities," Kovac said in an interview on the programme "21". Meciar's style, methods and means had threatened Slovakia's interests. He had not managed to solve economic problems which in normal circumstances could have been solved, Kovac said. "We were aware citizens were losing faith in politics and public servants, people's dissatisfaction was growing and ideas were entering their heads of the need for a strong hand and an authoritarian regime -- ideas far from the democratic style of government," he said. Most of the original supporters of Meciar's party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), and many members of parliament had realized the danger and harmfulness of Meciar's ways, Kovac said.
