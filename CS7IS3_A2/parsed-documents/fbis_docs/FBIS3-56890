ITAR-TASS learnt at the press centre of the space military forces that the launching was successful. The satellite was developed by the applied mechanics scientific and production amalgamation (Krasnoyarsk-26) under the guidance of chief designer and general manager Mikhail Reshetnev. The launching pioneers a system of direct space TV broadcasting, which will consist of five "Gals" satellites, for all information space of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The satellite is equipped with a three-segment onboard relay which will ensure for the first time the reception of regional TV broadcasting with small-size individual antennae with a diameter 0.6-0.9 meters over individual Russian regions. The satellite weighs 2.5 tonnes and will operate for five or seven years in orbit. The satellite will be put into orbit close to geostationary at a point 90 degrees of eastern longitude some seven hours after the launching. Following this, it will be brought to the point of "stationing" 44 degrees eastern longitude where it will be used for the assigned mission. The "Gals" satellite is the first unmanned spacecraft blasted off by Russia this year.
