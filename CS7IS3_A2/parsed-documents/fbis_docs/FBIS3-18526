This criticism, however, is only partly justified. Although the GNP of the United States grew by almost 3 percent in 1993, and although some 2 million jobs were created in 1993 and the unemployment rate, computed according to a new method, dropped to 6.7 percent in January, the much-praised U.S. "job machine" runs below capacity. In the United States, as in Europe, for some time there has been discussion on economic growth without additional employment. The leverage of growth on employment is not as great by far as in former phases of upswing. The Institute of German Economy recently calculated that in the U.S. economy overall, 7 percent growth of the GDP between 1991 and 1993 had brought about 3 percent more employment, while in the economic boom of 1983-1985, a 14.6-percent growth rate had still yielded a 9.6-percent employment increase. The reason for growth without employment increase--which occurs primarily in industry--lies in the slimming down of U.S. enterprises, forced by tough international competition. This applies above all to the automobile industry, machine and systems building, and the electrical engineering industry. New jobs are being created primarily in the service sector, in software and engineering offices, in social services, and in low-paying jobs such as parking lot and movie attendants. U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich would like to counter the "slimming down strategy" of enterprises with a qualification strategy and a reintegration program for the growing number of long-term unemployed. Millions of Exchange Proceedings Professor Dr. Horst Siebert, president of the Kiel Institute for World Economy, has furnished proof of the phenomenon of solidifying unemployment in the FRG. According to his calculations, the unemployment base (see HANDELSBLATT of 14 Dec 1993) has grown by 700,000 and 830,000 persons, respectively, during the last two recessions. Siebert predicts that an economic upswing will hardly improve the situation on the labor market. For the period 1970 to 1989, Siebert has found that employment rose only if the growth rate of the GDP went above the 1.7 percent mark. Even if economic growth were to approach 3 percent, it would not solve the problem of a solidifying unemployment. However, it is misleading to speak of an "unemployment base" rising with every cycle. Behind the unemployment figures, year after year there are movements into and out of unemployment by the millions. According to computations by the Federal Labor Office, in the course of 1993 there was a total of 6,574,300 unemployed. This number consists of those unemployed at the beginning of the year and those who became unemployede during the year. At the end of 1993, there was still a core of 2,513,700 unemployed. On the supply side, there is a similarly strong movement, albeit on a clearly lower level. In 1992, the average unemployment period in western Germany came to 24.7 weeks. When employment problems grow overall, they hit older people considerably harder than younger ones. In 1993, the unemployment rate for younger people (up to 25 years of age), was 14.1 percent, while for older persons (50 to 65 years of age) it was 30.5 percent. Although the number of long-term unemployed (one year or longer) in 1993 in western Germany reached its highest point since 1988 with 594,099, the ratio of the long-term unemployed at 26.2 percent remained constant compared to 1992 figures. Costs Must Come Down Measures of an active labor market policy, such as promotion of extended occupational training, occupational rehabilitation, general job creation measures (ABM), and employment assistance for the long-term unemployed contribute considerably to countering structural discrepancies and improving the balance between supply and demand on the labor market. They ease the labor market, and build a bridge for many out of unemployment into jobs. This also applies to the employment promotion law which has facilitated the conclusion of time-limited employment contracts (see HANDELSBLATT of 16 Feb 1994). But labor market policy measures and increased part-time work try to cure the symptoms of stagnating and decreasing employment rather than improving the preconditions for employment-intensive growth. The key to closing the workplace gap lies in improving the supply conditions in industry, in lowering costs, in tax and levy reductions, and a restrained wage policy better differentiated according to sectors, regions, and occupations. The Council of Experts, the research institutes and the German Bundesbank time and again have pointed out this correlation. To the lack of differentiated wage structures are added inflexibilities and incrustations due to institutional regulations which also raise the entry threshold into the labor market. But above all it is important that wage agreements only regulate minimum standards and leave room for operational wage and salary differentiations, and working hour differentiations and flexibilities. The chemical industry wage agreement partners have provided a good example in their 1994 agreement, which provides for a 2 percent wage and salary increase with a three-month delay, expansion of the working-hours corridor, and entry level wages for the previously unemployed and first-time workers.
