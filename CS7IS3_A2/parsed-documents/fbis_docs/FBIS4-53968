If the government were to implement a consumption tax hike and income tax cut "without a time differential, it would only discourage consumption," Hata told the House of Representatives Budget Committee. "It is utterly unthinkable to implement a tax hike alone from now on," Hata said in response to a query from Japanese Communist Party interpellator Kazuo Shii, who pressed Hata to clarify whether the government will hike the consumption tax. The tax rate is currently 3 percent. Hata hinted that the government will implement another tax cut in advance of a consumption tax hike, saying that a time lag between the two "is conceivable." "The ratio of consumption-related taxes to total state revenue (in Japan) is the lowest among the (24) member states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development," he said. The Japanese ratio stands at 19.2 percent, as against the OECD average of 40.3 percent. Japan "would not be able to cope with the needs of the aging society" unless as many people as possible shoulder the financial cost of welfare outlays on a broad basis, he said. After the first coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa fell in April, the coalition parties launched a second coalition by inking a common policy document on April 22, including a controversial accord to boost state revenues with a hike in indirect taxes. Asked whether Japan could implement concerted sanctions with the United States if China vetoed a possible U.N. Security Council resolution to punish North Korea for its suspected nuclear arms program, Hata hinted at his readiness to take such concerted action. "I understand Japan can take action even outside the framework of the United Nations" under the coalition's common policy document, he said. Hata was responding to Shii's query on whether a phrase in the coalition's common policy document implies that Japan may take concerted sanctions with the United States, if the Security Council failed to come up with a sanction resolution. The phrase on Japan's policy on the Korean peninsula says, "the government will deal with a contingency in close cooperation and solidarity with the U.S. and South Korea, while preparing for such a contingency under the Constitution." However, Hata renewed a pledge to place Japan's concerted actions with the U.S. within the boundaries of the Constitution. The Constitution's Article 9 bans the use of military means to solve international conflicts. On Japan-U.S. Trade ties, Hata said Japan will not be forced to accept a possible U.S. demand to set numerical targets to whittle down Japan's lopsided trade imbalance with the United States. He suggested he would remain adamant in turning down any demand related to numerical targets, as any talk of a target figure could be unexpectedly interpreted by the U.S. side as a commitment. "A figure tends to go alone by itself," he said.
