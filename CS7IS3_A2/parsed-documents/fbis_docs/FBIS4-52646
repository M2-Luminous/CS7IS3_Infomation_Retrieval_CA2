"I have no illusions. I know there will be no compromise in Jakarta, Paris, anywhere," the king told journalists at the Royal Palace, explaining that he was leaving for China two weeks earlier than planned, in part because he had no hope of solving Cambodia's ongoing conflict. "Even with 100 round tables (peace talks), there will be no peace," the king said, apologizing to the United Nations for sending 20,000 peacekeepers to enforce a peace plan and hold elections last year. "It was a waste," the king cried disparagingly. "We did not deserve those three billion dollars, because our behavior is so bad." The ailing 71-year-old king, who spoke for more than one hour about politics, his eventual death and his despair over the situation that remains in Cambodia, said he was continuing to offer solutions for peace out of desperation. The Khmer Rouge want ultimately to retake power in Cambodia and return it to "the Stone Age" in line with their communist ideology, he said. "They have not changed their leadership, their policy, their approach," he said. "Even when they say they accept a round table, it is not sincere. They are not sincere. They are just maneuvering to show plenty of good will," the king said. "I must confess today ... that as king, I have to promise peace," he said, adding that the prospect was "very bleak." "Knowing we are going towards the death of Cambodia, I should not remain as king ... but if there remains civil war, people would say it is because the king has left us," King Sihanouk said. "I am in a very bad situation, worse than Shakespeare's hero, Hamlet," he said.
