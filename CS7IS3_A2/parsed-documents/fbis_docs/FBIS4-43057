Charles Pasqua and Bernard Pons, however, made it clear that the votes garnered by the two lists should be combined. Was such a point worth a debate? The "union of the majority" is a very ambiguous notion that can easily be turned on its ear. While such a union can legitimately find its governmental expression in the shape of a coalition, it has never assumed the shape of a single party or a single group in the National Assembly: There were and are the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and the UDF [Union for French Democracy]. Before the parliamentary election of March 1993, there was no such thing as a homogeneous UDF, but an incomplete UDF alongside the UDC [Union of the Center]. So UDF cohesion is a very recent thing, and it mostly stems from Valery Giscard d'Estaing's dogged determination. Moreover, such a cohesion is fragile, and it is well-known that some people would be delighted to see it killed. RPR-UDF voters do not delude themselves on the scope of such a union, whose praises are being sung by every one of its leaders. In fact, union is an electoral slogan and strategy, especially as with regard to parliamentary and European elections as well as, to a lesser extent, municipal elections. It definitely does not mean that the various partisan families have merged or disappeared behind a single flag or man. In such a context, the De Villiers list was bound to find its rightful place. In 1989, when Valery Giscard d'Estaing was leading the union list, Simone Veil played the part of the dissident. Given the popularity she was credited with, she had set the mark quite high, between 12 and 15 percent. Very soon, it appeared she was going to fail. She ended up with 8.42 percent --nothing to be ashamed of -- while Valery Giscard d'Estaing achieved nearly 29 percent. The parliamentary Right totaled 37.3 percent of the votes, a result as outstanding as it was unexpected. Demanding Electorate Philippe de Villiers' performance appears to be the opposite of Simone Veil's. If the last opinion polls that were made public are anything to go by, he has been gaining ground steadily, thus becoming a disruptive factor within the majority. While initially his list was only credited with an estimated 5 percent, it could now match the result achieved by Simone Veil's list, or even improve on it. That would spell unmitigated success for Mr. de Villiers. The Maastricht affair has made its mark, and times have changed. In short, nobody can ignore Philippe de Villiers today. But was it necessary to strengthen him by attempting to exclude him from the majority? As the campaign draws to a close, Dominique Baudis' opponent is no longer [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard, but Philippe de Villiers. Three weeks ago, the latter would not have dared dream of such an improved standing. He has undoubtedly struck a chord within the RPR and the UDF. Evidence of this are the meetings he organized, which were well attended. To achieve the shift from activist mobilization to the mobilization of a fraction of the electorate, he only needed a little help: He has now got it from the leaders of the RPR/UDF list. As soon as Monday [13 June] morning, the stage will be set for the presidential battle. In the majority, contenders for the top job are already known. To be sure, the "union" or "rally" theme will be a core concern and topic for the presidential candidates who, as we saw, studiously refrained from direct and explicit attack against Philippe de Villiers. In fact, while the government and the various parties have carefully avoided giving the impression that this election had much importance in terms of internal politics, it might mark the beginning of serious turbulences both within the Right and the Left. As for the Right, if the De Villiers phenomenon is confirmed by voters on Sunday, it should force the various presidential candidates to tone down their union-at-all-costs rhetoric. Voters might be becoming more demanding as to the force and the nature of commitments. To paraphrase the word of General de Gaulle on Europe, there is no certainty that repeating, mantra-like, "union, union, union" will convince anyone. Especially as everybody knows very well that behind this noble word lurk significant political differences on issues. Not to mention feuds.
