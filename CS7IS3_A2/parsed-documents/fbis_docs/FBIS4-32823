One of the summit's main goals is to strengthen South-South cooperation as well as to draft guidelines for the Movement's future. This was pointed out by Robaina during a news conference. He also discussed other important issues, such as the forthcoming Ibero-American summit: [Begin recording] [Robaina] Three main issues dealing with economic aspects and Latin American integration will be discussed. In all likelihood, Cartagena will be a forum to reaffirm the willingness of the Ibero-American peoples and where Cuba will undoubtedly have to speak of the motives behind the call to a hemispheric summit in Miami which excludes Cuba. It is important to discuss our view on this maneuver in Cartagena. Regarding the blockade, no one has the least doubt that given what was accomplished in Bahia...[pauses] I believe other things happened after the Bahia summit. There was a strong resolution of support at the United Nations, and there is an ever increasing commitment among many countries, peoples, and governments. [Rodriguez] Minister, what is Cuba's position on the hemispheric summit? Do you believe it is an alternative to the Ibero-American summits? [Robaina] I would say that, rather than an alternative, it is undoubtedly a maneuver to discredit, diminish the authority, and overshadow the results of the Ibero-American summits. I also believe that if the regional superpower really meant to meet with every country in the region, it would have given more consideration to events, time, and place. In my opinion, the manner in which this has been organized speaks by itself of the [words indistinct] what we have been doing with Ibero-America. If we are not included, they still want to discuss Cuba which has been singled out and toward that end selected Miami. [Rodriguez] If Cuba were to be invited to the hemispheric summit in Miami, would Cuba attend? [Robaina] Rather than my opinion, it is the belief of the country's leadership -- the president himself has said it -- that we are not afraid to attend any forum we are invited to no matter where, even Miami. Cuba does not seek an invitation. Even if Cuba had been invited to that summit, it would have questioned the manner in which the summit was called, without considering the participant countries' opinions. Cuba is willing to go, however, and explain its project of truth and work anywhere our presence is requested. [end recording]
