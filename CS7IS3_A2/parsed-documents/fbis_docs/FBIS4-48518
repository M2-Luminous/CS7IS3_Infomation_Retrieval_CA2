CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said the CP remains convinced that a nation's right to self-determination can only be realized in a sovereign volkstaat [homeland]. No freedom of nations is possible within a unitary state. The Afrikaner National Front [AVF] has also decided to recommit itself to the attainment of a sovereign Christian Boer/Afrikaner republic. Dr. Hartzenberg, also leader of the AVF, said the AVF was appealing to all Boer/Afrikaners to join them, and in so doing become involved in the realization of a volkstaat. Dr. Hartzenberg has no doubts whatsoever that the majority of Afrikaners are in favor of a volkstaat and self-determination. This support, however, was not reflected in the outcome of the election because the majority of CP supporters did not vote. He said in a statement: "We are happy we did not take part in the election, because now we can say that we did not become part of the fiasco surrounding the election, nor did we commit ourselves to abandoning in any way the Afrikaner people's claim to freedom." According to him, the election was definitely not free and fair. There were blatant irregularities, and under a new government the country is heading for an administrative disaster. "The CP will not become irrelevant by not participating in the country's new parliamentary politics. We will still voice our protests loudly and clearly against any measure by the government which will be detrimental to the country's future. The CP was created then to bring about freedom and self-determination for the Afrikaner people. This task has only just begun." The CP's biggest task is to bring about complete unity among Afrikaners and to promote relations with other peace-loving peoples in order to gain more bargaining power. The CP will remain a fully fledged political party which will act outside Parliament in every sphere of life as a fighter for the rights of its supporters. "I am not in anyway sorry that the CP did not participate in the election. Today the whole world knows that the CP was not part of the election. Nobody would have known about our claims to self-determination had we been part of the new system. We could not have achieved anything inside Parliament as we would have been outvoted. Outside the new parliament we can do exactly the same as we did in the old parliament." Dr. Hartzenberg said the CP is to introduce a political strategy which will lead to the self-determination of the Afrikaner nation. There will again be a transitional process in the country -- from a communist controlled unitary state to real freedom. The CP will then be in the forefront.
