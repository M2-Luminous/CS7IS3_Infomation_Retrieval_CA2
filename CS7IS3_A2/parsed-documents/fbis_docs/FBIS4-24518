The spokesman made the statement when asked to comment on a report that the U.S. side allowed Lien Chan of Taiwan to stop over in the United States on his way to Latin America. "We are deeply concerned over this matter", the spokesman noted, pointing out that the "transit diplomacy" or "vacation diplomacy" that the Taiwan authorities have been pursuing is designed to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan". "We hope that the U.S. side will implement the principles laid down in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques in its action, refrain from engaging in any official contacts with the Taiwan authorities and prevent Lien Chan from making transit of the United States in any way, in the overall interests of Sino-U.S. relations", the spokesman said.
