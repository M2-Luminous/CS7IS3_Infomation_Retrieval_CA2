Is that what your talks were about? Stanislav Shushkevich: To start with, I'm very pleased that that meeting has taken place. It seems to me we were talking in an atmosphere of mutual trust. I was very pleased with the attention the Russian president gave to the problems of Belarus and with his understanding of them. As for the concrete results of the meeting, we paid practically no attention to minor tactical problems. We talked about comprehensive long-term cooperation. There are urgent matters, of course, and we did give consideration to them. But there are also matters that need serious preparation. We paid attention to those too. What I consider to be the main result is that we agreed that there is a need for a new treaty between Belarus and Russia. I think it's obvious to everyone that some points of the treaty of December 18, 1990, which is still in effect and which was signed when the Soviet Union was still in existence, don't seem too serious nowadays. What we need is a document that would provide a clear and accurate legal basis for comprehensive interaction between our two countries, help them achieve stabilization and make their development more dynamic. Corr.: Do you have in mind military and political cooperation? S.S.: Certainly. We discussed the current withdrawal of strategic nuclear forces from Belarus to Russia and the possibility of speeding up that process. We also gave detailed consideration to the latest initiative of the United States and European nations, known as "partnership for the sake of peace." And we talked about the participation of Belarus in the collective security system [of the CIS] as well. I will first of all say a few words about the latter problem. President Yeltsin understands our position, namely that we cannot fully participate in that system, because the syndrome of the Great Patriotic War (of 1941-45) and the Afghan syndrome are particularly painful for us. May I remind you that in both wars Belarus suffered greater per capita losses than any other republic of the former Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsin and I agreed that Belarus mustn't ensure its own security at the expense of any other state and therefore decided that Belarus would be gradually incorporated into the collective security system. By such gradual incorporation, which would make it possible to solve the problem painlessly, without giving rise to a confrontation within Belarus, I mean that we have not yet ratified the Treaty on Collective Security. We plan to ratify it with some reservations. Our diplomats should try to make it clear to our partners in the CIS that those reservations are not a whim on our part but reflect the actual state of affairs. When Russia realizes that, it will be easier to bring it home to other signatories to the treaty. Now, as regards rumors that we have plans to join NATO, we have never, under no circumstances, expressed any desire to join NATO, and have never even hinted at that. As for the withdrawal of strategic nuclear forces to Russia, we stated once again that everything is going on in conformity to the former agreements. We are working on a detailed schedule for it and a detailed treaty on it between our defense ministries. Belarus is making no direct or indirect conditions for it. We are deeply satisfied that our position has been given a good reception in the world. It is not ourselves but Russia and the United States that have proposed that, when fissile materials are assigned for civilian use, the part of their cost which is proportional to the amount of those materials remaining on Belarusian territory be paid to Belarus in hard currency. The only reservation we'd like to make is that, although all of us would like the nuclear weapons to be taken away as soon as possible, we may get into trouble if we are in too much of a hurry to get it done. So we'll make sure that all necessary safety measures are taken. Corr.: The peace policy of Belarus is likely to affect the nature of its armed forces too. However, today Belarus has more military officers "per capita" than any other former Soviet republic. How is that problem being solved? S.S.: That's a very painful and complicated process. We'd like to have what is, to all intents, a national army. We are patiently dealing with that task, taking into consideration the needs and sentiments of both the officers serving in Belarus and ethnic Belarusians doing military service outside the country and wishing to return home. I don't think cutting down the number of officers by decree is an acceptable way to speed up the creation of a national army. It's much more in our interest to get something done without throwing them out and leaving them totally neglected and embittered. Yes, it is a complicated process, I must repeat, but it's under control. We have a special parliamentary commission (the Commission on Defense and National Security headed by parliament presidium member Mechislav Grib) that is in charge of it and pays extremely close attention to it. Corr.: Did you discuss with the Russian president the possibility of assistance to Belarus in the protection of its borders? S.S.: I did. The point is that, if we wish to have a single customs area, -which is our aim under our earlier agreements, - Russia must have guarantees that Belarus doesn't provide a loophole for bending Russian laws and customs regulations. First of all, we must take care of our borders with Lithuania and Latvia (the Polish border is well under control). By the way, that would be much easier for Russia to do than look after the Russian-Belarusian border, which is much longer. Corr.: What are the other priorities that you think Belarus should have in its cooperation with Russia? S.S.: Belarus and Russia must have uniform price policies. Agreement on many points can be reached at the level of enterprises, without any government intervention. I think final documents will be basically ready by the end of this month, when (Russian Prime Minister) Viktor Chernomyrdin comes to Belarus to sign them. Corr.: Is Chernomyrdin mainly coming to make a joint statement with the Belarusian leadership on the unification of the monetary systems of the two countries, as has been reported? S.S.: What needs to be done is not to make statements but to sign a package of documents. If such documents are signed - there should be six or seven of them - the unification you have mentioned will materialize. It would be fairly naive to expect the two monetary systems to be unified instantly. See the next issue of Presidential Bulletin for the end of the interview, where Shushkevich speaks about the forthcoming visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Minsk and the CIS's development prospects.
