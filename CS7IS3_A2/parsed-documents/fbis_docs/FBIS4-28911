In his opening address, King Norodom Sihanouk's representative, Nhoek Chulong, who is hosting the talks at the city's Royal Palace, warned that if the two sides failed to reach a positive result the king would refuse to call for any further sessions. But despite this, the morning meeting broke up with the two sides failing to reach an agreement on a proposed ceasefire. "We will continue tomorrow," Mak Ben, who often serves as the Khmer Rouge's spokesman, said as he left the palace. Nhoek Chulong stressed the king's request for a simple "yes or no" answer to the ceasefire proposal. The government side, which also consisted of Cabinet Minister Sok An and parliament representative Toh Loah, agreed to the ceasefire and suggested a starting date of June 30. In a statement released to the press, senior Khmer Rouge delegate and former ambassador to China Chan Youran said the Khmer Rouge "were most delighted to have a ceasefire" and that it should be strictly controlled by a "committee or technical group." But he refused to give a simple "yes or no" answer. "I think the Khmer Rouge still do not agree to the ceasefire schedule proposal," Sok An said. Senior government representative and Interior Minister Yu Hokkri echoed the sentiments of most of his colleagues when he said he was "not at all optimistic" about the eventual outcome but was going along with the talks in accordance with the king's wishes. The Khmer Rouge, who control some 10 to 15 per cent of the country, boycotted last year's UN-supervised polls and have since continued a guerrilla struggle against the government installed by the polls. The talks follow a previous unsuccessful round hosted by the king at his residence in North Korea last month. On the agenda for Thursday's session is the even more problematic issue of the king's proposal for political concessions. Under this, government posts would be given to "acceptable" members of the Khmer Rouge, provided the guerrillas open up their zones and merge their fighters with the national army. Government officials said a major stumbling block was the Khmer Rouge's conditions for going along with the king's plan. Chan Youran said the Khmer Rouge would comply with the king's proposal if the government agreed to what the guerrillas called their "minimum political platform." A senior government official said this entailed scrapping the existing government and parliament and introducing a new power- sharing arrangement with the radicals. That is considered quite out of the question by Phnom Penh, as it would mean the two-billion-dollar UN mission which laid the foundations for a democratically-elected government would have been in vain, he said. "There is no way we can accept this," he declared. Other government members accused the Khmer Rouge of deliberate obfuscation and suspected the guerrillas were only presenting a facade of interest in the peace talks in order to buy time. "I don't believe there will be a positive result but let us wait and see what happens tomorrow," Yu Hokkri said. Co-premier Hun Sen recently said that the only way the Khmer Rouge problem could be solved was through a combination of social development to improve the lives of the country's impoverished rural majority and also though military pressure.
