FBIS4-47035 "jpusr065___94035" FBIS-USR-94-065 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 12 May 1994 RUSSIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS Tyumen Oblast Duma Session Reviewed Tyumen Oblast Duma Session Reviewed 944F0827A Tyumen TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA in Russian 12 May 94 pp 1-2 944F0827A Tyumen TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA Russian CSO [Article by Vitaliy Snisarenko, TYUMENSKAYA PRAVDA parliamentary correspondent: "Duma Chronicle: Documents, Figures and Commentary"] [Text] In previous issues, the newspaper covered the two-day session of the Tyumen Oblast Duma briefly and in general terms. Today we offer readers a more detailed and documentary analysis of the Duma's working agenda with commentary by our "parliamentary correspondent" Vitaliy Snisarenko. A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE AGENDA ITSELF It went without saying that the key issues in the session's work would be the budgetary message and other socioeconomic parameters of the oblast's life in 1994, including one of the key "points," in general--the Duma's lawmaking work; it is here that the foundation of our future would be laid. However, the fact that it was proposed that precisely these issues be discussed, for all practical purposes, only in the second part of the session caused general perplexity among representatives of the mass media. When the outgoing Duma leadership in the person of N. Baryshnikov and V. [? illegible] Tretyakov assigned numerical priority--and that has always been understood as meaning priority in importance--for the deputies arriving from local areas to problems of structure and staffing and of material and technical supply (point 5), and to the questions of approving estimated expenditures for the operations of the Duma and even of allocating money for the remodeling of the meeting hall (point 7). To the credit of the deputies themselves, in the process of approving the agenda they dropped the aforementioned points from it. Although it should be noted that a decree "on the remodeling of the principal hall," with the allocation of a full $1.5 million and "only" 80 million rubles for that "extremely important" undertaking, had already been drafted for the signature of N. Baryshnikov. The Duma deputies did some counting and figured that, given the fact that their corps numbered only 25 members, it was extremely irrational to have their own 57-person business administration. They did some counting and cut the business administration: There is an analogous department of the oblast administration close at hand that is capable of meeting the needs of the Duma deputies. In short, the eternal passion to spend money and inflate staffs continues to beat ardently: A. Korelyakov and V. Yudin spoke out harshly on that topic. I shall express my own viewpoint. I believe that it is necessary, in general, to change what is, for all practical purposes, an obsolete staffing arrangement--with its departments, deputy directors and chief and lead specialists--for supporting new Duma. I think that each of our new congressmen needs a two-person staff consisting of a legal specialist and an economist, both of whom should be highly professional: taken together, they would constitute the Duma's intellectual apparatus, and along with them there should be a common technical support group for all the deputies. CONCERNING THE COMPUTER DECREE Another draft decree had also prepared, according to which it was proposed to allocate R1,483,690,000 this year for the needs of the Tyumen Oblast Regional Agency for the Development of Data Processing and Telecommunications, which had been established back under V. Ulyanov. The Duma deputies also struck out this point. Although A. Korelyakov made a proposal simply to sell the existing imported IBM equipment, and G. Polyakov did not rule out the possibility of transferring it and placing it under the aegis of another Duma deputy, A. Klepalov, chief physician of the oblast hospital, I believe that the essence of the fundamental objection lay elsewhere. First of all, the unified Tyumen Oblast for which the computer system in question was intended does not exist. Second, it does not make sense in these times to spend scarce budgetary money for this project, and it is possible that the system that has been designated so far will prove suitable for the commercial and state banks: let them assume part of the expenditures. That is what the Duma decided, resolving to think the matter over and return to this matter later. Concerning the Draft Designs for the Tyumen Oblast Flag and Seal, the Problem of Unity, and the Plan for the Duma's Legislative Work The Duma decided that the draft designs for the flag and seal should be presented for consideration by the competition jury no later than 1 August 1994: the prize fund consists of R3 million and is to be indexed for inflation (the first prize is 1.5 million, the second prize is 600,000, and there are three honorable mentions of 300,000 rubles each). All that is fine. But in the course of the discussion of this and all the other matters on the agenda, one underlying issue that has not yet been resolved could be heard: the essence of it is that on 5-6 May the Duma, for all practical purposes, considered only the "southern" part of Tyumen Oblast's specific problems. If, in the future, the same budgetary questions with regard to the autonomous okrugs are designated in documents only by the meaningless phrase "on the one hand," that will be intolerable for the oblast Duma (G. Polyakov sharply underscored precisely this matter in his speech). Well, why, then, speak seriously today about a single flag and seal? Why, broadly speaking, should L. Roketskiy, who for all intents and purposes is dealing only with the questions of the south, continue to bluff? After all, the fact that the questions of oil and gas were virtually not considered at all at the current Duma session--they're not ours but the okrugs'--is considerable, obvious and distressing nonsense. And although I agree with the governor about letting the okrugs keep their governmental sovereignty--it is absurd to try to command from Tyumen in the old way, and inconvenient to boot--oblast-wide programs that are greatly needed by everyone have been halted in their development. And let us, finally, ask the following ruthless question: where will the tens upon tens of thousands of people from the resettled North go--and they are already going--when the oil and gas start to wane? Or the northern deposits become completely exhausted? To whom will the dead cities and airports of the North then be left? People won't go somewhere in the near aborad, which has become inhospitable for them, but to us, to the south. That is why I claim that today the number-one question on the agenda for the current Duma is legislative work. And the main thing is to adopt, at any cost, a Law on Relations Between Tyumen Oblast and the Khanty-Mansi and Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrugs That Are Parts of It--a functional law that is as rational as possible and that has been agreed to at the federal level. All the remaining legal acts--on local government, on oblast taxes, and so forth and so on--will "flow" from such a law, which will be fundamental for the oblast. But it is extremely difficult to resolve this matter: the "race of sovereignties" has gone too far,a nd too much time has been lost. On both days of the current Duma session V. Ulyanov sat beside me--today he is head of the Center for Regional Strategy that he himself "conceived." And he showed me, dated 24 April, the official record of disagreements on this subject, which bore the signatures of the heads not only of "our" okrugs but of other RF autonomous entities: at the level of the Russian Federation, it will evidently be necessary to pass a common Russian law, one for everyone. And so! So far the record in question bears a "No" writ large, without any hint of any consensual "Yes" in the foreseeable future. And V. Ulyanov is prepared to argue with anyone who cares to that the Duma will not succeed in achieving positive success in 1994. But the Duma members have no intention of surrendering: V. Yudin, V. Gorodilov [? poor legibility] and Ye. Panasenkova answered me bluntly: "We didn't come to the Duma for that!" Time will tell. In any case, for the time being, as paradoxical as it may seem, it is not the Duma but the governor who is raising and aggravating the problem of unity: it was precisely L. Roketskiy who spoke the word "referendum," and it was he who directed the Duma deputies toward Moscow, as long as nothing but destructive reforms are coming from there. On the Budget and Social Forecast Both documents presented by the administration were agreed to by the Duma practically without serious amendments. And the reason for that lay in the following circumstances. First, as L. Roketskiy noted, the budget message has not been put into final form; the reason for this lies in the inflationary processes and the behavior of the federal financial departments, which is by no means stabilizing the situation. In addition, all the figures will be defined more precisely in the process of thorough examination at working meetings with the constituent parts of the southern part of the oblast--its rayons and cities. Secondly, the Duma is still not prepared for dealing in detail with such documents in the course of its brief sessions, when only during the present session were commissions on the budget, finances and taxes (chairman, S. Kirichuk), on social and economic questions (commission head, V. Yudin), on questions of legislative activity and law and order (F. Sayfitdinov), and on regional policy and local government (S. Sheregov) formed in a preliminary fashion. The commissions' final makeup will be decided before 20 May. And so these commissions will deploy their "battle formations," and then they will see. But for the time being even the forecast of the social and economic future is not so reassuring, which, however, is the same thing that can be said about the present and future of Russia as a whole. Although personally, for myself, I noted the obvious uneven spots and disproportions. When the revenue from privatization that is forecast for 1994 comes to only R9.5 billion, I believe that figure is too small and reflects only the value of the measure that has begun to be carried out, without taking into account the forward progress of the "privatized national complex." The forecast under the heading "timber revenues"--just R2.9 billion--is also too small. On the other hand, under the "expenditures" section, a comparison of the following figures is extremely impressive. Whereas it is planned to spend nearly R69.1 billion for the operations of bodies of government and administration and notary offices, the figure of 76.74 billion rubles is not much greater than that, but it is for culture (37.275), physical culture and sports (5.765), social security (26.62), the mass media (1.93), the youth policy program (2.1) and the support of science and higher schools (3.04). An impressive discrepancy, isn't it? But the point is not even that, but the fact that we all would like to catch sight of the light at the end of the tunnel. And A. Korelyakov, member of the Tyumen Oblast Duma, literally pestered L. Roketskiy, governor and member of the RF Federation Council: "When will the depression in the country end?" The latter first cited general difficulties and then said, albeit rather floridly, in reference to oil and gas: "We in the oblast have maintained all our forces in order to wait it out until the next oil and gas boom. I believe it will occur in a year and a half to two years." And my memory immediately suggested how exactly that forecast coincided with the end of the current RF president's term of office. ONE SENTENCE ABOUT OTHER BUSINESS The Duma authorized its chairman N. Baryshnikov to sign the Contract on Social Accord on its behalf. The deputies will demand that the RF government reduce tariffs on gas and electric power produced in our oblast for Tyumen goods producers. It was decided to establish additional tax breaks with respect to the profits tax for enterprises that employ disabled persons. It was also decided not simply to adopt "wholesale" for implementation all the "unfinished" measures of the former oblast soviet, but to take a close look at that legacy and only then to "decide and decree." In one of his speeches L. Roketskiy uttered the phrase "poor and unimproved Tyumen," while at the same time Tyumen mayor and Duma deputy S. Kirichuk justifiably hopes that it is precisely the oblast Duma that has a duty to help turn Tyumen into a genuine oblast capital. One gets the impression that V. Bugayev, head of the Tyumen Rayon administration, came to the Duma to defend and "push through" the interests of precisely his rayon, and not the oblast. Ye. Panasenkova, Duma deputy and chief physician of the Zavodoukovsk Hospital, believes that it is necessary to hold closed working sessions of the Duma, since there is evidence of the old habit of some comrades to "work for the public." For the public, she believes, a press conference will be sufficient. The next session of the oblast Duma is scheduled for 15-16 June.
