On Sunday a number of Japanese newspapers, citing anonymous sources in the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry, informed that such a step was seemingly connected with the fact that the Russian population was having an increasingly negative attitude to "sops from abroad." In a talk with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, a representative of the department on questions of aid to new independent states of the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry stated that such reports in no way corresponded to the facts. According to him, no changes had been made in the programs of aid to Russia, and they were all being consistently carried out at working level. This is also true in full for humanitarian aid to the former USSR, for which Tokyo has alloted $100,000,000, mainly to provide medicines. The Foreign Affairs Ministry representative called the recently announced auction for Japanese companies to gain the right to supply consumer goods to Russia within the framework of the humanitarian aid program evidence of Japan's consecutive efforts in this direction.
