FR940524-0-00033 FR940524-0-00008 47 CFR Part 64 [CC Docket No. 92&hyph;256, FCC 94&hyph;58] Common Carriers; Open Network Architecture Requirements an Nondiscrimination Safeguards AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission adopted an order applying to GTE Corporation the same regulatory framework of Open Network Architecture (ONA) requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards that apply to the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) for GTE's participation in the enhanced services market. Under this order, GTE will be required to file an ONA plan within nine months of the release of this order, file federal and state ONA tariffs three months later, and implement ONA requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards fifteen months from the release of this order. The Commission stated that the public interest benefits of applying these measures to GTE amply justify its taking the next logical step toward an overall environment that will foster a fully competitive market for the provision of enhanced services to the American public. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Peggy Reitzel, Policy and Program Planning Division, Common Carrier Bureau (202) 632&hyph;1300. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The requirements have been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended, 44 U.S.C. §§3501&hyph;20. The information collection contained herein is not subject to the clearance provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3507 because it is imposed on less than nine respondents. Regulatory Flexibility Act In the NPRM the Commission certified that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 did not apply to this proceeding because the rule amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The rule changes directly apply only to GTE which is considered dominant in its field of operation. Neither the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration nor any commenting party challenged the Commission's analysis. The Secretary of the Commission is required to send a copy of this Report and Order, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 605(b) of the regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. Section 601 et seq . Summary of Report and Order 1. This is a summary of the Report and Order in Common Carrier Docket No. 92&hyph;256, Application of Open Network Architecture and Nondiscrimination Safeguards to GTE Corporation, adopted March 8, 1994, and released April 4, 1994 (FCC 94&hyph;58). The full text of the Commission's decision is available for inspection and copying, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m._4:30 p.m., in the FCC Reference Room (room 239), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554. The complete text of the Report and Order may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, ITS, Inc., (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. 2. Over the last eight years, the Commission established a comprehensive regulatory framework of nonstructural safeguards, including Open Network Architecture (ONA) requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards, to govern the Bell Operating Companies' (BOCs') participation in the enhanced services marketplace. Under ONA, BOCs are required to offer unbundled ONA services to enhanced service providers (ESPs). By requiring the BOCs to offer unbundled network services to ESPs, ONA increases opportunities for enhanced services providers (ESPs) to provide, and customers to receive, a wide range of enhanced services. The nondiscrimination safeguards consist of Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) rules, Network Information Disclosure rules, and nondiscrimination reporting requirements.
