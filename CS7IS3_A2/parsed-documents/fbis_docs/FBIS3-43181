Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-05JAN94-RUSSIA-NATO Moscow Blasts NATO Expansion on Eve of Alliance Summit SUMMARY On the eve of the 10-11 January NATO summit, Russian President Boris Yeltsin has strongly reaffirmed his opposition to the possible expansion of NATO membership, warning of the possible negative consequences of such expansion. Yeltsin's statement comes as the culmination of a campaign by other Russian officials to forestall any expansion of NATO that excludes Russia. This campaign has taken pains to counter Baltic and East European efforts to press for their countries' early admission to NATO based on the strong showing of ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party in the 12 December Russian legislative elections, with some arguing that Russia will have to respond to any appearance of the continuation of Cold-War era "bloc politics." END SUMMARY In a final push to forestall moves at the upcoming NATO summit toward an early expansion of NATO membership, Yeltsin press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov issued an "authorized" statement on 5 January warning of the possible negative consequences of such steps and calling on NATO leaders to "dispel" the "impression of ambiguity" in their position on the issue. While the statement began with a terse disclaimer expressing "respect" for the "acknowledged right of independent states" to "join international organizations," it went on to castigate specifically Lithuania's "official request to join NATO" and more generally the "haste" of "some countries" to join a "military-political alliance." Arguing against a "bloc mentality" in an era when the "world's major powers" are working toward "dismantling the inheritance of the 'Cold War'" and when the military doctrine of the new democratic Russia "excludes any kind of aggressive displays," the statement criticized the "motives and arguments" of those wishing to join NATO as "unconvincing." It went on to warn that Yeltsin is "worried" that NATO expansion will "provoke a negative reaction" within Russia, "promote . . . undesirable attitudes" among both civilians and the military, and "ultimately could lead to military-political destabilization" (ITAR-TASS, 5 January). Other Russian Critics Yeltsin's strong statement follows a spate of recent comments by other Russian officials critical of the Baltic and East European states for using Zhirinovskiy's election success to argue for their quick admission to NATO. Some of the officials, like Yeltsin, have highlighted the potential negative consequences of an early expansion of NATO membership to Baltic or East European states: --In an interview with the Prague daily Lidove Noviny published on 15 December, Yeltsin's foreign policy adviser, Dmitriy Ryurikov, claimed that creation of "new lines dividing Europe"--a reference to East Europeans joining NATO--would be "insulting to Russia" which now has "no political, philosophical, or ideological differences" with East Europe or the West. He also noted that Russia "has to react" to any movement by "such a huge military bloc toward our border." --An article in the 18 December Izvestiya reported that Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is "assuming" that the Baltic and East European countries will "cite Zhirinovskiy's success" in the recent elections to "demand" both the "immediate withdrawal of Russian troops" and "rapid acceptance into NATO." The report cited Kozyrev as saying that he "will not allow" foreign countries to "exploit the Zhirinovskiy factor" in this way and as recommending that the Baltics strive to "deprive Zhirinovskiy of his social base" by cooperating with Moscow to "improve the position of the Russian-speaking population." --In an interview published in the 23 December Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Kozyrev similarly charged that certain "circles," including "those European countries which for some reason want to join NATO," are "making capital" out of Zhirinovskiy's recent electoral success "even though they themselves cannot explain what they will get out of" NATO membership. He promised that "Zhirinovskiy's success will not produce any changes" in Russian foreign policy. --Defense Minister Pavel Grachev seemed to take a more conciliatory tack in a 29 December press conference, reportedly saying that Russia would withdraw its troops from Estonia and Latvia in 1994 in order to "avoid the Baltics appealing for early NATO membership" to counter an alleged "military threat" from Russia. Grachev claimed not to understand the efforts of East European and Baltic countries to "find protection" from a "mythical threat from Russia" by joining NATO (Tallinn BNS, 29 December 1993). --Appearing on an Ostankino television program analyzing the election results broadcast on 18 December, First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin noted that the East European states and NATO need to "take other interests into account, including Russia's interests" because positioning a "military-political bloc" right up against "the borders of Russia" could "bring about an undesired reaction." Adamishin also stressed this theme in an interview published in the Italian daily L'Espresso on 26 December, arguing that if the West "continues [its] policy of encirclement," it will "risk having to reckon with a Zhirinovskiy." Moscow's Previous Opposition Moscow's strong opposition to any eastward expansion of NATO predates the Russian elections. Yeltsin signaled that such a development could be politically explosive after a joint Russian- Polish declaration signed by him and Polish President Lech Walesa in August, which recognized Poland's right to join the alliance, sparked a controversy within Russia over the issue. A letter that Yeltsin sent to Western leaders in September laid out Moscow's position and reportedly stressed the domestic ramifications of such a move. According to a text of the letter published by the Prague daily Mlada Fronta Dnes (2 December), Yeltsin noted that, although Moscow recognized that incorporation of East Europe into NATO would not "automatically lead to the alliance turning against Russia," the Russian public--"not only the opposition, but also moderate circles "--would "undoubtedly view this as a new kind of isolation" that "diametrically contradicts [Russia's] logical involvement in the Euro-Atlantic region." During a 9 December meeting in Brussels with NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, Yeltsin reiterated that Moscow "would not like" moves to extend NATO membership to East Europe (ITAR-TASS, AFP, 9 December 1993). Throughout the fall, other Russian officials kept up a steady drumbeat of public criticism of NATO expansion, giving it high visibility as a foreign policy issue to both foreign and domestic audiences: --Kozyrev, addressing the U.S. Foreign Policy Association in New York, stressed that world stability should not be sought by expanding NATO but by transforming the bloc and adapting it to peacekeeping efforts (ITAR-TASS, 30 September 1993 Campaigning later for election to a single-seat constituency in the military stronghold of Murmansk, Kozyrev assured the Commander in Chief of the Northern Fleet Oleg Yerofeyev, who noted that NATO members were actively operating in the region, that NATO will not increase its membership (ITAR-TASS, 27 November 1993 After the 3 December meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), Kozyrev claimed that the question of extending NATO membership in the near-term had been taken off the agenda of the upcoming NATO summit, characterizing the decision as one of the most consequential outcomes of the session (ITAR-TASS, 4 December 1993). --Answering journalists' questions about Moscow's views on the possibility of the Baltic states joining NATO, Grachev stressed that "Russia does not approve of any expansion of NATO to other states, including the Baltics." Noting that Russia had no right to interfere in the affairs of a sovereign state and that it was up to the Baltics "to decide what they want to join and why," Grachev nevertheless warned that, if they join NATO, Russia "will then take the necessary defensive steps" (ITAR-TASS, 22 November 1993). --Adamishin gave repeated warnings about expanding NATO to the foreign press, cautioning a Madrid newspaper, for example, that if the East Europeans joined NATO and Russia was left out to "feel again like a besieged fortress, isolated behind a cordon sanitaire," there could be "considerable consequences in Russian domestic politics" (El Pais, 23 October 1993). The Primakov Report The fanfare with which Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) director Yevgeniy Primakov used a 25 November press conference to unveil the FIS report, "Prospects for the Expansion of NATO and Russia's Interests," which set forth a comprehensive assessment of the negative impact of NATO expansion, suggests the depth of Moscow's desire to forestall such expansion. Although Primakov acknowledged that "NATO today is not the NATO of the Cold War," he stressed that Russia "is far from indifferent to a bloc that is expanding its area of responsibility to our borders" and is being called upon to become the "sole guarantor of peace and stability" for former Warsaw Treaty members. Drawing from the 13-page unclassified report, Primakov argued that the real risk to Russia from an expansion of NATO lay in the fact that NATO is only "slowly" transforming itself from a "political-military alliance designed to counter external threats" into a mainly political instrument appropriate to the new tasks of the post confrontational period." Contending that the alliance currently "is geared toward strategic planning of the worst sort," Primakov added that to change its "persistent stereotypical [bloc] mentality" will "clearly take a long time" (Radio Rossii, Moscow radio, 25 November 1993). Although Primakov dismissed as "speculative" allegations that the military's influence over political decisions had recently increased in Russia, he implicitly cautioned the West against putting Russia in a position where its current relative military weakness becomes a domestic issue. He highlighted a conclusion contained in the FIS report that the Russian Government's inability to take retaliatory steps if NATO was extended could "generate discontent" among those "responsible" for Russia's security (Interfax, 25 November 1993). According to the text of the report, such retaliatory measures would be imperative from a military standpoint and would include fundamental changes in Russian force structure and posture to offset the "immense offensive potential" of a NATO expansion to Russian borders. The report concluded, however, that such offsetting measures would "undoubtedly" result in "an excessive strain on the state budget and ultimately a weakening of Russia's defense capabilities." The report warned further that, under such circumstances, target deadlines for military reform and modernization might not be met, resulting in a "qualitative reduction" of Russia's military potential in comparison with the "leading military powers" (Perspektivy Rashireniya NATO i Interesy Rossii, 1993). While some newspaper articles suggested that the Foreign Ministry had some unspecified disagreements with the FIS over the question of NATO expansion (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 26 November 1993; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 30 November 1993), Primakov conceded in general that "some differences between departments always exist" but downplayed any disagreements with the Foreign Ministry (Interfax, 25 November 1993). Searching for Partnership and Equality Moscow has signaled its own interest in closer ties to NATO and has appeared generally receptive to the Partnership for Peace proposal. However, it has evinced concern that Russia be accepted as an equal by the Western powers. --In his September letter, Yeltsin reportedly suggested that "the relations between [Russia] and NATO should be several degrees warmer than relations between the alliance and East Europe," adding that "direct cooperation" between Russia and NATO in "advancing peace" could "progress at a much quicker pace" (Mlada Fronta Dnes, 2 December 1993). Summing up the thrust of Yeltsin and Grachev's December meeting with Secretary General Woerner, Kozyrev described Moscow's attitude toward NATO as seeking "not membership, but partnership," and he noted that cooperation should be as "broad and specific as possible" (ITAR-TASS, 10 December 1993). --Although he later claimed it was essentially a Russian idea (ITAR-TASS, 4 December 1993), Kozyrev also expressed reservations about the Partnership for Peace plan at the NACC session. Noting that it was "a complicated issue" and that "we all have to find the appropriate answers," he stressed that "no one has a magic solution," and that the scheme must be studied carefully (AFP, 3 December 1993). --In a 11 November interview with the newspaper Segodnya, Russian Ambassador to Belgium and representative to NATO Nikolay Afanasyevskiy said Russia needed to clearly define the content and political objectives of the partnership and make sure that it is not a "preparatory class from which 'A' students will be admitted to NATO" but a "genuinely mutual rapprochement" allowing "equal cooperation in critical situations." --Prior to Yeltsin's Belgian visit, the Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda cited Russian defense and foreign ministry officials as saying any security system which included Russia as an 'equal partner" would be "acceptable" (9 December 1993). Outlook Russia will persist in opposing any expansion of NATO that excludes it or appears not to treat it as an equal partner. Yeltsin and his team are likely to continue to argue both that their democratic credentials make Baltic and East European fears unrealistic and that any NATO expansion will only play into the hands of Russian ultranationalists like Zhirinovskiy. Nevertheless, the presence of a substantial nationalistic faction within the new Russian legislature will undoubtedly complicate Yeltsin's efforts to assuage the fears of Russia's neighbors who are seeking shelter under the NATO umbrella. Box Zhirinovskiy' s Views Zhirinovskiy has made contradictory statements about NATO: --Commenting on his party's foreign policy priorities immediately following the elections, he announced "we are not against NATO being joined by East European or other countries" (Interfax, 14 December 1993). --At a press conference on 21 December, however, Zhirinovskiy demanded the breakup of NATO (Asahi Shimbun, 22 December 1993). --In Vienna Zhirinovskiy expressed both views. He told an Austrian television reporter that "we have dissolved the Warsaw Pact" and therefore "NATO must also be dissolved," but told a radio reporter that "if Poland or Hungary would like to be included in NATO, okay," it would be "no problem for Russia" (ORF TV, 21 December 1993; Osterreich Eins radio, 22 December 1993).
