He pointed out: Although China hit a record high in increased grain output in 1993, strains on grain still could be seen in some localities. For example, Guangdong is still short of 10 billion jin of grain a year. In the days to come, the province must strive to raise its level of self-sufficiency in grain. Chen Junsheng remarked: The imbalance in the regional grain supply remains a problem. Take Guangdong for example, its current grain output is 30 billion jin or so but its grain demand is some 40 billion jin, or it is short of 10 billion jin a year. It has to buy grain from outside the province. He maintained: Guangdong must feed some 10 million people coming from other parts of the country. In doing so, it should not just rely on buying grain from other provinces. Chen Junsheng stated: Guangdong has provided the country as a whole with useful experience in reform and opening up to the outside world. Its township and town enterprises have developed rapidly. The increased peasant income is achieved mainly by developing township and town enterprises. However, on the grain issue, Guangdong must work really hard to ensure the area of land sown to grain, increase grain output, and give consideration to social benefit rather than put exclusive stress on economic results. In a word, the province must strive to raise its level of self-sufficiency in grain.
