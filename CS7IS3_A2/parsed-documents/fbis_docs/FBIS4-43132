Some EU politicians do not even want to shake hands with them. The nomination of Belgian head of government Jan-Luc Dehaene as the successor of Brussels Commission President Jacques Delors is looking increasingly unlikely. Since Belgian ministers openly dissociate themselves from their Italian colleagues from the neofascist National Alliance in EU Council of Ministers' meetings, observers expect Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to reject the "favorite" of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand out of consideration for the Roman coalition. Since Delors' successor has to be unanimously nominated in the circle of the 12 heads of government, all the more respect is paid to the attitude of the Belgian ministers. Citing the EU's democratic bases, representatives of Belgium (which, with Greece and Germany, is a member of the EU presidency troika) have already expressed their protest twice. At the meeting of the EU ministers responsible for telecommunications on 30 May, Belgian Elio di Rupo, son of Italian immigrants, made a statement and reportedly refused to shake hands with Giuseppe Tatarella, Rome's minister for post and telecommunications. It is his personal decision to refrain from any contact with his Italian colleagues, Di Rupo said. In response, Tatarella allegedly said that Benito Mussolini had abolished handshakes in Italy and replaced them with the "Caesarian greeting" (of the raised arm.) During the second appearance of an Alliance minister -- at the EU environment minister's meeting in Luxembourg on Wednesday -- Belgian Minister Jacques Santkin, for his part, made a statement: "Precisely after the D-Day celebrations, it has to be clearly affirmed what the bases of democracy are." This time, Italian Alliance Minister Altero Matteoli answered that "the principles of freedom and democracy, which have been addressed, will never again be doubted." Well-informed circles in Brussels proceed on the assumption that Belgium's protest attitude is determined by Dehaene's socialist coalition partner and not due to a secret agreement in the "troika" with Bonn and Athens. In the Dutch Parliament, the parties said that an Alliance candidate nominated by Italy for the future EU Commission would be "boycotted." Before assuming office in January, the future EU Commission will have to face a "vote of agreement" of the new European Parliament. Even now, it is doubtful that a Commission member from the Alliance will obtain the agreement of the majority in Strasbourg.
