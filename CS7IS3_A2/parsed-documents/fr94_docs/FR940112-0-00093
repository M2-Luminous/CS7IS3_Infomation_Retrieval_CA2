FR940112-0-00093 FR940112-0-00021 Comment: Some commenters predicted that this proposed provision would result in increased Medicaid expenditures because individuals will choose to obtain more costly services known to be covered under the Medicaid plan, rather than less costly, possibly noncovered services. Further, they predict that individuals will wait to seek medical treatment if those expenses are not deductible in the spenddown process instead of getting early treatment for a medical condition. Response: While we have withdrawn this option, studies of the effects of cost-sharing on utilization and health status have been inconclusive. Therefore, it is not clear that patterns of utilization of medical care would have been significantly altered if we had adopted this option and States had implemented it. Comment: Some commenters questioned why the NPRM did not offer this option to States using more restrictive eligibility criteria than SSI, under section 1902(f) of the Act. Response: As discussed earlier, this option has been dropped altogether. Comment: A commenter suggested that, for purposes of the spenddown provision, we define the term ``medical expenses included in the plan'' as all services provided to categorically needy individuals. Response: We have withdrawn the option for States to limit deductible medical expenses to those for services included in the State plan. Therefore, we have not considered the commenter's suggestion in the context of that option. (States are required to continue deducting nonreimbursable expenses for premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance and for necessary care that is recognized under State law, whether or not such expenses are included in the State plan.) However, while States are required to deduct expenses for services not included in the State plan, States may continue to place reasonable limits on the deductible amount. Therefore, we considered the commenter's suggestion in this context, and we disagree with the suggestion. (This issue does not arise in States that determine eligibility under section 1902(f) of the Act because the inclusion or exclusion of services under State plans is not a factor in the spenddown process in these States.) States may provide a different range of services for the categorically needy than they do for the medically needy population. The spenddown procedures in Provisions A through D apply to medically needy individuals and apply both for AFDC-related cases and for the aged, blind, and disabled. Individuals eligible as medically needy are eligible for only those specific services that a State has chosen to provide to its medically needy population. If ``included in the State plan'' referred to services for the categorically needy, as the commenter suggested, the State would be unable to place reasonable limits on the deductible amount of expenses in the spenddown process, which only applies to the medically needy in States that are not determining eligibility under section 1902(f). We find no compelling program reason for such a restriction. Therefore, we believe that it is appropriate to allow each State to define ``included services'' for purposes of applying ``reasonable limits'' to mean services a State provides to medically needy individuals (rather than only to categorically needy individuals). In this way, the State may place reasonable limits on the deductible amounts of expenses for the medically needy except those included in the State plan. (It should be noted that ``reasonable limits'' refers to the amount, rather than the type, of expense that is deductible. For example, States may limit the amount, but not the type, of health insurance premiums that are deductible.) Comment: Commenters predicted that this provision will be error prone in practice, as eligibility workers and providers will need to distinguish correctly between covered and noncovered services to deduct only covered services during spenddown accurately. Response: We withdrew the option because of its negative impact on applicants and recipients. Comment: Several States disagreed with our proposal that States may not place amount, duration or scope limits on covered services in the spenddown process, even though the State applies those limits when paying for services furnished to Medicaid-eligible individuals. These commenters contended that their authority to place amount, duration and scope limits on services they pay for under Medicaid is an extension of their authority to decide which services they will cover under the State plan. They believe that this is an unnecessary restriction on the right to control their Medicaid program. Response: We do not agree with the commenters on this point. Under existing regulations, which have not been revised, States may place reasonable limits on the deductible amount of expenses not included in the State plan but may not limit the deduction of expenses included in the State plan. (Expenses ``included'' in the State plan are those for services which are listed in the State plan, whether or not Medicaid will pay for them. By contrast, ``covered'' expenses are a subset of ``included'' expenses. Covered expenses are expenses for services for which Medicaid will pay if furnished to the individual by a Medicaid provider. Expenses incurred for services which are for care which exceed State plan limits on amount, duration, and scope are not considered to be covered expenses.) The basic requirement in section 1902(a)(17) is that incurred expenses recognized under State law be taken into account in the spenddown process. We believe that this is in keeping with the thrust of this requirement to require the deduction from income of expenses recognized under State law when the State has also included the expenses in the State plan, even though the State limits the amount of such expenses it pays for. We, therefore, allow States to limit the deductions only for incurred expenses recognized under State law that are not included in the State plan. As we explained in response to a comment under Provision A concerning projecting institutional expenses, we find adequate authority for this policy in existing sections of the Act. The Secretary has authority under section 1902(a)(17) of the Act to prescribe the extent to which costs of medical care may be deducted from income in medically needy programs.
