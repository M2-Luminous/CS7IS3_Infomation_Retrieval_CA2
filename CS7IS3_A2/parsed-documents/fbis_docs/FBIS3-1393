Eight to 10 shots rang out as a small group of marchers came down Jeppe Street about 8.15 on Monday. One man lay sprawled on the pavement between Delvers and Von Weiligh Streets as police, firearms drawn, combed first floor balconies searching for the attackers. One of the shots hit the car of a priest working at St Mary's Anglican Cathedral nearby. The priest, Lawrence Mavundla, said, "I just heard the shots, I heard my car get hit. I got out of it and ran, leaving the car in the middle of the street." The car was abandoned for about 10 minutes before being removed by city officials. The radiator had been punctured.
