Military reaction has come in the wake of a report prepared by Dr. Pinto that describes PAC's as the main violators of human rights in Guatemala and because the final resolution of the UN Human Rights Commission requested that PAC units in areas where there is no conflict be dissolved based on agreements that may be reached during the peace negotiations. In noting that the Army's position is similar to that expressed by the Defense Ministry, Major Vargas affirmed that "the Army respects the position stated by the UN representative but we have our own opinion." She suggested that next time the UN expert visits Guatemala, "she should stay longer because this would permit her to speak with all the sectors, including PAC members." The major said that a longer visit would allow Dr. Pinto to have a broader idea and learn about special cases that cannot be understood in only eight days.
