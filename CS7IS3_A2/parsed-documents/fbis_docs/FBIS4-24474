Deputies attending the meeting heard a report by Wu Shunxiang, deputy chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Planning and Economic Commission, on the execution of Tibet's 1993 economic and social development plan and on the autonomous region's draft economic and social development plan for 1994. They also heard a report by Pingcuo, director of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Finance Department, on Tibet's final financial account of 1993 and on its draft financial budget for 1994. Puqung, executive chairman of the meeting and the presidium, presided over the meeting. Other executive chairmen of the meeting were Chen Kuiyuan, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Luosang Toinzhub, Jiang Chengguang, Ma Guanghua, Gao Shizhen, Zheng Guangju, Zhan Dui, Ni Zhicheng, Baima Ciren, Chilai, Wang Xiaoruo, Luosang Xinba, Cidian Lamu, Yixi Danzeng, Lu Sheng, Liao Jikang, Sangzhub, and Xiangba Pingcuo. Wu Shunxiang, who was entrusted by the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government to make the report, said in his report: Tibet continued to adhere to the reform and opening up policy in 1993 and the region's economic and social development maintained at a considerable speed last year. Over the past year, under the leadership of the regional CPC Committee and government, following the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important remarks made during his south China tour, centering on economic construction, and proceeding from reform, people of all nationalities in Tibet emancipated their minds and changed the conventional way of thinking, enabling Tibet to take a new step forward in carrying out reform and opening up -- its production and construction developed rapidly and in a steady and sustained manner; and work in the science and technology, education, and other social sectors developed in a coordinated manner. The region's 1993 gross product, calculated using current prices, reached 3.65 billion yuan -- in terms of comparable prices, this represents an 8.1-percent increase over the previous year, which was higher than the planned growth of 8 percent. With the public ownership system as the pillar, a diversified economic setup in which simultaneous development was made in all economic sectors began to take shape. The market was brisk, the economy prospered, and the people's livelihood continued to improve. To completely fulfill the 1994 plan, the report stressed that work in few important areas must be properly carried out. They are: First, we should do everything we can to increase incomes of the masses of peasants and herdsmen; second, we should ensure that reform of state-owned enterprises is properly carried out; third, we should endeavor to develop the market; fourth, we should strictly control price increases; fifth, we should make positive efforts to reform the workers pension system and the unemployment insurance system; sixth, we should deepen reform of the fixed asset investment system and further improve the management of capital construction projects. Based on an overall analysis of last year's economic performance, Wu Shunxiang pointed out in his report: In 1994, Tibet's economy can still maintain a good growth trend. As long as we do our work well in all areas, we will be able to develop the economy in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner, as required by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu in his government work report. Pingcuo, who was entrusted by the autonomous regional government to make the report, said in his report: Following the more than 100 million yuan in financial revenue in 1992, Tibet's financial revenue further increased in 1993 -- reaching 156 million yuan, a 43.5-percent increase over the previous year, which was higher than the region's gross product growth. Financial expenditures in 1993 was 2.16012 million yuan, a net increase of 494,820 yuan -- or 30 percent -- over the 1992 final account value. Both the absolute amount of increase in expenditure and the increase percentage were the highest in recent years. The guiding thoughts for the preparation of the 1994 budget are: to ensure the supply of daily necessities for the people; to ensure that reform can be carried out smoothly; to support construction; while ensuring funds for wages and basic public expenditures, to smoothly promote financial, taxation, and other major economic reforms; to strive to open up new financial sources and to increase revenues; to adjust the expenditure structure -- supporting selected agricultural, animal husbandry, science and technology, and educational projects and to the construction of infrastructural facilities; and sharply reducing general consumption expenditures to ensure that the economy develops in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner and to maintain social stability. Tibet's party, government, and military leaders attended yesterday's meeting. All members attending the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference attended the meeting as observers. Yesterday's meeting should have been attended by 448 deputies; 358 deputies, meeting the quorum, attended the meeting.
