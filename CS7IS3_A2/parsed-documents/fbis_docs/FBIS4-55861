This was stated by HDZ Secretary General Jure Radic for Croatian Television's Dnevnik [news] program on Thursday night. Dr. Radic appeared as a guest on the Dnevnik program shortly after the voting on the aforementioned agreement at the session of the HDZ Presidency. "Considering that, according to the HDZ Statute, the Presidency makes all important political decisions and is accountable for them, it is quite clear that the HDZ accepts the agreement signed on Wednesday without any reservations, and that it will carry it through," the HDZ secretary general said. Parliamentary Crisis Avoided Radic said that "a possible parliamentary crisis had been avoided in the best way," with the signing of an agreement. He stressed that the HDZ had approached the agreement with clear stands and the desire to offer to the opposition parties the number of leading posts in the assembly to which they are entitled to according to the percentage of their deputies in the Assembly of the Republic of Croatia. He said that the same principle applies to the HDZ, which means that posts of the chairmen of both assembly chambers belong to the HDZ. Commenting on the view expressed by Drazen Budisa, leader of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, that thanks to the signed agreement, the Croatian Assembly will no longer be able to function as a mouthpiece [transmisija] of the ruling party and the president of the state, Dr. Radic said that the Assembly had not been the mouthpiece of anyone in the executive authority nor of the president of the state in the past either. He said that the Assembly of the Republic of Croatia has the constitutionally regulated powers and tasks, and it has been and will be functioning in a democratic way as a multiparty assembly. Dr. Jure Radic said that the agreement signed on Wednesday is "yet another confirmation of the principles that exist in a multiparty system founded on the results of the elections." New Names by the End of the Week In response to a question by the Dnevnik editor concerning the election of the future leading people in the assembly, Dr. Radic said that the representatives of the parliamentary parties have agreed to complete all the necessary consultations in connection with that this week, and after that they will inform the public on who the new assembly officials will be. Replying at the end of the interview to a question on whether the assembly, following the signing of this agreement, will begin its work and deal with the vital issues for which it has the mandate of the Croatian electorate, Dr. Jure Radic said that he thought that the public was pleased with the signing of the agreement and that the public was in fact one of the reasons as to why the agreement was signed. The HDZ secretary general repeated that the starting points of the agreement were that the election results, which stipulate that the top posts in both assembly chambers belong to the HDZ, be taken as the criterion.
