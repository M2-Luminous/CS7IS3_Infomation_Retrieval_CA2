FR940527-1-00129 FR940527-1-00014 The chart shows the causes of the decline in the rate-of-increase projections since the final rule for FY 1994. As the chart shows, the decline in the rate of increase projections is due almost entirely to a decline in the rate of increase projections for Medicare inpatient capital. (As the chart also shows, the rate of increase projections for Medicare enrollment, Medicare admissions incidence, and Medicare admissions, have changed only marginally.) In turn, the decline in the rate of increase projections for Medicare inpatient capital is the result of declines in the rate of increase projections for total inpatient capital and Medicare share. For FY 1993, the panel survey data that we use to develop the projected rate of increase for total inpatient capital shows a decline in actual interest payments compared to FY 1992. We believe that this decline in interest payments is due to refinancing of debt instruments by hospitals to take advantage of lower interest rates. For FY 1994 and FY 1995, we are projecting that total inpatient capital cost increases will return to the level at which increases for depreciation costs alone have been running (i.e., 7&hyph;8 percent) as the number of refinancings declines. The projection of the rate of increase in Medicare share for FY 1993 is similarly grounded in panel survey data. The panel survey data for that year show that, contrary to our previous assumption, Medicare day share has not been increasing in proportion to the increase in Medicare admissions. We have accordingly reduced the FY 1994 and FY 1995 rate of increase projections for Medicare share to account for that fact. In addition to the decline in the rate of increase estimates since the FY 1994 final rule, there has been a slight (^0.54 percent) decrease in the FY 1992 cost per case in the December 1993 HCRIS data, compared to the June 1993 HCRIS data that we used for FY 1994. The following chart shows the combined effect of the reduced rates of increase estimates and the reduced FY 1992 cost per case by comparing the projections from FY 1992 to FY 1995 at the time of the FY 1994 final rule and in this proposed rule.
