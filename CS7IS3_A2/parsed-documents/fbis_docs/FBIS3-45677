The conference called on the people of various nationalities and all circles across the region to work with one heart and one mind, to pool the efforts of all and to strive to realize our region's two expected goals by the end of this century and to realize the grand objective of "marching towards the front rank." The conference was presided over by Wang Qun. Qian Fenyong gave an important speech. Bai Enpei, Wang Zhao, Geriletu and Wuyunwimuge attended the conference. In his speech, Qian Fenyong first relayed the guidelines of the national united front work conference. He said: The national united front work conference was held at the time when our country's reform, opening up and modernization have entered a new historical stage. The conference used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guidance, conscientiously studied and clearly defined the new situation and new tasks facing the current united front work. Qian Fenyong said: Inner Mongolia is a border minority area and the first region of our country where the regional national autonomy is implemented. The characteristics of having minority nationalities to live in compact communities and various religions have enabled our regional united front work to occupy an important position and to play an important role. To accelerate the pace of reform, opening up and economic development, Inner Mongolia must mobilize the strength of all sectors to participate in reform and construction and safeguard national unity, the reunification of the motherland and stability in the border areas. Along with the establishment of the socialist market economic system, the new pattern of establishing a structure of ownership with socialist public ownership as the main body and the joint development of multiple economic sectors is taking shape in our region and the rank of workers of the non-public sector is being expanded unceasingly. Under such circumstances, our region's united front has become greater in scope with more objects and heavy tasks. Party committees and governments at all levels, in particular, the party's leading cadres at all levels, should fully understand the important significance of our region's united front work from the strategic perspective of promoting the building of two civilizations, democracy and the legal system, safeguarding stability in the border areas and realizing a long period of order and stability, adopt practical and effective measures, strive to form a new atmosphere in our region's united front work and create a new situation. Qian Fenyong said: To comprehensively promote our region's united front work, we must particularly grasp well four current tasks. First, we should conscientiously do nationalities work well. To successfully carry out nationalities work, the most crucial and core issue is to accelerate our region's economic development. At present, we should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the eighth enlarged plenary session of the fifth regional party committee under the guidance of the spirit of the decision of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC central Committee, regard the establishment of the socialist market economic system as the objective and carry out our work in close connection with the main theme of reform, opening up and development. We should continue to consolidate and develop a socialist national relation of equality, mutual help, unity and cooperation among the people of various nationalities and strengthen the great unity among people of various nationalities; second, we should strengthen management over religious affairs in line with law. We should comprehensively and correctly implement the party's policy on reform of religious beliefs, consolidate and develop the patriotic united front between the party and the religious circles and concentrate the will and strength of all religious believers on the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Meanwhile, we should ban and deal strict blows to illegal and law-breaking activities in line with law and channel religious activities to the path of policies and law; third, we should further strengthen the democratic party work. It is necessary to continuously uphold and improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC and give full play to the role of democratic parties and nonparty personages in joining the discussion of political affairs and democratic supervision. Party committees, people's congresses, governments, and the committees of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at all levels should realistically issue specific policies in an effort to institutionalize, standardize and regularize political consultation and democratic supervision. Party committees at all levels should strengthen the selection and training of nonparty cadres and unceasingly improve their quality; fourth, we should do a better job in united front work in various spheres and boost the enthusiasm of all sectors. It is necessary to further strengthen the work on intellectuals outside the party, unite with and mobilize the nonparty intellectuals to actively offer plans and measures and give full play to the role of the united front as a "tank of personnel." We should strengthen overseas united front work, give play to the role of overseas friendship associations, make friends extensively, and attract more compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and Overseas Chinese compatriots to come to our region on tour and observation and for making investments and engaging in economic and trade activities. Wang Qun gave a speech at the end of the conference. He pointed out: The united front is an important magic weapon for our country to win a victory in revolution and construction. During the new historical period, the united front has a more extensive and profound historical significance. Party and government departments at all levels across the region, in particular, the principal leaders, should fully understand the important meaning of our region's united front work and conscientiously study and deeply understand the spirit of the national and regional united front work conferences. In implementing the party's united front policy, the task of prime importance is to grasp nationalities work. We should continue to consolidate and develop socialist national relations; uphold and improve the regional national autonomy system; and strive to accelerate economic development and social progress in minority areas. Wang Qun stressed: We should unite with all the forces that can be united, mobilize and educate people of various nationalities and various circles across the region to work with one heart and one mind, pool the efforts of all to overcome difficulties, and struggle to win a comprehensive victory of reform, opening up, development, unity and progress in our region.
