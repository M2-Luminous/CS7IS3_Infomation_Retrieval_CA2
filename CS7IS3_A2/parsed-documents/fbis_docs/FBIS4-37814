Muhsin Dallul said the government wanted Syrian troops, which entered in 1976 at the request of the Arab League, to stay in Lebanon to help the army in deploying in all parts of the country following the end of the civil war. "We need help from the Syrian forces in providing some brigades to be sent to the south in case there was an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied areas," he told the United Arab Emirates daily AL- KHALIJ. "Our relationship with the Syrian forces is strategic in this respect. There are several areas where we need the support of the Syrians. This issue is not for discussion at all because the Syrian forces came to Lebanon at an official request and their stay is still demanded officially." Israel, which controls a border strip in the south to prevent cross-border attacks by Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas, has accused the nearly 35,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon of backing the guerrillas. It has also called for border security arrangements with Lebanon as one of the conditions for quitting the south. "We reject any talk about security arrangements with Israel," he said. "We are sticking to UN Resolution 425 and we have the capability of preventing any infiltration or operation from the south against Israel after the implementation of that resolution," Dallul said. "But if Israel stayed, then we have a great national decision, which considers the attacks against the Israelis in the south as legitimate because we are not policemen for protecting the occupation. We reject this occupation and believe the resistance is carrying out a legitimate and national duty, which must continue so long as the occupation stays." Dallul said Israel wanted to destabilise Lebanon to scare away tourists, a key hard currency earner for Lebanon. He expected Israel to continue attacks on Lebanon but added: "Let Israel do whatever it wants. We will not fulfill its wishes and we will not stop resistance attacks."
