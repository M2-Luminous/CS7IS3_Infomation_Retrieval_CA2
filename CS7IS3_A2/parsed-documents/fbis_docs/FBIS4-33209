Maestro emphasized: "The lack of encouragement for regional economies has caused many companies to collapse." He went to Government House to meet Presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf. He said: "Chubut is trying to implement key mechanisms to revitalize production." Maestro noted: "This involves fiscal policies like the removal of taxes. We have removed energy taxes and rural real estate taxes and are now implementing a dynamic loan policy." The Chubut governor emphasized that his province "currently has a $100-million loan portfolio for productive sectors, with very low interest rates, 10-year repayment periods, and up to three-year grace periods to begin repaying loans." The Radical Civic Union governor concluded: "By implementing all these measures, we are trying to alleviate a very complex situation in the field of production."
