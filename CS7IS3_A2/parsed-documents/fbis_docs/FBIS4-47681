FBIS4-47681 "drafr084_c_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 2 May South African Press Review for 2 May MB0205112394 MB0205112394 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Inefficient Election--"Give or take a few rough edges," the South African election will probably be "a fair reflection of the broad will of the people," notes an editorial in the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 2 May on page 12. However, "too many foreign observers" assessed the polls "as remarkable and then added the rider `...by African standards.'" "A cold assessment of the election will not cast a particularly complimentary light on its administrators, the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]." Voting was "chaotic in some areas," as "vast numbers of ballot papers went missing and the required voting equipment just did not arrive." "Crisis management" was supplied as "the Government, the National Peace Secretariat and others came to the IEC's rescue." "The new South Africa could be born into a culture of sloppiness -- where crisis management becomes a way of life. During the transition to democracy it was sometimes necessary to bend the rules, to turn a blind eye. In the interests of good government and an ordered society, that must not be repeated." SOWETAN Journalists Coverage of Election -- As the media "definition of news" is "that which is unusual," says the editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN on 2 May, "it is therefore not susprising that they have turned the attention of the country to what went wrong during the election. We have written extensively about problems with the delivery of material to voting stations, the late starts at polling stations, the problems at the counting centres and the painful struggle to get the results out." "The only sad thing is that we might have shifted the focus away from the great things achieved in a short week of history-making." "We did not make a noise about the IEC's achievements." And the rightwing strategy to disrupt the elections "went terribly wrong. It seems its potential threat to a democratic South Africa was overblown or only in the imagination of foreign journalists." "It is now history that last week's four days of polling were the most peaceful in South Africa in years." BUSINESS DAY Loyal Opposition -- "By next week we will have swapped one-party rule for what might be no more than two-party power sharing in a government of national unity," notes an editorial headlined "Election Comment -- the Editor" in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 2 May on page 1. "Ironically the Nats [National Party] will be cast in the role of a loyal opposition, loyal to the extent that party members will be in the Cabinet and will be jointly responsibile with ANC members for Cabinet decisions." "While the totalitarian impluse might be to dismiss the small parties as irrelevant, the contributions the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], Freedom Front and DP [Democratic Party] can make should not be overlooked. They might be thorns in the government's flesh and some might represent fairly narrow interests, but their opposition must be viewed as constructive if the country is to succeed in its quest for national reconciliation." The "different factions" of the ANC are expected to "hold together" and to "continue to do so for a while, reaping popular support from Nelson Mandela." "Eventually the ANC will need to develop a role as a broadly popular party of the center capable of building a strong economy while retaining mass support," however "this may eventually cost the party a radical wing which tires of power-sharing." "Making the transition will be a necessary foundation for the country's future stability. It will be made easier if the concept of a loyal opposition is acknowledged for the first time in decades." New Economic Era -- The country is poised to enter a new economic era, just as surely it is entering a new political one," notes an editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY on 2 May on page 12. "South Africans need and expect thoughtful economic stewardship just as they need and expect thoughtful political management. Without the first, the second cannot succeed." While the threats of inflation and recession remain, "sound economic stewardship" implies "fiscal incentives that encourage industrialists to expand and to create jobs." While funds have been promised from abroad, state borrowing cannot "force up interest rates to levels that halt industrial expansion. Sound economic stewardship should, however, lead to growth rates that quickly expand the country's tax base. The conomic cake will then be big enough for eveyone to have a fair share."
