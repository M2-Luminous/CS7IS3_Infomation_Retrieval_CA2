The election race has shown that the voters' preferences will depend on how convincing a presidential candidate's plan is on the two main problems: the conflict with Ingushetia and a political status for South Ossetia acceptable for the northerners. There are six presidential candidates in the race today. They are Akhsarbek Galazov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of North Ossetia; Prime Minister Sergey Khetagurov; Taymuraz Batagov, the deputy internal affairs minister; Ilya Bekmurazov, chief of the republic's tax inspectorate; Mukharbek Kisiyev, chairman of the Pension Fund; and Georgiy Kodzayev, rector of the Highlands Agricultural Academy. Akhsarbek Galazov and Sergey Khetagurov stand better chances. True, Galazov's rating dropped somewhat in the wake of Boris Yeltsin's visit to the Northern Caucasus. He is being accused of a compromise approach to the Ingush-Ossetia problem. Galazov's opponents try to blame him for President Yeltsin's edict, which rescinded the local parliament's decision on the impossibility of Ossetians and Ingushi living together and caused an explosion of dissatisfaction in Ossetia. At the same time, Akhsarbek Galazov secured 138,000 votes in the elections for the Federal Assembly. This is an impressive showing if one considers that the elections were taking place right on the heels of Boris Yeltsin's visit to the Northern Caucasus. The other contender -- Sergey Khetagurov -- also has high chances to win. He is a new-wave politician, a pragmatist. He is supported by local economic managers, directors, and entrepreneurs. Even the economic troubles worsened by the conflict with Ingushetia and the republic's active part in the South Ossetian problem have far from dismayed the North Ossetia premier. On the contrary, they have only made his authority stronger. One piece of evidence is an unofficial dialogue with Chechnya President Dzhokhar Dudayev, held on Khetagurov's initiative. The result: After these negotiations Groznyy has repeatedly confirmed its noninterference in the Ingush-Ossetia conflict. The North Ossetia prime minister's positions became even stronger after Boris Yeltsin's visit to the state of emergency zone. Sergey Khetagurov spoke sharply against Moscow's stance. He thinks that as an arbiter the Kremlin gambles on force whereas one should give a possibility and time for Ossetians and Ingush themselves to agree. The fact that Khetagurov swims against the stream, never fearing for his career, secures him additional votes. Aleksandr Dzasokhov, former CPSU Central Committee secretary, was seen as the third main candidate for presidency of the republic. However, the "Styr Nykhas" public organization asked Dzasokhov to pull out of the election marathon. He complied, announcing that a radical change of leaders threatens the republic with tipping the fragile political balance. Another argument given by "Styr Nykhas" is that the victory for Dzasokhov, for example, may cause a repetition of the Chechnya variant. A power struggle against the backdrop of the South Ossetia problem and the dispute over Prigorodnyy Rayon may split North Ossetia. Evidently only Sergey Khetagurov is trying to outdistance Akhsarbek Galazov. According to unofficial information, one of the four remaining candidates, or all of them, might do on the last day before the elections what Dzasokhov did.
