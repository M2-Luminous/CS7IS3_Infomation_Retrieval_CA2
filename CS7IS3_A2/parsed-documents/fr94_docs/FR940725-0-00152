FR940725-0-00152 FR940725-0-00019 Lack of training was evident in all of the confined space accidents which I have investigated. The current 1915 standard is not adequate when addressing training requirements. While the 1915 standards state that the SCP [shipyard competent person] must have certain abilities it does not require formal training. There are also no formal training requirements for personnel working in confined spaces. These deficiencies should be addressed. The SCP should receive formal training on testing, ventilation, fire and explosive and toxic hazards as is being currently covered by NFPA SCP courses. General workers do not require the same level of training but should be instructed as to the hazards associated with confined spaces and the employer's testing, entry, hot work and space labeling or identification program. [Ex. 11&hyph;10] OSHA's requirements for shipyard competent persons are contained in final §1915.7, which is discussed earlier in this preamble. The employer is responsible for ensuring that these designated individuals have knowledge and skills appropriate for determining whether or not a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere is safe to enter. The employer cannot have the necessary information to designate a person as a competent person unless that employer either provides the necessary training or ensures that the person has already received it. In addition, if the competent person is not an employee, the employer will not usually be the source of that person's training. Therefore, rather than specifying shipyard competent person training this final rule focuses on the abilities and skills of the competent person and holds the employer responsible for determining that the competent person meets those requirements. Other commenters suggested that OSHA require all exposed shipyard employees to receive training as outlined in the SESAC recommendation (Ex. 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;50). They argued that all workers that work in areas containing confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres should be aware of the hazards of unrestricted entry into those spaces. For example, the U.S. Department of the Navy (Ex. 11&hyph;30) stated: All workers except those who will never be involved with confined space entry/work should be trained. Minimum knowledge should be a well understood concept of what a confined or enclosed space is, what the potential hazards are, and the need for space evaluation by a knowledgeable individual and, in some cases, certification by a ``qualified person'' prior to entry and work. One commenter, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) (Ex. 11&hyph;51), suggested that the standard specify that employees receive classroom-type training. They were concerned that employees would receive a simple briefing rather than actual training. They stated their concerns as follows: The ability to have specific directions to train and provide annual review with classroom type instruction, and where the instructor has direct inter-play with the employee, is the most desirable, as well as preferred. One of the big problems that we have always felt has been the issue in training is the addressing of specific training. In the training of employees at our facility, stand-up safety briefings are used for training in Haz Com. The employee is asked to sign the back of this briefing to show they have attended and received the training. In the briefings given, the person giving the briefing has had little or no formal training on the subject material, making it a perfect ``paper program''. The only way we know it does not work is through interviews with the employees. It is therefore imperative that the recommendations of SESAC be followed, as they are most inclusive and specific, and that the instructors be knowledgeable of the subject material. OSHA has not adopted the IBEW's suggestion. Employers may use classroom or ``on-the-job'' instruction or a combination of the two in complying with final §1915.12(d). The primary objective of final §1915.12(d) is to ensure that employees will be familiar with the subjects listed under paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3). There may be wide variations in the combinations of classroom and on-the-job training that may be necessary for different work sites, configurations, and control measures. On the other hand, OSHA shares IBEW's concern that some employers might try to comply with the standard through simple briefings that impart little knowledge to employees. In enforcing final revised Subpart B, the Agency will determine whether employees have learned the subject matter addressed by the standard by interviewing employees and reviewing the employer's procedures for dealing with communicating hazard information and ensuring employees have the skills necessary to do their jobs. In addition the Agency will examine the employer's certification that the training has been provided as required by final §1915.12(d)(5). It should be noted that, whatever the method of training that is provided, it must be provided before an employee enters a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere, as required by final §1915.12(d)(4). The requirements adopted in final §1915.12(d) are based on the recommendations of SESAC as presented in the notice reopening the record on Subpart B. The purpose of these requirements, along with an explanation of any differences between the final rule and SESAC's proposed language, is presented in the following discussion. In paragraph (d)(1), OSHA is requiring employers to ensure that employees who must enter confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres are trained to perform their duties safely. This provision is intended to ensure that employees are familiar with the duties imposed by final revised Subpart B so that the work practices they use will conform to the standard and will protect them from hazards posed by these spaces. In paragraph (d)(2), OSHA is requiring employers to ensure that each employee who must enter confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres is trained to recognize and understand the hazards or hazardous conditions he or she may encounter during entry. The specific hazards or hazardous conditions that OSHA addresses are found in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(vii) and they include the following: (1) Recognition of the characteristics of the space, (2) Anticipation and awareness of the hazards that may be encountered during entry, (3) Recognition of the signs, symptoms, or other adverse health effects that may be caused by exposure to hazards,
