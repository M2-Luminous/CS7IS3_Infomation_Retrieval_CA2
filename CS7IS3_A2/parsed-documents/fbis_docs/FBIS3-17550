If the islands are transferred to Japan, "there will be no need for us to keep the Pacific Fleet, because it will have no access to the ocean," Ustinov believes. In his opinion, Russia has virtually lost the Baltic and the Black Sea Fleets. The possibilities of the Northern Fleet have been considerably reduced. Ustinov suggested that the withdrawal of an aviation regiment from the South Kurils shows that "some politicians continue to pursue the aim of playing "the Kuril card" and selling the islands to Japan." The press conference heard the concepts of the State Duma committees on geopolitics and security regarding state borders. Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Security Viktor Ilyukhin believes that normal border demarcation would take 5-7 years and cost two to three Russian annual budgets. In this connection, he believes that the CIS countries should have a single external border and single border troops. And technically they should reinforce only the border with the Baltic states. Ilyukhin is convinced that the internal borders between CIS countries should only be concerned with hygiene control.
