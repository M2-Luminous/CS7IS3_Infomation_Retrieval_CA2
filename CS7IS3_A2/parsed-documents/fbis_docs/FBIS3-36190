Its participants considered the draft regulations which will be worked up in two weeks and which will determine the principles of mutual relations between the neighboring oblasts. According to Vadym Chuprun, the meeting proved that there are no discrepancies among the leaders of the oblasts, that all disputable issues relate mostly to customs service and the border, but they should be tackled at the interstate level. At the previous meeting of oblast leaders they discussed the issue on granting them the status of border zones which would contribute to establishing normal mutual relations. This issue was to be solved by the governments of both countries. Unfortunately, Vadym Chuprun pointed out, while Russia did take certain steps in this direction, the Ukrainian Government did not respond to the appeal by the participants in the Belgorod meeting. The current meeting approved an appeal to Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin with the request to help establish normal neighborly relations between the neighboring states.
