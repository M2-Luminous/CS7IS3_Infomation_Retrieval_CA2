This information was released by Under Secretary of Aviation Mario Fernandez after attending an academic briefing on the subject held at the Political Science Institute of the University of Chile. [Begin Fernandez recording] As far as I know, a commission will be traveling within the next few days. It is part of the decisionmaking process. I responsibly said here -- just as ex-Defense Minister Patricio Rojas put it before leaving his post -- that substantial progress has been made toward making a decision on the Belgian Mirages. This does not mean a final decision has already been made. Several steps are still to be taken, and they are the steps that the Air Force and the Defense Ministry are responsibly taking. [end recording] Mario Fernandez added that the purchase of these planes was announced at the end of the previous administration by then Defense Minister Patricio Rojas, and that this was a gesture of political responsibility. [Begin Fernandez recording, in progress] ...because the entire process of the examination of various alternatives for replacement of the Hunters, which the Chilean Air Force has implemented, to some extent reached a conclusion during the previous administration. Upon conclusion of the process, it is obvious that the government had to make a decision to support this technical decision. Before leaving his post, ex-Minister Rojas made the decision and announced it. In this regard I believe that the proper conclusion of all the proposals or initiatives of an administration is a gesture of political responsibility. [end recording] If the deal is finally made, the Belgian planes will replace the obsolete Hawker Hunters which the Air Force has used since the end of the 1960's. Experts have noted the importance of the possible purchase of the Mirages, which will give our Air Force top offensive power in this part of the world.
