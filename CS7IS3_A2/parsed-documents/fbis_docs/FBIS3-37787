How did you construct this diplomatic success? [Adamishin] We had been moving toward this goal for almost a year and a half. At that time, we had already made a proposal at the UN General Assembly to demilitarize Sarajevo and place it under UN protection. We worked with all the sides but certainly used the leverage that we have had on the Serbs. I believe that it is difficult for anyone else to have more influence than us in this field. It was not that we were defending their position to the bitter end or that we were manifesting our pan-Slavism. The Serbs were aware of the fact that we supported a balanced political settlement. [Sergi] Therefore they took you seriously. [Adamishin] Now they believe in us. For this reason, when Yeltsin made a proposal for the unilateral withdrawal of their heavy weapons from the hills around Sarajevo, they said yes. It was the culmination of our efforts as well as a clear manifestation that political methods prevail over the use of force when settling conflicts. [Sergi] This was a point of major dispute between Russia and the foreign governments. [Adamishin] Yes. You see, we share more or less the same view as our partners on "what" must be done. However, the positions diverge on "how" it must be done. We have always been supporters of political methods over the use of force except for very specific, restricted cases regulated by the United Nations. For this reason we did not like the NATO ultimatum which, to tell the truth, shuffled the cards. The talks had already begun and the ultimatum made the Muslims become more uncompromising. The situation became difficult, there was no way out. Russia brought its own influence into play to find a way out. If things go well, if the other side now does what the Serbs have done, we will truly be able to speak of an opening in the Bosnian situation. After Sarajevo, the accord can be further extended. [Sergi] What guarantees do you have that the Serb side will not have second thoughts? [Adamishin] The guarantees are those of the Bosnian Serbs' elective assembly. The decision was not made by one man alone. I do not see any reason why they should break their promise. The weapons have been withdrawn. [Sergi] Your envoy, Churkin, has said that if the Serbs were to change their mind, even Russia will change its position. Is this so? [Adamishin] I do not want to consider hypothetical situations. And then I would not want to contradict Churkin who has done very well. [Sergi] We have also been forced to note some rigidity over the past few hours. Yeltsin has given a warning, Churkin has again pointed his finger against the ultimatum. Strong notes... [Adamishin] I have not noticed these strong notes. In my opinion the NATO ultimatum could be judged even more severely. [Sergi] So you are still using soft notes? [Adamishin] For me they are. You see, the NATO ultimatum took over from the United Nations to put us out of the game. Or rather, thinking that we would be placed out of the game. I repeat: the ultimatum upset negotiations. I have already said that the Muslims immediately became more inflexible. The ultimatum is a mistake. It was made on the wave of public indignation over the Sarajevo market massacre. I fully share this indignation, but taking decisions of such an importance with consequences that are difficult to calculate on the basis of emotions is a little too much. [Sergi] There are reports that the massacre was the work of Muslim formations. What do you say? [Adamishin] If the Serbs had been guilty, it would have been made known immediately. If there had been certain evidence, it would have been made known. We also have some information in our possession that would point to strangers not from the area as being guilty. [Sergi] Strangers in which sense? [Adamishin] I am referring to people that arrived in Bosnia from outside... [Sergi] From where? [Adamishin] What do you mean from where? It is a known fact that there are various kinds of mujahedin on the Muslim side. This is what I mean when I refer to people that came from outside. [Sergi] Do you mean that you actually know about this. [Adamishin] I would not want to swear to the leaks. But they do exist. [Sergi] Do you have some clue if not certain evidence? [Adamishin] We can judge on the basis of what the others say. We are distant from these places. The results of the investigations to date tell us that it is not known where the grenade came from. Officially I must keep to these versions. However I have read -- and these are leaks from Western sources -- about the involvement of forces that are not connected with the parties in question. [Sergi] It has also been said that with your initiative you have done a favor to the West, which could not wait to get itself out of difficulty after the threat to bomb. Is this so? [Adamishin] First and foremost, we did something entirely in favor of Sarajevo. If, along the way, we also did a small favor to the West it would not be a bad thing either. [Sergi] Could there have been a secret accord between Yeltsin and Clinton? The United States could have reasoned this way: If Russia convinces the Serbs to withdraw we will publicly recognize your diplomatic success... [Adamishin] You do not have a very good opinion of us. You think that we would act upon the suggestions of others. Russia has carried out an independent role, its own role, over the past months. We would like to see it concerted with the positions of the others, but it is the others that sometimes push us out. [Sergi] What will the next move be? [Adamishin] In my opinion it should be an attempt to go beyond the Sarajevo accord. That is, the search for a global solution to the conflict. We are close enough to the result. [Sergi] Churkin has returned to the area of conflict. Why? [Adamishin] He is going to Croatia where our battalion is. To stay there. To avoid any incitement or wrong moves. He will be in Sarajevo on his birthday. [Sergi] If there was no secret accord with the White House, are we therefore witnessing the onset of a new rivalry between Russia and the United States? [Adamishin] I would not want to light the fire on diversities. Certainly, as I have already said, we did not like the NATO ultimatum also because of the fact that it excluded Russia from the decisionmaking room. And all this while the positions on the crux of the problem were quite close. We do not agree that NATO should decide on these matters. If it is a matter of using force in international relations the Security Council must give the authorization. [Sergi] The partnership is not in danger then? [Adamishin] We want a partnership with the United States and NATO. But it should be seen as being a two-way street. We do not like this partnership if decisions are made without consulting Russia.
