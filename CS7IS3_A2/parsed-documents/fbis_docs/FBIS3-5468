"We are ready to cooperate with the United States on several problems but we will not accept any issue becoming a precondition for the normalisation of diplomatic relations," a foreign ministry spokesman said. Christopher said Saturday in Hawaii before heading off for an Asia-Pacific tour that Vietnam needed to make progress in its human rights record, settle claims by US businesses and resolve questions on US service personnel missing since the conflict in Indochina. "There are a great many things they would have to do before normal relations can be established," Christopher said. US and Vietnamese met in New York last week to discuss human rights in an atmosphere described by Hanoi as "constructive," although no other details merged from the meeting. Vietnam has said it welcomes dialogue on the issue but will not countenance "interference in its internal affairs." A recent State Department report on Vietnam's human rights record welcomed changes to the constitution that enshrine certain legal rights, but accused Hanoi of detaining dissidents who peacefully expressed political views. The secretary of state praised Hanoi for its help in the search for the 1,647 US personnel still listed as missing in action in Vietnam, which has diminished as a obstacle to ties due to increased cooperation from authorities here. Officials from both sides also said they had made "some progress" in talks in Hanoi last week on opening liaison offices and settling claims on more than 500 million dollars in assets seized by both sides in 1975 after the Vietnam War.
