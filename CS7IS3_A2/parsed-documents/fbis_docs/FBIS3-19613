The main group will come home Sunday [20 March]. Approximately 120 of the Norwegian soldiers who have served in the headquarters company in the Somalian capital of Mogadishu will arrive by plane in Gardermoen. They will then continue on to Onsrud barracks for medical tests and to hand in all their equipment before being dismissed. "Once again, it will be a withdrawal command group comprising 10 men that will monitor the loading and shipping of equipment," said Colonel Ove Stromberg of FDI 4/IR4 [expansion unknown] in charge of mobilizing the UN forces in that country. The group in question will be traveling home just before Easter, leaving behind just five Norwegians who will help the remaining UN force to take over the headquarters. These last five men will return in early May. Most of the equipment that the Norwegian company had at its disposal will be transported back to Norway, while some will be sold in Somalia, and Stromberg revealed that some will also be given to aid organizations. Check Once they have returned, both troops and officers will be subjected to the same procedures as all UN troops undergo. These will comprise a medical check and talks, and Onsrud also intends to take up contact with the civil health authorities covering the areas where the soldiers live to ask them to do any necessary follow-up. This is something that has been done in the wake of a major UNIFIL [UN Interim Force in Lebanon] study of servicemen who had returned from Lebanon. It has been suggested that the Somalia company will be eligible for transfer to Bosnia, but Stromberg ruled this out. The troops will be dismissed in the usual manner, although it is of course by no means out of the question that some of them will be selected again -- say for service in Bosnia, he said. UN duty is beginning to be a heavy burden on the Norwegian defense authorities, and certain categories of specialized personnel are extremely hard to find. This is the case, for example, for mechanics, who are meant to keep the fleet of vehicles in good running order. It is also proving difficult to find enough people in the medical service. The defense authorities want a form of rotation so that UN service does not become a "life-style" and would prefer to see around 25 percent of personnel receiving new contracts. However, in some groups this percentage is already close to 40. Indian and Pakistani troops will now be the main force within UNOSOM -- the UN force in Somalia. The force totals 20,000 men. The U.S. forces will be out of the country before the end of the month.
