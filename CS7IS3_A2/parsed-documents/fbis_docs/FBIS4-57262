FBIS4-57262 "drlat095_k_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Ministry Corrects Announcement Ministry Corrects Announcement PY1605224094 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2133 GMT 16 May 94 PY1605224094 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 May (EFE) -- The Economy Ministry corrected an announcement made by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo concerning the alleged three-month postponement of the implementation of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur). A mistake by an official seemingly misrepresented Cavallo's remarks in the ROK, which had caused surprise in domestic political, diplomatic, and economic spheres. According to official information, Cavallo had announced in Seoul that Mercosur would go into effect on 1 April 1995, with a three-month delay in its original schedule. When three hours had elapsed since the information's release and after journalists' insistence on learning the reason why the Argentine economy minister unilaterally announced the alleged postponement, an Economy Ministry official acknowledged that he made a mistake "when transcribing the tape" on which Cavallo's remarks had been recorded. Having met with the ROK's minister of the Economic Planning Board, Chae-sok Chong, Cavallo commented that "Mercosur will grow at a faster pace than NAFTA." To support his statement, Cavallo noted that the Mercosur member countries' economies are "undergoing tremendous growth, as evinced by the Argentine case."
