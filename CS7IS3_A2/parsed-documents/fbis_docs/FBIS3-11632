These surrenders have made the North Americans furious, and the problem is going from bad to worse. A top-level meeting to discuss the problem was held at the Presidential Palace this morning. At the end of the meeting, one of the participants, the government minister, played down the importance of the controversy. [Begin recording] [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] It was a working meeting, just like the others we have been holding in recent weeks, to coordinate among the Executive Branch, the Prosecutor's Office, and the Attorney General's Office the implementation of the surrender policy to benefit justice in the country and to use it as a tool to end impunity. [Reporter] I imagine that the prosecutor general versus the U.S. Congress topic was discussed at the meeting. [Villegas] We discussed, among other topics, the international effects of disagreements over the surrender policy. I hope that the drug-consuming nations in general and the international community will continue and even step up the efforts made so far to support Colombia's struggle against drug trafficking.
