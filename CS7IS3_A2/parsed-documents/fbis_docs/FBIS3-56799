In particular Vitaliy Kononov, chairman of the party, and Sergey Kurykin, chairman of its political council, took part in the session. The "greens" evaluated favorably the document, which had been signed. "The agreement gives a new impulse to making external ties more vigorous and strengthening them, which in its turn will stimulate potential foreign investors to become more active, Vitaliy Kononov noted. The reservation lies in the fact that compensation for nuclear weapons in the shape of fuel for operational Ukrainian atomic electric power station is not grounds for their further development." The concern of the Green Party of Ukraine is evoked by the conditions for processing and burying radioactive waste. Regarding the proposal of the Kharkov "greens" to nominate Leonid Kravchuk for the Nobel Peace Prize for steps toward the non-nuclear status of Ukraine, Kononov replied that the Green Party of Ukraine is still going to examine this issue, because at present they do not have information about the mechanism for granting this prize.
