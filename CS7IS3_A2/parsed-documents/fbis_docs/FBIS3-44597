The station has bought, but not scheduled for screening, the documentary, which triggered protests from China when the BBC showed it last month. Independent documentary maker Jeremy Bennett said TVB "should have the courage of their conviction to show the film". TVB first saw the one-hour documentary at the MIDCOM television festival in Cannes in October where, according to the head of sales for the French company Teleimages which co-produced and sold the documentary, "every station in Hong Kong wanted to buy the programme". TVB was the highest bidder, and according to Mr. Bennett, one of the first places in the world to purchase the programme in November. But TVB now says it has not decided when, or even if, it will screen the programme. The documentary, Mao, The Last Emperor, was bought for the English-language Pearl channel before the controversy exploded and the Chinese Government labelled it vicious slander. Mr. Bennett said he had been told of direct pressure being placed on Portugal, Britain and Singapore not to show the programme. While Portugal had ignored warnings that it could hurt relations between the two countries over Macao and the BBC screened it on December 20, Singapore withdrew from purchasing the programme after warnings from China. "I sincerely hope the TV station in Hong Kong will screen it. I don't see why the people of Hong Kong shouldn't see it, especially as this is such an important topic to them. I'm surprised they haven't already shown it," Mr. Bennett said. "Over 20 countries in the world, including all major European countries, are seeing this film, so why should people in Hong Kong be deprived of seeing this when it is more important." TVB spokesman Lily Chan said the station had not ruled out screening the contentious programme. She said the station had not talked to any Chinese officials about the documentary and that it would not expect any interference from China. "We don't anticipate any pressure because there hasn't been any so far, so this should not be part of the consideration about when, or if, to screen it," she said. She said the controversy surrounding the documentary was not the only criteria when considering its screening.
