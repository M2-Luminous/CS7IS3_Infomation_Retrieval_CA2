Over 100 dead and about 500 wounded are the consequence of the frenzied attacks by Karadzic's followers. Nothing is known about the fate of many people from the right bank of the Drina River. Many are believed to have been massacred and left among the charred remains of villages in the southern section of the battlefield. The battle hospital is caring for the wounded with superhuman efforts. There are no medicines, no surgical equipment, no power. There is also no hope that Gorazde's hellish experience is nearing an end. On the contrary, the attacks are increasing. Deadly tank shells are raining down from Ustipraca on both banks of the Drina. Infantry attacks against the defense lines of Kopaci are supported with fire from howitzers and all other artillery weapons. Chetniks are also attacking the defence lines of Gotunjak, [place name indistinct] Hill and Gradina. They are also launching attacks on the northern side of Gorazde from the direction of Metvici, toward the villages of Vrazalice and Tvitjak, and the Trovrh peak. The situation, however, is most critical at the approaches to the town, on the right bank of the Drina. Serbian and Montenegrin volunteers are systematically firing at civilian facilities. The town is being systematically destroyed with all available weapons since 0900 -- street by street, house by house. Many houses have been destroyed, many are in flames. It is futile to expect anything to change here without an urgent intervention by the international community.
