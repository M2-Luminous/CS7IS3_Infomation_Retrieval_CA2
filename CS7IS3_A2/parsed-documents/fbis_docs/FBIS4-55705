Every half-hour, the mechanism makes a grinding noise, reminding everyone that the time is slipping by for Moravcik and his coalition government. Installed in mid-March, the government now has just a few months until the early elections on 30 September and 1 October. It is not an enviable position to be in. Moravcik and his government, which comprises three politically very heterogeneous parties, must create some order in the economic, administrative, and political mess left behind by Vladimir Meciar, the populist and just as popular leader of the HZDS (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia), which, following a frontal assault on his politics by Slovak President Michal Kovac, had to leave the field. True, the new prime minister knows how to get nice figures in the popularity polls (about 25 percent), but that is still 9 percent less that his HZDS rival, who has long been busy with his election campaign, in which, as is customary, he tackle not so much the issues as the people. Jozef Moravcik, who in 1992 was the last Czech foreign minister and the Slovak foreign minister in Meciar's Cabinet, remains confident. He still has no time to conduct a campaign. He leads his Cabinet and does it conscientiously, soundly, and even a bit dully. He feels that his most important task is to quickly mend Slovakia's dilapidated image. The biggest obstacle to this is the time factor. So how big are the chances of the Slovak Government's winning this race against time? Moravcik answered the question with apparent reluctance. "It is indeed a race for which we have little time. There is only one way to win this race: Be consistent and systematic. First, the problems must be solved. These decisions were always postponed by the last government. The most important thing in this respect is privatization. We have to solve the problem of coupon privatization. We have already approved the time frame for this: The voucher booklets will be sold to the people in early September. Another problem is the budget. We are trying to maintain the deficit at 4 percent of the GNP. We want more favorable conditions for loans from businesses. The situation is not at all rosy as regards the financing of education and health care." Later this month, an IMF delegation will investigate the possibility of giving Slovakia a stand-by loan of $230 million. The condition for this loan is that Slovakia bring its budget deficit down from 23 to 6 billion krone (1.3 billion guilders [G] to G360 million). That will seem daring to a great many Slovak voters. Moravcik said: "The only way is to convince them that these resources are needed to stabilize the country's financial situation. Everyone feels the problems in this area very acutely." One of the government's most important goals is to restore international confidence in Slovakia and to attract foreign capital and investment. "We feel that people accept us and that we are successfully creating a positive attitude about ourselves. However, there is one problem: On the one hand, people are showing understanding, but, on the other, they are playing a waiting game. The crucial moment will come at the end of June, when the IMF makes a decision on the standby loan." "For Slovakia, it is not just a question of the standby loan," Moravcik said, "but also of the IMF's approval of its entire economic policy." During Vladimir Meciar's government, the impression was often given that Slovakia was a besieged fortress surrounded by enemies. What has Moravcik done to change this? "We do not at all have the feeling that we are enemies or that we have enemies. Our goal is to bring peace to the situation and not to get embroiled in counterproductive controversies. We are going to convince the voters that antagonistic politics does not offer any prospects for this country." One of the most controversial problems in Slovak domestic and foreign policy is the position of the Hungarian minority (11.5 percent of the population) and relations with Hungary. The last government tried to limit minority rights and took a tough confrontational stance vis-a-vis Budapest. The new government has taken a completely different tack: Not only was Moravcik's coalition government set up with support from the Hungarian minority party, but it also immediately began to improve the climate between Bratislava and Budapest. After much to-ing and fro-ing, this resulted in a talk between Moravcik and Hungarian Prime Minister Boross. "We wanted a meeting on a higher, official level, but we could not agree on the content of the communique, so we sought out another forum and decided on an informal meeting. In this way, we wanted to demonstrate that, although we are not currently in a position to resolve a number of open questions, such as the immutability of borders, the political will is there to seek out solutions in a friendly atmosphere."
