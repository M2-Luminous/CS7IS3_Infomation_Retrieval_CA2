We welcome banking organs from all countries to establish organs in Tianjin and we are certain they will thrive here. The Tianjin branch of the Foreign Exchange Bank of the ROK is the first branch bank of the ROK in China. The Foreign Exchange Bank is one of the major banks of the ROK with 238 branch banks and subbranches.

The warm and friendly reception the ROK national assembly speaker and some ministers of the government gave to the delegation left a profound impression on me. We have established friendly city relations with Inchon city. The ROK has speedily increased investments in Tianjin and the inauguration of the Tianjin branch of the Foreign Exchange Bank has shortened the distance between us. I am full of confidence in the prospects of cooperation. Mr. Yi Chang-U said: Through the municipal government delegation's visit to the ROK led by Mayor Zhang Lichang, the friendly contacts between the ROK and Tianjin will be further strengthened. Our branch bank in Tianjin will contribute to the two countries, and, in particular, to the economic development of the ROK and Tianjin.
