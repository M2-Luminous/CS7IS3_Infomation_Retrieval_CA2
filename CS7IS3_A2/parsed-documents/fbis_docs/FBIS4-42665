Respondents were asked whether the present Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] government's image is better or worse than that of the previous New Democracy [ND]. Some 36.6 percent thought it better, while 28.8 percent considered it worse. Another 30.7 percent thought it is the same, and 3.9 percent did not know or did not answer. The next question centered on whether the government is trusted to confront the current economic crisis and was asked over several consecutive months. In December 1993, positive answers amounted to 23.6 percent, compared with 37.8 percent negative answers and 38.7 percent who did not know or who thought it was too early to judge.

Finally, on 9-10 May, 33.7 percent said they trusted the government, compared with 64.6 percent who said they did not, and 1.7 percent who did not know. A 16 March MARTEL poll asked respondents to indicate which, in their opinion, is the government's principal quality. Some 27.4 percent chose simply the fact that the present government is better than the previous one. A total of 18.2 percent said that it is "moderate," 10.0 percent thought that it conducts a "successful foreign policy," and 7.6 percent that it is "socially just." Some 4 percent thought that its economic policy inspires trust, 21.5 percent said that the government possesses no special attributes, and 11.3 percent did not know.

On the contrary, Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras had a negative balance of 11 percent and Communist Party [KKE] leader Aleka Papariga a negative balance of 46 percent.
