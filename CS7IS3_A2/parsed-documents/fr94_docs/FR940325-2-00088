Specify by title or name the percentage of time allocated to the project, the individual annual salaries and the cost to the project (both Federal and non-Federal) of the organization's staff who will be working on the project. Line 6b_Fringe Benefits: Enter the total costs of fringe benefits unless treated as part of an approved indirect cost rate which is entered on line 6j. Justification Enter the total costs of fringe benefits, unless treated as part of an approved indirect cost rate. Line 6c_Travel: Enter total cost of all travel by employees of the project. Do not enter costs for consultant's travel. Justification Include the name(s) of traveler(s), total number of trips, destinations, length of stay, mileage rate, transportation costs and subsistence allowances. Line 6d_Equipment: Enter the total costs of all non-expendable personal property to be acquired by the project. Equipment means tangible non-expendable personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. Justification Equipment to be purchased with Federal funds must be required to conduct the project, and the applicant organization or its subgrantees must not already have the equipment or a reasonable facsimile available to the project. The justification also must contain plans for future use or disposal of the equipment after the project ends. Line 6e_Supplies: Enter the total costs of all tangible personal property (surplus) other than that included on line 6d. Line 6h_Other: Enter the total of all other costs. Such costs, where applicable, may include, but are not limited to, insurance, food, medical and dental costs (noncontractual), fees and travel paid directly to individual consultants, local transportation (all travel which does not require per diem is considered local travel), space and equipment rentals, printing and publication, computer use training costs including tuition and stipends, training service costs including wage payments to individuals and supportive service payments, and staff development costs. Line 6j_Indirect Charges: Enter the total amount of indirect costs. This line should be used only when the applicant currently has an indirect cost rate approved by the Department of Health and Human Services or other Federal agencies. With the exception of States and local governments, applicants should enclose a copy of the current approved rate agreement if it was negotiated with a Federal agency other than the Department of Health and Human Services. For an educational institution the indirect costs on training grants will be allowed at the lesser of the institution's actual indirect costs or 8 percent of the total direct costs. If the applicant organization is in the process of initially developing or renegotiating a rate, it should immediately upon notification that an award will be made, develop a tentative indirect cost rate proposal based on its most recently completed fiscal year in accordance with the principles set forth in the pertinent DHHS Guide for Establishing Indirect Cost Rates, and submit it to the appropriate DHHS Regional Office. It should be noted that when an indirect cost rate is requested, those costs included in the indirect cost pool cannot be also budgeted or charged as direct costs to the grant. The total amount shown in Section B, Column (5), Line 6k, should be the same as the amount shown in Section A, Line 5, Column (e). Line 7_Program Income: Enter the estimated amount of income, if any, expected to be generated from this project. Separately show expected program income generated from OCS support and income generated from other mobilized funds. Do not add or subtract this amount from the budget total. Show the nature and source of income in the program narrative statement. Column 5: Carry totals from Column 1 to Column 5 for all line items. Justification Describe the nature, source and anticipated use of program income in the Program Narrative Statement. Section C_Non-Federal Resources This section is to record the amounts of ``Non-Federal'' resources that will be used to support the project. ``Non-Federal'' resources mean other than OCS funds for which the applicant has received a commitment. Provide a brief explanation, on a separate sheet, showing the type of contribution, broken out by Object Class Category, (See Section B.6) and whether it is cash or third-party in-kind. The firm commitment of these required funds must be documented and submitted with the application.
