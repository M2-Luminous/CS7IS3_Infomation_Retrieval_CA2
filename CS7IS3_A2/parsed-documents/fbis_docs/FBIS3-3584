Li made this remark at a recent municipal foreign economic and trade meeting. He said that the current international and domestic situation helps pave the way for further use of foreign funds, but a better environment for such investment is badly needed. As world consortiums, financiers and transnational firms have kept pouring into Beijing to seek opportunities since the beginning of the year, the emphasis of the work should be placed on creating favorable conditions for foreign investment and cooperation, he said. In the first month of this year, the number of the newly-built companies with over 10 million U.S. dollars investment each reached 20. The biggest of them were two real estate corporations, each having a total investment of 60 million U.S. dollars. And by the end of January the municipal government had approved 7,783 foreign-funded firms and directly used more than 10.71 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds. Explaining the reason for promoting the role of foreign investment, Deputy Mayor Lu Yucheng said that the drive will focus on encouraging the attraction of more foreign funds, the setting up of more businesses, more project construction and more profits earned this year. Lu also said that the majority of the foreign funds will be guided into the construction of urban infrastructure facilities and development zones of various kinds, as well as into the mainstay industries such as automobiles, electronics and building materials. In addition, he said, full use should be made of world trade information networks to provide more information services for both investors and those who need investment. And the drawing up of laws and regulations concerning foreign economic trade and co-operation should be strengthened to protect the foreign businessmen's legal rights and interests in China. Administrative formalities should be simplified and work efficiency should be improved in order to provide a coordinated servicing process. In 1994 the city will pour more funds into the construction of major projects such as the capital's subways, expressways and power plants. The construction of first-class economic and technology development zones will also be stepped up through Sino-foreign co-operation. Lu also said that Beijing is now probing for ways to establish Sino-foreign shareholding companies. For this reason, the companies that are already listed are encouraged to issue B and H shares, and the financial institutions to issue bonds abroad, while infrastructure projects will try the BOT (building, operation and transfer) channel.
