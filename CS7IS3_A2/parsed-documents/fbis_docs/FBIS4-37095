Syria, which boycotts the multilateral talks, has evinced interest in the various proposals being discussed by experts in workshops and in regional meetings. A senior Israeli source said that Syria's interest in the economic aspect of the multilateral talks is very great. He said the Syrians have evinced great interest in the proceedings of the work groups and are interested in being updated on this issue. The source assessed that "the economic sphere could be Syria's entrance gate into the multilateral process." All the participants in the Rabat conference expressed the hope that Syria and Lebanon will join the economic work group. Some even said there is a feeling that a development in that direction may take place soon. It is assessed that Syria has reached the conclusion that the economic forum is the most practical forum in the multilateral process and that it could lead to rather tempting infrastructure and development projects. Consequently, as the Israeli source said, "the Syrians do not want to miss the train." Economic sources claim that Syria is very well aware of the fact that the projects being discussed in the conference have far-reaching economic significance and harbor great potential for large-scale international financing and investments which Syria stands no chance of obtaining otherwise. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0400 GMT on 16 June carries a recorded interview with Professor Ya'aqov Frenkel, the Bank of Israel Governor who co-heads the Israeli delegation to Rabat, in which Frenkel is asked about the Syrian interest in the proceedings. Frenkel is recorded as saying: "Today we have heard some reports by some delegations indicating that indeed from their impression of their bilateral dealings with the Syrians they gained the impression that indeed there might be some growing interest and a somewhat more positive attitude toward the committee. But I would emphasize very strongly that this was not part of any formal report, nor is there hard evidence. One talks about nuances and feelings, and that's basically where we are."] [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 16 June carries an interview with Uri Savir, director general of the Foreign Ministry and the other co-head of the Israeli delegation to Rabat, in which, referring to the same issue, Savir is recorded as saying: "Based on various reports by the EU and Japan, it looks as though Syria is evincing some interest in this conference. Visits were paid to Syria by various elements, especially the EC, which has organized this conference. Syria is showing interest in the regional economic cooperation talks, which is perhaps the most significant work group in the multilateral talks. At this point, however, Syria has made no commitment to join the talks; this is reserved for a later stage." [Asked about progress on the Israeli-Syrian track, Savir says: "It is hard for me to say, because it is difficult to guess exactly what stands behind this Syrian curiosity. Perhaps they believe that progress will be achieved in their bilateral talks with us, a thing they consider as a condition for joining the multilateral talks. It is also possible that there is something else here, namely, the more projects are being planned between us and the Arab countries the more difficult it becomes for any country to be left out of the picture." Savir adds: "I assume Syria realizes that joining this framework will not contribute to the peace process only, but to the Syrian economy as well."]
