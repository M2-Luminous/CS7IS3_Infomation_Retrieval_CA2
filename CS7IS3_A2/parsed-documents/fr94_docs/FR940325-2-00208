Box 468, Piketon, Ohio 45661, an electric public-utility subsidiary company of American Electric Power Company, Inc. and Allegheny Power System, Inc., both registered holding companies, has filed an application under sections 9 and 10 of the Act. OVEC requests authority to purchase or lease 515 railcars for approximately $22.7 million. OVEC proposes to use the railcars to deliver coal to its associate company, Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corporation's Clifty Creek Plant. To minimize the costs associated with the railcars, OVEC also proposes to sublease the railcars to its associate companies and, during times of non-utilization by OVEC and its associate companies, to non-affiliates. OVEC states that it would sublease the railcars only if the revenue generated by the sublease covered all variable costs and makes a contribution to the fixed costs of the railcars. Central Power and Light Company, et al. (70&hyph;8345) Central Power and Light Company, 539 North Carancahua Street, Corpus Christi, Texas 78401, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, 212 East 6th Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74119, Southwestern Electric Power Company, 428 Travis Street, Shreveport, Louisiana 71156, and West Texas Utilities Company, 301 Cypress, Abilene, Texas 79601 (collectively, ``Applicants''), all electric public-utility subsidiary companies of Central and South West Corporation, a registered holding company, have filed an application under sections 9(a)(1) and 10 of the Act. Applicants propose to lease owned unit trains and railcars to nonaffiliates through July 1, 1999. Lease terms will cover those periods during which the Applicants do not need the unit trains and railcars for operations, and could range for as short a time as it takes to make one trip to ten months. Any leases will provide for lease rates at or near market rates at the time such leases are entered into. Applicants anticipate that leases of the owned unit trains and railcars to nonaffiliates will be a small percentage not expected to exceed an average of 50% of available unit trains and railcars for each Applicant. Rental income received from the leasing of unit trains and railcars will be recorded as credit to fuel stock account number 151 and will go to offset the depreciation of railcars and unit trains which is charged to this account. Any leasing income in excess of the amount of depreciation charged to account number 151 will be credited to rental income account number 454.

CNG proposes to issue and sell on or before June 30, 1996 up to $400 million principal amount of debentures (``Debentures''). The Debentures will be sold in one or more series at a price, exclusive of accrued interest, which will be not less than 98% nor more than 101% of the principal amount and at an interest rate which will be a multiple of 1/8, 1/10, or 1/20 of 1%. The Debentures will mature in not more than thirty years and will be issued in accordance with the indenture between CNG and Chemical Bank, as Trustee, dated May 1, 1971.

In the event Rule 50 is rescinded as proposed by the Commission in HCAR No. 25668 (November 4, 1992), CNG requests authority to be permitted to issue and sell Debentures under competitive bidding including the aforesaid alternative procedures without prior Commission approval. The proceeds from the sale of the Debentures will be added to CNG's treasury fund and subsequently used for general corporate purpose to: (1) Finance, in part, capital expenditures of CNG and CNG's subsidiaries, (2) displace roll-over of commercial paper previously issued for working capital purposes, (3) finance the purchase of CNG's common stock in the open market, and/or (4) acquire, retire, or redeem securities of which CNG is an issuer without the need for prior Commission approval pursuant to Rule 42 under the Act.
