FBIS4-31359 "dreeu111_y_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-111 Daily Report 23 May 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal `Scandal' in Federal Assembly Reviewed `Scandal' in Federal Assembly Reviewed 94BA0293C Belgrade VREME in Serbo-Croatian 23 May 94 p 15 94BA0293C Belgrade VREME Serbo-Croatian CSO [Article by M.M.: "Something Is Floating in the Water"] [Text] The series of incidents in the parliament here was enriched last week (on Wednesday, 18 May) by the scandal in the parliament involving the spilling of water, shoving, and curses referring to the opponent's communist mother. When Drasko Markovic, deputy of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], said something concerning the reputation of Dr. Radovan Bozovic, president of the Citizens Chamber of the Assembly of Yugoslavia -- more accurately, when in proposing an item on the agenda he mentioned Bozovic's involvement in the so-called ministerial scandal (stealing on a large scale involving two ministers of the Serbian Government, headed by Dr. Bozovic), which is still dragging on in the courts -- the latter turned off the microphone at the speaker's stand. In the next scene, the president of the Citizens Chamber gestured to the Radical deputy to leave the speaker's desk, and the latter took a glass of mineral water (it must have been "Karadjordje!") and spilled it on the president's desk, but not so violently that it would splash the president of the Chamber. Bozovic then obtained from the Chamber permission to eject the deputy from the Chamber. (Up to now deputies have been ejected without a vote.) The chastised deputy first headed for the exit, and then, at the suggestion of the party's leader, he sat on a bench. The Radicals surrounded their colleague and did not allow the Assembly security to eject Markovic from the Chamber. There began a test of strength based on credentials--the Radicals referred to immunity, and the security personnel referred to the official order of the president of the Chamber. One security officer shouted: "Mr. Deputy, allow me to discharge my duty!" Seselj answered: "You are not going to discharge your duty!" In the fistfight that ensued, Radical Deputy Filip Stojanovic got a bloody ear. Seselj shouted in a strong voice: "You have drawn the man's blood, damn your communist mother. To hell with Sloba Milosevic!" He advised his deputy to display his bloody handkerchief, and then, raising the temperature, he said that "half a liter of blood has been shed"; throughout the entire Chamber, he called to Radmilo Bogdanovic, chairman of the Security Committee: "Radmilo, see what your police are doing!" The latter, after sending a long and significant look in Seselj's direction, left the Chamber! When passions cooled, the Radicals left the session, and the next day (Thursday, 19 May) they did not attend the debate concerning the new rules of the Assembly, when everyone was talking about the "dignity of the Assembly." Incidentally, on two occasions before this incident Bozovic has left the session when Dr. Vojislav Seselj mentioned his involvement in criminal scandals. Exactly a year ago, an incident occurred in which Bozovic took the opposite tack. When Radical Deputy Vakic dealt a knockout blow to Deputy Mihajlo Markovic, Bozovic reacted in a manner well-disposed to Vakic. The Socialists were tolerant for a long time, they approved Dr. Seselj or encouraged him to do outrageous things in the Serbian and federal assemblies. Recently, they have been getting a little annoyed.
