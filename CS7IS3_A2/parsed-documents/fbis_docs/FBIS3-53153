In an exclusive statement to MENA, Sa'id Kamal said a joint Palestinian-Egyptian committee met in September and decided to hold the count to guarantee the right of return for the Palestinian refugees. This step is a prelude to the meetings of the Palestinian-Israeli ministerial follow-up committee, which will discuss the Palestinian refugees problem, Kamal added. The Palestine ambassador in Cairo said the count will not revoke the Palestinian citizen's right to live and work in Egypt. He noted that special forms have been prepared and will be distributed among the Palestinian refugees from 15 January at the al-Tahiri compound in Cairo and Egyptian consulates abroad. He said that these forms are optional, not compulsory, noting that the count would serve the interest of the Palestinian citizen. It also aims to find jobs for unemployed Palestinians within the framework of development programs sponsored by the Palestinian authority, Sa'id Kamal added. In his statement, the Palestinian ambassador said that Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, has instructed the Palestinian embassies in Arab and foreign countries to coordinate with the Egyptian consulates in charge of the count.
