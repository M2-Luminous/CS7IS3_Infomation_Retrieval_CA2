The RS sources said that the scenario and its media support were developped in mid-January with the participation of a group of Moslems from former Bosnia-Herzegovina who are active in the Islamic lobby in the United States. The preparations included three military advisors to the Moslem army who carefully planned the time and place of the massacre. The bloodshed at the Sarajevo market was caused by a mortar shell and several explosive devices, but the Serb side does not yet have all the necessary facts. The RS sources claim that there is no doubt that many traces, which would immediately show that the incident was stage-managed, were removed with lightening speed. They said that the expertise carried out by the U.N. Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) was superficial and underscored the significance of the fact that the Moslems refused to agree that Serb experts take part in the investigation. The RS sources said that the criminal action aimed to create a reason for the continuation of the pressure against the Bosnian Serbs, to provoke NATO air strikes and support the Moslem side in its aspirations to control the entire Bosnian territory. The sources said that the stage-managed action is also an attempt to bring about the failure of the Geneva peace talks and to provide a justification to the Moslem side not to sign the peace plan. All this is supported by the fact that Moslem Presidency Vice-President Ejup Ganic on Monday revealed a new Moslem proposal to create a cantonal Bosnia. The Bosnian Serb sources learned that a new stage-managed action is planned in case the Sarajevo incident fails to achieve the wanted results, thus confirming the determination to realize these aims. The sources said that Moslem ambassador in the United Nations, Muhamed Secirbegovic, on Monday openly threatened to do this. If NATO fails to carry out the sir strikes "such incidents will recur," he said.
