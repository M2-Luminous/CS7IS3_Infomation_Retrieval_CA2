FR941004-2-00012 FR941004-2-00006 [A&hyph;427&hyph;813] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From France AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary Bettger or Penelope Naas, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;2239 or 482&hyph;3534, respectively. Preliminary Determination: We have preliminarily determined that certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from France are being sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Act''), as amended. The estimated margins of sales at less than fair value are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994 (59 FR 14148, March 25, 1994), the following events have occurred: On April 11, 1994, the United States International Trade Commission (``ITC'') issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination ( see, ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;688, 59 FR 18825 (April 20, 1994)). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b), the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') issued its antidumping duty questionnaire to Interfit, S.A. (``interfit'') and its related U.S. company, Vallourec, Inc. (``Vallourec''), on April 29, 1994. Interfit is the only company named in the petition as a producer and exporter to the United States of the subject merchandise. On June 14, 1994, petitioner alleged that Interfit was selling the subject merchandise in France at less than its cost of production (``COP''). We found reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales in the home market were being made at less than COP and thus initiated a COP investigation. On June 30, 1994, petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination. The request was granted by the Department on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994). On August 4, 1994, petitioner alleged critical circumstances with regard to imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from France. On September 6, 1994, Interfit submitted constructed value (``CV'') data for models reflecting a large percentage of sales made in the United States during the period of investigation (``POI''). On September 23, 1994, Interfit provided CV information for the remaining models sold in the United States. Scope of the Investigation The products covered by this investigation are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening ( e.g. threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The POI is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994. Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether Interfit's sales for export to the Untied States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. United States Price Because Interfit's U.S. sales of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings were made to an unrelated distributor in the United States prior to importation, and the exporter's sales price methodology was not indicated by other circumstances, we based USP on the purchase price (``PP'') sales methodology in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act.
