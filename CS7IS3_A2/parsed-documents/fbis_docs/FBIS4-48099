The talks, which lasted six hours, were held between representatives of both Alhaji Koromah and Roosevelt Johnson, who did not attend yesterday's talks. Mr. Johnson showed up yesterday morning, but left after Mr. Koromah failed to appear. Present at the talks were Mr. Raleigh Seekie, Mr. Gbaigbala, Mr. Joseph Tediah, and Maxwell Kaba, among others. The military aspect of the ULIMO talks were completed recently, with an agreement by the two sides to cease fire and allow ECOMOG to take control of all roads within ULIMO areas. Meanwhile, the Citizens Peace Mission [CPM] has commended the leadership of ULIMO for the present bold and courageous decisions taken, which culminated in issuing of a communique calling for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire between forces loyal to the national chairman, Alhaji Koromah, and [words indistinct] chairman Roosevelt Johnson. In a release issued, the CPM also commended the Liberia Peace Council, the LPC, for requesting deployment of ECOMOG and UNIMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] in the political subdivisions under its control, which it said also amounts to an unconditional and immdiate cease-fire between the LPC and NPFL fighting forces. The Citizens Peace Mission expressed gratitude to ECOMOG and UNIMIL for their role in bringing the conflicting parties of ULIMO to the conference table. They hope that the Freetown experience will not be repeated.
