It has been made painfully clear that the relationship between the 40 million or so Irish Americans and Dublin is more durable than the one between the White House and Downing Street. It would be a great shame if the pique of the Prime Minister, John Major, or some of the collateral fall-out from the visit of Mr Adams to the U.S., distracted from pursuit of the peace process set out on December 15. There is a tendency among British and Unionist politicians to throw up their hands in horror at the idea of the Sinn Fein leader being given carte blanche to present himself as a person of peace. However, this grossly underestimates the wisdom of all those who watched his show in action. His constant resort to attacks on the perceived colonial power, Britain, and events that took place more than 70 years ago, tends to be as unconvincing as Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's attempt to blame all the world's ills on American imperialism. It is the defence of someone who does not have the intellectual fire power to justify violence, even on contemporary grounds. The other benefits of Mr Adams' visit, are, first, the acknowledgement by President Clinton that the December 15 declaration was the best way forward. Having the world's only superpower behind the process can be helpful, as the Israeli-Palestinian deal proves. Second, as high level officials in Dublin point out, it puts pressure on Mr Adams and the IRA to deliver on a ceasefire. When he arrived at Dublin airport early yesterday he described moves towards peace as being their "final phase," a timely break in his recent meanderings on the need for clarifications. In fact, it is something of a distraction that Sir Patrick Mayhew should have chosen now, just as the impact of Mr Adams's visit is being absorbed in Ireland, to have changed horses by refettling the existing political process. His ideas, including a measure of power devolution to a new assembly and cross-border co-operation in tourism and environment, are fine, and maybe even sensible. But the timing is appalling. It gives the appearance of a domestically driven, political reaction to Mr Adams's megaphone in New York. It does seem that Sir Patrick has again played what is perceived in Dublin as his weakest suit: the failure to consult with those directly concerned in the Nationalist and Loyalist communities. Senior ministers in Dublin believe that the Downing Street declaration faces its stiffest test in the next few weeks. Once the European election campaign moves into high gear in the spring (polling is in July) politicians on both sides of the border -- but particularly the Unionists in the North -- will be so trapped by the need to show the respective power of their factions, that the boldness which brought James Molyneaux to Dublin will be snuffed out. The government of the Republic has made an unusual effort to cultivate Unionist support for the Downing Street declaration with the Tanaiste [deputy prime minister] and foreign minister, Dick Spring, travelling to Belfast and the Shankill as part of the effort to demonstrate that politicians in the South do not have horns. Indeed, there is a view here that Sir Patrick should have spent as much time closely cultivating Unionist and Nationalist factions, instead of pronouncing from Stormont in the manner of the old-style British ruler. What essentially has been going on since December 15 is waiting on the IRA. It was clear from day one that, despite the prelude of the Hume-Adams talks (and the accord which may never even have been put down on paper) and the disclosure of the unofficial contacts between Britain and Sinn Fein, that the IRA was nowhere near ready to accept the concept of a ceasefire let alone laying down its arms. What has followed has been a kind of double bluff. Mr Adams has waffled on ad nauseam about the need for clarification of the Downing Street declaration. Albert Reynolds and the Dublin government and Downing Street (to a lesser extent) have obliged by delivering a series of speeches and statements looking across a range of issues-including demilitarisation. However, the real clarification that Mr Adams has been seeking, according to high level offficials here, is not from the main parties to the declaration (their positions are basciaUy known) but from within the IRA itself. Adams is seen as in the centre of a "poisonous" power struggle. He is representative of a better educated generation which believes that the armed struggle can never be won and that it is time to modernise the IRA cause and move away from the hardline republicanism, hatred and mythology of past generations. But Mr Adams's ability to bring the moderates along, let alone the extremists, is a high-wire act, and it is by no means clear whether he will cross to the other side. It must be remembered that the IRA has a strong vested interest in maintaining an armed struggle that has brought them a large flow of informal funds from the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. and created a black economy built on racketeering. Moreover, nobody -- including Mr Adams -- knows what the reaction will be in the cells of South Armagh, the greatest stronghold of republicanism. If Mr Adams pushes too far he could find himself with a bullet in the neck, unleashing internecine warfare within the extremist nationalist movement. There is no great optimism in Dublin government circles of the Downing Street declaration advancing. It believes it could fail for a number of reasons: the exposure of Mr Adams, failure of the British Government to maintain its secret track of dialogue, the weakness of John Major which leaves him vulnerable to the pressure of the more extreme Loyalists. Sir Patrick's mid-course correction smacks of that. Despite all of this there is a conviction here that the gains in economic co-operation and standards of living which would follow rapprochement are far too important to be lost. Failure now would mean another two decades of armed stalemate and lost economic opportunities.
