The instigator is Tokyo Steel. The price is 55,000 yen per ton for Tokyo Steel, whose entry in steel plate, which had been a product monopolized by blast furnace manufacturers, began in April. Not only is it cheaper than the price of blast furnace manufacturers said to be 90,000 to 100,000 yen, but even South Korean products, and President Masashige Iketani does not hesitate to say, "Controlled pricing by blast furnace manufacturers has maintained high prices." The silent pressure of the blast furnace manufacturers to shut out imports and maintain price order is normal in the industry. Steel processors who are called shearing and coil centers fear the opposition of blast furnace makers and have not spoken openly about dealing in import steel. The major trading companies also have not dealt openly in imports. The market control power of those blast furnace makers now has begun to waver. "If the foreign and domestic price differential is not eliminated, the export industry will no longer be able to keep going." That is because voices of revolt from major consumers such as autos, shipbuilding, and home appliances have seethed up. Moves to use cheap South Korean steel, such as by Mitsubishi Motors, also are becoming a reality. The blast furnace makers have been driven to lower steel prices for autos and shipbuilding. The "domestic-foreign price differential" is not just for consumer goods. According to the report of a major trading company with the title, "Comparison of Taiwanese, South Korean, and Japanese Steel Costs," "calculated at $1 to 125 yen to 783 won to 25.75 yuan, the cost per ton is $587 for regular Japanese steel, about 60 percent higher than $370 for Pohang Iron and Steel Co. (POSCO), and 353 dollars for China Steel (CSC)." Cost reduction to the level of international prices, specifically "dropping to the price of POSCO" where the wages of steel workers are said to be one-fourth that of Japan, now has become the watchword of the blast furnace makers. "In the case of petrochemical products, the Asian market has become borderless" (Susumu Hashimoto, manager of Resin Division, Mitsui Petrochemical Industries). There is a high tariff for U.S. and European products, but the import offensive from South Korea and Taiwan taking advantage of the preferential duty framework is intense. Ten percent of the demand has been replaced by import goods for polyethylene film for supermarket plastic bags or trash bags. "The price of Japanese polyethylene is 70 to 80 percent higher than the United States or South Korea" (Daiwa Research Institute). The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] forecasts that import goods will account for 20-30 percent of petrochemical products in the near future. "The collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 began the worldwide deflation," points out Yoichi Ito, head of the Exchange Operations Office of Sumitomo Trust & Banking. "The former socialist countries, which have low costs, have been incorporated into the market economy system, and their products have begun to flood world markets all at once. Prices inevitably will tend toward standardization" (Ito). In addition to NIE's (newly industrializing economies) and developing nations with the ability to supply, the former socialist countries also have become supply nations. On the other hand, no place in the world has enough demand to absorb that. The prices of international products, which are a reflection of the world economy, are gradually improving after the great bottoming at the beginning of 1993, but viewing real prices which are adjusted by the inflation rate of advanced nations, "Only crude oil and gold are at the same level as during the 1960's, and agricultural products, nonferrous steel, etc., are from one-third to one-fourth" (Marubeni Research Department). Even if prices do not go down, a mechanism where "they will not increase" easily has been created worldwide. In Japan, high yen acceleration has restricted the lowering of prices. "In the Japanese economy, when a yen rate higher than $1 equals 130 yen takes root, the domestic-foreign price differential will come to have decisive significance" (Nomura Research Institute). The procurement of materials from overseas is rapidly spreading. Sanyo Electric put together high yen emergency measures by order of the president in the summer of 1993 and worked out a policy of "procurement from abroad with the most advantageous price." Change to import goods in steel for compressors, plastic products, and printed circuit boards and other electronic parts is beginning. The goal of the overseas purchase ratio, which had been 8 percent in fiscal 1993, "will be over 10 percent this fiscal year." While Suminoe Textile, the largest maker of interior materials for autos is demanding that synthetic fabric manufacturers lower prices to international price levels, they are studying whether they should import from South Korea or Taiwan BCF nylon for car seats that will be used in new cars this fall. It is a defensive measure because "the move from auto manufacturers on materials suppliers to lower prices has accelerated all at once since the beginning of this year" (Director Kanichiro Kishigami). The wave of overseas materials procurement is going back upstream. A return to half of the drop from peak to bottom is called a "half-price return." The forecast that, "even if the economy fully recovers, there will be a half-price return of steel prices at the most" (President Toshio Kokure, Kawasaki Steel) may be too optimistic in view of the reality that international prices will determine the upper limit.
