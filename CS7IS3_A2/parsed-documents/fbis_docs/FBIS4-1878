State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry reiterated Defense Secretary William Perry's remarks on Sunday that Washington was not prepared to recommend to the allies to rescue Gorazde for the time being. The enclave, one of the UN-declared "safe havens" for the Bosnian Muslims, has been under Serb attacks in recent days and there were calls for NATO military steps or threats to halt the Serbs, just like the recent success in making the Serbs pulling out heavy guns from Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. In Cleveland, President Bill Clinton said "whether we can recreate the conditions of Sarajevo anywhere else depends in part on the facts of each specific case." At the White House, Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said "at this point we don't have any specific plans around any of the safe havens." Meanwhile, the ASSOCIATED PRESS reported that the administration strategy on Bosnia could change after John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returns tomorrow from the former Yugoslavia.
