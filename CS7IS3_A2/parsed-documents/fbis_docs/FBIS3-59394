Economic and trade departments in every locality are presently urgently carrying out this task, and some provinces have completed the task. National assigning of textile manufacturer designators is an important condition for the establishment of an export license approval system to export textiles to the United States. The establishment of an approval system is significant for raising China's export quotas for nations that limit textile imports, especially the United States. This measure can more effectively combat the illegal activity of fabricating false licenses and combat illegal textile transhipment and ensure the legitimate interests of export enterprises. Manufacturer designators are made up of fifteen digits and are mainly used to clarify which manufacturers have textile exporting licenses, and to prove the original place of production of goods. Textile manufacturers are state, cooperative, individual, partially or wholly foreign-owned, and other types of manufacturers engaged in the processing and manufacture of textiles, clothing, accessories, and other products included in bilateral textile agreements. It is reported that some local economic and trade control departments only assign the designation to manufacturers that provide their region with textile export goods. Therefore, some manufacturers that provide goods for export enterprises outside of their region and have the capability to provide export goods are left out of the designation. This leads to some export licenses not being issued on schedule because they lack a designated manufacturer, causing an adverse effect on normal exports. Therefore, all localities' economic and trade departments, based on MOFTEC's requirement, should organize all manufacturers and not designate some manufacturers. The economic and trade control departments of all localities are the departments responsible for organizing all textile manufacturers in their region as designated manufacturers. In accordance with the demands of MOFTEC, all local economic and trade control departments should direct and oversee the designation of their region's textile manufacturers, and the collection of data and reporting to MOFTEC by all local and county departments responsible for economics and trade. Once the manufacturer designation is set up and recorded, it should not be arbitrarily revised. The designation should be controlled by a person with special responsibility. Every export enterprise, when applying for a license to export textiles to the United States, must enter the manufacturer designation for the goods in the permit in column 13 and enter the designation in the MIDS column when filling out the visa. Otherwise, the certificate will be considered false. Thus, it is mandatory to use the manufacturer designation. Presently, the establishment of the manufacturer designation is entering the final stage and economic and trade departments from every locality should seize the opportunity and seriously and meticulously accomplish this task. Units that still have not completed the task when the time expires, after China implements the approval system for licenses to export textiles to the United States, will not receive certification for the United States. This will create a huge economic loss for export enterprises. Thus, the economic and trade departments of every locality should energetically strive to overcome various difficulties and complete the task of establishing textile manufacturer designations on time throughout the nation.
