Lula made the disclosure to 52 executives from large foreign groups during a luncheon in Sao Paulo. He said: "Inflation in Brazil is not fueled by demand; rather, it is a political problem. The way to reduce it gradually, effectively, and lastingly is through a social pact among workers, business people, and the government. Our government will be based on such an agreement because inflation will decline only when this agreement is achieved." The idea of a pact is not new. It was tried under the government of Jose Sarney by then-Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto, but it was not endorsed by either the PT or the Sole Workers Center, the trade union closest to the PT. As an example of the type of agreement he wants, Lula cited the pact concluded two years ago by business people, workers, and government in the car industry that resulted in tax cuts for the industry and job security for workers. After noting that the eight administrations that have ruled the country since 1985 have not succeeded in curbing inflation, but rather provoked losses to workers, Lula said: "We have to start by bringing inflation under social control." He added that it also will become necessary "to introduce changes" to oligopolies and the financial system, to guarantee investment in productive activities, and to fight corruption in state-owned banks so they will no longer be used as "backup coffers" and that "domestic debt can be rescheduled so the state can count on funds for investments." Lula went as far as responding to questions by business people about how a socialist party plans to attract foreign capital. He said: "Capital has neither fatherland nor ideology. No businessman who has invested in China has questioned the Chinese Government about the Tiananmen Square massacre." Lula stated that investors would respond positively if his government assured them that they would obtain profits. He added that, to this end, it will suffice to "slightly increase" the purchasing power of all Brazilians. He said: "If we achieve this, the consumer market will be such that you will be interested in investing here." The business people also expressed concern about the closed nature of the Brazilian economy and about the fact that the PT opposes the privatization of state-owned companies. Making it clear that he is not in favor of opening up the economy, Lula said: "Open borders sound good in speeches, but in practice every country has mechanisms to defend its market and products." He announced that the PT will maintain a state monopoly over petroleum and telecommunications but will promote concessions to the private sector in other areas. Showing that he is against privatization, Lula said: "But instead of trying to buy the existing state-owned companies, why do you not try to build railroad tracks and roads and many other much-needed projects in Brazil"? The business people come from various countries, the United States, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Japan, Korea, and Australia, among others, and represent large groups such as IBM, Mitsubishi Bank, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, AT&T, and Eastman Kodak, among others. They are attending a master's degree program of the Massachuset Institute of Technology, which promoted similar visits to Chile and Argentina, where they met President Carlos Menem, and Mexico. In Brazil, they also are scheduled to meet economists Persio Arida and Andre Lara Resende to learn about the economic proposal of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party's presidential candidate.
