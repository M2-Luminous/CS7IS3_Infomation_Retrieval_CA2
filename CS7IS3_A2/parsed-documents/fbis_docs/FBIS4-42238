The excesses of the Haberer era at Credit Lyonnais have become a political issue that could threaten cohabitation. Most worrisome are the serious deficiencies they reveal in the management of France's largest bank. It all erupted so suddenly no one saw it coming. More than the private school affair, more than the CIP [youth vocational training contract] affair, it threatens to become the first major crisis of cohabitation, and may even foment divisions within the majority itself. The Left saw the dismissal of dethroned senior civil servant Jean-Yves Haberer as an attack on the Elysee and an implicit swipe at Pierre Beregovoy. Bercy [Finance Ministry] and the Treasury Directorate take the episode as an infringement on their prerogatives. For them, the worst is probably yet to come. The fact that Philippe Seguin is personally chairing the parliamentary commission of inquiry is probably not unconnected with the fact that Treasury's director at the time was Jean-Claude Trichet, now governor of the Bank of France and mortal enemy to all opponents of the strong franc policy. Even the timetable of the probe is tainted with partisan considerations: The inquiry's report is supposed to be submitted on 11 September, coincident with the beginning of the final stage of the presidential race. Now as "luck" would have it, the principal target of the majority deputies is expected to be Bernard Tapie--undeclared candidate in the presidential elections--by virtue of his controversial ties with SDBO, a Lyonnais subsidiary. The rich political trappings of this big showdown could divert attention from the most important question raised by the affair: How could France's biggest bank have adopted such dysfunctional operating procedures? Because there was no actual wrongdoing, not in the juridical sense. And the alarm was sounded much earlier than people today find it convenient to remember. In fact, it all began three years ago, in late 1990, with the MGM affair. MGM--that glorious and expensive Hollywood studio--fell into the portfolio of the French bank almost without warning. Concerned at the volume of money involved, the Banking Commission asked Lyonnais for all the details on the Parretti imbroglio. By dint of increasingly insistent pressure, the Banking Commission finally had its way, and the figures provided to it at that time turned out to be accurate. It was at this point that the bank monitoring body decided, contrary to what had been said since, to put Credit Lyonnais under close surveillance. This was in autumn 1991 (as confirmed by memoranda). What was disturbing was the sharp augmentation of Lyonnais's activity (loans out and portfolio participations) at a time when the economy as a whole showed obvious signs of getting winded--and the bank's accounts looked entirely too good. Failure To Inform In July 1991, the profit-and-loss statement for the first half of the year, though very favorable on its face, confirmed the commission's doubts and convinced it to continue investigating the bank. It decided to begin by focusing the investigation more on the subsidiaries than on the parent company. In November 1991 the inspectors started with Altus, Jean-Francois Henin's fiefdom. That was the focus until April 1992. Their labors bore fruit: They demanded specific reforms on provisions, calculation of earnings, and accounting practices. A long letter was sent to the titular president of Altus, Jean-Yves Haberer, in which the inadequacy of internal controls was mentioned. As regulations stipulate, he was the only recipient. It was up to him to inform the shareholders, to wit Lyonnais and Thomson, and the auditors. He did not do so. The second subsidiary on the list was Bernard Tapie's generous provider, SDBO, where the mission remained from the end of May to September 1992. Then the focus shifted to Clinvest and International Bankers, both headed by former Lyonnais president Jean-Maxime Leveque. The commission meanwhile wrote again to Boulevard des Italiens [Credit Lyonnais headquarters] reminding the president of the conditions attached to the 1991 settlement of accounts. Once again, the shareholders of Credit Lyonnais were not informed officially. At the same time, before the final closure of the 1991 accounting year, the governor of the Bank of France--Jacques de Larosiere, the president of the Banking Commission--hosted a "summit meeting" with Jean-Yves Haberer and Francois Gille, the bank's director general. Coincidence? Anyway, the net amount for provisions to cover "bad" risks was increased 50 percent over the 1990 level. Thanks to Altus, Credit Lyonnais still showed a net profit of 3.2 billion francs [Fr]. But the situation worsened under the weight of economic recession, especially the real estate crisis. Image-Conscious Auditors After publication of the accounting figures for the first half of 1992, the Banking Commission opted to probe into the core of the reactor. In October 1992, it would audit the parent company. As the tutelary authority for the banking sector, the then-economic affairs minister, Michel Sapin, was informed; he in turn sent a letter to Jean-Yves Haberer on 22 September directing him to furnish a detailed analysis of the bank's loan portfolio. A new anomaly: The Banking Commission was unaware of the existence of this letter. Apparently, it knew nothing about it before it was published recently in the pages of LIBERATION. Conversely, Michel Sapin was probably unaware that the Banking Commission was already within the gates. In the meantime, however, informal contacts were established with the Treasury Directorate, which after examining the six-month accounting statements, warned the minister's staff. But officially, at the political level, no decisions were made. Finally, the 1992 accounting year ended with a loss of Fr1.8 billion. The picture was reportedly "improved" by an accounting artifice--reducing the country-risk provisions by Fr2.5 billion--with the acquiescence of auditors Ernst & Young and Coopers & Lybrands. The auditors made no special comments in the final auditors' report, despite the violent arguments they had with the office of the director general. The excuse made by one of the auditors: "We didn't want to destroy the image of the bank, and we continue to stand by that position." Dissimulation? Under the law, the auditors have no right to pass information to other persons. Lack of judgment? No, because at the time they believed, as did the regulatory organism, that the bank would be able to solve its problems by itself. Why then should they create a furor in Paris financial circles? A sentiment with which the Banking Commission would concur, right up to May 1993. But when finally it received the report from its inspectors, it judged the time opportune to inform the shareholders: in this instance, the state. In August 1993, the governor of the Bank of France sent a very official letter to the minister. The solemn terms employed and the unusual nature of this step left little room for doubt: The affair would have to be dealt with under Article 52 of the Banking Law of 1984, which obliges shareholders to take responsibility for the collapse of their institution. The solvency ratio of "the bank that always says yes" was at risk of falling below the 8 percent level required to meet international banking standards. In his letter to the minister, Jacques de Larosiere mentioned a Fr7-billion shortfall in parent company provisions. An estimate which, according to Jean-Yves Haberer, reportedly was reduced to Fr5 billion after heated discussions initiated by Francois Gille. Rumors began to circulate quietly here and there, but nothing official leaked out. Surveillance of the group resumed, as ritually performed as two episodes of "Santa Barbara." The Commission inspectors returned to monitor compliance at Altus and SDBO, and were upset to see there had been no slowdown in activity at Altus, in the first six months under the leadership of financial high-flyer Jean-Francois Henin, despite generally deteriorating economic conditions. Not surprisingly, the probe led back, in November 1993, to the parent company, this time under the eye of an observer from the Treasury Directorate. But by now it was too late to avoid the political fallout. Politics and Prestige Several more weeks, and this auditors' headache would become an "affair." Ultimately, the Banking Commission was to reckon the real loss for 1993 at just over Fr15 billion. But the official figure, disclosed on 24 March, was only Fr6.9 billion, to which the observers added Fr18.4 billion in state guarantees to OIG, the real estate company where Fr40 billion worth of Lyonnais' "problem" assets and real estate loans had been placed. So now we are up to more than Fr25 billion. Of course, that is just an approximation. The guarantee covered only Fr14.4 billion of dubious real estate credit. The other Fr4 billion was for future interest expenses and carrying costs. Is all this just bickering among the experts? No, it's more than that. First of all, the amounts of money involved are shocking, since they don't even include the three huge scandals the Lyonnais carries like millstones around its neck (Maxwell, MGM, and Sasea), already in large part funded in 1992). Second, what the battle is really about is not so much accounting as image and politics. Otherwise why would we have seen so much wrangling between high-level bureaucrats who rarely indulge in public scenes? These masters of the bureaucratic bromides taught at ENA [National Public Administration School] would soon fall into dissension. Between the outgoing president, who thought the bank could resolve its own problems; the Treasury Directorate, outraged by the criticisms leveled at Jean-Pascal Beaufret, chief of its office of financial and monetary affairs, manager of the bank since 1992; the cabinet of Edmond Alphandery, weakly defending the ministry's role; and new Lyonnais president Jean Peyrelevade, supported by the Matignon [office of the prime minister] but characterized as "cowardly" by his banking colleagues. In the last analysis, how much money did Credit Lyonnais lose in 1993? It all depends how you look at it. When a business loses money on a real estate asset, or an ownership interest in such an asset, it must recognize the entire loss at once if it is forced to sell it in less than a year. On the other hand, if the business deems it strategically important to keep, the potential loss can be stretched out over two or three years. Everything depends on whether management regards it with a short- or medium-term perspective. The same goes for loans. By way of example, BNP [National Bank of Paris] did not provision a single centime for EuroDisney, though it has lost Fr5.3 billion. For one simple reason: It believes that the loan is not at risk since interest payments continue to be made. "This very often is the explanation for all the changes in the accounting picture whenever a new president comes on board. In the Lyonnais affair, the judgments made about operations already under way suddenly changed," says one of the protagonists. From the perspective of his industry-bank strategy, Jean-Yves Haberer was fully within his legal rights not to recognize the total potential loss, since from the standpoint of his objectives it was a long-term investment. Today, it is obvious that Jean Peyrelevade views the situation in terms of a definitive clean-up of accounts that will free his hands for the future. As shown in the real estate loans. At the height of the crisis, to prevent banks from being dragged down with their developer clients an ad hoc agreement was negotiated with the tutelary authorities: Treasury, the Banking Commission, the association of chartered accountants, etc. Written directives were sent to allow real estate provisions to be stretched over several years. "But the new Lyonnais management decided to set aside all the provisions at once," notes one of the company's directors. What if the financial position of the OIG real estate company were to improve dramatically tomorrow--what would be the judgment then? That Catherine Tron, the expert into whose hands its management was entrusted, performed brilliantly? That the financial arrangements put together by the Banking Commission, Treasury, and the bank were astute? Or simply that the crisis is over? "If it hadn't been for the recession, everyone would have said it was a work of genius," a critic of Jean-Yves Haberer readily admits. That, in any case, is the line of defense taken by the former president of Credit Lyonnais. But that defense cannot excuse the company's managerial errors. It is not enough to have a grand strategy: One must also mind the store. And Jean-Yves Haberer ran Lyonnais like the Treasury Directorate, without bothering to find out what was really happening. Here's one revealing example: The Olympia & York case, one of the world's biggest real estate disasters. "I learned in the press that we were involved; it was not up to me to keep tabs on that, there was a system of delegating authority already in place when I arrived, and I kept it," says Haberer. "But I asked for an investigation to find out how it happened." The bank lost a trifling Fr2 billion in that Fr70-billion real estate collapse. One fact uncovered in the probe was that Bernard Thiollon, then-director general, gave a green light, against the company's recommendation, to the financing of Canary Warf, the famous London real estate project that led to the ruin of the Reichman brothers. From the moment he arrived, Jean Peyrelevade put an end to the practice of delegating unlimited authority to the directors--a practice that does not exist in the other big banks--and simultaneously reduced the total of tied-up funds. Similarly, he created a directorate of loan commitments staffed with four investigators to keep a close eye on the 400 biggest clients with which the bank has commitments in excess of Fr100 million. The criterion? Their ability to pay back their loans tomorrow, or at worst within five years. At Societe Generale and BNP, there is a prestigious monitoring unit called the inspectorate general. It is almost unthinkable that Boulevard des Italiens should have nothing comparable. That until 1991 there were no consolidated statements, client by client, developer by developer, and there was no centralized risk management. For France's largest bank, truly incredible! This awesome mismanagement is at least partly to blame for anomalies like the Parretti affair, or the Pelege disaster in the real estate domain. Autonomous Fiefdoms Another explanation of this incredible chaos: the fiefdoms that Jean Peyrelevade began denouncing as soon as he took office. Within the bank, the largest fiefdoms were in commercial banking, the directorates of the big subsidiaries, real estate, and international lending. Among the subsidiaries, the most notorious were SDBO and Altus, which seem to have been the source of about 80 to 90 percent of the losses. Thus Michel Gallot, inspector of finances, president of SDBO with almost unlimited autonomy, took advantage of his friendship with Haberer to circumvent the hierarchy. With the results now familiar to everyone. As for Jean-Francois Henin, the "Mozart of easy money," he reported directly to the office of the president. To complicate matters even further, the two previous directors, Jean-Maxime Leveque and Jean Deflassieux, continued to cast their own shadow on the company. The first personally introduced three of the bank's big clients--including Robert Maxwell and Michel Pelege--to his successor. The second continued to exert a strong influence on international lending, notably to CLBN, the Dutch subsidiary through which the MGM scandal arrived. One can certainly see why Jean Peyrelevade is so cool to the idea of seeing the parliamentary commission of inquiry take the torch from the State Audit Office and make a public spectacle of all the tangled and damaging threads to this affair. At this level of dysfunction, the bank will require more than provisions for bad credit...to undo the moral damage to its own. [Box, pp 58-59] Disinvestments The word went out to sell. Jean Peyrelevade's originally announced objective--a disinvestment of Fr20 billion--has been revised upward now to Fr35 billion over two years, to calm his overly-excited colleagues. At every level, in all the subsidiaries of Credit Lyonnais: 1,200 industrial participations, totaling Fr50 billion, were examined with a fine-toothed comb. The simplest transactions were those in the orbit of Clinvest, the group's merchant bank. A special unit was set up to take charge of unloading shares held in various businesses; it was staffed by five of the bank's forty-odd employees, under the direction of Henri Filho. Their mission: to sell off as many assets as possible. But it proved to be an arduous task. First, because the recession and sluggish stock market were against them; second, because in most cases Lyonnais had been content with minority ownership positions of 10, 15, or 20 percent, rarely more (only in disastrous situations), to avoid the need to consolidate them into its own accounts. Moreover, the bank's withdrawal risked leaving the companies involved vulnerable to the horrors of investor turmoil, at a time when they were only just beginning to recover from the economic recession. So the new CEO wrote personal letters to his principal clients, to assuage hurt feelings. In Progress Already Fr2 billion of shares have been transferred, including TF1 [television network], the Naf Naf textile group which has just gone on the Stock Exchange, and Essilor. These disentanglements were carried out quickly and most often discreetly. In some cases, as with Sylea, a Labinal subsidiary, they were accompanied by financial restructurings. If computer chip card maker Gemplus goes on the Stock Exchange, Clinvest will also seize the opportunity to reduce its holdings. Being Considered The temptation is great to disinvest from Marne et Champagne, one of the biggest champagne wholesalers, weighed down as it is with the takeover of Lanson. Likewise the bank on Boulevard des Italiens is reportedly tempted to distance itself from the Bourgoin company, but the fragility of the country's second largest poultry concern makes that operation very sensitive. The objective of Henri Filho's team is to find buyers capable of reaching an understanding with the majority shareholders. For the moment, shares in companies quoted on the secondary market, and small enterprises not traded on the Exchange, are proving easier to unload. Flo breweries may soon follow in Naf Naf's footsteps. Hoped For The financial situation of some companies such as Aerospatiale and Usinor-Sacilor offers little if any hope of a rapid and honorable withdrawal, though Credit Lyonnais has quit even trying to hide its desire to extricate itself from these two groups as soon as possible. As for FNAC, it could change owners much sooner than expected. Several prospective buyers have signaled their interest. Quite a few, actually: Compagnie Generale des Eaux, Pinault-Printemps, Bertelsmann, Kingfisher, etc. The complicated dossier of France's biggest bookseller could, paradoxically enough, turn out to be the easiest to resolve. Impossible In general, these large transactions are being carried out in a pragmatic way, taking advantage of opportunities as they arise, the ideal being to trade a capital loss for a good exit, as in the case of TF1 (Clinvest ceded 3 percent of its shares). While partial disinvestments are relatively easy to arrange, solutions must still be found for participation in control-holding groups such as Artemis (Pinault), Sofitbol (Bollore), Arnault et Associes, and Christian Dior (LVMH). The resolution of Altus' situation will necessarily entail lightening its portfolio, but investments in the controlling companies of certain large groups, and in "financial chain" entities such as Novalliance, seem to be locked in where they are. Partial Disinvestment While it may be out of the question to withdraw altogether from major enterprises such as Bouygues, Lagardere Groupe, etc., it is still clear that the bank is looking to reduce its equities in other companies. There have been some gradual share transfers, notably vis-a-vis Lagardere Groupe. Reduction of its external ties has become an obsession, but cessation of investment is already a reality. Apart from a very few symbolic transactions, the king of industrial banking has decided it does not want to buy into any more companies. [Box, p 60] Haberer Interviewed [L'EXPANSION] The parliamentary commission of inquiry is trying to focus on the dysfunction that supposedly existed in the relationship between Lyonnais and the ministerial authorities. What is your position? [Haberer] I don't see any "dysfunction" to complain about. A public bank lives in very close intimacy with its shareholder, the state, and with the Bank of France. Coordination of these two entities is not the bank's responsibility. The Treasury Directorate did its job. The three successive administrators it delegated--Philippe Jaffre, Denis Samuel-Lajeunesse, and Jean-Pascal Beaufret--are remarkable men whose critical faculties never failed them. France's biggest bank has a macroeconomic role. It has an obligation to conduct itself responsibly. At the time, France's enterprises were suffering from equity capital shortages, so they welcomed the industrial-bank strategy. [L'EXPANSION] You are accused of having made decisions in a vacuum. [Haberer] This is the classic tactic for dodging responsibility--and invoked by the very people that were supposed to be setting policy! Credit Lyonnais is a statutory-law company. When it comes to extending credits, nothing is decided without a committee meeting and official minutes. And in a bank that has 8 million clients, it is not the president's job to ensure in each case that the collateral is sufficient. On the other hand, as soon as I arrived, I set up a committee, like the one at Paribas, where capital investments were discussed. At all events, the criticisms leveled at me should be seen in terms of the big picture. [L'EXPANSION] Why did you invest in Usinor-Sacilor? [Haberer] I wouldn't do it again today. But at the time, people were criticizing Lyonnais for only financing financiers. This particular idea came from the [Usinor-Sacilor] president, Francis Mer, and his enterprise flourished. The deal was also a beautiful piece of financial engineering that augmented our equity capital, despite the restraints that impeded us.... The Cooke ratio gave us no choice! [L'EXPANSION] Some of the bank's losses come from the subsidiaries, Altus and SDBO, which you have defended. [Haberer] Their recent reverses have weighed less heavily than the provisions required for the commercial bank: the motion picture industry, small- and medium-size enterprises, real estate. In France, the parent companies, with their monolithic traditions, don't have close ties with their subsidiaries. If they did, how could they manage to run up a consolidated balance of Fr2,000 billion without paralyzing centralization? You have to give the subsidiaries their commercial autonomy. Altus made more money in four years than it lost, and I regard as unfair the sarcastic criticisms directed at Jean-Francois Henin, one of our country's best financiers. The SDBO has a long history, an entrepreneurial culture, and it works in market niches that Lyonnais itself seldom frequents.
