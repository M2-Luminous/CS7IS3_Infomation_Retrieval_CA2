[Han Sung-chu] The U.S. Government has not officially stated that the possibility of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue is remote. Only the mass media have expressed hardline views. The ROK and United States hold that they will continue their efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue and that if they fail in their efforts, they will examine the possibility of imposing sanctions on North Korea through the UN Security Council and other means. [Kim] How will you hold consultations with the United States? [Han] The two countries will examine and analyze the development of the situation so far. They will also discuss the principle on resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue. Conditions permitting, they will discuss ways to foster cooperation with China, Japan, and other countries concerned. [Kim] Is it possible that the North Korean nuclear issue will be presented to the UN Security Council? How will our government respond then? [Han] It seems inevitable that it will be presented to the UN Security Council if no progress were made in the negotiations on nuclear inspections before the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors meeting. However, even if the issue is presented to the UN Security Council, no decision on economic sanctions [kyongjejejae] or other measures will be made right away. The government will honor any decision by the UN Security Council and positively participate in its implementation. [Kim] Do you predict how the international community will react if North Korea promises to accept nuclear inspections right before the IAEA Board of Governors meeting? [Han] The problem at present is to confirm whether the continuity of nuclear safeguards is ensured. Deciding on whether the continuity of nuclear safeguards is ensured or not is the IAEA's own right, and I think the international community will honor the IAEA's decision on this matter. [Kim] It is rumored that North Korean President Kim Il-song has failed to correctly perceive the reality concerning the nuclear issue. [Han] There is such a rumor or analysis. However, I cannot correctly comment because I have had no direct dialogue with North Korean policymakers. However, if this were true, it is truly worrisome. [Kim] At New York contacts, the United States promised to North Korea that it would discontinue the Team Spirit exercise and decide on the timing of the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks if North Korea accepts nuclear inspections. Is the promise still valid? [Han] The agreement at the New York contacts will be valid until the IAEA declares the discontinuation of nuclear safeguards.
