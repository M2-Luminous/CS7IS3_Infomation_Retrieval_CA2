ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) designates endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), for the plant Poa mannii (Mann's bluegrass). Four extant populations containing a total of approximately 125 individuals of the species are known to occur in the northwestern and north-central region of the island of Kauai. The species and its habitat are threatened by goats, competition by naturalized, introduced vegetation, fire, landslides, and erosion. The existence of few populations and individuals increases the likelihood of extinction from stochastic events and/or reduced reproductive vigor. This final rule implements the Federal protection provisions provided by the Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this final rule is available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours, at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pacific Islands Office, 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, Room 6307, P.O. Box 50167, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert P. Smith, Field Supervisor, at the above address (808/541&hyph;2749). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Poa mannii was first collected by Horace Mann, Jr., and William Tufts Brigham in 1864 or 1865 in Waimea Canyon on the island of Kauai. The name Poa mannii was published without a description (attributed to William Munro) in Seemann's Journal of Botany in 1869. The specific epithet was selected to honor one of the original collectors. Subsequently, the species was validly published by Hillebrand (1888) in his flora.
