The deals, totaling more than $20 million, will give the city the largest and most sophisticated digital transmission network in China. It will also result in the city having the most advanced network management capabilities for the surveillance and control of its entire public telecommunications network. The sale represents the first time AT&T will supply high-speed transmission equipment to China since the demise of the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control [COCOM]. The 17-member organization controlled technology transfer to the East Bloc for 44 years and ceased to exist on April 1. Under these contracts, AT&T will supply BTA with two state-of-the-art systems: SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) fibre optic transmission equipment operating at 2.488 Gb/s (gigabits per second) and a set of advanced network management and surveillance systems to monitor and manage the communications network. With the equipment, Beijing will be able to offer advanced telecommunications services and have the flexibility to move forward with new services, according to BTA officials. Zhang Ligui, Director General of BTA, said the signing of the two AT&T/BTA agreements signifies that cooperation between AT&T and Beijing has entered a new stage. William Warwick, Chairman of AT&T China Incorporated, said, ``We see these projects as an important milestone in building our relationship with the BTA. This is our first delivery of SDH technology to China since President Clinton lifted export controls on high-speed transmission sales,'' Warwick added. AT&T currently has nine joint ventures in China.
