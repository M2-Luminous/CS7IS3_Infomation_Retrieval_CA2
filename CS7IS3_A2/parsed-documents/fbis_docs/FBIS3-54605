In a memorandum submitted to the PLO Executive Committee, 'Abd-al-Shafi said that in light of the evolving situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, particularly after the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles accord, the requirements of the transfer of power, and other matters related to the implementation of the accord, we see a need to set up a national authority council in the Gaza Strip and another one in the West Bank. This council should consist of respected local nationalist personalities who enjoy national credibility and high moral standards and who represent various sectors of the social and political fabric. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, who recently led the reformers' delegation to Tunis, defined the authority's tasks as follows: It will be the only national and local authority and the local address of the PLO. It will be the only channel of contact with the PLO. It will serve as an advisory body to the Palestinian leadership on all local matters, above all by giving its opinion regarding the transfer of powers and other matters stemming from the Declaration of Principles and its implementation. It will carry out all other tasks in its capacity as a national and local authority council. It will coordinate among the various bodies should this be necessary. The memorandum submitted by 'Abd-al-Shafi suggested that this authority continue in its tasks until elections are held. It also proposed that the PLO Executive Committee form a small preparatory committee, comprised of personalities from inside, to set up this authority. Dr. Taysir 'Aruri, member of the Palestinian People's Party political bureau, has said that 'Abd-al-Shafi's demand enjoys his party's support and that of FIDA [Palestinian Democratic Union], Fatah's partners in the Palestinian leadership. He pointed out that Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, member of the PLO Executive Committee and FIDA's leader, supported this idea during the Palestinian leadership's meetings, but the proposal was rejected by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.
