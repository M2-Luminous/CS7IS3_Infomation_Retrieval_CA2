It says, in particular: The reports from Yemen over the past few days speak about wide-scale military actions. Despite numerous calls to stop the firing, more and more units and subunits join the fighting and the sides are using virtually all military means at their disposal. The Russian leadership again appeals to the warring sides with a pressing request to immediately stop all military operations. No matter how deep the differences between the participants of the conflict might be or what aims they might pursue, we believe they cannot justify the fratricidal bloodshed, more destruction and suffering of the entire people of Yemen. The government of the Russian Federation in Sana and the Russian General Consulate in Aden are doing everything necessary to ensure the safety of the Russian citizens in Yemen.
