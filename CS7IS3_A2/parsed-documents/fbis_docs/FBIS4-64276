They insist on stressing its coherence and especially the considerable trust placed in Europe. This is proved by the fact that future weapons research has been kept at the same level, but reduced as an overall percentage of the plan. This ratio, referred to as the CRED (Research, Study, and Development Credit), was fixed at 6 percent of the annual budget. When the account for ground arsenals, which are grouped together in Giat Industries, was closed, the figure was 5.6 percent. It will further drop to 5.3 percent. The distribution ratio between military equipment manufacturers and research and development facilities will therefore switch from 70:30 in 1994 to 75:25 by the year 2000. R&D credits will drop from 16.2 billion francs [Fr] per year to Fr14 billion. The logic behind this is the need to supply the Armed Forces with the resources they rapidly require. In the eyes of the authorities, there is no question of reliving the experience of the mid-eighties, when a new fighter aircraft, a new tank, new helicopters, missiles, ships, an aircraft carrier, and submarines were all planned at the same time, representing more than Fr700 billion-worth of programs to be financed. However, above all, this brake on research budgets, while the overall military planning budget is rising by 0.5 percent this year or even by 1.5 percent over the last three years, represents a clear message from the French authorities to industry: You must cooperate on the European level. This should make it possible to limit the amount of parallel work being carried out in the European defense industry and to share the costs that each company previously bore alone. At the Defense Ministry it is stressed that its decision to reduce the CRED is in line with its "policy of champions" and "technological choices" in the weapons industry. Effective Cooperation Thus, the future fighter aircraft destined to succeed the Rafale will have to be produced as part of a cooperation project. Dassault Aviation is already working in this field with British Aerospace, while Dassault Electronique is working with GEC [General Electricity Company]. The Tigre and NH-90 helicopters (French-German for the former and French-Dutch-Italian for the latter) have been saved, although costs have been revised downward. Where ships are concerned, the Horizon frigate program (France, Great Britain, and Italy) shows the way ahead. Officials have not hesitated to force industrial groups to cooperate by whittling down their R&D credits. They stress that the military planning law, which provides for overall annual growth, will enable French weapons companies to increase their military revenues (excluding exports) significantly by the year 2000.
