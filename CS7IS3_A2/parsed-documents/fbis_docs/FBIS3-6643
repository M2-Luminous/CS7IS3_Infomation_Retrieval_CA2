During the total seizure of Pailin at 1800 on 19 March, the KRAF met with a stiff resistance and were counterattacked by the recalcitrant DKG. As a result of the battle to protect the Bar Ya Kha village, the KRAF killed 22 DKG troops on the spot. In particular, at Sala Krau the KRAF seized two 76.2-mm guns, a 122-mm K-38 cannon, 30 RPK's, a DK-75 gun, a DK-82 gun, two 37-mm antiaircraft guns, 10 AK-47's, two SKS's, two SKT's, an RCL, seven B-40's, an 82-mm mortar, a 107-mm rocket stand, two 105-mm rifles, more than 10 tonnes of assorted ammunition, more than 50 automobiles, and hundreds of motorcycles. These are only preliminary results. The General Staff will inform the public of subsequent results in the future.
