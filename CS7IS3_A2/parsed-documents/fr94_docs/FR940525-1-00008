FR940525-1-00008 FR940525-1-00004 IV. Impact Statement We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule would extend from 3 months to 5 months the time frame that providers have to file their cost reports and would define what HCFA considers to be an ``acceptable'' cost report submission. Neither of these proposed changes would have a significant economic impact on providers. Therefore, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. Thus, we are not preparing a regulatory flexibility analysis. Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact statement if a proposed rule may have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. We are not preparing a regulatory impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. V. Other Required Information A. Public Comment Because of the large number of pieces of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, in preparing the final rule, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date specified in the Dates section of this preamble, and we will respond to the comments in the preamble of that rule. B. Paperwork Reduction Act This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).

(i) Cost reports are due on or before the last day of the fifth month following the close of the period covered by the report. For cost reports ending on a day other than the last day of the month, cost reports are due 150 days after the last day of the cost reporting period. (ii) Extensions of the due date for filing a cost report may be granted by the intermediary only when a provider's operations are significantly adversely affected due to extraordinary circumstances over which the provider has no control, such as flood or fire. * * * * * (5) An acceptable cost report submission is defined as follows: (i) All providers._The provider, in addition to completing and submitting the required cost reporting forms, including all necessary signatures, must submit all supporting documentation required by program instructions. (ii) For providers that are required to file electronic cost reports._In addition to the forms and documentation required in paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5)(i) of this section, the provider must submit its cost reports in an electronic cost report format in conformance with the requirements contained in the Electronic Cost Report (ECR) Specifications Manual (unless the provider has received an exemption from HCFA). (iii) The intermediary makes a determination of acceptability within 30 days of receipt of the provider's cost report. If the cost report is considered unacceptable, the intermediary returns the cost report with a letter explaining the reasons for the rejection. When the cost report is rejected, it is deemed an unacceptable submission and treated as if a report had never been filed.
