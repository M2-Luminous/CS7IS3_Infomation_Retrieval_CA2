At a tele-conference today, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua urged the strengthening and improvement of control over pricing in order to curb excessive price rises. Zou said that to create an environment favorable for implementing various reform policies, it is necessary to keep an overall economic balance and a reasonable economic structure. Redoubled efforts should be made to increase market supply, especially production and supply for residents' daily necessities, he said. He stressed that any price reform program to be put into effect must be approved and arranged by the State Council and no arbitrary price rise should be allowed. He said that the pace of establishing a sound price control system should be quickened and the supervision and administration over the prices of daily necessities and services should be strengthened. He called for efforts to guide residents' consumption and ease the fear of inflation. Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, said at the conference that the check will cover all enterprises, and individual households engaging in industry and commerce as well as government institutions and the illegal and arbitrary charges since the latter half of 1993. Serious violations will be traced back to the latter half of 1992, Chen said. The check will be conducted mainly on the prices of daily necessities as well as service charges, the minister said. The check will be started later this month.
