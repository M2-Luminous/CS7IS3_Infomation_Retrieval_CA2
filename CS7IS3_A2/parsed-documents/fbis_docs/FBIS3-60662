This type of reaction is the opposite of what takes place in nuclear fission which is currently carried out by atomic reactors throughout the world and are used to produce nuclear energy and to conduct nuclear tests. The research scientist says that the results of his theory is the solution to the problem of beginning research in this area at an international level, where research continues and there is still no emergence of a reactor which would use hydrogen as it [word indistinct]. Hydrogen is one of the main elements of water and thus energy created from nuclear fusion is considered to be one of the most important alternative forms of energy in the future because its fuel (water) is available in (?great quantities) from the sea and oceans. The research scientist says that this discovery will spur scientisist to review their research and experiments and to reexamine their theoretical studies and reformulate them on new bases and concepts. The research scientist said that this discovery would help to solve other scientific problems which depended on it.
