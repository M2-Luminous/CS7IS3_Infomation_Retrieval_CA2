They concluded that economic and political interests in Indonesia have made the nation's legal system subordinate to these two fields. The experts also concluded that law has never been the determining factor in decisions. The seminar was attended by Professor Dr. Sunaryati, a legal expert; Professor Dr. Sri Sumantri, dean of the Law Faculty at Pajajaran University; and Dr. T. Mulya Lubis, a legal expert. The legal experts told the seminar that the legal system in Indonesia has been tampered with from time to time. They said that the government, professional institutions, businessmen, and the people must show the political will to strengthen the national legal system. At the seminar, the legal experts cited several concrete examples to support their allegation that the country's archaic legal system is no longer suitable for the present situation. The experts agreed, however, not to point out the unsuitable laws in the existing legal system, but instead discussed ways to seek the best replacement for those regarded obsolete so that future generations can observe the new laws. Sunaryati said that we do not have to blame the old laws which the nation inherited from the Dutch colonial masters. Instead, we should think of a way to establish our own national laws that are free from political dominance and applicable to the present situation. Mulya Lubis said the current legal system has made the judicial institutions ineffectual purveyors of justice. He singled out the courts' failure to uphold justice when dealing with the nation's economic and business laws had resulted in the non-repayment of loans. In other words, there is no political will to settle the bad debts problem even though there is a clause in the law that will allow the problem to be settled comprehensively. Actually the practice of dispensing one's own rules is not something new in this country. Several cases of contempt for the law have been discovered and efforts to uphold justice have been carried out by the legislative and executive branches. This could be seen from several documents that date back to the formation of the Republic of Indonesia. It is interesting, however, to note the outcome of the seminar. This is because the topics of discussion were highlighted at a time when the nation is at the take-off stage for entry into the PJPT II. At this stage, the legal system is one of the most important factors in efforts to implement the national development targets. Definitely, every aspect of the legal system should be guided by the national discipline which is the driving factor behind the people's obedience and loyalty to the laws. National discipline is a norm that exists in a society. To cite an example, the MPR [People's Consultative Assembly] always places national discipline as one of the dominant factors in the Broad Outline of State Policies [GBHN]. This means we have to abide by the national discipline to ensure that the our national development goals are achieved. [passage omitted
