The communique, which was issued from "the mountains of the Mexican southeast," is addressed to the national and international media and is signed by guerrilla subcommander Marcos. The document lists a number of local and foreign media that the EZLN will accredit to cover the negotiations to solve the armed conflict in Chiapas State that began on 1 January. "The initiation of a dialogue for peace between the EZLN and the federal government at a yet to be determined place and date is imminent," states the document, which adds that the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command (CCRI-CG) [Comite Clandestino Revolucionario Indigena-Comandancia General] has already reached "basic agreements" with Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho. It added that "some details are yet to be settled and some previous agreements are yet to be fulfilled, but the basic points have already been defined." The EZLN asserted that "there is an open-door policy" toward the local and foreign media which, according to the rebels, "carry out their task objectively without taking sides." In this sense the communique stated that "all the written press" shall be allowed, as far as the EZLN is concerned, "to cover the dialogue for peace and reconciliation," but in the case of televised media, the guerrillas "will veto the participation of only the national private television stations Televisa and Television Azteca." According to the rebels' report, Televisa "does not need to seek news because they invent it at their will and convenience," while the reporters of Television Azteca "have shown a lack of professionalism by offering money to our fighters" to make statements. The communique added that several media "have flatly refused to report with objectivity" and have "particularly attacked our cause and that of the Chiapas Indian people." The EZLN also publicized a "special invitation" to nine newspapers and four television stations, both Mexican and foreign, three Mexican magazines, five Mexican radio stations, and five international news agencies -- including AFP --to cover the government-guerrilla dialogue. The report from the Zapatists stated that accreditation of the press will be carried out through San Cristobal de Las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the national commissioner for intermediation (appointed by the EZLN).
