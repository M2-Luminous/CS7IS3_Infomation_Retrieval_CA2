"I don't consider measures to that point (are necessary) yet," Hosokawa told reporters before leaving for summit talks in the United States. While signaling that the North Korean nuclear crisis will figure high on the agenda in Friday's talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington, Hosokawa reiterated that Tokyo counts on Chinese cooperation in efforts to convince Pyongyang to reach a compromise. "We are joining forces with the United Nations and the permanent members (of the UN Security Council), and would also like to enlist China's cooperation," he said. He said he conveyed this request to Chinese President Jiang Zemin during the summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Seattle in November. Asked for comment on Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa's remarks alleging North Korea has already been armed with nuclear weapons, Hosokawa said this does not reflect the government's stance. "We don't have such reports on hand," he said. Earlier in the day, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also said Japan is not considering economic sanctions against North Korea. "We are not in a situation to do so," the top government spokesman said at a news conference. Takemura said Tokyo will continue its diplomatic efforts to help the negotiations go smoothly. The YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported Thursday that Japan, the United States and South Korea have agreed that UN economic sanctions would be inevitable if Pyongyang continues to block international inspections of its nuclear facilities. The daily reported that the three countries reached the accord in early February at a trilateral working-level meeting in New York. It also said Tokyo will start preparing for sanctions, such as limiting trade with Pyongyang and halting currency remittances by North Korean residents of Japan. Talks between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, have been stalemated over Pyongyang's rejection of iaea special inspections. The IAEA is expected to refer the matter to the UN Security Council later this month. Japan's exports to North Korea amounted to some 28.2 billion yen in 1992 and imports from that country totaled 32.6 billion yen, according to Japanese Government figures.
