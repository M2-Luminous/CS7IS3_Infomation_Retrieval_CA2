He also expressed doubt about President Lissouba's ability to solve the crisis. Foreign Minister Benjamin Bounkoulou, who is quite irritated, spoke to Monique Mas: [Begin Bounkoulou recording] The reasons that impelled Mr. Roussin to react in this way -- the assessment he made about our president -- are unacceptable. His remarks are discourteous toward a president of a country that is a friend of France. This assessment is not in line with the traditions of friendship between Congo and France; it is not in line with the elementary principles of diplomacy and international law for a minister of a friendly country to judge a head of state in this way. It is all the more serious since Mr. Roussin has very friendly relations with President Pascal Lissouba. What is very surprising about these remarks by Minister Roussin is that the previous day a French Government statement issued by the Foreign Ministry noted the search for a political solution under the authority of President Lissouba. [end recording] The French ambassador to Brazzaville was summoned to the Congolese Foreign Ministry this morning.
