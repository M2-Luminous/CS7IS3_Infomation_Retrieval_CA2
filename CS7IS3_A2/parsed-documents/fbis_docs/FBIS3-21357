This direction has opened the gates of hope wide before the youth of this nation to obtain the jobs that best suit their capabilities, making them better able to take part actively in serving this country and its citizens. Saudi Arabian Airlines is considered one of the leading organizations in this field; it has achieved 78 percent Saudization, and according to its current plan, this is slated to increase to 86 percent by 1415H [1995]. Mr. Hasan Muhammad Tayib, Saudia's deputy director general for employee affairs, spoke to us in this interview of the philosophy of Saudization which the airlines has carried out, and continues to carry out now. Priority to Saudis [Al-Ghamidi] Now that Saudia has done what everyone wanted to do, how far has Saudia gone in this direction? [Tayib] The constant instructions of the Custodian of the Holy Mosques, God preserve him, on the development of national manpower and raising its performance standards, are the engine of our strategy in the field of human resources. Saudi Airlines has over time focused on their development through its plans for the development and training of Saudi persons to take their natural place in the company's technical and administrative positions. Over the last two decades a number of steps have been made in the field of Saudization, in line with the company's phases of growth, the evolution of its staff structure, and local job market data, all focused on the creation and protection of enough job opportunities for Saudis to supplement the decrease in expatriate labor. Training and Development It was our obligation for Saudia to offer our citizens the opportunity to join our training and development program in various areas of the air transport industry, in accordance with the government's policy. For this purpose we established training departments in the technical and management fields. We have also sent trainees abroad to specialize in all branches and activities of this industry that are not found domestically. Turning to the Saudization program plan, a study was prepared, the first of its kind, with the cooperation of the Manpower Council. It lasted nearly two full years and was aimed in general at arriving at an executive plan in a fixed-time program that began in 1407H [1987] and is continuing until 1415H [1995], with the general average of Saudization of total employees inside the Kingdom to be 86 percent by the end of the plan. Saudia has completed a major phase of the execution of this plan, with 78 percent Saudization; and this will increase to 86 percent according to the plan by the end of 1995. A Badge We Are Proud Of There are positive signs that indicate the acceptance of Saudi youth of some of the vocations that they were hesitant about before, ending a real obstacle to the implementation of the Saudization program, such as jobs in air service and accessory office work. It is enough for me to point to the praise, or rather the certificate with which Saudia was honored, from His Royal Highness Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, minister of interior and chairman of the Manpower Council. It showed His Highness's kind appreciation for Saudi Airlines' efforts to implement the Saudization plan. We consider this a badge on the chest of every member of our company who helped to reach the basic goal of Saudization. Practical Solutions [Al-Ghamidi] As an offical and a citizen, how do you view the extent of Saudization in the private sector? [Tayib] There are numerous efforts being made by official and national agencies to enact practical solutions to the Saudization question in the private sector, such as the national labor seminar in the national sector that was held in the Institute for Public Administration in January 1992, in which they dealt with the extent of participation, the seriousness of the effort, and the frankness of receptivity. I sincerely hope these efforts will continue so that we may see what they have planned transformed into a living reality. Saudi is carrying out, in this field, the role it was given by its membership in this society. In addition to its program, it is part of a committee made up of the Interior Ministry, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and the Presidency of Civil Aviation to put rules and recommendations in place aimed at Saudizing jobs at airline agencies and travel agencies. I Disagree [Al-Ghamidi] Some private sector executives think that Saudi employees are not carrying out their proper role, and ask for more productivity. How true is this, in light of your own experience with Saudi employees? [Tayib] My personal conviction is completely different, and it is a conviction formed over long practice, and through varied employee experiences. The human element is an important part, even the most important element of production, and its profit is in conformity with the investment in it, in terms of training and development. Some business owners have a capacity for patience for projects sometimes, for the profit to show, but they hesitate in integrated investment thinking which deals with Saudi employees, considering them national human capital. There is a problem of training the national sector, and the reasons for it must be studied, and solved; perhaps some are the non-existence of specialized, integrated agencies to carry out this role, or business's weak conviction of the importance of training, or financial reasons. This is in addition to the importance of looking at what is expected of Saudi employees who work in travel agencies in which Saudi Airlines takes part in accordance with the request of travel agents (TACA) [acronym as transliterated] by developing a training program covering no less than 25 specialized training courses for agency employees alone. Philosophy of Saudization [Al-Ghamidi] What is the strategy upon which employee training is based? [Tayib] The management philosophy of Saudization is based on the consideration that the human element is the decisive factor in the success or failure of any company. From this standpoint, constant training is seen as the basic pillar of its growth and the expansion of its facilities and services, especially in an industry as highly skilled as air transport. Training is also one of the social goals of Saudization, by building and polishing our people's skills and training them to work in the company's positions essential for management and operating its fleet by using the most modern methods in line with the highest international standards and specifications in thus industry. The company's training strategy is based on three components: - Operating needs, covering the volume and variety of work in the frameworks of both time and place. - Employment requirements essential for operating requirements, including the variety of qualifications needed and the necessary expertise and ability for training. - Methods of modern technology and management thinking, in light of which we are reviewing the training programs, methods, and equipment to suit our technical needs and conceive a method of work performance.
