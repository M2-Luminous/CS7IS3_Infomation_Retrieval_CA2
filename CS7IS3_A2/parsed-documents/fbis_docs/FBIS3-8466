The Serbs were asked to agree on 33.3 percent of the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina for the Muslims; to allow the replacement of the Canadian battalion in Srebrenica; to withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo; and to allow the opening of Tuzla airport, while in return the EU would do its utmost to ensure that the sanctions imposed on the Serb people were lifted as a matter of urgency, Krajisnik told Jagodina Radio today. We have met all our commitments but the EU has done nothing to lift the sanctions. The EU alone is to be blamed for losing our trust and its reputation, and from now on any EU proposal will be met with a large amount of reservation, Krajisnik said. On the other hand, Washington's proposal for a federation and confederation of Muslims and Croats and speculations about the Serbs joining the Muslim-Croat agreement indicate, to say the least, an inability to view the situation on the ground realistically, Krajisnik said, and went on to add: It is only by pressure that a federation and confederation of Croats and Muslims can be set up; however, not even force can secure Serb participation. In view of the above I think that the most logical way forward would be to sum up the negotiations so far, to decide if the Owen-Stoltenberg plan is dead, and to convene a new conference in which all three sides would take part and at which fresh proposals for territorial divisions between the three national communities would be submitted, Krajisnik said and went on to stress: It is only the issue of territories that can be discussed realistically since we have already committed ourselves to a union of three independent states in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik said in conclusion.
