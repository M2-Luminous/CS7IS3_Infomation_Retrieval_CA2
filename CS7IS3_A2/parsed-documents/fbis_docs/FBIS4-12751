The most recent meeting was held five days ago. A senior Hamas official, who wished to remain anonymous, said his organization will seek to participate in all Palestinian institutions, such as health and education bodies, provided it is granted a fair slice in the future Gaza Strip rule. A Fatah source has also confirmed the meeting, saying that his organization intended to permit Hamas to take an active part in the process, alongside Fatah, in a bid to solve together the Palestinian population's everyday problems. At the meetings, Hamas representatives expressed a desire to take part in the Palestinian police, when one is established. They are our brethren, a Hamas source said, and we will cooperate with them in a bid to ensure the Palestinian people's safety, and we are certainly not against participating in the Palestinian police force. The source added that Hamas welcomes the recently returned Gaza Strip deportees. Another important decision made at the last meeting was that more meetings should be held to permit a discussion of various vital issues. A date for one such meeting was set for the next few days. The rumors about the Fatah-Hamas meetings have generated great excitement in the Strip. The headline of yesterday's AL-QUDS, one of the leading newspapers in the territories, pronounced: Numerous Reactions to Fatah-Hamas Dialogue. The Strip residents now hope that with the autonomy implementation, they will be able to attend to all their affairs as one united front.
