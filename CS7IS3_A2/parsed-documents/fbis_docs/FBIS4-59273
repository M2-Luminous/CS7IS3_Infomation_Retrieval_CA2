Bankers and government officials said the central bank, which has reserves of around 2.7 billion dollars, wanted to maintain the current exchange rate of 1,689.50 pounds to the dollar. The last such intervention occurred last August, amid speculation triggered by a major Israeli military offensive in southern Lebanon. Al-Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, decided Sunday to boycott government meetings after plans for a reshuffle aimed at including more Christian figures were opposed by President Ilyas al-Hirawi, himself a Christian, and the parliament speaker Nabih Birri, a Shiite Moslem. Al-Hariri ordered the postponement of the weekly cabinet session. The billionaire prime minister's appointment in October 1992 and his plans to rebuild war-shattered Lebanon at a cost of up to 12 billion dollars helped to attract back Western and Arab investors to Lebanon. But his 30-member Syrian-backed government, made up equally of Christian and Moslem ministers, has failed to enjoy the trust of many Lebanese political and religious leaders, namely the Christians. The situation has been exacerbated with the recent arrests of dozens of former Christian militiamen, including former warlord Samir Ja'ja', in connection with a February church bombing and a 1991 political killing.
