The Statistics Department reported that the improved trade position was due to stronger demand, which induced higher export growth compared with that of imports. Exports expanded by 18 percent from the 10 months in 1992 to RM100.2 billion as against a 14.3 percent growth in imports at RM96.3 billion. [passage omitted] For the 10-month period under review, the acceleration of export growth was largely contributed by significant increases in the exports of manufactured goods (+36.8 percent), machinery and transport equipment (+29.7 percent) and miscellaneous manufactured articles (+10.7 percent). These three major components contributed to 67.9 percent of total export earnings. The department reported that exports of mineral fuel, the second largest contributor to export value, experienced a reduction of 5.2 percent in earnings when compared with the same period in 1992. The growth in imports was largely contributed by higher imports of machinery and transport equipment (+16.6 percent), which accounted for 55.7 percent of total import receipts. Malaysia's major trading partners during January-October 1993 were Japan, the United States, Singapre, Taiwan, Germany, the United Kingdom, South Korea and Hong Kong, which collectively accounted for 75.4 percent of the total trade.
