The foreign affairs spokesman said that Simic's remark about his complete agreement with Jeszenszky that UN sanctions against rump Yugoslavia have become absurd was inaccurate. "Hungary's position on the embargo is unchanged," the spokesman said. Simic also indicated that, in keeping with the January talks of President Milosevic and Jeszenszky, concrete steps will soon be taken to resolve problems for Hungarians in the Serbian region of Vojvodina. There will be negotiations between the Serb Government and the Democratic Hungarian Community of Vojvodina (VMDK). Hungary asked Yugoslavia to demonstrate its commitment to promoting peace, lessening tension, and settling the crisis. The United Nations would see licensing of CSCE missions in Yugoslavia, ensurance of free navigation on the Danube, easing of tension in Kosovo, and progress in guaranteeing the rights of Serbia's minorities, including ethnic Hungarians, as gestures towards peace. The Hungarian side was happy at Serbia's readiness to open talks with the VMDK.
