He spoke about the position and stances of the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation ahead of the next round of Geneva talks. [Name indistinct] has the report. [Correspondent] At today's discussion of peace talks at the Council of the Congress of Bosniak-Muslim Intellectuals, Minister Ljubljankic spoke, among other things, about elements of our position before the next round of Geneva talks, which was defined in the past few days. [Ljubljankic] "As you know, in Bonn we discussed the Croatian state's offer that is -- from the legal and political point of view -- useless. Starting from its heading: A contractual agreement, and so on via the preamble and the articles explaining the agreement -- we reached the conclusion that I have just said: The document is useless. The document basically contains an offer for a confederation between Croatia -- enlarged by so-called Herceg-Bosna -- and some future Bosniak-Muslim republic as it is defined in the document." [Correspondent] What forced the Croatian leadership to take this step? Minister Ljubljankic believes that it was Croatia's stained reputation on the international scene, as well as the sharp criticism of Tudjman's policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, voiced in Croatia itself. What will be our reply? The working group, set up at the prime minister's request and which included Minister Ljubljankic, has prepared draft proposals, which were yesterday discussed at the sessions of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency and the government. [Ljubljankic] "We will submit a new proposal to the Croatian side on a confederal agreement between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Bosnia-Herzegovina meaning the territory held by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- the Croatian side refers to it as the Muslim army -- and Herceg-Bosna, because the remaining territory will be considered as temporarily occupied. This draft document will state that the power would be based on the principle of parity between Croats and Muslims and that the two state working groups or commissions will work on perfecting and finding a final definition of this [word indistinct]." [Correspondent] During his recent visit to Sarajevo, former French President Giscard d'Estaing suggested to President Izetbegovic to bypass Geneva in some way and bring in new elements to the talks, Ljubljankic said and added: [Ljubljankic] "We think that the time has come to do something like this because Geneva, I have recently said it on radio, has become a caricature. There is always something being added, we have constantly been adding something to the proposals. One side would be dissatisfied with something and it would add an element; finally the whole project became a caricature [words indistinct] I think that these things should be changed and that the UN Security Council should take over. Given the existing status quo it is better that the UN Security Council supervises the situation in Bosnia than at the Conference on Former Yugoslavia." [Correspondent] The largest part of the public abroad supports the official Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities, and so do many former politicians whose opinion is still important in the world. Active foreign politicians however, favor a division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the equation of guilt and so on. Minister Ljubljankic will tell us why that is so. [Ljubljankic] "I have only one answer: Because it is the Muslims who live in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Why are they afraid of Bosnian Muslims (?when) the Bosnian Muslims are also Europeans? They are surprised that if we have already accepted all the benefits of European culture, and if we live according to the European cultural pattern, we are still Muslims. (?Is this) a way for Islam eventually to come to Europe as an idea, not only as a form, as a shadow of something historical and traditional, but also as an idea to take Europe, to encompass it, to fulfill the emptiness of the European man with a new idea. It is my deep conviction that this is the reason why they are afraid. What is the answer to this? We must find one together. I believe that we should remain what we are and remain in Europe."
