Moreover, forces opposing Rabbani's government have reiterated their demand for the president's resignation. They have, furthermore, formed a new political-military organization, called the Coordination Council [Shoray-e Hamahangi] of Afghanistan's Islamic Revolution [CCAIR]. Our correspondent in Kabul reports on the latest developments in Afghanistan: Since this morning, battles between the warring factions in Kabul have intensified. Haji Farid, a spokesmen for Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], said that extensive offensives by the forces opposing Rabbani's government began at 10.00 today, Kabul time. The offensives were waged from five different fronts in the south and southeast of the Afghan capital, and the attacking forces attempted to infiltrate the defense lines set up by Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's forces. Battles in Kabul intensified after the government opposition groups issued a statement announcing the formation of a new political-military organization called the CCAIR. The statement, which was issued yesterday, states that without the resignation of Borhanoddin Rabbani from the presidency, the battles in Kabul will continue. In response to the statement, a spokesman for Afghan President Rabbani announced yesterday that Rabbani's government is prepared to tender its resignation only after general elections are held in 6 months' time. In an interview today, the Hezb-e Eslami spokesman said: The precondition set by the opposition forces calling for Rabbani's resignation still stands, and Afghan Prime Minister Hekmatyar has promised that he will resign after Rabbani does so. Meanwhile, reports indicate that last night and this morning, General Dostam's war planes repeatedly bombed the positions of Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's forces, situated in the heights around Kabul's television station, the presidential palace and Bagram airport in northeast Kabul. In retaliation, Rabbani's war planes bombed the positions held by Hezb-e Eslami and General Dostam in the south and southeast of the capital.
