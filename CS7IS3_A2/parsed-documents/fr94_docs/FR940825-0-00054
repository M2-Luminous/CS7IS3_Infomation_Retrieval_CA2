FR940825-0-00054 FR940825-0-00013 37 CFR 1.482␣International Preliminary Examination Fees Section 1.482, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(ii), is revised to adjust the fees authorized by 35 U.S.C. 376 to recover costs. 37 CFR 1.492␣National Stage Fees Section 1.492, paragraphs (a), (b) and (d), is revised to adjust fees established therein to reflect fluctuations in the CPI. Response to Comments on the Rules Patent Fee Increase A notice of proposed rulemaking to adjust patent fees was published in the Federal Register on May 27, 1994, at 59 FR 27519, and in the Official Gazette on June 7, 1994, at 1163 OG 14. A public hearing was held on June 28, 1994. Three comments were received and considered in adopting the rules set forth herein. Comments: The respondents, although not objecting to the three percent fee increase, strongly oppose any fee increase for the purpose of making up patent fee surcharge money that is being withheld from the PTO. The respondents support the Administration's proposal to ensure that all user fees assessed by the PTO are used exclusively by the PTO. Response: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508) requires the PTO, in fiscal year 1995, to collect $107 million in patent fee surcharges and to deposit these collections to the Patent and Trademark Office Fee Surcharge Fund. In the past, Congress has only appropriated part of these deposits back to the PTO. Deposits not made available to the Office reside in the Fund. To date, the reserve in the Fund is slightly in excess of $35 million. For fiscal year 1995, the PTO requested that all patent fees be provided directly to the Office, thereby eliminating reliance on appropriations from the Fee Surcharge Fund. This language will not be enacted. The House of Representatives has recommended that an additional $18.7 million in patent fee surcharges not be made available to the Office in fiscal year 1995. Final action on the 1995 appropriations bill is pending. The Administration does not propose to increase patent fees in fiscal year 1995 other than the increase that reflects fluctuations in the Consumer Price Index. Collection of the Fee for Access to APS-Text at the PTDLs A fee for access to APS-Text at a PTDL was set in the final rule package published in the Federal Register on August 21, 1992 (57 FR 38189). The final rule became effective October 1, 1992. On that date, the fee took effect but collection was immediately suspended by the Commissioner to provide additional time to solicit input from the private sector on alternative collection methods, and other options for accessing patent search and retrieval in the Libraries. The Office received six comments. Comment: Two respondents stated that many of the PTDLs already have considerable experience in collecting fees for access to on-line patent and trademark services provided by private sector vendors. They suggested that mechanisms already in place could be adapted to the collection of fees for PTO-provided services. These respondents also suggested that the PTO procure access for the PTDLs to private sector on-line patent and trademark services, using a Federal procurement mechanism, such as Fedlink. Response: The PTO encourages the PTDLs to provide a variety of patent and trademark services for their patrons. However, the PTDLs are not required to provide access to private sector on-line services, and the PTO can only provide support and training to the PTDLs for products and services it develops. In the case of APS access, participation on the part of the PTDLs will be voluntary. With respect to other services, the PTDLs will make the decision as to which ones best fit the needs of their user communities. Fedlink, which provides on-line services to Government agencies, cannot extent its charter to include the PTDLs. Under the proposed subscription method, libraries should develop policies and procedures which best suit their particular circumstances. Comment: One respondent suggested that the access to APS be expanded beyond the PTDLs, with a small fee for general use, and discounted fees for independent inventors and/or off-peak usage. Response: At this time, allowing direct access by the public would impact internal PTO operations. Access at PTDLs will ensure usage in a controlled environment, where end-users will have access to knowledge and skills of trained librarians. Comment: One respondent suggested that the PTO permit voluntary participation by the individual PTDLs. Response: Participation on the part of the PTDLs will be voluntary. The level of participation by the PTDLs will not affect their relationship with the PTO in any manner. Comment: One respondent suggested that the PTO provide access to APS-Text on a subscription basis. This method would set a fee for anticipated usage over a determined period of time. Response: The PTO will provide access to APS-Text to the PTDLs on an annual subscription basis. All of the libraries will have the option of subscribing. Each library that chooses to subscribe will establish a policy for providing the public with access to APS-Text. Comment: One respondent suggested that the PTO set up a system that allows users to input credit or debit card numbers. Response: Currently, the PTO is studying this collection option. The current equipment in use does not allow access via a credit or debit card. This option may be feasible in the near future.
