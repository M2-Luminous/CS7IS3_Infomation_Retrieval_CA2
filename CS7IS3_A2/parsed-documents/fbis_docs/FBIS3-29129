Watanabe, head of one of the major factions in the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party, said, "we cannot make such an easy-going remark that (U.S.-Japan) relations are mature ones between adults." "The other side will surely take retaliatory action" against Japan, he said. Watanabe, speaking at a lecture in a Tokyo hotel, said he is opposed to the setting of numerical targets as demanded by the U.S. to gauge the openness of Japanese markets. He said Washington has been preoccupied with the idea that Japan will not give in to U.S. demands unless threatened. Watanabe was deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister under Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa between 1991 and 1993. On Friday, trade ties between Japan and the U.S. suffered a sharp setback after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton failed to strike a deal on a new "framework" to slash Japan's trade surplus and increase the share of imports in its markets. Japan has rejected a U.S. demand to set up numerical targets to measure the openness of Japanese markets of three sectors -- autos and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of telecommunication and medical equipment.
