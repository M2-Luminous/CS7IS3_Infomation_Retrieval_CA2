FR940317-1-00168 FR940317-1-00014 Description: The 1992 amendments to the Older Americans Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;375) now require States to submit their intrastate funding formulas to the Commissioner on Aging for approval, rather than only for review and comment, as was the case prior to the 1992 amendments. The amendments also require the Commission to provide guidance to States in the development of their intrastate funding formulas. AoA has interpreted the amendments to require that this guidance be in addition to the language contained in section 305(a)(2)(C) of the statute which requires State agencies to take into account the geographic distribution, greatest economic and greatest social need of older individuals, with particular attention to low-income minority individuals, in the development of their intrastate funding formulas. If the Commissioner does not approve the intrastate funding formula, a new requirement under section 304(c) requires the Commissioner to withhold the State's allotment of supportive and nutrition funds under Title III of the Act. In order to comply with these new statutory requirements as well as address the intent of Congress, the Commissioner has developed regulatory standards, and provided directions for each State agency on how to evaluate whether its formula meets those standards. The proposed regulations are designed to provide a State agency with flexibility to either maintain its current formula or, if necessary, to allow for the development of a modified or new formula that addresses the requirements set out by Congress in section 305(a)(2)(C) of the Act. These proposed regulations require that careful consideration be given to the geographic distribution of older individuals in the State, and the distribution among the planning and service areas of older individuals with greatest economic need and older individuals with greatest social need, with particular attention to low-income minority individuals. Because section 304(c) now requires the Commissioner to withhold funds if the Commissioner does not approve a State's intrastate funding formula, States cannot reasonably be expected to develop intrastate funding formulas that can be approved, unless they receive regulatory guidelines. Further, in the course of developing their intrastate funding formulas, States are required, under sections 305(a)(2)(C) and 305(d), to publish their intrastate funding formulas for review and comment by the public. This publication for review and comment must include: ``(1) A descriptive statement of the formula's assumptions and goals, and the application of the definitions of greatest economic or social need; (2) a numerical statement of the actual funding formula to be used; (3) a listing of the population, economic, and social data to be used for each planning and service area in the State; and (4) a demonstration of the allocation of funds, pursuant to the funding formula, to each planning and service area in the State.'' In addition, section 307(a)(33) now requires the State plan to include the statement and the demonstration required by paragraphs (2) and (4) of section 305(d) of the Act. The Commissioner may not approve the State plan unless the Commissioner approves the statement and demonstration. These proposed regulations provide States with guidelines on how to make an acceptable numerical statement and an acceptable demonstration of the allocation of funds. Description of Respondents: State or local governments and non-profit institutions.
