The 1,800-megawatt facility, which will sell 70 per cent of its power to Hong Kong, is just 20 kilometres from the Sai Kung peninsula and 50 km from Central. But senior police officers admitted last week that problems still had to be ironed out and agreements reached with mainland officials. They would keep their "fingers crossed" until plans were finalised, they said. Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey, whose department is co-ordinating the contingency plans, is expected at the opening of China's second and largest nuclear plant. However, a Security Branch spokesman said negotiators were still trying to secure a pledge from China to notify the territory of any on-site accidents. The two sides would talk again in Guangdong later this month. Meanwhile, Marine North Division commander Herbert Au Hok-lam, a key adviser on the police contingency plan, said evacuation and safety proposals for Hong Kong were "never meant to be an all-embracing plan". "Let's face it, it's still in the planning stage. Not every problem has been ironed out. We're still trying to work out what the problems are. We're not professing that the plan is perfect, (but) attacking it for lack of coverage or adequacy, or inadequacy, is not constructive," he said. The Royal Hong Kong Police's Chief Staff Officer (Administration), Peter Cummings, said there was a basic plan of action in case of emergency, but it contained "a lot of alternative possibilities" and some details had yet to be determined. "By and large we do have everything planned -- we just have to keep our fingers crossed that nothing happens," Mr Cummings said. Police planners, led by Marine North Division, were concentrating on Mirs Bay and Ping Chau island, 12 km from Daya Bay, he explained. The small island in Hong Kong's remote northeast attracts thousands of teenage campers and picnickers at summer weekends. "If there was a disaster at Daya Bay, it would be the Mirs Bay and Ping Chau areas that would be affected," Mr Cummings said. "If it's a weekday, there's hardly anybody on Ping Chau. If it's a weekend, then we've got bigger problems because there could be a couple of thousand people there. "There is a provisional plan. We've got enough in hand now to do something if we had to, but there are always going to be differences of opinion: do you evacuate people, do you shelter people, do you need (iodine) pills or not need pills? Nothing's ever going to be 100 per cent satisfactory." Mr Au said he had travelled to Ping Chau after the SUNDAY MORNING POST revealed the island's marine police had been issued iodine pills. Ping Chau police said they had received bottles of potassium iodine pills to distribute in case of a Daya Bay accident. Unsure of what to do with the pills, the policemen had padlocked them in the station's gun cupboard under instructions from the Police Public Relations Bureau to shield them from view. "They were never meant to be kept in a secretive manner," Mr Au said. "They have to be administered as soon as possible ... they are meant to be kept in first aid boxes. I double checked that the iodine tablets were in the first aid box, not in the arms cupboard." The tablets fight the absorption of radioactive iodine after a nuclear accident and have been distributed to police at Tap Mun, Kat O, Ping Chau and Marine North Division. Ping Chau police, faced with the prospect of rounding up thousands of teenage picnickers with loud hailers, said they had expected a test run. But Mr Au said Ping Chau visitors would not be forewarned by government notices or police, and no test run had been planned. "You have to look at it from a pragmatic point of view -- you're looking at something that may not happen," Mr Au said. "I'm not in the process of arranging any test runs of administering the pills. (In an emergency) we would have to round up (picnickers) and warn them that something's happened. "We would face the problem of evacuating them, arranging for transport, ensure they are kept in an orderly manner and ensure they can be taken to a place where they can be examined and, if they have been subjected to radiation, treated accordingly." Daya Bay campaigner, the Reverend Fung Chi-wood yesterday called for the reactor to be shut down, saying the contingency plans failed to provide adequate protection. The United Democrats member and spokesman for the Joint Conference for the Sheltering of the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant said the group was now urgently pressing for the closure. "The nuclear plant poses so much of a threat to Hong Kong that it should cease operating," he said. The Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company has invited hundreds of government, business and media figures to watch Mr Li open the $31 million Daya Bay plant this morning.
