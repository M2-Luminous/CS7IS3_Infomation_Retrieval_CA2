Summary of Response Mission The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible to direct, coordinate, and provide logistical support of other Federal agencies. GSA, in accordance with the National Plan for Telecommunications Support During Non-Wartime Emergencies, manages the provision and operations of telecommunications and automated data processing services. A GSA employee, the Federal Emergency Communications Coordinator (FECC), in accordance with appropriate regulations and plans, is appointed to perform communications management functions. 2. Capabilities and Resources GSA provides acquisition and procurement of floor space, telecommunications and automated data processing services, transportation, supplies, equipment, material; it also provides specified logistical services which exceed the capabilities of other Federal agencies. GSA also provides contracted advisory and support services to Federal agencies and provides security services on Federal property leased by or under the control of GSA. GSA will identify a Regional Emergency Communications Planner (RECP) and FECC, when required, for each of the 10 standard Federal regions. GSA will authorize the RECP to provide technical support and to accept guidance from the FEMA Regional Director during the pre-deployment phase of a telecommunications emergency. The GSA Regional Emergency Coordinator will coordinate all the services provided. Upon request of the Senior FEMA Official (SFO) through the Regional Emergency Coordinator, GSA will dispatch the FECC to the disaster site to expedite the provision of the telecommunications services. 3. Funding GSA is not funded by Congressional appropriations. All requests for support are funded by the requestor in accordance with normal procedures or existing agreements. 4.
