Columnist Criticizes West's Stance on Bosnia A MUSLIM MUST NOT ACCUSE OTHERS OF APOSTASY An approximately 2,000 word unattributed report on pages 1, 8, and 9 of 'AQIDATI notes that the al-Azhar Fatwa Committee ulema have declared that Islam prohibits a Muslim from accusing another Muslim of apostasy without genuine and concrete knowledge. Even if an individual Muslim finds out that another Muslim is a renegade, he "must not mete out punishment," because this is a task that must be verified and carried out by officials in charge of society. Only competent officials have the means to ascertain that a certain individual is a renegade and mete out a sanction, the article states. A Muslim who violates this rule is culpable and is working against true Islamic teaching. ULEMA COMMITTEE MEETS TO RESPOND TO EXTREMIST THOUGHTS A 120-word unattributed report on page 2 says that the ulema committee that has been formed to respond to the thoughts and claims of extremists held its first meeting on 15 June, where it reviewed the books from which the extremists derive their thoughts. Several named professors and ulema attended the meeting, which was chaired by Awqaf Ministry Under Secretary Dr. 'Abd-al-Rashid Salim. Salim said that at the end of the meetings the ministry will compile the ideas crystallized by the ulema and publish them in booklets for distribution to the public, the report concludes. AWQAF MINISTER BERATES OFFICIALS FOR IGNORING INSTRUCTIONS A 100-unattributed report on page 2 notes that Aqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub has addressed severe criticism to the Awqaf departmental chiefs throughout Egypt. He stressed that they do not follow up the progress of the work in their departments, particularly regarding preaching, nor do they comply with the themes of the Friday sermons approved by the ministry. According to the report, Mahjub described his instructions to the chiefs as mere ink on paper. The report says that these chiefs are expected to be replaced. UELMA TO GO TO RUSSIAN REPUBLIC TO TEACH ISLAM A 70-word report on page 2 states that the Awqaf Ministry has decided to send a number of ulema to the Checheno-Ingush Republic to promote Islam. Awqaf Ministry Diector General 'Ulaywa said that the goal is to increase the amount of religious information for Muslims, teach them Arabic, and project the genuine picture of Islam. INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC CONFERENCE IN ALEXANDRIA IN AUGUST A 100-word report by Majdi Za'tar on page 3 of 'AQIDATI says that the largest international Islamic gathering organized by the Egyptian Awqaf Ministry will meet in Alexandria in mid-August under al-Azhar Mosque Rector Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq. Awqaf Minister Dr. Mahjub said that more than 50 Islamic affairs ministers and representatives of 100 Arab and European countries will attend the conference. Za'tar concludes that the conference will discuss the Islamic call and cooperation with other religions. ISLAMIC WRITER URGES MUSLIMS TO SEEK WEST'S KNOWLEDGE In an 800-word article on page 7, Islamic writer Dr. Muhammad 'Amarah exhorts Muslims to seek knowledge and learning so that our nation can rise and revive the Islamic civilization. He argues that it is wrong to blindly imitate and be subservient to the West, but we should seek the West's useful and positive knowledge while not forgetting our roots and spiritual values. Thus we will not be blind "imitators or subservient to the West" and, at the same time, we will not "isolate or close ourselves" to the scientific progress of the West, 'Amarah concludes. INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC CONFERENCE IN CAIRO IN JULY A 2,000 word report by Muhammad al-Abnudi and Musa Hal on page 10 of 'AQIDATI's 21 June issue notes that an international conference for the Islamic call will be held in Cairo in mid-July. The report says that this is the first conference to be devoted to the Islamic call and ways of promoting it. Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub said that the conference will discuss ten issues. The reporters then interview several ulema from the al-Azhar and the Awqaf Ministry, who spell out their views on the issues that the conference should debate. COLUMNIST CRITICIZES WEST'S STANCE ON BOSNIA In a 200-word article entitled "Peace in Bosnia" on page 20, columnist 'Adil Dayf maintains that the way the European countries and the United States continue to deal with the Bosnian crisis shows that they are trying "to impose a de facto solution" on the Bosnian people. This is "a gross injustice" to the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he says, particularly after they have lost so many of their sons along with large tracts of their territory as a result of aggression by the Serbs and Croats. Peace in Bosnia, Dayf concludes, requires the deterrence of the aggressors, return of the territory they usurped, and the lifting the ban on arms for the Muslims.
