In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Grachev said that European security is not only NATO's prerogative. Security should be ensured by joint effort of all political and military structures, he added. Speaking about bilateral cooperation, Grachev noted that an agreement has been reached to send to Britain about 60 junior Russian officers for military training. Additionally, working groups will be set up this year to study prospects for holding joint Russian-British military manoeuvres next year. Rifkind expressed satisfaction with the fact that Russia has confirmed its intention to join the Partnership for Peace programme. In his address to the NATO leaders earlier today Grachev said that Russia is ready to develop broad and constructive cooperation with NATO and called for devising an "active mechanism" of bilateral consultations on all problems concerning European and global security. Grachev said that "Russia is ready to develop genuine and all embracing strategic cooperation with NATO. NATO's partnership for peace programme should play a role in this process." However, he stressed that the programme "is not a comprehensive answer to the realities of the new epoch" and is only the first step towards building a new strategic alliance in the name of peace and security. Russia is interested in broader relations with NATO to correspond its (Russia's) weight and position in the system of international relations, Grachev said. He emphasised that Russia does not claim any privileges, but is seeking to develop and expand the very concept of partnership between the East and West. He said Russia is also ready to develop cooperation with NATO in coordination of military policies, peace-keeping operations, military planning and training, as well as disarmament, arms control, conversion, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nature protection.
