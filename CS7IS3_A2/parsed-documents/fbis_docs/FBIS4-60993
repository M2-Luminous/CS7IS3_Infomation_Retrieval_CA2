According to unofficial information, the sides discussed the approach to a settlement of the Karabakh conflict in connection with the meeting planned for 3 May in Bishkek of heads of parliaments of Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the participation of representatives of Nagornyy Karabakh. The initiator of the meeting was the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, which has noticeably stepped up its peacemaking activity in the zone of the Karabakh conflict. Vladimir Shumeyko, who arrived in Bishkek today, stated that the talks provide an opportunity to reach agreement on the question of a settlement of the Karabakh conflict. He considers the main justification for this to be the fact that Azerbaijan recognized Nagornyy Karabakh recently as one of the participants of this conflict. Shumeyko called this a very big leap forward in the process of the talks on Karabakh.
