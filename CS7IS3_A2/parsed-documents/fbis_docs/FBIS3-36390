The officer told INTERFAX the stocks of residual fuel oil in the republic's capital Petrozavodsk and in Medvezhyegorsk would only last three days, those in Belomorsk and Segezh for two days. Coal supplies in Petrozavodsk would run out in a week, those in Medvezhyegorsk in four days, he said. Karelia is unable to pay the firms providing it with fuel and has asked the federal government for help, the officer said. A commission has been set up in the republic to redistribute the remaining fuel to keep the central heating systems and larger factories going. According to some sources, the Karelian government was due to meet on Saturday to discuss emergency measures. The temperature in the republic, which lies in northwestern Russia, has these days been staying at between minus 18 and 20 degrees Centigrade.
