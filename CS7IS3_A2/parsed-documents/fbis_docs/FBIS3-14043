In an interview with the Voice of Germany, she paid glowing tribute to the Kashmiri brethren for their just and valiant struggle, and pointed out that India has sent 600,000 troops to occupied Kashmir to suppress the struggle of the Kashmiris. The prime minister expressed the hope that India will not be able to suppress the heroic struggle of the Kashmiris despite all its military might. Benazir Bhutto explained in detail her government's efforts to project the Kashmir issue at the international level, making particular reference to the gross violation of human rights in occupied Kashmir. She said the Kashmir issue has assumed international status as a result of Pakistan's efforts. The prime minister disclosed that before the deferment of voting on Pakistan's resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, India asked Iran to convey to Pakistan that it was ready to receive a delegation from the Islamic countries. Citing the actual reason for the postponement of voting on the resolution in Geneva, Bhutto said the voting was deferred because Pakistan was getting what it had planned to achieve with the resolution. She refuted Indian claims that the resolution has been withdrawn, emphasizing that the resolution is still effective; voting has been deferred on the condition that India allow delegations from Muslim countries to visit occupied Kashmir. If necessary, Pakistan will approach the commission and raise this issue again. This is the politics of conscience and principles, the prime minister added.
