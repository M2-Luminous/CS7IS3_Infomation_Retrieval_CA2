"Meciar, as a non-corrupted and a pro-Slovak orientated politician, has strong voter support in Slovakia, in spite of all the attacks on him. But it is not only because of Meciar's charisma that even people whom the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has not addressed until recently and who preferred business to politics, are currently turning towards Meciar's banner," the paper says. The government coalition's attacks on the HZDS have a deeper meaning than it may outwardly seem. "It is not only more than 200 billion crowns of property to be privatized which is in question, although it is just this which caused the majority of regional party leaders to miraculously change their positions, but rather the internal development of the country and the question of which international circles will include Slovakia in their sphere of influence, REPUBLIKA writes. "The internal political situation in Slovakia is characterized by controversies. Instead of building serious international prestige and advantageous economic ties which would lead Slovakia to prosperity, it is acquiring the stigma of an unstable country. Foreign investors and partners have no guarantee that they are not investing in a country where the political situation and economic projects change with the weather," the daily writes. The new government coalition had pledged to pursue civilized policies without confrontational tones while accusing the HZDS of doing that. "But the developments we have been witnessing recently show how distant are the bosses of political parties and movements from political culture, they lack the political maturity which [is] reflected in a gentleman-like approach towards adversaries. Attacks on the ex-premier did not calm down even after the victorious assault of his post by temporary allies. On the contrary, they are growing stronger, the daily writes. Meciar took time out immediately after the shocking fall of his cabinet, the independent NARODNA OBRODA writes. Two years after a decisive election victory the HZDS has weakened to such an extent that a direct hit from the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and the opposition put it out of parliament for six months. However, the HZDS, the strongest political force in Slovakia according to poll ratings, has recovered quickly from the knock-out. The ex-premier's tactics of silence and avoiding journalists has become its program and the HZDS has sent to the advance front positions its "reserve snipers" such as Olga Keltosova, Sergej Kozlik, Tibor Cabaj, and Katarina Tothova. "This phenomenon might have at least two explanations. Either a fight for confidence and the nomination to the candidate slates is being waged within the movement or it is hiding its biggest trumps -- election leaders Meciar and Ivan Gasparovic -- to use them for the last pre-election moves," NARODNA OBRODA writes. The daily stresses, however, that the shift of sympathies during the current election campaign in Hungary does not play into the HZDS's cards since if Hungarian Socialists of Gyula Horn in coalition with the Free Democrats win the elections then Meciar's Hungarian card will be set at naught. "And finally, a protective mist over Meciar is aimed to convince voters that he has never been and is not a source of political confrontation. And with the loss of memory it would be easy to believe that it was the Castle (Slovak president's residence) and all those who betrayed the HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS) who caused the confrontation. The sharpest attacks will not therefore be directed towards the strongest political enemies -- the Christian Democrats and the SDL -- but against Meciar's former co- workers such as Roman Kovac, Jozef Moravcik, Rudolf Filkus, Ludovit Cernak, and President Michal Kovac, the daily writes.
