The 60,000-strong crowd also removed the lettering of the words, Long Live Kamuzu, from the walls of the stadium. In a conciliatory gesture, Mr. Muluzi has told the former president that he may stay on in the glamorous Sanjika Palace for as long as he likes. With the results of five constituencies still outstanding, Mr. Muluzi's United Democratic Front has won 84 of the 177 seats, compared to the 52 of Mr. Banda's Congress Party.
