In the third year of Azerbaijan's "independent" existence, there is no new constitution, no law on citizenship (all the rest of the laws written for Azerbaijan's citizens are, as a result, turning into a code) and no passport. It has no legitimate parliament (the National Assembly is functioning instead, with a five-fold smaller staff) and only in the sixth year of the war did it begin to build a regular army. Is it any wonder, after this, that the activity of censorship -- that age-old scourge of the "fourth power" -- is not regulated by legislation? No, though of course, some National Assembly acts about censorship do exist. For example, in the autumn of 1992, the "Law on Mass Information Media" was passed, and one of its points is direct prohibition of censorship of the press (the explanation of relations with the state through the court is proposed). For some time after this, the role of censor was played by Iskender Gamidov, the indefatigable minister of Internal Affairs, who would pace up and down the editorial offices and, with his own hands, beat up the editors of newspapers that had wronged the People's Front (ZERKALO, AYDYNLYG, ISTIGLAL). By 2 April 1993, however, the government, without beating about the bush, had introduced a state of emergency and reinstated political and military censorship. In this period the publication of the newspapers ISTIGLAL, SABAKH and GYZYLBASH was shut down, and the type pages of the opposition newspapers were "adorned" with the blank spaces left from the material that had been cut. On the whole, the shift in power in June 1993 had no effect on the situation: censorship was retained all the same (the new powers thoughtfully extended the state of emergency introduced by their predecessors), it was just that the group of "lads for flogging," in which the former pro-government newspapers found themselves, was changed. The case is recalled, for example, when, last summer, a piece was removed from the reprinted newspaper AZADLYG, and from some reference book for the biography of Geydar Aliyev, at that time speaker of parliament (now the president). The piece pertained to his former chairmanship in the KGB and membership in the CPSU Central Committee Politburo. A whole chunk of his life was removed (which, incidentally, did not overly burden Aliyev himself). Then not long ago, in January, a few paragraphs from S. Talbott's September report before the United States Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, with an account of that country's official position on the change of power in Azerbaijan, were removed from the newspaper ISTIGLAL. It took this newspaper two months of battling with the censorship and an appeal of the "Helsinki Watch" to G. Aliyev, for the "Amnesty International" report on the state of human rights in Azerbaijan in 1992 (!) to be passed through. The thing is, censorship is constructed according to the old Soviet model of "inside-out glasnost": let the whole world know, but just don't corrupt the domestic reader. Censorship can be understood in some places: after all, there is so far no law on censorship which would regulate its relations with the press and the government, and no list of the state and military secrets which formerly existed in almost every state office. One has to work in the old way, primarily aimed at not offending the "first person" of the state in any way. The situation did not change with the September canceling of the state of emergency, along with political (but not military) censorship, nor with the December passage by the National Assembly, in response to the grumbling of the press, of a special decree forbidding politicians to engage in censorship. The only innovation is a particularly feeble one forbidding the newspapers now to leave the blank spots left from the materials removed, and making them fill them in with something loyal or bring the lines together. "Or else, you see, those abroad will think that our country has censorship and no democracy," the censor requiring this ingenuously explained to one of my friends. The present regime is in general beneficially distinguished from the preceding "democrats" by its greater sensitivity to world public opinion. This is, in my opinion, the only effective means of pressure on the regime in the direction of liberalizing the attitude toward the independent press. The government's counteracting of this liberalization is mainly along the line of strong "educating" of the press, in order for the president to subordinate to himself personally both the censorship and the only newspaper publishing house, "Azerbaijan." On the one hand, the censor explains "that such-and-such is good and such-and-such is bad," and on the other hand -- the publishing house sets up an obstacle to unpleasing newspapers. It takes no special art to do this, incidentally, when one considers the difficulties experienced by the independent press, as compared with the government press, when it is based on self-provision with metal plates, paper and the rest of the things necessary for printing, 95 percent located in another sovereign state (Russia), with which bank and transport relations are complicated. All the newspapers of Azerbaijan are now in debt, except perhaps the government-subsidized "officiosa." But while in Russia private enterprises and banks can subsidize a certain political group without being afraid that the road to normal activity will be cut off to them, in Azerbaijan this is fraught with major troubles. So it is not by chance that Etibar Mamedov, chairman of the National Independence Party, stormed into parliament on learning that they wanted to check the account of his party newspaper, MILLYAT, to find out the channels by which money was arriving. If one considers the fact that AZADLYG, the newspaper of the People's Front, at the time when the PFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan] was in power, managed not only to make ends meet, but to lease an entire building, buy computers and even subsidize the holding of two PFA congresses, then the information that, through the raykoms of the "Yeni (New) Azerbaijan Party," headed by the president, certain major enterprises alluded to the need for donations to the party organ of the same name does not seem all that groundless. Having been contributing to the independent press for four years now and having survived several introductions and cancellations of censorship and five changes of power, I can with full responsibility summarize that after a certain temporary ebb, each of these changes has led to even greater "screw-tightening" with respect to the press which is independent of the government (and the ruling party). Concentrating censorship and the press media in the same hands and persistently expressing, in the pro-government press, the idea that "a state at war does not need hundreds of newspapers" -- all that cannot help but put one on guard. The striving for monopoly over the printed word is not the casual whim of a certain specific ruler, but the expression of the general striving of a pleiad of "fathers of the nation," replacing each other in Azerbaijan, toward political monopoly (it is not by chance that they call the press the "fourth power"). The press is an irritant, damaging the false democratic image of the government, and at the same time it is very vulnerable, particularly in a post-totalitarian state such as Azerbaijan. The treatment of the mass information media may therefore be regarded as a barometer of the moods of any specific government. These are the abc's, and therefore, when the West, which has tantalized us with the delights of its democracy for dozens of years, is now shamefully ignoring the obvious anti-democratic trends in the attitude of a certain specific government of Azerbaijan toward the press, ascribing this sometimes to the war and sometimes to the infancy of our democracy, I am inclined to regard it as assumed naivete. Well, the government of the People's Front cannot be national and democratic if its minister beats up journalists, and the president, in response to the complaints, promises to add to this with the help of the court! The smell of the Caspian oil, which both regimes promised the West, has clearly dispelled its feeling for the recurrences of totalitarianism. But really, from whom can we ask and expect help, if not from the West? Several Western petroleum companies have representatives in the republic, but not a single department of democratic funds or institutions, which in itself shows the direction of the West's interests. In this connection, the story comes to mind of one of the American presidents who reconciled himself to the arbitrary rule of a Latin American dictator, because he was "his own son of a bitch." The United States had no fewer problems with this country (Nicaragua) because of this approach, and in the end a revolution broke out, and this error in reckoning will echo for a long time. So is it not simpler (and cheaper, in the long run) to develop democracy in Azerbaijan instead of implanting "our own" dictators?
