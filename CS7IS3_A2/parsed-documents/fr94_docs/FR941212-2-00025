ACTION: Order of Area, Road and Trail Travel Restriction. SUMMARY: This order, issued under the authority of 43 CFR 8342.1 and 43 CFR 8364.1 limits non-motorized mechanized and motorized travel on identified public lands in the vicinity of Rabbit Valley. This order authorizes single-track travel routes for mechanized vehicles (including motorcycles, snowmobiles and bicycles) less than 40 inches in width and authorizes two-track travel routes for mechanized vehicles (including all-terrain vehicles and four-wheel drives) over 40 inches in width. Authorized routes will be identified on recreation area maps and designated by on-the-ground white arrow signing. The identified public land is in Colorado, Mesa County, under the management jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, Grand Junction Resource Area, Grand Junction District.

EFFECTIVE DATE: The restriction shall be effective December 15, 1994 or until rescinded or modified by the Authorized Officer. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Rabbit Valley is experiencing heavy and generally undirected recreational use. Dominant recreational pursuits include; horse riding, mountain biking, hiking, off-highway vehicle (OHV) riding, camping, dinosaur fossil viewing and viewing rock art. Current travel designations for the area, established in the Grand Junction Resource Area, Resource Management Plan, 1987, allowed ``motorized use is permitted only on existing roads and trails'' or ``closed'' areas to motorized use . These travel designations still facilitated the expansion of unauthorized routes. The unauthorized routes resulted in multiple trailings, unaesthetic landscape conditions, and unacceptable impacts to cultural, soil, vegetation and wildlife resources. The Grand Junction Resource Area, Resource Management Plan, 1987, identified the need for to prepare supplemental recreation management plans for the Grand Valley which includes Rabbit Valley. The Rabbit Valley Recreation Area Management Plan (RAMP) and Environmental Assessment (CO&hyph;076&hyph;1&hyph;16) was prepared, with public participation and comment. This order implements the Decision Record signed on May 7, 1991 by the Grand Junction Resource Area Manager. Travel routes that did not negatively affect resources were authorized as either single-track routes open to mechanized travel under 40 inches in with or as two-track routes open to mechanized vehicles 40 inches and over in width. The area affected by this order will be posted with appropriate regulatory signs. Travel maps of the area are available at the Grand Junction Resource Area Office and Grand Junction District Office.
