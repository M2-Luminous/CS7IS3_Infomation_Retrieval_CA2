Thirty-one cases each were allocated randomly into the IFN group and control group. Another 24 cases each for IFN and control groups were studied by double-blind method. All the patients were treated within 5 days of the illness. The results showed that subsidence of symptoms and signs resulted from viremia, restoration of renal function and platelet count were much faster, and complications much less in the IFN treated group. In both the randomized and double-blind studies, the number of cases that skip both the hypotension and oliguria phases were significantly more in the IFN group than that in the control (87.1 percent and 62.5 percent vs. 51.9 percent and 29.2 percent, p < 0.05). The results suggest that Hu IFN-_a_ therapy administered before the 5th day of EHF may shorten the duration of illness, alleviate the damage of organs, and improve the cure rate.
