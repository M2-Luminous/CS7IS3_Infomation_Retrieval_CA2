The program of the trip included visits to Izmail and Belgorod-Dnestrovskyy, a meeting with Odessa residents in the Politechnical University house of culture, and a live program on local television. Kravchuk was accompanied by his adviser Valentyn Symonenko, Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, Odessa State Administration Head Vladlen Ilyin, Oblast Council Chairman Ruslan Bodelan, and Odessa Mayor Leonid Cherneha. Speaking before Odessa residents, Kravchuk negatively assessed the reluctance of the oblast council to grant a patch of land for the building of the oil terminal. Kravchuk emphasized: "I think that the oblast council still has time to think and make a decision that would suit Ukraine's interests." Answering a question about his relations with Yeltsin, President Kravchuk pointed out: "Our personal relations are normal. We even know when we have to telephone each other. With regard to Yeltsin's perception of Ukraine, he signed the tripartite agreement on behalf of Russia and granted Ukraine recognition of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Of course, the president of Russia, just like his Ukrainian counterpart, has to protect the interests of his state." President Kravchuk shared his opinion about the newly appointed Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol. He, in particular, pointed out: "I have never been Masol's opponent. In 1990, he resigned after he had been summoned to the Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee and proposed to make this step. At that time he unsuccessfully tried to find support outside Ukraine." This is how Kravchuk explained his decision to propose Masol's candidacy: "My decision was prompted by the specific procedure for the Supreme Council's approval. I had to propose someone who would not cause a split and opposition. There were other candidates, too, but I understood that they did not have a chance and preferred not to hurt their feelings. Now, the main thing is not to stand in Masol's way." Answering a question about the relations between eastern and western Ukraine, Kravchuk stated: "I know both parts well and I am sure that no problems exist at the level of ordinary people. However, there are gentlemen who shout on behalf of the people. Both in the east and the west people want to live free lives." Kravchuk informed the audience that in accordance with a presidential edict, the National Bank of Ukraine had transferred 1.7 trillion karbovantsi to assist the agricultural sector. He added that a fixed exchange rate of the U.S. dollar would soon be introduced in Ukraine -- 20,000 karbovantsi. According to Kravchuk, should this step fail to significantly influence prices, a fluctuating rate will be introduced.
