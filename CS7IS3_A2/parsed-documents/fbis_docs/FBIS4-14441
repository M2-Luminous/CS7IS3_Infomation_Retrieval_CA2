Padenko from Vladivostok; from the "Pacific Ocean" program] [Text] Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of the Maritime Kray administration who has just returned from Moscow, held a news conference in Vladivostok. He began by rebutting criticism by the VLADIVOSTOK newspaper, which in an article, accused him of lobbying for Japanese technology to process nuclear submarine waste. The newspaper claimed that, unlike the costly equipment from Japan, our Far East scientists offer a version which is both cheaper and much more effective. However, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko emphasized that our equipment was still at the laboratory stage, while the Japanese technology has already been tried in industrial applications at every Japanese nuclear station and could quickly save Maritime Kray residents from a catastrophic accumulation of nuclear waste. What is more, the equipment will be installed free of charge. After this, the governor made the following statement: [Begin Nazdratenko recording] On the basis of edict No. 54-1 of the Russian Federation State Duma, issued on 11 February 1994, on the legal basis for the election of organs of state power of federal members of the Russian Federation and of organs of local self rule, and on guaranteeing the voting rights of citizens; and in accordance with article No. 5 of decree No. 2265 from the President of the Russian Federation, issued on 22 December 1993, on guarantees of local self rule in the Russian Federation; and taking into consideration the numerous appeals by city and rayon administrations, political parties, public movements, and voters, and the need to search for a means of social protection for the needy in society; and in coordination with the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation, I hereby decree: 1. To transfer the date of elections for the Maritime Kray Duma and organs of local self rule from 27 March 1994 to 23 October 1994. 2. To recommend to the Election Commission of the Maritime Kray that it prepare, before 30 April 1994, a proposal to ensure the implementation of the above-mentioned decree. 3. That Tereshkov, head of the finance department, and Stepanovich, head of the accounts department, are to direct funding allocated by the kray administration for conducting the election campaign to city and rayon administrations to solve issues of social protection for needy citizens. [end recording] [Padenko] Then Yevgeniy Nazdratenko answered questions by journalists on such topics as the scandalous action taken against Viktor Cherepkov, the mayor of Vladivostok. He denied reports by several news agencies that claimed the municipality building was surrounded by OMON [special purpose militia unit] troops, bonfires and many protesters bearing placards. We journalists verified this denial personally when we visited the municipality building immediately after the news conference. There were no bonfires or demonstrations. The building is protected by reinforced police units, and the tenth floor, where the offices of the city administration leadership are located, are a shambles. Repairs to the offices are being carried out, they are also being cleaned and furniture is being replaced because, it seems, the previous leadership did not even keep their own workplace clean. The new leaders saw the similarity between this scene and the neglect in the city. The new authorities, therefore, issued decree No.1 declaring a sanitary and epidemiological emergency in Vladivostok. It was signed by Konstantin Tolstoshein, acting head of city administration. Here is his what he said: [Begin Tolstoshein recording] We must clean the city before 9 May, in time for the national holiday, the holiday of veterans, the holiday of victory. Church holidays fall on approximately the same dates. We simply must tidy the city and make it look as it should. The second issue is the work of the city transport authorities. The way the city transport system works today... [Padenko, interrupting] ...Free of charge. [Tolstoshein] Free of charge or not is a secondary issue. First, it must start working in an orderly fashion. Trains, trams, and trolley buses must function properly. There is a problem: The dacha season is about to begin, and electric trains should be running. After all, not everyone in Vladivostok has a car, so we have to deal with this issue, too. Third, there are very few stores in the city that cater to veterans of World War II, or Afghanistan, Chernobyl victims, or diabetics; most of them are closed. In other words, we are also working on this problem. I have met and resolved this issue with the state reserve, so we will open several additional stores over the next few days, and we will supply food products and necessities there at much lower prices. Fourth, strange as it may seem, the winter is over, and we are taking care of the city, cleaning and washing it and so on, but we have already started to prepare for next winter. [end recording] [Padenko] A demonstration supporting the ousted mayor was held yesterday in Vladivostok central square. Even Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was expected, though he did not fly in. A commission from Moscow began its work in the kray administration building. The highest legislative organs are looking into the Cherepkov affair, and Viktor Ivanovich [Cherepkov] himself declared a hunger strike in his home.
