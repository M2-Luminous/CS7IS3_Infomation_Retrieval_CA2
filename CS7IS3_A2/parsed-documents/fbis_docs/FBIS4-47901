The meeting follows the extension of the 48-hour warning strike launched by the workers of the Libreville Petroleum Group. This strike first resulted in a gas shortage and now a fuel shortage which has caused a lot of inconvenience for housewives and many drivers who could not get to work this morning. The petroleum workers, who are threatening to extend their strike to 8 May, are demanding a 15-percent salary increase. [Paris AFP in French at 1158 GMT on 4 May in a similar Libreville-datelined report adds: "A two-day strike by workers of petroleum products distribution companies has today led to the suspension of domestic flights and a fuel and gas shortage in Libreville. All domestic flights will be suspended until 8 May unless a solution is found between now and then, airline sources say. However, national Air Gabon Airlines are maintaining international flights. Gas stations have not received supplies since 2 May and a lot of them, even though pump attendants are not participating in the strike, have had to stop distributing fuel. It is also impossible to find gas cylinders, which are distributed by the petroleum companies."]
