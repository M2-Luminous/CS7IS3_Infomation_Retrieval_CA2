As applicable, RACT-level, BACT-level, and new source review control of PM&hyph;10 precursors from major stationary sources of precursors in the airshed (applicable to both moderate and serious area SIP's under section 189(e)). The demonstration required under section 189(b)(1)(A) should follow the existing modeling guidelines addressing PM&hyph;10 (e.g., ``PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline'' (June 1987); ``Guideline on Air Quality Models'' (Revised); memorandum from Joseph Tikvart and Robert Bauman dated July 5, 1990) and any applicable regulatory requirements. A supplementary attainment demonstration policy applicable to initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas facing special circumstances was issued in a memorandum from EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards to the Directors of EPA Regional Air Divisions on March 4, 1991. 14 That supplementary policy is not applicable to serious area SIP demonstrations. 14 ``PM&hyph;10 SIP Attainment Demonstration Policy for Initial Moderate Nonattainment Areas,'' memorandum from John Calcagni and William Laxton to Director, Air Division, EPA Regions I&hyph;X, March 4, 1991. V. Waivers for Certain PM&hyph;10 Nonattainment Areas A. Historical Perspectives The EPA in the past focused much of its air pollution control efforts on industrial point source emissions and other traditional sources of air pollution. 15 For instance, EPA's 1977 guidance on SIP development gave priority to control of urban fugitive dust after control of traditional sources, but in preference to rural fugitive dust, on the grounds that (1) urban soil was believed to be contaminated and, therefore, potentially more harmful than the native soils in rural areas; (2) the potential for significant population exposures and attendant health effects was much greater in urban areas; and (3) scarce resources at the Federal, State, and local agency levels could be most effectively brought to bear on the more pronounced problems found in urban areas. 16 Accordingly, EPA's policy was to require greater emphasis on control of emissions in urban areas, including control of fugitive dust from all major sources. In contrast, control requirements for rural areas were far less ambitious, focussing on the control of major industrial sources, with little attention given to natural or nonindustrial emissions. This policy of giving a lower priority to controlling natural or nonindustrial emissions in rural areas became known as the ``Rural Fugitive Dust Policy.'' 17 15 The EPA distinguished between ``traditional'' and ``nontraditional'' sources. The term ``nontraditional source'' first appeared in official print in 1976 in EPA's ``National Assessment of the Urban Particulate Problem,'' EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;76&hyph;024, July 1976, and was coined as a catch-all to refer to those sources not traditionally considered in air pollution control strategies, including construction and demolition, tailpipe emissions, tire wear, and various sources of fugitive dust. Since then, the use of the term has expanded to include such sources as prescribed agricultural and silvicultural burning, open burning, and residential wood combustion. 16 ''Guidance on SIP Development and New Source Review in Areas Impacted by Fugitive Dust,'' Edward F. Tuerk, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Waste Management, to Regional Administrators. 17 See, e.g., ``Model Letter Regarding State Designation of Attainment Status,'' David H. Hawkins, Assistant Administrator for Air and Waste Management, to Regional Administrators, October 7, 1977; see also, ``Fugitive Dust Policy: SIP's and New Source Review'' (August 1984). The EPA's policy focus shifted away from the type and location of the emission sources (i.e., traditional or nontraditional sources, urban or rural locations) to the size of the particles emitted when the indicator for the NAAQS was changed in 1987 from total suspended particulate matter to PM&hyph;10. While revisions to the rural fugitive dust policy were being considered, the policy was continued during the initial phases of implementing the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS on an interim basis. 18 However, EPA believes that the 1990 Amendments provide a statutory alternative that wholly supplants the rural fugitive dust policy (see sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(f) of the amended Act; 56 FR 37659 (August 8, 1991)). 18 See 52 FR 24716 (July 1, 1987). B. Waiver Provisions The Act, as amended in November 1990, was designed to assure that attainment and maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 standards, which were promulgated in 1987 (52 FR 24634, July 1, 1987), be as expeditious as practicable. Thus, the Act requires States to submit several revisions of the SIP for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, if necessary, to ensure attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable. Among other planning requirements, the SIP revisions must first provide for the implementation of RACM on PM&hyph;10 sources. If RACM is not adequate to attain the NAAQS, subsequent revisions must provide for implementation of additional, more stringent control measures until the NAAQS are attained. Congress recognized that there may be areas where the NAAQS may never be attained because of PM&hyph;10 emissions from ``nonanthropogenic sources,'' 19 and that the imposition in such areas of certain State planning requirements, as described in the previous section, may not be justified. Therefore, under section 188(f) of the Act, Congress provided a means for EPA to waive a specific date for attainment and certain control and planning requirements when certain conditions are met in the nonattainment area. 19 The legislative history of the 1990 Amendments indicates that Congress intended that the term ``nonanthropogenic'' sources of PM&hyph;10 refer to activities where the human role in the cause of such emissions is highly attenuated [see H.R. Rep. No. 490, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 265 (1990)). Section 188(f) provides two types of waivers. First, the Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive any requirement under subpart 4 applicable to any serious nonattainment area where EPA determines that anthropogenic sources of PM&hyph;10 do not contribute significantly to the violation of the standard in the area. Second, the Administrator may waive a specific date for attainment of the standard where EPA determines that nonanthropogenic sources of PM&hyph;10 contribute significantly to the violation of the standard in the area.
