The source said the IAEA has accepted Pyongyang's proposal and plans to send an advance party to North Korea as early as Thursday to check and remove security seals on the experimental reactor. He said their visas have already been prepared. But the IAEA needs to further sound out North Korea on the mission, the source said, noting Pyongyang has yet to reply to the Agency's inquiries. He said that before sending a full team, the U.N. nuclear watchdog wants to know whether the offer to allow observation of the unloading of spent fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear facility is merely that, or whether North Korea will also allow collection of fuel samples to take place. IAEA spokesman David Kyd told reporters Sunday the Agency is "not sending a team until we have clarification." The Agency wants to inspect the spent fuel core of the Yongbyon reactor to see if any nuclear material has been diverted for possible use in a covert nuclear weapons development program. Sampling can determine if the spent fuel had been in the Yongbyon reactor since it went on line in 1986, or if the fuel had been secretly changed. The reactor was shut down for 100 days in 1989, three years before the IAEA made its first nuclear inspection in North Korea. The IAEA source said North Korea has not responded to a separate agency request that it also be allowed to inspect a radiochemical laboratory placed off limits to inspectors in a visit last month.
