Following three hours of negotiations behind closed doors, journalists' questions were answered by Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijan National Assembly. "It is hard to say whether some document will be signed at the meeting," the head of the Azerbaijani delegation declared. "Discussions are taking place, primarily concerning the withdrawal of the Armenian armed formations from the territory of Azerbaijan, the return of the refugees, and the establishment of a lasting cease-fire." A. Dzhalilov observed that the question of observers would be decided today. To the question: "How does the Azerbaijani delegation view this request," A. Dzhalilov said: "We proceed from the fact that the conflict has grown into a war and that Armenia and Azerbaijan should resolve this by peaceful means. It is today a question of not burying the problem in the `sand,' a war is under way on the territory of Azerbaijan. One million refugees are living under tent-city conditions. Because of this, reason must prevail."
