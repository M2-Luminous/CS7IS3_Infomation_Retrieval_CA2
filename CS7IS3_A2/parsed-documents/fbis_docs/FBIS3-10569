It was held at the National Sports Council stadium. Some 300 grassroots delegates participated in the congress. One of the most important conclusions reached was to stage a general strike on 2 May. A national struggle committee was established, headed by the top leaders of the labor unions. The committee will be in charge of coordinating the strike. The leaders said the current economic policy, as well as the government officials' "lack of social sensitivity" are behind the call for a general strike. The last such strike in our country was staged 36 years ago, in 1958. The leaders who attended the congress also decided to condition to three issues the presence of the labor unions in the tripartite round of negotiations on the macro-social policy, which they have been holding with the government and entrepreneurs. The first condition calls for the immediate release of the leaders of the transportation sector labor unions, who were arrested on 6 March in Quiindy. The second calls for release of the peasant leaders who are being kept at the former Security Guard facilities. The third calls for the automatic dismissal of all members of the Administrative Council of the Social Welfare Institute and the end to repressive measures against any demonstrations by workers or peasants. The workers congress also decided to participate actively, with all its grassroots, in the peasants' march scheduled for 15 March. The march will start with a gathering at the former Metropolitan Seminary and parade along Eusebio Ayala Avenue to Uruguay Square. From there, the demonstrators will try to reach the National Congress building. The transportation sector labor unions and some teachers' organizations will also participate in the march. The teachers will stage a 24-hour stoppage on that same day. It was also decided during the congress to support the general strike to be staged by the urban buses drivers, which has been scheduled for 21 March. The USTT [Transportation Sector Workers Trade Union] and the Fetrat [Transportation Sector Workers Federation] have reported that if Roberto Medina and Samuel Arguello, the leaders who were arrested in Quiindy, are not released by tomorrow the transportation sector strike will be moved forward to 15 March. The national workers' congress decided to ask the government to readjust by 40 percent the current minimum wage. It is expected the government will show signs of willing to meet this demand before 2 May. If this occurs, the official attitude will be considered a sign of "goodwill."
