Everything points to the fact that the massacre of worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque was not a spontaneous act by a group of "extremists" but the beginning of a series of steps that the Zionist Government is pursuing with a special objective in mind. To understand this, it is necessary to find out what this objective is. 2. We should look at the latest U.S.-Israeli actions in the region. What has been described as a peace "process" by the Arabs only contains the word "peace," and it is pursuing specific objectives. The first objective is to extinguish the burning flame of the intifadah, which has been one of the most dangerous political-social phenomena for Israel as well as for the United States and even some of the corrupt regimes in the region, and is considered to be yet another fruit of the Islamic revival process. The second objective is the establishment of full security on all of Israel's borders. Like the Camp David Accord with Egypt, this issue should become the major pivot of all activities and should concentrate on a peace accord with Syria and the disarmament of the Hizballah. The third objective is Israel's entry into the world of Islam, the consolidation of economic relations with the world of Islam, and the establishment of a social and political presence among the Muslims; and naturally the Zionist regime is more enthusiastic about entering the oil-rich Arab countries of the Persian Gulf than any other country. The reason for this is not the existence of petrodollars, but the absence of a native population and of a precise national identity in these countries--something that will accelerate and facilitate the possibility of Israel's entry there. 3. Israel's behavior throughout the talks shows that it is pursuing these three objectives. Before thinking about a conditional and limited autonomy for the Palestinians, Israel is thinking more about extinguishing the flame of the intifadah. But despite its unconditional surrender to Yasir 'Arafat, all its other arrangements have been upset because the intifadah is alive! Israel's overly enthusiastic approach in consolidating its relations with the world of Islam and entering its markets is not a secret, and in this field--as in other fields--U.S. pressures on the Arabs, especially in the Persian Gulf, can be seen. But what is the situation like today? In one word, the U.S.-Israeli plan has been disgracefully defeated because the oppressed people of Palestine demand their rights and are extremely alert and experienced in this demand. And moreover, Islam is emerging again and the intifadah is the Islamic movement of the Palestinian people. Therefore, when the Zionists look at a child holding a stone in his hand in the streets of Hebron, Jerusalem, or Gaza, they multiply this into several million and what they see is a horrific nightmare. At no time has resistance against the Zionists been so strong in the world of Islam, and this is at a time when Israel is not threatened by any Arab army! Therefore, the pivotal policy of the Zionists is clear: the only way to preserve the current Zionist regime is to extinguish the intifadah. But how? 4. In the so-called peace process, Israel tried to fool the Palestinians by offering a conditional and limited autonomy. But this plot was foiled in its initial stages. Israel then chose a second path. It chose to do the same thing that the Christians did in Andalusia and what the Serbs are now doing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I strongly refuse to use the phrase "racial cleansing" because it is an overt insult to human "power of speech" since this phrase has nothing to do with either "cleansing" or "race." It is actually "barbarianism," which perpetrates a crime in the garb of Zionism. The Zionists, who have given up hope of persuading the Palestinians, have decided to resort to force to wind up matters. They are well aware that if this plan is to succeed, it should succeed today because tomorrow will be too late. They also know that they have an immense "opinion-making" machinery and all of the techniques of this machinery at their disposal and are using it in a bid to shape the opinion of the simple-minded people in the world. Also, they know that most of the Arabic and Islamic governments will be harnessed by the United States and that they sincerely want Israel to safeguard them from the great wave of Islamic revival, although they may pretend that they do not. Therefore, the conclusion that I draw is: First of all, the crime perpetrated at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque was not a solitary and simple act. Second, the Zionist Government's plan is to pursue the objectives of the so-called peace process, and this is only the beginning of this plan. Third, there is no doubt that the U.S. Government is fully aware of this new policy and that the necessary coordination with the West's propaganda machinery has been made by the Zionists' tentacles in this network. The policy of hypocrisy and persuasion that existed in the first method--that is the process of talks--was thwarted by the brave Palestinians on their own. But how should the new policy of massacres and eradication be thwarted? The world of Islam should not remain only on the sidelines, as it has done in the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, and merely issue statements. From the very beginning, it should impose the legitimacy of its decision, irrespective of what the UN Security Council does. Yes, the Muslim ummah is facing a big test.
