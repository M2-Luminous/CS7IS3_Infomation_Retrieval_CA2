In his interview to SNARK Mr. Gukasyan said such statements aimed at displaying the Karabakh military forces as barbarous in the face of the world community. But the fact is that the Azeris themselves have bombarded their towns and villages, said the Minister. Only in Agdam there fell more than 300 shells since it has been under the control of the Karabakh army. Mr. Gukasyan consider the Azeris have shelled their own towns seeking to destroy the Karabakh military posts and barracks, which they suppose are placed there. Now, when the prospects of a long-termed armistice are very real, the Azeri propaganda is trying to conceal its own sins and to discredit Karabakh, which only complicates the process of negotiations, said Arkadi Gukasyan.
