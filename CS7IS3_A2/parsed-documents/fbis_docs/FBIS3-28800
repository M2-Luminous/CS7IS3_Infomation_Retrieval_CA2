[Sekizawa] The United States is seeking to set a share for U.S.-made products on the Japanese market at the same level as those secured by American manufacturers in the seven major industrialized nations (G-7), except Japan. So it is a numerical target, and it means managed trade. [Aikawa] You must have had a bitter experience in agreeing to the semiconductor accord. [Sekizawa] All member companies of the Communication Industries Association of Japan [CIAJ] are semiconductor users, and an overwhelming number of them are semiconductor makers too. To attain "the 20-percent share of foreign-made semiconductors," efforts such as starting cooperation right from the semiconductor development stage have been made." The 20-percent share is neither a commitment nor a target. Actually, it is taken as a point at issue. The United States appears to think the semiconductor accord is the only successful case. If a numerical target should be included in the accord on the telecommunications sector, it is certain that the United States will start trying to strenuously impose it on Japan. We have had similar experiences, and that is why we are worried. [Aikawa] The United States maintains that foreign-made products have only a small share on the Japanese market. What is your comment on this? [Sekizawa] The share mentioned by the United States is at the same level as that of other G-7 nations, but the share of the private sector is included in the figure. According to a CIAJ survey, the share of foreign-made products in government procurement is 0.3 percent in the United States, and 1.6 percent in Japan. The figure is small in both countries but the share in Japan is larger than that in the United States. Therefore, the argument maintained by the United States is based on shaky ground. [Aikawa] The United States also calls for including Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation [NTT] in the list of organizations required to procure more foreign-made products. [Sekizawa] Since the years when NTT was a public corporation it has made efforts to keep procurement fair by treating both Japanese and foreign companies without discrimination, and it has procured products from American and European makers. When the United States says "our companies are not included," we are puzzled. Moreover, NTT has been turned into a private company. The question is whether the same system connected with the government can be applied to NTT. The question also arises when this issue is viewed from the standpoint of protecting stockholders' interests. [Aikawa] Why is it that the share of foreign-made products in government procurement is small? [Sekizawa] In conducting government procurement, neither Japan nor the United States will invite all foreign companies to participate in the bidding. Moreover, another problem concerns specifications, which are normally written in English in the United States and in Japanese in Japan. According to standards set at the GATT, however, I think efforts should be made to make procurement procedures transparent. As a result, the amount of office work on procurement will increase. Since costs will be paid by taxes, the people will be asked to bear this new burden. [Aikawa] What do you think of the principle of mutualism? [Sekizawa] NTT holds business talks in the United States to expand its procurement of foreign-made products. Although the United States is not being asked to make the same effort, a major precondition lies in the U.S. Government at least taking similar measures in conducting its government procurement. [Aikawa] Cooperation is being promoted among many companies in the communications industry. What do you think of this? [Sekizawa] This sector is becoming more global and borderless. Cooperation is being promoted among companies of various nations in different ways. The question is whether there is any sense in deciding on the share for each country, as this may have the adverse effect of obstructing the trend toward cooperation.
