After Jamaica, it will be the turn of the Turks and Caicos Islands to accept the Haitian boat people on their territory for questioning by the U.S. Coast Guard. This decision was made by the local government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British colony located 90 miles off Haiti. Rothschild Francois has details: [Begin Francois recording] In the agreement concluded between Washington and the Turks and Caicos Island Government, it was mentioned that the United States will provide facilities for the questioning of Haitian refugees while they are being considered for political asylum in the United States. These installations will include the utilization of a desalinization factory, the extension of the wharf to accommodate the landing of U.S. ships, and the building of a landing runway. The United States will pay all expenses for this operation and will also provide aid to the Turks and Caicos Islands. One to two million dollars will be spent for this program. The first U.S. technicians are expected on the island within the coming days to prepare for the launching of this program, which will be using a staff of 250. According to the Press Society, the agreement between the Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States indicates that before the center for refugees is operational, the United States could begin interviewing the Haitian boat people on board a U.S. ship in the waters of Turk Island, more precisely, near Grand Turk. Since the announcement of this partial change in the U.S. policy regarding Haitian refugees, more than 1,500 refugees have been repatriated to Port-au-Prince. The new U.S. policy has not yet been applied. This policy provides that Haitian refugees will no longer be sent back directly to Port-au-Prince, but will be questioned aboard U.S. ships. The qualified refugees who receive political asylum could be admitted to the U.S. territory, while other boat people would be repatriated to Port-au-Prince by the U.S. Coast Guard.
