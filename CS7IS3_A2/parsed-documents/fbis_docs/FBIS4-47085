Thus, except for a narrow circle of persons concerned with their official duties, few people have thought about the fact that Ajaria is a major artery of Georgia's industry, whose vigorous pulse has a great deal to do with the republic's economic potential. Now that Georgia's economic sectors, including industry, are having a hard time of it, it may be of interest to take a look at the problems of the autonomous republic's enterprises; for this purpose we interviewed Ajarian First Deputy Industry Minister Tamaz Bolkvadze. [Tevzadze] Batono Tamaz, in these times of warped political and economic conditions, when the country faces difficult problems, Ajaria is most often cited as an example of stability, calm, and relatively better economic conditions. In this context, how are things now in the autonomous republic's industrial sphere, despite the fact that many of Georgia's major enterprises are now at a standstill? [Bolkvadze] Despite the difficult political and economic situation, a number of Ajaria's industrial sectors have done a certain amount of work and taken very useful--even bold--steps in order to meet the forecast targets on time. But in order to show that these are not just empty words, I will cite some figures. In 1993 we produced 100.5 billion coupons worth of commercial output (in comparable prices) and manufactured 7.2 billion coupons worth of various kinds of goods. The construction and repair administration completed 81.3 million coupons worth of project work. Also last year, 13.7 billion coupons worth of goods were shipped to consumers. That figure includes 5.5 billion coupons worth of goods shipped outside the republic. A total of 462.3 million coupons worth of various kinds of items were shipped on the basis of inter-governmental agreements. [Tevzadze] You probably have a number of problems as well. What obstacles do you encounter? [Bolkvadze] The basic reasons for declining production volumes are difficulties in supplies of materials, raw materials, and energy. I guess it would be useful to cite some facts. Last year our enterprises only obtained 630 tonnes of rolled metal stock from various sources, versus our requirements of 10,000 tonnes. Again, we obtained 51 tonnes of nonferrous metal instead of 950 tonnes. We also got much less than we needed of particle and fiber board, fabrics, and so on. As a result, our enterprises were not even able to work at half capacity throughout the year. Not only that, but some of them stood altogether idle for a long time. In addition, problems in transportation brought it about that large amounts of finished goods piled up in enterprise warehouses. By January 1994, 166.9 billion coupons worth of finished goods had been charged to production establishments, including major enterprises such as the electromechanical, shipbuilding, machine building, and transformer plants. Despite our difficulties, most of our enterprises managed to earn the profits called for in the forecast, but some of them are in an unsatisfactory financial position. [Tevzadze] What is the Ministry doing to rectify the situation, and what help are you getting from the autonomous republic's leaders? [Bolkvadze] Almost all the credit for the fact that Ajaria is in a comparatively better position than Georgia's other regions today goes to the republic's leadership, in particular Ajarian Supreme Council Chairman Batoni Aslan Abashidze. As for our Ministry, it is working intensively to attract investments. Here again, Abashidze's prestige and efforts have helped us greatly. It was at his initiative and personal invitation that Ajaria was visited by British experts who helped us prepare investment projects. The projects were translated into Russian and English and distributed to client enterprises in accordance with sectors and enterprise potentials. Plans call for rebuilding and re-outfitting those enterprises, completing projects that have been started, forming joint enterprises, and so on. Right now, negotiations are underway between the Batumi Electromechanical Plant and Bulgaria's Balkankar regarding the joint development of electric hoisting machines. A joint Russian-Georgian-Turkish enterprise, Kimikos [Chemist], has been formed. There is also a deal between the Batumi Sewn Goods Association and a British firm, by which the firm brings supplies and raw materials to Batumi and the factory makes the goods; as a result, we have already earned hard currency. This year we plan to produce about 200 billion coupons worth of goods for which we will have to import about a billion Russian rubles worth of raw materials from Russia. For this reason, the Ajarian Autonomous Republic's Industry Ministry has prepared a list, which has been sent to the Republic of Georgia's Ministries of Industry and Material Resources for Trade. [Tevzadze] You have mentioned Russia and the Russian ruble. Is your Ministry concerned with restoring business relations with the CIS countries? [Bolkvadze] Of course. And the republic's leaders are helping us in this as well. I have mentioned the restoration of relations with Russia. In January, in addition, along with the Georgian Industry Ministry an agreement was concluded with Ukraine's Machine Building and Military Industrial Complex and Conversion ministries, Belarus's State Committee for Industry and Intersectorial Enterprises, and Tajikistan's Industry Ministry. The new contacts should help us obtain sufficient supplies and raw materials--in particular, 8,542 tonnes of rolled ferrous metal, 847 tonnes of nonferrous metal, 1,200 tonnes of metal products, 1,000 tonnes of plastics and so on. Enterprises have started working to inaugurate new products in 1994. In particular, the Transformer Plant is working to inaugurate the production of new types of electroconvectors and electric heaters. The Electromechanical Plant is developing test models of a new type of enclosed 5- and 15-passenger electric vehicles. The Batumi Consumer Goods Machine Building Plant is doing preparatory work to inaugurate the production of low-power washing machines, series production of which is planned for the end of this year. The Batumi Shipbuilding Plant has begun to prepare the technical documentation for a new model of launch. A certain amount of work is being done to use available material resources to renovate products. The Shipbuilding Plant has basically completed the development of an oceanarium. The Machine Building Plant is manufacturing uniform buttons, insignia, and chest decorations for the national army and Georgian police officers. The Consumer Goods Machine Building Plant has inaugurated the manufacture of plastic boxes. In the Furniture Production Association we have inaugurated the production of new kinds of dining room and kitchen furnishings. The Woodworking Plant has inaugurated the use of a local raw material--bamboo--to make tables, chairs, booths, and modern-style children's beds. The Leather Goods Plant has reactivated a shop which uses remnant materials to make leather lining goods, also a section which uses remnants to make belts, handbags, and watchbands. In short, we are not sitting idle, and we have high hopes for the future.
