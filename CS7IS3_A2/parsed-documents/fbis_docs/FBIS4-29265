The documents are being translated into Korean by Foreign Ministry officials and staff at the South Korean Embassy in Russia, they said. "The documents include telegraph messages between Kim Il-song and Joseph Stalin. They can substantially prove North Korea made the first provocation against South Korea," said one official, "Once the papers are translated, they will carry much, much value." North Korean still insists that Seoul made the first attack. Russia gave South Korean President Kim Yong-sam the war documents when the latter visited Moscow last week. The bundle contains over 600 pages of over 200 items including communication North Korea had with the former Soviet Union and China from January 1949 to October 1950. For example, the materials show Kim Il-song requested Moscow's support for the war in January 1950 and Stalin agreed the following month. They include an attack plan prepared by Russian military officials in May 1950 and the kind of weapons Soviets supplied to North Korea between September 1949 and April 1950. Officials said the original papers will be kept by the government and sensitive materials will be kept confidential.
