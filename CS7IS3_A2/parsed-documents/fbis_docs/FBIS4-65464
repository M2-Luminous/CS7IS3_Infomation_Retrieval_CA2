It Is Not a Problem"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Caprettini] Confidence or elections. Some people who were members of the fascist team have said this be a matter of alternatives. [Fini] No, it is a matter of clearness, as opposed to those who are dreaming about the existence of other majorities. It is also the clearest reply to [Italian Popular Party, PPI, member] De Mita who hopes to be able to get up to his games again. [Caprettini] Secretary, what do you think of De Mita's idea of opposing the government just to form another one, considering that the PPI does not want to hear about an agreement with Forza Italia and that there are not sufficient numbers for an alternative? [Fini] They want to show that they exist. However, they are continuing to reason with the methods of the First Republic. They put personal interests before those of the nation. They are not at all worried about the possibility of losing precious time to form a new executive body. It is the oldest and most decrepit Christian Democrat who is coming back to peer in. [Caprettini] Secretary, there are some points about the negotiations with the government that are still obscure. Maroni [Northern League] at the Interior Ministry, for example. You opposed him, then...perhaps you convinced him to nominate Gaspari [of the AN] as undersecretary? [Fini] It would be bad for the government if the undersecretaries were given mandates to control the ministers. No, the story is simple. I had expressed political perplexity. However, on the one hand, I am convinced that either I gave them a free rein or the government would not have been formed, and, on the other hand, I obtained clarification from Bossi and Berlusconi. [Caprettini] Another little mystery is the veto on Tremaglia. Who gave it? [Fini] I do not know. He has been personally wronged and we have been the subject of a considerable political wrong. So much so that I obtained the commitment of the majority to entrust Tremaglia with the presidency of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of Deputies. [Caprettini] And will he accept? [Fini] I think so. He is not one of those gentlemen of before -- I am talking about the PPI members -- who put personal interests before those of the country. [Caprettini] The final unresolved mystery is Di Pietro. First of all, is it true that you proposed him? [Fini] No, it is true that I said that I was greatly in favor of his participation of the government. [Caprettini] Who is responsible for his renunciation? [Fini] This is still a little mysterious for me too. From what was understood, Di Pietro was not insensitive to the proposal. Then a veto fell. Who gave it? I do not know, perhaps [Chief Prosecutor] Borrelli. [Caprettini] Are you worried about the accusations that continue to come from abroad about the presence of neofascist ministers in the Italian Government? [Fini] Not at all. They will be forgotten in a month. There are the European elections. You will see that after 12 June this story of bogies that is being stirred up by the European politicians of the Left will end. Then there will be other occasions to show how things stand. There is the G-7 summit. There are the EC ministerial meetings. [Caprettini] Are you satisfied with what you have obtained in the government? Or do you feel a bit like a spare wheel? [Fini] I do not have worries of this type, and I am satisfied with five important ministries. [Caprettini] However, there have been some grumbles within the party. Buontempo says that it is necessary to think about splitting the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the AN. [Fini] Buontempo is an objector by nature. Criticisms? Let them be made, I have no wish to strangle the internal debate. However, I think that the press is more interested in these subjects than my party is. [Caprettini] What do you think of the government's program? [Fini] It is good. It is very realistic and therefore viable. [Caprettini] Will you manage to obtain the confidence of the Senate? [Fini] Yes, we will...also because it is clear that if there is no majority we will have elections. Wait and see, at the crucial moment many of our adversaries will leave for coffee!
