How else could a young man under the age of 37 who has not even mastered the externals of religious subjects move ahead so swiftly? Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, who has no social assets, has set no precedent by formulating independent interpretations of theological questions and has not risen to any level in his thinking. And yet, he rose swiftly from serving as a group official in al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party to serving as an official in the Amal Movement. Then he became Hizballah's mobilization officer in al-Biqa', served as commander of the party's fighters against the Amal Movement in Iqlim al-Tuffah, and [eventually] became the secretary general of Hizballah in Lebanon. Nasrallah managed to move ahead of outstanding scholars as well as leading formulators of independent theological interpretations, masters of thought, and our predecessors in the quest for Islam. How was he able to move ahead of all these people so swiftly? Let us mention the following facts to support our allegations: 1. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, group official in al-Da'wah Party, managed to persuade people that he had never joined the aforementioned party. Some people in the Islamic Republic of Iran fell for that ploy and believed him. Sayyid Hasan thus became the clean man whose personal and social history was untarnished. It is worth noting that Sayyid Nasrallah's name was cleared by key figures of al-Da'wah Party who denied his affiliation with the party because they knew how much the young people who were fond of Imam Khomeyni's approach, may God be pleased with him, hated al-Da'wah Party. They hated it because the party had made fighting Imam Khomeyni's approach its strategic goal. That had been the party's goal ever since the Holy Imam Khomeyni arrived in the holy city of al-Najaf following his exile from Turkey, where he had lived after the late Shah exiled him from Iran in 1963. By clearing Nasrallah's name the key figures of al-Da'wah Party were able to set the stage for Nasrallah to gain access to the decisionmaking position. Nasrallah would gain such access after gaining the confidence of sincere young people and after officials in the Islamic Republic of Iran were persuaded that his background was spotless. 2. Sayyid Hasan has held in Hizballah, ever since it was founded, a position from which he could deal directly with the party's elements. He became the mobilization officer in the party, and that gave him the opportunity to present himself to those elements as a humble person and to portray himself as someone who empathizes with the dispossessed and their concerns. But it was the cadres of al-Da'wah Party who had penetrated Hizballah who took part in polishing Sayyid Hasan's image and presenting it to these gullible youths. Consequently, a large segment of the party's elements became fond of Sayyid Hasan because they believed he was a humble man, indifferent to the objects of this world, and troubled by the concerns of the toiling classes. Some of these young people even preferred Sayyid Nasrallah to his professors, the late Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, may God have mercy on his soul; Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli; and Shaykh Muhammad Yazbak. These were the men who preceded Nasrallah in associating themselves with the blessed Islamic Revolution after its victory in 1979. In this regard suffice it to point out that after Sayyid Nasrallah received a majority of the votes of the members of the Consultative Council in the elections, which followed the expiration of Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli's term as secretary general, he yielded to the late Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, claiming humility as his motive. Nevertheless, he held control of the party's finances and military matters, thereby restricting the movement of the secretary general completely and turning himself in to the real decision maker. 3. Sayyid Nasrallah went to Iqlim al-Tuffah to lead Hizballah's fighters against the Amal Movement. He assumed an ultra-extremist position, and he showed so much enthusiasm for the fighting to continue that he refused to adhere to Ayatollah Khomeyni's unequivocal order, banning fellow Muslims from fighting each other. That turned him into a symbol of the resistance in the eyes of the party's elements who had strong feelings of hostility for the Amal Movement. In fact, Sayyid Nasrallah even traveled to Iran after the agreement between the party and the movement [to express] his objection to stopping the war between fellow Muslims. But his aim in going to Iran was to create some distance between himself and the media under the pretext of seeking knowledge in Qom, the center of learning. When he was in Iran, however, he tried to project the image of someone who was in full compliance with the wishes of officials, and he expressed his willingness to do everything that he was asked to do. When Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, may God have mercy on his soul, was killed by the criminal Zionists, everyone acted quickly so that Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah could be installed secretary general and Shaykh Na'im Qasim blocked from that position. Shaykh Na'im Qasim, who served as deputy secretary general during the lifetime of Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, is known for his affiliation with al-Da'wah Party. That is how Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, a key figure in al-Da'wah Party, got to the position of secretary general of Hizballah. And yet, it was generally believed that al-Da'wah Party had actually been driven out of the primary decisionmaking position in Hizballah. 4. Sayyid Nasrallah vehemently attacked the Lebanese Maronite regime in his speeches, and he described it in the ugliest terms. He got many people to think that he was sincere when he disavowed the infidel regime, but then he would turn into an apologist for it and rationalize joining it. When he found no precedent in Shiite history to justify a person's public involvement with infidel entities and oppressive governments, he worked hard in the hope that he might get Ayatollah Khamene'i, may God protect him, to give him legal cover. When he failed to do that, he took one sentence from the leader's statement that dealt strictly with internal Iranian matters, and he published it in the center of the front page of AL-'AHD Newspaper. That sentence had nothing to do with the outside world, and it had nothing to do with the elections in Lebanon. Nasrallah published that sentence to let people believe that Iranian leaders, acting according to a fatwa [formal legal opinion] from Imam Khomeyni, may God sanctify his secret, had pushed him to join the Lebanese regime. Nasrallah then started making various charges against those who hesitated to go to the polling stations or those who did not vote for the candidates he had nominated. After bringing the matter to a [words indistinct] doing that by blatantly falsifying the facts right and left, Nasrallah started leaking information through his mouthpieces, indicating that no one had been legally commissioned by the Islamic leadership, but that the decision to participate had been made in the so-called Shura Council. 5. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah wants people to forget that he lied to them about the parliamentary elections. He wants them to forget that he forced Muslims to recognize the Lebanese regime when he became a member of that regime's legislative authority. Today, Nasrallah is venting his wrath against the government, loudly proclaiming that, "We will not let the blood of our martyrs be spilled in vain." According to our information, however, he is trying hard via numerous and different channels to get one of his followers accepted as a government minister. This would be the price for the blood of martyrs who died in Airport Square. This time too the rationale is reforming the situation from within. We are reminding sincere believers who would not consent to abandoning the provisions of their true religion that the basis for disavowing infidel and oppressive governments is the same as that for prayer and fasting. We are reminding those sincere believers that the unequivocal verses from the Koran and the sayings which are attributed to the prophet, may God bless him and grant him salvation, and to the sacrosanct imams, peace be upon them, forbid dealings of any kind with non-Islamic entities. No person, not even the most erudite scholar, can make permissible what God Almighty and His messenger, may God bless him and grant him salvation, forbade. Accordingly, from now on, no true Muslim who is a member of Hizballah may obey his leaders so he can make money or protect a position, because by doing that, he would be obeying a creature and disobeying the Creator.
