Things were not dragged out, since Henri Emmanuelli was elected first secretary of the Socialist Party ad interim. [passage omitted] The departure of Michel Rocard has opened up a new crisis in the Socialist Party. In order to overcome it as soon as possible, the National Council this evening elected Henri Emmanuelli first secretary, but in an acting capacity, until the next congress, which will be held in the autumn. Henri Emmanuelli, aged 49, is the former speaker of the National Assembly. In his first statement he paid tribute to Michel Rocard: [Begin Emmanuelli recording] I should like, first of all, to praise the way in which Michel Rocard, the outgoing first secretary of the Socialist Party, has faced up with dignity to this day, which has passed off calmly, in a relative mood of fraternity -- I say relative because, when people are separated by the way they vote, there is always a degree of antagonism, but it has been calm. To the activists I say that I hope that from now on we will be able to act in such a way as to recover the confidence of the men and women of the Left, who over these past months, sometimes over these past years, have felt that the Socialist Party was either not speaking out for their interests, or not speaking out for their hopes.
