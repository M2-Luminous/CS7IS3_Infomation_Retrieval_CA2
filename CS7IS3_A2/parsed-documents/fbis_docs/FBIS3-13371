The paper said in its comment for tomorrow, Sunday, that most of these accusations come from one big power with interests in the region. It has some relationship to the issue at which accusations are being leveled. The paper added that these accusations are not based on anything other than reports containing unconfirmed information or guesswork. It added that these accusations are linked to some kind of violation of international peace and security, which means that the road is now open for taking the necessary resolutions accompanied by certain sanctions on the part of the Security Council. The paper said that Iraq was previously accused of using gas against the Shiites in the marshlands. After investigations, it was proven that this had not taken place. Libya was also accused of setting up installations for producing chemical weapons -- an accusation for which there is no evidence to back it up. Similar accusations have been leveled at other Arab countries.
