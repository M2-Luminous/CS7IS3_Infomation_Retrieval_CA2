Daskalov told journalists after the meeting that the documents contained primarily an assessment of the events which preceded the military invasion and followed it by "former Bulgarian and Czechoslovak functionaries." Havel said that today's act followed his earlier talks with Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev at which Havel showed interest in such documents. Part of the "national hygiene" is to know better one's own country's history, Havel said, adding that he would extend the documents to a commission of historians dealing with the 1968 events. Daskalov pointed out that the Bulgarian Parliament had in 1990 officially apologized to the former Czechoslovakia for Bulgaria's role in the events. Asked why Bulgaria was handing over the documents concerning 1968 only now Daskalov said that it was probably because in Bulgaria is more bureaucracy. Havel said that his meeting with Daskalov today served as an opportunity for exchanging information on the current political situation in both countries and on prospects for mutual relations. He said he believed there were no political problems or contested issues between the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. The two countries hold similar views on many questions and orientate their foreign policy in the same direction, he added. Hungary was the first country to hand over documents concerning the 1968 events to the former Czechoslovakia in June 1990, six days after Czechoslovak archive documents concerning the 1956 Hungarian revolution were handed over to Hungary. In August 1991, Czechoslovakia officially asked the former Soviet Union for access to the Soviet Government and party archives. In December 1991, Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Aleksandr Lebedev handed over documents concerning the events of 1968 and 1969 to Vojtech Mencl, chairman of the Czechoslovak governmental commission looking into the period. The documents contained reports which were sent by the then Soviet ambassador to Czechoslovakia to Moscow and the orders from Moscow. Russian President Boris Yeltsin handed over two packages of archive materials to the then Czechoslovak President Havel during his visit to Moscow in April 1992. The materials came predominantly from the archives of the former Soviet Communist Party and from the KGB.
