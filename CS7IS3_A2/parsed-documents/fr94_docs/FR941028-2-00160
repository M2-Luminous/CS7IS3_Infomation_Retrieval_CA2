FR941028-2-00160 FR941028-2-00109 Work Restrictions Comments: Requiring three consecutive negative smears before an HCW who is receiving treatment for active TB can return to work is excessive. A person who has improved does not cough and does not produce sputum and may be kept off duty unnecessarily. Response: Confusion had been caused by an incorrect wording in the guidelines, that ``negative smears on consecutive days'' were required. This has been clarified. The recommendation for 3 consecutive negative smears collected on separate days was deemed appropriate and retained. Comments: If an HCW who has a positive skin test result does not take preventive therapy, the HCW should be required to be seen and interviewed frequently. Response: The frequency of follow-up was not specified to allow for flexibility. Supplement 2 Comment: HCWs should be allowed to read their own skin test results. Response: Retained the recommendation that they not read their own test results and cited a reference as to why they should not. Comment: Clarification is needed on what constitutes a positive skin test result for HCWs. Response: Added to the recommendation that a HCW may be considered positive if the induration is 10 mm or more and referred to the Diagnostic Standards (ATS/CDC statement). K. Problem Evaluation Comments and subsequent changes made in the risk assessment section also apply here. Revised this section. L. Coordination With Public Health Department No substantive comments or questions received on this section. M. Additional Considerations for Selected Areas Comment: What controls are needed in special areas such as hospices and nursing homes? Response: Added a statement on the need to conduct a risk assessment and have an infection control plan, which should be reviewed and revised regularly. For hospices and nursing homes, it was clarified that TB isolation rooms are not needed if they do not provide care to TB patients. Restated the need for a referral protocol with periodic review. Supplement 5 Decontamination: Cleaning, Disinfecting, and Sterilizing of Patient-Care Equipment Comments: Only one comment on this section concerned the cleaning of ventilation ducts. Response: No changes were considered necessary.
