This is evidenced by an SWG [Integrated Research Services] poll conducted from 1990 to the present. The most obvious result is the increased number of Italians who resolutely profess to be right-wing. However, the results of the SWG survey, which we publish with this report, should be read taking into account the various stages in our recent history, starting from the remarkable percentage (39.6 percent) of those who professed to be center-left in 1990, at the height of the five-party system. By the end of 1991, on the eve of the local elections, this group began to disintegrate, flowing into the Center and center-right categories, headed by the Northern League. After the 1993 municipal elections, the center-left continued to crumble away, while the Left gave signs of recovery and the Right started its new, uninterrupted growth. The number of center-left citizens diminished proportionally by half, the center-right became stable, and the Left's rise was confirmed. In fact, the resulting polarization reflects the new electoral model, which completely upset the previous balance of forces. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Question: In the present political context, does your allegiance go to... | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Percentage |Oct 90 |Oct 91 |Dec 93 |May 94 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Right |8.6 |9.3 |10.6 |21.5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |center-right |9.0 |16.3 |16.0 |16.5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Center |21.2 |23.5 |25.2 |24.5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |center-left |39.6 |30.8 |22.8 |11.3 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Left |21.6 |20.1 |25.4 |26.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
