More than ever before, I would like to reaffirm my unflinching determination, as well as the determination of the government that I have the honor to head, to primarily resort to dialogue with all our partners in order to find solutions to the problems of our nation. We have taken cognizance of the defection of a few cabinet members at this time of a serious crisis that is affecting our country and the entire West African subregion. We believe that all democrats and patriots--all true sons of Mali--wherever they may be, will understand the need to join hands in our efforts to overcome the current predicaments and to avert threats against the democratic process and the very future of our nation. For a few days, disturbances have been taking place in schools with the attendant threat to the freedom of citizens and to their property. I would like to appeal to all partners in the Malian educational sector -- school administrators, teachers, parents, and students -- to primarily resort to peaceful negotiations as the only way to safeguard this school year. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all sincere democrats and patriots to get involved in efforts to stop all adventurers who would like to plunge our country into anarchy. We reiterate our unflinching determination to enforce the laws of the land, to protect citizens and their property, and to maintain law and order. Any instigation to revolt through false rumors or defamatory statements designed to incite hatred among Malians, at a time when our country rather needs to heal its wounds and restore national reconciliation, will be punished in accordance with the law. No great and lasting development can be achieved in disorder and insecurity. Our country has enough human and natural resources to overcome this crisis on condition that we all set to work in discipline.
