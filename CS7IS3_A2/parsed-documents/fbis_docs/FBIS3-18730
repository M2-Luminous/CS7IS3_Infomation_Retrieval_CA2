France already has more than 6,000 troops under the United Nations flag in former Yugoslavia. The battalion would consist of career soldiers, infantry and engineers, but the decision to send them is not yet formal, the sources said. The decision would be taken in close coordination with Britain. A British Government source said London could also send significant reinforcements to Bosnia. The reinforcements would enable the UN to put into force Security Council Resolution 900 providing for restoration of essential public services in Sarajevo, the sources said. Meanwhile Prime Minister Edouard Balladur held a meeting Monday with General Betrand de Lapresle, who will replace General Jean Cot as commander of UN forces in mid-March. Cot is being relieved at the request of UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for publicly demanding authority to order air strikes against the Serbs.
