FBIS4-7669 "dreeu064__a94024" FBIS-EEU-94-064-A Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 ANNEX Poland Committees Support Amendments to Labor Code Committees Support Amendments to Labor Code LD0104194494 Warsaw PAP in English 1804 GMT 1 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD0104194494 Warsaw PAP English BFN [Text] Warsaw, April 1 -- The government economic committee and the government socio-political committee Friday supported a legislative draft which, if adopted by the government and passed by parliament, will significantly change labour law and labour relations in Poland. The draft is the most extensive and weighty amendment ever introduced to the labour code enacted in 1974. The new proposals have been tailored to the realities of a market economy and designed to make the labour law compatible with international standards. The general idea behind the draft amendments is to restrict state intervention into labour relations and give greater freedom of negotiating labour terms and conditions to the parties concerned, that is trade unions and employers as well as individual employees. The provisions of the draft define only minimal obligations and duties of both parties to a labour contract, leaving the rest to direct negotiations. According to Labour Minister Leszek Miller, the amendments enhance the position of employees in some respects. For instance, the draft guarantees the right to severance pay to retiring workers and sets a minimum extra pay for night work. Both proposals are a novelty in the Polish labour legislation. The amendments also make labour law more flexible than it has been to date, particularly with regard to work schedules and hours. The draft tries to secure a better symmetry of the rights and obligations of employers and employees. Under the draft provisions, the shortest paid vacation leave would be 18 days instead of the present 14 days. One other change consists in extending the status of employers to individuals who are not legal persons. This would be of particular importance to family businesses. During their Friday session both government committees examined the most important criticisms addressed to the draft amendments by trade union federations.
