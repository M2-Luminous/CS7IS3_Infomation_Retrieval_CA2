The chief-editors of 13 US newspapers and magazines arrived here earlier this week on a three-day visit to "raise their understanding of present-day Iran," a U.S. journalist told AFP. They have already held several meetings with representatives of the Iranian media and were to meet Saturday with the editors-in-chief of the press in Tehran. "It is not clear who invited the American editors to Iran and why the Culture Ministry has arranged a meeting between them and Iranian chief-editors," said JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, a daily close to Islamic hardliners. The paper warned that the meeting could be a "ploy" by Washington to try and reopen talks with Iran through an indirect channel. Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after radical students stormed the U.S. Embassy here and took its staff hostage. The United States has called several times for direct negotiations, but the two sides have yet to make a breakthrough. Islamic hardliners are fiercely opposed to any talks with Washington.
