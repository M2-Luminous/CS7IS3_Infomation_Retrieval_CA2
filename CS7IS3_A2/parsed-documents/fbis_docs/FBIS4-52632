If not, the PDI will have to wait another 10 to 15 years to become great. One prerequisite for taking advantage of the moment is maintenance of cohesiveness in the party organization. Megawati made this statement Sunday, 27 March, when she held a gathering for PDI members at Blitar to mark the end of the fasting month. Present at the program were PDI DPP Chairmen Suparlan and Mangara Siahaan, Deputy Secretary-General Dr. Syafei Ali Gumai, Chairman of the East Java PDI DPD [Regional Executive Council] Latief Pudjosakti, and all PDI DPC [branch executive council] chairmen from throughout East Java. According to Mega, the opportunity can be seized if the PDI is unified and cohesive, and not confused and quarrelsome. "What is the use of electing me to be general chairwoman if you are always quarrelsome? The PDI is not going to become great if its members and leaders are always quarreling. Is that what is to be handed down to our younger generation?" she asked. Mega said that in handling the emergency situation in Surabaya, she tried not to be drawn into a confused an quarrelsome situation. She followed the situation with patience and firmness. "If I had not been patient and firm, I do not know what would have become of the PDI. Therefore, your strong support for me as general chairwoman of the PDI DPP must once more be demonstrated by eliminating all confusion and quarreling from the PDI organization," she asserted. However, Mega continued, the greatness of the PDI does not depend only on the top central leadership.
