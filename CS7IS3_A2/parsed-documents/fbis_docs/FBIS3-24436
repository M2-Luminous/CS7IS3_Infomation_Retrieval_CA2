The increase in the citizens' social anxieties and dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in the country and the drop in their political activity were occurring during all of last year. After the October events ended the democrats' ideological and political offensive against Soviet communist totalitarianism, Russian society, which was released from the hypnotic influence of the conflict between the branches, called into question the doctrine proposed by the democratic reformers for building a new Russia. Where Are We Going? It is not worthwhile hurrying to read a burial service over Russian democracy. It is alive; however, it is, without a doubt, living through difficult times. Judging by everything, a political recoil began after the spurt forward. The speed of the communist system's disintegration greatly determined its energy. What will be its strength and where will it lead all of us? One must understand whether one ought to attempt only to slow its backward movement and make its consequences as painless as possible or whether democracy will preserve sufficient potential, requiring only adjustments in its adopted course. What should these adjustments be? The answer to this question will greatly depend on appraisals of Russian society's condition and on the choice which the democrats themselves must make. Let us begin with the first item. When the Democratic Russia activists, who were painfully shocked by the results of the December elections, assembled to urge the people to unite in a popular antifascist front, disappointment awaited them. It became clear almost immediately that they would be alone. The liberals, communists and even part of the democrats came out sharply against this proposal -- as a confrontational one fraught with a new escalation in the conflict. They said that such an action would provoke an upsurge in fascism rather than stopping it. The liberal environment again said that "communofascism" is a myth but it could become a reality if the reformers do not change their course and the "demorussians" do not stop calling people to the barricades. Nevertheless, the decisive argument against an antifascist front at the present time was not this but rather the feeling that one would not succeed in arousing the people to active political actions. The people were tired from the endless conflicts and from politics, in general, and have lost their trust in it. That is why the idea of a front was quickly transformed -- first, into an antifascist movement and, later, into the draft of a "New Civic Movement" that would have the strategic purpose of building a civic society and insuring a peaceful process for reforming Russia. Opposition to fascism was only one of the movement's tasks. Thus, the change in policy was caused by the recognized necessity to rethink the condition of Russian society and, correspondingly, its goals and tasks. This is really something to think about. "The Democrats Have Messed Everything Up" This popular curse was born in the pro-communist opposition under the influence of the USSR's collapse and the price liberalization. It has now acquired the meaning of an ideological evaluation of democracy in Russia by the entire implacable opposition. Much is concealed in this evaluation: complaints about the sharp dramatic changes in the country, irritation caused by the burdens of day-to-day existence, doubts about the correctness of the course adopted by the reformers and the value of democratic freedoms, and preservation of the strong influence of the former soviet and party nomenklatura in the central state apparatus and local bodies of power and economic structures. A wave of united antidemocratic opposition is rising on such sentiments. Great-power nationalism, the idea of a self-contained state elevated above society and maintaining authoritative order in it, and a policy of blocs and confrontations in international politics are more and more becoming its common foundation. How far can the recoil go in this direction if an effective counteraction is not found for it? It is understandable that the best method would be successful implementation of the economic reforms, into which Russian society has already been drawn rather deeply and, as they say, the "active construction of a civic society." Perhaps, however, the latter is not quite what is needed and it is better to carry out the reforms under conditions of "enlightened authoritarianism?" This viewpoint is expressed just as frequently as the liberal romantic idea, which is contrary to it, of absolute evil coming from the state executive branch before which both the fascists and the "communofascists" are indeed only one of those defending the "sprouts of democracy" and not an alliance of extremist pro-communist and ultranationalist forces. Who is right? The Fuss About the "Social Pie" It is difficult, of course, for the democrats to convince people not to identify them with a corrupt bureaucratic state since they, failing to control it effectively, have taken upon themselves moral responsibility for everything in the country. However, it is important to state clearly what we are dealing with today. First, the state has not remained unchanged since 1991. As the radicalism of market reforms weakened and the administrative regulating role of the state was made more active, it settled more and more on its apparat-bureaucratic base and the role of branch lobbying in distributing the scarce -- as before but now not only physical resources but also money resources, grew at the same time. Accordingly, the danger of returning to the system of "bureaucratic trading" for a disproportionately large share of the diminishing "public pie" grew stronger. In the final analysis, this was the undoing of the centralized Soviet economy. The fact that the leadership and lobbyists of the branch monopolies are implementing such an egging-on revenge not only by penetrating into the leading cabinets but also by actively supporting the proletarianized masses of workers, including the strike movement, is now new. This "swing" in society is fraught with two terrible threats -- the inflationary collapse of the entire economy and a political explosion capable of returning the country to "war communism" and reaction. Second, despite a presence everywhere in society, the state has nevertheless surrendered its positions to a great extent. This is having extremely painful consequences since society itself is weakly structured socially and politically. As a result of numerous post-revolution shocks (wars, class struggle, collectivization, massive migrations) to the Russian social consciousness, the natural social ties -- family, kinsmen, community, fellow countrymen, etc. -- which firmly bound him for centuries, were destroyed to a great extent. At the same time, modern social structures based on a compromise and mutually beneficial agreement about non-converging class interests were not strengthened. During the Soviet epoch, a totalitarian state performed this cementing role in Russia. Now, however, this system has greatly eroded, leaving society in an atomized condition. As a result, a phenomenon of duality arose in the relationship of the modern Russian to the state: his striving to free himself from the administrative limitations of labor activity and use, on the one hand, and the simultaneous wish to preserve for himself a system of all-round state social paternalism, on the other hand. This duality and not just the resistance of the former "party, soviet and economic aktiv" is playing a role in braking the political reforms of B. Yeltsin and the market reforms in the spirit of Ye. Gaydar. Nevertheless, the reforms must move forward -- but how? Who Is Right? Many points of view exist regarding the course of economic reforms: the government's, Ye. Gaydar's, Shatalin-Abalkin's, Yavlinskiy's, etc. Although the president in his message to the Federal Assembly confirmed the course of the reforms in its basic principles and Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin made a completely moderate and balanced statement about ways to adjust it, arguments have become even sharper. What is the trouble? This problem has many aspects. In any event, however, the main thing that should interest everyone is how to make a correct choice and understand what specifically divides the participants in the controversy. Here, something is beginning to be cleared up. Ye. Gaydar, having given the economy money in the form of genuine economic resources instead of the previous account assets, was not able, according to the unanimous opinion of his opponents, to demonstrate how he could combine structural reorganization with an acceptable level of unemployment and the preservation of high-tech production. He himself, however, continues to think that his economic experiment would have brought total success if it had not been interrupted half-way. It seems that the large amount of negative experience that he acquired in the government is the source feeding his persistence. Gaydar understood, in practice, that the main problem of the reforms was how to force the branch monopolies to move to structural changes and where to get money and time to make this process as painless as possible in the economy (a decline and structural disproportions) and in the social area (unemployment). Of course, the figures of the branch lobbyists, by whose efforts and the efforts of part of the government's bureaucracy it would be possible to throw the economy suddenly back into the chaos of the administrative market economy of the past -- but now with even greater pernicious consequences -- constantly stood before his thoughtful gaze. That is why he regards -- not without skepticism -- V. Chernomyrdin's adjustment ideas since they have not been stated completely clearly (yes, and wisely; this should have been done immediately) since mutually contradictory tasks of supporting existing production, struggling against inflation and carrying out market institutional reforms are linked together in his program although the general idea of adjusting economic policy is completely understandable. This deficiency in the government's plan is seemingly overcome in the Shatalin-Abalkin program, which proposed a definite mechanism for producing a correlation of prices and wages in the national economy in a rational system and also for executive support of key branches by the state. Trust in the program, however, is undermined by the stubborn unwillingness of its authors to recognize the positive meaning of Ye. Gaydar's replacement of administrative levers for managing the economy with market ones. That is why the danger exists that the measures proposed by them can, in the final analysis, be a mirror anti-market image of a radical monetarist approach. Instead of the slogan: "Suppress inflation at any cost," the slogan: "Support a certain level of social appropriations, prices and wages at any cost," will be put forward -- with the threat of rolling back to an economy of shortages. The reform version proposed by G. Yavlinskiy with its stress on implementing a harmonious schema for state regulation of the process of subsequently transforming the former Soviet economy into a normal market one is seemingly deprived of this defect. At first glance, it looks effective as a competitor not for the "Gaydaronomics" of the past two years but for possible other "post-Gaydaronomic" approaches, using its positive results and not only its corrected failures. The main problem, however, with this program (as with all G. Yavlinskiy's previous works at the macro level) is, in his own words, that it requires preliminary changes in political conditions -- at a time when the main problem is the establishment of a program for actually existing social and political conditions. A New National Idea It is clear that the way to transform the former Soviet totalitarian society into a civic one runs through the failures of its atomization and archaicization. That is why it is no accident that the president's message especially stressed the need to strengthen the state's role in forming civic society's institutions. The political conditions are not quite favorable for this despite the strong drop in the popularity of the democrats and democracy and the collection of opponents. From this viewpoint, it is worthwhile to look at the case of the DemoRussians' recent advancement of the concept of a "New Civic Movement," which is designed to unite public, political, social, and other non-political movements of a civic persuasion. An increase in understanding the mutual connection between the struggle for the democratization of the state apparatus, the uniting of all pro-reform forces, the establishment of mechanisms for the citizens' effective influencing of the authorities and protection of their everyday interests by them, and, finally, the suppression of reactionary political trends are important new phenomena in the democratic movement.
