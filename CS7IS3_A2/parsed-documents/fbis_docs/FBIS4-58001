FBIS4-58001 "drlat104aa_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-104 Daily Report 21 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Chilean Delegate on Meeting Chilean Delegate on Meeting PY2805003294 Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 21 May 94 p 21 PY2805003294 Montevideo EL PAIS Spanish BFN [Text] Chilean Agriculture Under Secretary Alejandro Gutierrez said: "Chile is very interested that the Cairns Group continue to function because we believe its participation in the GATT Uruguay Round was very successful." Now that the GATT Uruguay Round has concluded, the Chileans want to see "how it is applied in the rest of the world, and this is why the Cairns Group must continue to function as a base for the dissemination of information and for action for other countries, especially the industrialized countries." The special Chilean mission continues in Uruguay to overcome the problems that have occurred with the export of Uruguayan meat. These problems pertain to the expiration of the operation permits for the meat packing plants and not to problems in the quality of the product, as was mentioned originally. In this respect, Gutierrez said that in his country "there is a new law and this is why the rules and regulations are quite strict," and this is also why "the same standard [preceding word in English] that is being applied to those who supply us from other countries is now being applied to the cattlemen here." It is the view of Chilean authorities that "different rules and regulations cannot be applied to the suppliers," and this why "the Chilean agricultural mission is now working in Uruguay to draft a report." He explained that Chile wants "the typifying rules and regulations to be complied with, and that the political agreements between the two countries also be observed."
