ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The American Automobile Labeling Act provides that, beginning October 1, 1994, passenger cars and other light vehicles must be labeled with information about their domestic and foreign content. The new labels will enable consumers to take country of origin information into account in deciding which new vehicle to purchase. This final rule establishes a new regulation to implement this statute. The regulation includes requirements which apply to motor vehicle manufacturers, suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment, and motor vehicle dealers. For model year 1995 and model year 1996 carlines which are first offered for sale to ultimate purchasers before June 1, 1995, manufacturers and suppliers may, instead of following the detailed calculation procedures set forth in this new regulation, use procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield similar results. DATES: This regulation is effective August 22, 1994. Petitions for reconsideration must be received not later than August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Petitions for reconsideration should be submitted to: Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Nelson Gordy, Office of Market Incentives, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5313, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202&hyph;366&hyph;4797).
