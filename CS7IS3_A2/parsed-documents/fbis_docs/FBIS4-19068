The central point today is the signing of several agreements, many of them of an economic nature, but there is also an outstanding social debt that could lead to a solution for the so-called children of the war. Those Spanish citizens who left Spain for Russia as children, during or after the Spanish Civil War, are now old and their pension status has still not been resolved. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports from the Moncloa palace: [Fernandez Cespedes] The two leaders have described their talks as very interesting. Yeltsin and Gonzalez also agreed when they said that Hispano-Russian relations are good, but there is much room for improvement. Furthermore, they are certain--and it seems they have no doubt from what we have heard--that the treaty of friendship and cooperation they signed this morning in the Moncloa Palace is going to very quickly step up Hispano-Russian relations. Yeltsin said this a few moments ago while expressing his disbelief at the present state of affairs. The president of the Russian Federation does not understand how trade between two great states--he thinks that the Spanish state ranks third regarding the quality of life in the world--does not reach two percent. Gonzalez also highlighted the treaty of friendship and cooperation as a channel that will politically and legally regulate the treaties that have been signed during this visit. As you know, one of these treaties allows the children of the war to get their pension in Spain, and it will not be less than the minimum established in our country. In short, this is a treaty of friendship and cooperation that, according to the Spanish prime minister, is going to be boosted annually and will institutionalize Hispano-Russian summit meetings at the highest level. [Begin Gonzalez recording] This agreement contains the commitment to hold at least two formal meetings between the foreign ministers every year and a meeting at the highest level every year. [end recording] [Fernandez Cespedes] And, finally, to end with a human touch but no less interesting. Boris Yeltsin has challenged all of us here at the news conference to enjoy a state of health like his, at the age of 57, by playing tennis and swimming in the Black Sea with a water temperature of four degrees.
