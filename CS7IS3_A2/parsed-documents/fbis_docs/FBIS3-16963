(On the eve of the presidential elections on the peninsula, the "Russian Party of Sevastopol" seceded from the "Russian Party of the Crimea" and created its own separate organization.) A number of appeals to the electorate of the Crimean Republic were adopted, in particular, not to take part in the elections to Ukraine's Supreme Council and also to the Crimean Supreme Council in accordance with party lists. The voters are urged not to accept these two ballots at electoral wards. Such a position is due to the fact that the aforementioned Crimean movements do not consider the Crimea to be a part of Ukrainian territory. With regard to elections to the Crimean parliament, the "Russian Society of the Crimea" and the "Russian Party of Sevastopol" are convinced that, today, the "Rossiya" [Russia] bloc is not what it used to be when it brought [Crimean President] Yu. Meshkov to power. According to chairman of the "Russian Party of Sevastopol," deputy of the Crimean Supreme Council and of the Sevastopol City Council Aleksandr Kruglov, the "Rossiya" bloc has been joined by those people who betray Russian ideas. The voters are urged to vote for individual personalities, proceeding from their specific personal characteristics, and not for candidates of the "Rossiya" bloc during the Crimean elections to the Supreme Council that will be held in accordance with the majority system.
