(b) Relief for an applicant. (1) (i) When it is determined in a final decision that an applicant for employment has been discriminated against, the Board shall offer the applicant for employment the position that the applicant for employment would have occupied absent discrimination or, if justified by the circumstances, a substantially equivalent position unless clear and convincing evidence indicates that the applicant for employment would not have been selected even absent the discrimination. The offer to the applicant for employment shall be made in writing. The applicant for employment shall have 15 days from receipt of the offer within which to accept or decline the offer. Failure to accept the offer within the 15-day period will be considered a declination of the offer, unless the applicant for employment can show that circumstances beyond his or her control prevented a response within the time limit. (ii) If the offer is accepted, appointment shall be retroactive to the date the applicant for employment would have been hired. Back pay, computed in the manner prescribed in 5 CFR 550.805 shall be awarded from the date the applicant for employment would have entered on duty until the date the applicant for employment actually enters on duty unless clear and convincing evidence indicates that the applicant would not have been selected even absent discrimination. Interest on back pay shall be included in the back pay computation where sovereign immunity has been waived. An applicant for employment shall be deemed to have performed service at the Board during such period for all purposes except for meeting service requirements for completion of a required probationary period. (iii) If the offer of employment is declined, the Board shall award the applicant for employment a sum equal to the back pay he or she would have received, computed in the manner prescribed in 5 CFR 550.805 from the date he or she would have been appointed until the date the offer was declined, subject to the limitation of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Interest on back pay shall be included in the back pay computation. The Board shall inform the applicant for employment, in its offer of employment, of the right to this award in the event the offer of employment is declined. (2) When it is determined in a final decision that discrimination existed at the time the applicant for employment was considered for employment but also by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant would not have been hired even absent discrimination, the Board shall nevertheless take all steps necessary to eliminate the discriminatory practice and ensure it does not recur. (3) Back pay under this paragraph (b) for complaints under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act may not extend from a date earlier than two years prior to the date on which the complaint was initially filed by the applicant for employment. (c) Relief for an employee. When it is determined in a final decision that an employee of the Board was discriminated against, the Board shall provide relief, which shall include, but need not be limited to, one or more of the following actions:
