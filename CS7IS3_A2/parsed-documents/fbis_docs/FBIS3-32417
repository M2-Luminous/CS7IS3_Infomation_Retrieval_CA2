Lage Davila has already left by plane for Colombia. Lage said that an example of that isolation is approval for two consecutive years by the UN General Assembly of resolutions rejecting the U.S. blockade. He added that in the second year, the number of countries supporting the resolution for Washington to suspend the embargo on Vietnam has increased. He said that the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam is the result of the heroic struggle and victory of the Vietnamese people, thus making more evident to international public opinion the unjust and cruel nature of the U.S. blockade against Cuba. In Brazil, Lage Davila and his delegation visited Sao Paulo, Brasilia, and Rio de Janeiro. They also met with President Itamar Franco and the ministers of foreign affairs, the economy, and health, in a series of activities that yielded positive results.
