The IMF's figures show that the investments of the large U.S. investment firms in the portfolios of the developing nations rose from $1.5 billion to $120 billion during the last five years. Furthermore, Morocco has greatly benefited from the interest of private investors, and has come to be called "the EC's Mexico." In an IMF study dealing with the flow of investments to 46 developing nations over the course of five years, it was reported that this flow of investments was accompanied by a boom in direct foreign investments, and that, after the value of investments had totalled $25 billion, they came to total of $50 billion, according to an IMF newsletter that is published from time to time and that was published in Washington last Wednesday. Analysts working for the IMF make a connection between the big influx of foreign investments and the economic reforms adopted by a large number of the developing nations which have strengthened the economies of these nations, and the fact that about 40 percent of the economic growth experienced by the world at the present time is taking place in the developing nations, since a large number of the industrial nations themselves are drowning in the swamp of an economic recession. Guy Pfeifermann, a high-level economics expert in the IMF, points out that "investors who are looking for investment opportunities are closely examining and scrutinizing these markets, and this is something that is only natural." Most of the increase in private investments is attributable to domestic sources, but the huge increase in direct foreign investments in the developing nations, in Pfeifermann's opinion, represents a "historic turning point" in which investors are showing that they have complete confidence in the economies of the developing nations, and this is a confidence which did not exist five years ago. Pfeifermann also calls our attention to the fact that the investment portfolios in the developing nations, during the last two years, have experienced a vertical upswing. This fact is closely related to the attractive investment climate that exists in a large number of the developing nations, and is closely related to the lowering of U.S. interest rates and decisions by the large U.S. investment firms to diversify their investment portfolios. The IMF's figures indicate that these firms' investments in the portfolios of the developing nations have increased from $1.5 billion to $120 billion during the last five years. However, in view of the fact that these investments constitute only 0.5 percent of their total investment portfolios, observers find no reason to worry about whether or not these investments will continue. The big surge in private investments appeared mostly in East Asia and Latin America. The flow of investments to the nations of North Africa and the Middle East remained average or below average in relation to the 46 nations covered by the IMF study, but there was a great discrepancy in the amount of the investments that flowed into each of these countries (in North Africa and the Middle East). Morocco benefited greatly from interest on the part of the private investors. It has recently experienced great improvement in this regard and has become, or almost become, "the EEC's Mexico," because clothes-producing firms have set up plants in Morocco in order to export their products to the EEC, according to Pfeifermann. Lebanon has stood out among the other nations, and the IMF believes that the beginnings of prosperity exist there. Pfeifermann points out that a recently-published government report indicates that the rate of economic growth in Lebanon surpassed 7 percent last year. He says: "There is no doubt that Lebanon is once again having an economic boom after its civil war came to an end. One positive sign is that a number of Lebanese companies have asked the IMF for financial aid of the type that the IMF usually provides." But Egypt, on the other hand, earned no praise from the analysts working for the IMF. Robert Miller, one of the chief analysts who contributed to the study, says that "Egypt was far less promising than the other nations in the area because of the enormous number of state-owned establishments, which are moving only very slowly in the direction of privatization." Miller is worried about the negative effect that political problems in Egypt are having on the investment climate there. Those participating in the study say that the Middle East, as a whole, has been hurt by the world's falling oil prices. The study was confined to 46 nations, chiefly because the information utilized was not available in the case of the other developing nations. The study analyzes in detail the situation in five Middle Eastern and North African nations, which are Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Iran, and Turkey. One of the criteria used by the study to evaluate the capability of any of the economies to attract foreign investments was that of comparing these investments to the GNP. In Egypt, private investments were 7.8 percent of the GNP in 1992. This is a low percentage in comparison with the percentages in Thailand (32 percent) and Korea (25 percent). The rate of private investments in Tunisia was 10.7 percent of the GNP, and in Turkey this figure was 11.7 percent. The average rate for the 46 nations covered by the study was 13.2 percent. Taking the above-mentioned into consideration, Morocco's rate of private investments to its GNP was 13.4 percent (that is, above average). Perhaps Iran's good performance, which was accompanied by a noticeable increase in public investments, was in response to the reforms that in 1992 appeared to evidence considerable success. But it is also possible that this good performance is attributable to false information or statistics, according to officials in the IMF. The study draws attention to the influx of private investments in a number of nations in the Middle East or nations adjacent to it. The performance of the Turkish stock market was the strongest performance shown by any of the young markets during the last few years. But this stock market has lost 60 percent of its value in U.S. dollars during the last few months, a fact that indicates that its performance has been similar to that of a great many of the young markets in that it is capricious and not subject to controls.
