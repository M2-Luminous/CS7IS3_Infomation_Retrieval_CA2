All of them support his demand to disarm the settlers, reorganize the settlements before the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and deploy international observers in the territories. 'Arafat's assistant Jibril Rajjub told us in an interview in Tunis that Israel is responsible for torpedoing the Oslo agreement. [Rajjub] I believe the PLO cannot resume the peace process or negotiations without a new basis. The new basis is solving the problem of the settlers. I think that uprooting all the settlers from Hebron is the only solution to return to the negotiations. Those who killed and those who danced and celebrated after the brutal massacre in the mosque will have no peace and there will be no coexistence with them. We will not give them security while they live in Hebron. [Amir] What are you afraid of? What can happen in Hebron now? [Rajjub] Anything is possible. One day a mad person might come and do the same thing. No one can guarantee that the Hebronites will not take revenge. What happened motivates us all to take revenge and react in the way they see fit. It is better to solve the whole problem and remove the settlers. I think we will be traitors if we agree that those who celebrated the massacre in Hebron will remain in Hebron. [Amir] Does this mean the negotiations remain deadlocked and that you are reopening the Oslo agreement? [Rajjub] Listen, the deadlock happened after the brutal massacre in Hebron. Negotiations have taken place over six months following the Declaration of Principles agreement. The negotiations have always been linked with the security and peace of the settlers and settlements. What happened proved that security and peace can be achieved when we send the settlers to hell. [Amir] Rajjub announced that Fatah will renew the armed struggle against Israel. Was this a PLO instruction? [Rajjub] There has been no decision to end the struggle. Perhaps the means have changed but as long as there is occupation and settlers, no orders are given to end the struggle. [Amir] Will the Fatah Movement initiate a revenge operation following the Hebron massacre? [Rajjub] Anything is possible. I think this is a possibility. No one can tell you that something like this won't happen. [Amir] Regarding the contacts between Tzomet and the Labor Party, total indifference is being demonstrated on the surface. But Palestinian sources note that including Tzomet in the government will, in their opinion, restrict the Israeli Government's freedom of action in the negotiations with the Palestinians and enable Rabin to act more forcefully against the extremists among the settlers.
