Vlasov has approved statutes for an Oblast Duma and elections to it. The draft of this document was first discussed in detail at an oblast assembly of representatives of various parties, movements, and other public organizations, and also power structures. There were major objections from assembly participants to the administration's proposal to elect 17 deputies to the future Duma who would work on a permanent basis. In that case, the opponents claimed, not all Vladimir Oblast rayons would be represented in it, not to mention the fact that it would have to operate without standing commissions. But, apparently, the representative body henceforth will operate without standing commissions, since the final version of the statutes on the Oblast Duma provides for 21 deputies. The original draft statutes on elections also underwent significant changes. Now someone wishing to register as a candidate in an electoral district requires not three but only two percent of voters' signatures in his favor. According to the statutes, groups of voters, public associations, and individuals are entitled to nominate a candidate.
