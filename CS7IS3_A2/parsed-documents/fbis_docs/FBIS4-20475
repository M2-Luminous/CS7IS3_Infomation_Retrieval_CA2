Among them, 10 were first prize winners, and another 30 ranked second. The youngest was 26 years old, and the average age was 32. They were all selected from research institutes under CAS. Among them, 34 were Ph.Ds., with 31 having earned their doctorates at home. Altogether, they had published 1,159 academic papers in Chinese and foreign academic periodicals. The scientific research projects which they presided over or participated in as key members had won six prizes of state-level scientific and technological achievements and 22 awards from CAS, provinces and ministries. Their achievements have been prominent in scientific and technological fields. Research fellow Zhang Zhile, aged 30, was the youngest among the first prize winners. Zhang received his doctorate from Shenyang Metal Research Institute. He has obtained outstanding research results in the fields of magnetics, magnetic materials and applied magnetics, with publication of 57 academic papers in foreign and domestic periodicals. A research group led by him succeeded in developing a new permanent magnetic material of world advanced level. He and his colleagues have advanced a new theory of magnetic colloidal effects through analysing phenomenon associated with handling of permanent magnetic material, thus solving a knotty problem of several decades at global level. Many specialists praised his efforts as an absolutely first-class job. Wider dissemination of magnetic technology, a project in which he was involved, has brought over 100 million yuan to oilfields. Due to his stirring efforts, he was granted the title of Liaoning Provincial Outstanding Young Scientific and Technical Worker, awarded at the Third Prize Ceremony of the China Association for Science and Technology. Wang Xiaofang, born in 1967, was the youngest prize winner. A Ph.D. of the Shanghai Optical Machinery Research Institute, he is known for his creative accomplishments in the study of laser plasma X-ray spectrum and X-ray lasers. Wang has published more than 20 academic papers in influential local and overseas journals. He was the key member of the first research project to set up a soft X-ray spectrometer with penetrating strap raster. Other national firsts by Wang and his colleagues have included the systematic study of the equilibrium of linear focus X-rays, the course of their evolution and the space-time character of composite X-ray lasers. In addition, Wang has designed a new way to drive lasers and a new laser target. As a key member, he participated in research for the state-designated ``863'' high-tech project, as well as a key project designated by CAS and another by the State Natural Sciences Fund. In 1992, he was given first prize for Natural Sciences by CAS, and his treatise was chosen in 1993 as an excellent one for the National Young Scientists' Academic Paper Exchange Meeting on Laser Science. Qi Zhixue was the only woman among winners. Shortly after she finished her master's degree at the Electronic Industry Research Institute in 1988, she was assigned a job in the institute. In 1992, Qi went to Canada for one year of further studies. At the end of this, she was advised her excellent marks warranted her staying on to continue toward a doctorate. However, feeling she was badly needed at home, Qi politely declined the Canadian offer. After returning to China, she participated in the study and manufacture of line-cutting machine tools. She was in charge of software programming which solved technical problems in handling of non-circular curves. This feat won the second prize for Beijing Scientific and Technical Progress. The program-control system for the new machine tools which involved Qi's major efforts took the third prize for scientific and technical progress of CAS in 1991. The same year, she was conferred the title of ``Outstanding Contributor With Chinese Masters'' by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council. Other winners included Li Jinghai, Yuan Yexiang, Chen Zhaoxiong and Wang Zhixin, whose research projects all earned prizes for scientific and technical achievements from the state or CAS. The young scientist awards are presented biennially in a bid to discover and encourage talented young scientists. In 1989, there were 21 winners. In 1991, the number increased to 25. Recipients gain not only awards but also special housing, promotions and professional study opportunities. Zhou Guangzhao, president of CAS, said, ``Our academy is passing through a crucial stage. The burden of work is shifting to fledgling scientists. Having the young replace their elders is one of the three important tasks we face in the 90s.'' CAS is honored as a state team. Under its umbrella are some 150 research institutes, with 60,000 scientific workers. Among them, there are 30,000 young scientific workers under the age of 40, accounting for half its total employment.
