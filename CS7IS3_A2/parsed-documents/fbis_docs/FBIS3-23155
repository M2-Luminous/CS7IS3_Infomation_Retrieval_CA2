Throngs of citizens have assembled on the highways and roads amid a heavy traffic jam. According to the information announced by the interior minister a short while ago, nine people were killed and a number of others injured in the blast. He declared that the church and the worshippers inside it have escaped a horrible massacre because not all the explosive charges planted in the church went off. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Mr. Minister, having been briefed by the security agencies on the effects of the explosion, what is the latest death toll? [Mirhij] We are not yet sure of the number of dead, but I believe there are nine dead. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Mirhij] The explosive charge was designed to cause a big massacre, but God's care, [words indistinct] some charges went off but not all. Had all the explosive charges gone off, the result would have been devastating. [Shahin] Anyway, the security forces are conducting investigations inside the church. Reporters have been forbidden to enter the church for security reasons. They will be allowed in later after the initial investigations. Destruction and devastation are evident inside and outside the church. There are no doors or windows. Cars parked nearby have been damaged, along with homes. The church is located in the Zuq Musbih area and there is heavy traffic on the highway. The Internal Security Forces are trying to facilitate traffic.
