Shmelev (Atomic Reactors Institute, RNTs [expansion not given] ``Kurchatovskiy institut''); received April 30 1993; UDC 621.039.548] [Abstract] Nowadays great attention is paid to analysis of possible AES accidents caused by overheating of fuel that results in global destruction and meltdown of the core and release of fission products into the heat transfer agent and beyond the primary loop and AES protective shell. To provide reliable computer forecasts of accident development it is necessary to know information on release of long-lived fission products and use an adequate mathematical and physical model of fission products release under conditions that are typical for serious accidents. Experimental studies of release of fission products in various media under different temperatures (up to the uranium dioxide melting point) have been conducted for several years at RNTs ``Kurchatovskiy institut''. The article presents results of measurements of time and temperature dependences of release of fission products such as [.sup]140[/] Ba, [.sup]140[/]La, [.sup]95[/]Zr, [.sup]103[/] Ru and [.sup]141[/]Ce when annealing irradiated specimens in an inert medium under conditions that simulate accident situations caused by overheating of reactor fuel. Results of test conducted in an active medium are being prepared for publication. The article describes the specimens and procedure used for determining release of solid fission products and presents experimental results. It was found that release increases along the Ce- Zr- La- Ba series. Figures 5, tables 3, references 4: 2 Russian and 2 Western.
