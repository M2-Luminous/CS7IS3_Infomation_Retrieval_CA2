In a statement to an INA correspondent in Cairo before heading for Amman, Basindwah said: What is taking place in Yemen is not a civil war as depicted by some people, but a confrontation against the remnants of secessionism and violators of the constitution and legitimacy. Basindwah said: Now that the separatist cliques have continued with their agentry, fabrication of crises, and igniting the war, the Yemeni people and the constitutional government have decided to confront these cliques to restore security, stability, and legitimacy. He stressed that matters are proceeding in favor of legitimacy and the people, adding that there is no question that they will triumph. The foreign minister said that the government and people, led by Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, appreciate Arab brothers' feelings and concern over unity. He added: However, what is taking place in Yemen is an internal matter. Fighting was imposed on us, so we have no choice but to defend law and unity in the wake of the crisis fabricated by the separatists over the past year. Regarding the possibility of reaching a cease-fire and holding dialogue, Basindwah said: If these elements do not return to constitutional legitimacy and resort to law, and if the gangs do not abandon their dreams and return to the legitimacy represented by the Constitutional leadership under President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, we will continue to uproot them. Asked about his current Arab tour, Basindwah noted that Yemen hopes that the Arab brothers will understand what is taking place as well as the crisis fabricated by the YSP leaders to strike at Yemeni unity. He stressed that some parties refer to Yemen as South and North for separatist objectives, adding that many members of the current government come from the South, such as the new defense minister, the commander of the Navy, fighters, and commanders. Basindwah ridiculed the separatists' statements that Arab parties are helping the Yemeni Government in confronting the separatists. He said: We challenge them to prove this. It is not strange to see these rebellious apostate elements making such false statements at the instructions of foreign forces. Asked about the nature of the Yemen's future political life, Basindwah said: Following the regrettable incidents, Yemen will enter a new phase of stability, democracy, prosperity, legitimacy, and collective participation in the government in accordance with the interests and Constitution of the Republic of Yemen.
