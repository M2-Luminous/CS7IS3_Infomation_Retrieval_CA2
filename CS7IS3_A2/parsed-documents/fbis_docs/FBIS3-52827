In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Khartoum, al-Bashir said: Our Arab ties are inclined toward reconciliation with those who are hostile to us because we believe that reconciliation among the Arabs is the peoples' desire. We will continue our efforts to achieve this goal in the near future, if not today. He added: Everyone in the Arab region now feels that the current discord has weakened the Arab stance on the Arab nation's causes. We have noticed that the Arabs are absent in many international arenas and in the situations that require cooperation and coordination. For his part, Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih has said that his country supports all efforts to achieve Arab reconciliation and all initiatives to restore Arab solidarity. In a statement to the MENA Khartoum correspondent, he added: We have already declared our support for the initiatives of United Arab Emirates President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman, and Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. He noted that the current regional and world challenges make Sudan more insistent on collective and bilateral action to achieve Arab reconciliation. This reconciliation, he said, has become a historic responsibility that requires everyone to accomplish it in line with the aspirations of the Arab nations who are fed up with the current divisions. Abu-Salih says: Arab reconciliation and the restoration of Arab unity are the goals we are trying to accomplish, and this proves our sincere desire to improve the current situation. We are doing all we can to achieve reconciliation, and we will be the first to support an Arab summit to achieve solidarity and rally all efforts to confront the current world and regional dangers that threaten the Arab nations. He asserted the need for a suitable atmosphere to achieve an inter-Arab political detente and to prepare properly for an Arab summit. He remarked that the bases on which such reconciliation relies are stipulated in the Arab League charter, which we all respect. Dr. Mustafa 'Uthman Isma'il, Sudanese minister of state and secretary of the popular international friendship council [name and title as received], says achieving Arab reconciliation is one of the fundamental bases of Sudan's foreign policy. This policy's aim, he adds, is to eliminate all causes of division and dispute because Arab solidarity will stop the current disorder. He believes that the current developments in the Arab world, Israel's attempts at hegemony and expansion, the deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and pan-Arab security problems such as the water and border problems require an urgent Arab summit. He said that to be successful this summit needs favorable circumstances by removing current tensions and disputes. He expressed his belief that if the current intense reconciliation efforts are boosted, they will pave the way for a summit. The Sudanese minister of state believes that the Arab League should move in various ways to make the Gulf Cooperation Council issue a resolution calling for such a summit. He notes that the Arab League can also seek other resolutions from the Arab Maghreb Union and from countries outside these two councils. Then the Arab League should meet at the foreign ministers level to discuss proposals and means for the summit. He says that reconciliations between countries with various disputes could be achieved before the summit, which would consolidate these efforts, and other topics could be discussed. He affirmed that the summit is necessary and desirable even if it achieves nothing because it will break the psychological barrier caused by the Gulf war and because failing to hold such a summit will encourage others to interfere in Arab affairs and will weaken Arab efforts to restore solidarity. The Sudanese minister of state pointed out that the general Arab trend is positive and inclined toward reconciliation. He noted that past reconciliation efforts have resulted in easing tension, as was the case in Palestinian-Saudi relations when Faysal al-Husayni in his capacity as head of the Palestinian Steering Committee in the peace talks visited Riyadh; the start of a dialogue between Yemen and Saudi Arabia; and the improvement of Sudan's relations with some of the Gulf states, including Qatar and Oman. He said: I believe that the efforts of the Arab League and its secretary general will help end the current differences, although these efforts might take some time to reach a strategic situation where the Arab countries will form a single economic, military, and social bloc. He added that Egypt's role is crucial in holding the summit, because as chairman of the Arab League and the OAU and with its influence it can help expedite the efforts to hold an Arab summit. For his part, Muhammad Shakir al-Siraj, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Sudanese Transitional National Council, the parliament, asserts that restoration of Arab solidarity is a fundamental requirement to ward off the dangers that threaten the Arab world and the suffering of the Iraqi, Libyan, and Sudanese peoples. Al-Siraj expressed his belief that Arab leaders are able to restore solidarity and that after more than three years since the outbreak of the Gulf war, disputes that resulted from that war should disappear. He hopes the Arab leaders will be able to hold a summit this year.
