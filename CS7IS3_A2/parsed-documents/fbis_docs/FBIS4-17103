Will the United Nations and NATO Be Able To Draw the Proper Conclusions?"] [Text] Berlin, 19 April -- The latest bloody impasse into which the resolution of the Bosnian problem has been driven has arisen thanks to military interference by NATO. This attests that, by following the gradual and quite irresponsible decisions of politicians, it is possible to achieve only a dramatic escalation of the stand-off. In point of fact, FRG Foreign Minister K. Kinkel agreed with this assessment at a meeting with his colleagues from the European Union member countries. Of course, his judgments were far more diplomatic, and he still considers military interference justified -- how could it be otherwise? -- but even the head of German diplomacy has been forced to acknowledge the obvious: "This has not produced the desired results." This, in fact, could easily have been ascertained in advance from Russian diplomats, for example, who know both the state of affairs on the spot and the Serbs' national character. But no, instead they preferred to organize a public airshow. Now Kinkel is appealing to Russia, asking it to use all its influence to induce the Serbs to pull back their troops from Gorazde. Appealing to that very Russia which there was "insufficient time" to warn of the air strike against the Bosnian Serbs' positions. The microscopic military effect turned into a crushing blow against the months-long peacemaking efforts of Russian diplomacy, which also has to its obvious credit its highly successful participation in lifting the siege of Sarajevo. What has happened in Gorazde demonstrates very graphically the impotence of the United Nations and NATO and, most importantly, the total lack of any ideas whatever about how the Balkan problem should be resolved. Of course, it is far simpler to down aircraft and shoot up tanks from the air than to display a consistent will to peacefully achieve the set goal. But where is this goal? It long ago vanished beneath mounds of verbiage.... Brussels, 19 April -- Did the NATO raids produce what was expected -- at least the psychological capitulation of the "target" in the face of the alliance's show of military might or, most importantly, hope of a move toward a political settlement dictated by this might? No, something else happened. NATO's military interference has led only to a radicalization of the belligerents' positions, as well as jeopardizing the contingents of UN forces in Bosnia, whom the embittered Bosnian Serbs are already calling "participants in the conflict" and who, accordingly, are increasingly frequently becoming the object of countermeasures which the West calls "repressive." What now? To judge from available information, NATO's Brussels headquarters still proceeds, in principle, from the decisions adopted earlier. Namely, to carry out new raids if a request is received from the command of the UN Bosnian forces -- a request sanctioned by A. Akashi, the UN secretary general's special representative. But the internal situation within this "company" no longer appears as definite and clear as it did just at the end of last week. The events of the weekend, which showed the futility of the "strong-arm peacemaking method" in Bosnia, presented both the United Nations and NATO with a dilemma: to step up pressure or abandon it altogether? NATO headquarters has not yet reacted officially to this dilemma, which Akashi recently formulated as a need to make a choice between sharply increasing the size of the UN contingents in Bosnia and withdrawing them, but on the other hand there is lively press comment on this topic. Diverse opinions are being heard, but probably never before have views which cast doubt on the present "peacemaking policy" as a whole been expressed so frankly and in such a generalized form in the newspapers. The newspaper LA LIBRE BELGIQUE, for example, writes that the losses borne by a number of Western countries in the course of expeditions under UN auspices make peacekeeping operations unpopular, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for some governments to continue this "humanitarian" policy. But what is the alternative? In the opinion of practically all commentators, only the talks process can work. Mindful of the fact that it is constantly malfunctioning, however, LA LIBRE BELGIQUE expresses another noteworthy thought: Why not use, in the interests of a settlement, an additional trump card such as...the lifting of the embargo against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia? You probably could not invent a better epitaph for "strong-arm peacemaking."
