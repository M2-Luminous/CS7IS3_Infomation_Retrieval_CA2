According to this policy, Arab nations will be given a preferential status for investing money here over Western nations. The Investment Promotion Bureau [IPB] and the Investment Board [IB] will be made more effective. The government plans to pay more attention to agricultural industries. In order to attract foreign investors, investment centers will be established in the embassies and here in Pakistan. Various conferences and seminars will be held in countries that show interest in investing in Pakistan. The wrong policies and plans of former governments, foreign investment in Pakistan was not encouraged enough and not much attention was given to it. Each of our governments had tried to get money from the West, however, our planner forgot that the interests of the Western nations have nothing to do with our own interests. The Western nations look for ways to interfere in our internal affairs under the guise of investing here and they find various ways to put political pressure on us. For example, the United States has suspended military and economic aid to Pakistan. Its condition is that Pakistan must freeze its nuclear program. It is not willing to impose this condition on India and wants to put all these restriction on Pakistan alone. When the Western nations fail to realize their political and economic interests, they break their promises and stop their aid. The United States has also restricted Pakistan's exports and has imposed major restrictions on our textiles production. The same is true for other Western nations. Even some Asian countries under U.S. influence are treating Pakistan similarly. The Western nations impose strict requirements for investing money. They try to make the developing countries the markets for their products and do not import products from these developing nations. We should have paid attention to it a long time ago, because we not only have trade and economic relations with Arab nations, we also have historical, religious, cultural, and social relations with them. The Arab nations do not insist on imposing strict rules for investing money like the Western nations do. All they want is security of their capital. In exchange, they will take interest in purchasing Pakistani products. The Arab nations have a great demand for agricultural products. The present government has shown far-sight by including Arab investors in agricultural industries. Most of the Arab nations are not self-sufficient in growing food grains. The Arab investment will help develop our agricultural industry and the export of agricultural products to Arab nations will prove a boon for us. Our agricultural production will be exported to friendly Arab nations. This will increase our exports and the food grains need of the Arab nations will also be met. The Nawaz Sharif government had also tried to give special entitlement to foreign investors and also held a major seminar here. A large number of European investors had participated in that seminar, however, there were no concrete results. Some reasons for limited foreign investment in Pakistan are our bureaucratic rules and regulations, shortage of electric power, and the problem of law and order. The program that our government has formulated for luring Arab investors should pay special attention to alleviating the problem of shortage of electric power. It is a common complaint that our trade attaches in other countries do not pay attention to it, although it is their duty to look for new sources of investment and increase our trade. We need cooperation from trade and industrial circles to hold conferences and seminars in Arab countries for attracting their investment. To this end, first we should send deputations of experts to these countries to establish individual relations with the investors there. We must establish centers in these countries to encourage investments and a regular advertising campaign should also be started. It would be better to invite Arab investors to visit Pakistan and present to them details of agricultural areas in which they can benefit. The government should review old reports on plans for attracting foreign investment and find out the reasons for the failure of those plans. Until these problems are alleviated, neither will success in this area be possible nor can we make better plans.
