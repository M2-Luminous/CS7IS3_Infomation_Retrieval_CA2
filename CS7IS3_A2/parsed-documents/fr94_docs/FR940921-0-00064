(a)(1) Exhaust emissions from new 1991 and later model year Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines shall not exceed (compliance with these standards is optional through the 1996 model year natural gas- and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled heavy-duty engines): (i) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines fueled with either gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, and intended for use in all vehicles except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this paragraph. * * * * * (B) *␣*␣* ( 2 ) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines fueled with either gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas and utilizing aftertreatment technology. 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle. (C) *␣*␣* ( 3 ) A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its liquefied petroleum gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families in any or all of the NO X averaging, trading, or banking programs for heavy-duty engines, within the restrictions described in §86.091&hyph;15. If the manufacturer elects to include engine families in any of these programs, the NO X FELs may not exceed 6.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (2.2 grams per megajoule). This ceiling value applies whether credits for the family are derived from averaging, trading or banking programs. (ii) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines fueled with either gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, and intended for use only in vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of greater than 14,000 lbs. * * * * * (B) *␣*␣* ( 2 ) For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines fueled with either gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas and utilizing aftertreatment technology. 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow at curb idle. (C) *␣*␣* ( 3 ) A manufacturer may elect to include any or all of its liquefied petroleum gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families in any or all of the NO X averaging, trading or banking programs for heavy-duty engines, within the restrictions described in §86.091&hyph;15. If the manufacturer elects to include engine families in any of these programs, the NO X FELs may not exceed 6.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour (2.2 grams per megajoule). This ceiling value applies whether credits for the family are derived from averaging, trading or banking programs. * * * * * (v) For natural gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines intended for use in all vehicles except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (A) Nonmethane hydrocarbons. 0.9 gram per brake horsepower-hour (0.33 gram per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. (B) Carbon monoxide. ( 1 ) 14.4 grams per brake horsepower-hour (5.36 grams per megajoule), as measured under transient operating conditions. ( 2 ) For natural gas-fueled Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines utilizing aftertreatment technology. 0.50 percent of exhaust flow at curb idle.
