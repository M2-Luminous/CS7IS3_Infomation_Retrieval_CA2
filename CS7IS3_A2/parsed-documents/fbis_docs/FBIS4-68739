FBIS4-68739 "jpusr054___94004" FBIS-USR-94-054 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 6 May 1994 INTERSTATE AFFAIRS Picketing for Release of Russian Activist in Kazakhstan Picketing for Release of Russian Activist in Kazakhstan Reported 944Q0361B Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 6 May 94 p 3 944Q0361B Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Article by Sergey Kozlov, under rubric "Kazakhstan": "Public Organization Activists Demand the Freeing of the Leader of the `Russian Commune' in North Kazakhstan: Official Alma-Ata and Moscow Are Not Hurrying To Clarify the Situation"] [Text] Boris Suprunyuk, leader of the North Kazakhstan department of the "Russian Commune" organization, who was confined under guard on 12 April of this year, has been brought to Alma-Ata for enforced psychiatric evaluation. The prisoner is being charged with actions the punishments for which have been stipulated in Part 1 of Article 60 of UKK [Kazakhstan Criminal Code] (the article is called "Violation of National and Racial Equal Rights and the Equal Rights of Citizens Depending Upon Their Attitude Toward Religion"). As a citizen of the Russian Federation who is residing in the Kazakhstan city of Petropavlovsk, Boris Suprunyuk attracted the interest of the North Kazakhstan procurator's office as early as last summer, after he spoke at the local Cossack Circle, criticizing the "linguistic" policy of the city authorities. The criminal case that was initiated in this regard languished until April of this year. But apparently after Suprunyuk took part in the picketing of the Kazakhstan embassy during Nursultan Nazarbayev's recent visit to Moscow, the authorities decided to let this case go full speed ahead. The leader of the "Russian Commune", after his arrest, was in Petropavlovsk for one week, and no one, not even his lawyer, was allowed to see him. According to a statement made by employees of the oblast procurator's office, during the night of 19-20 April, the prisoner was taken to Alma-Ata for the purpose of undergoing trial-related medical evaluation. But for a period of two weeks nothing was known about Suprunyuk: Kazakhstan officials completely refused to make any comments on the situation. There was a similar lack of success in the attempts made by employees of the Russian embassy in Alma-Ata to learn anything about the fate of the Russian citizen. The embassy sent notes several times to the republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and statements were also sent to the Kazakhstan ambassador in Moscow from the appropriate committee of the State Duma. According to Russian diplomats, both Nursultan Nazarbayev and Andrey Kozyrev were informed of this. By preventing the embassy employees from seeing the accused, the Kazakhstan authorities, in the opinion of the same diplomats, are violating the Russo-Kazakhstan consular convention. In addition, people in the Russian embassy consider that the forced psychiatric evaluation is also inadmissible. Last Monday it finally became known that Suprunyuk has been brought to the capital of the republic. In his own words, he was brought from Petropavlovsk several days earlier than the date given by the authorities. And while he was in Alma-Ata, only his lawyer was allowed to visit him. On Wednesday the republic procurator's office was picketed by activists from the Alma-Ata "Russian Commune," the "Harmony" movement of Semirech'ye Cossacks, and social democrats. In their opinion, there is no corpus delicti in Boris Suprunyuk's actions, since he, as a journalist, had the complete right to express his opinion with regard to the local policy, so long as he did not go beyond the confines of the law. However, one also hears hypotheses concerning a kind of behind-the-scenes agreement between the Moscow and Alma-Ata officials with regard to Suprunyuk. Otherwise it is extremely difficult to explain such an obvious ignoring by the Kazakhstan officials of the Russian reaction to the events. Boris Suprunyuk, with his aggressiveness in defending the interests of the Russian-speaking population of North Kazakhstan, has been troubling not only the local authorities for a long time. His actions also have been causing dissatisfaction on the part of Russian officials who deal with Central Asia, and who definitely do not always view the Russians in Kazakhstan as the object of their official concerns.
