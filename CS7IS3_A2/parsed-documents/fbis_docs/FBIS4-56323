Such groups have created big, powerful blocs, regardless of party membership. The rural bloc, for example, is twice the size of the PMBD [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] bloc, which is the largest party in Congress. The bloc of nationalist lawmakers is bigger than the rural bloc, and also much more pluralistic. This bloc is made up of leftist deputies like Haroldo Lima (PC do B) [Communist Party of Brazil], Ernesto Gradella (PSTU-SP) [expansion unknown-Sao Paulo], and PDT-RJ [Democratic Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro] to politicians of such diverse trends as Prisco Viana (PPR-BA) [Progressive Renewal Party-Bahia] and Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front Party-Bahia]. The nationalist bloc has made unfeasible all attempts to end the monopoly of Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. All bloc members consider the oil sector a strategic area. Whenever the interest of some of those groups is jeopardized, their members react immediately. The rural bloc has just prevented the approval of Provisional Measure 457 [MP 457], which established the URV [real value unit] as the basis of the government economic plan. In exchange for support for the Planalto Palace proposal, they demanded the pardoning of the debts that were contracted before the Collor plan. During the negotiations they obtained a promise to reschedule the debts over a five-year period. They rejected the promise, and increased their demands, because they know they can exert even stronger pressure. "There is an excellent environment for group action in Congress," PFL leader in the Chamber of Deputies Luis Eduardo Magalhaes (Bahia) said, adding that he is against the privilege of such groups. Despite his position, Magalhaes joined the group of lawmakers who acquitted PFL Deputy for Pernambuco Ricardo Fiuza in the Constitution and Justice Committee. Fiuza had been charged with irregularities within the Budget Committee. At that moment the influence of those who were indebted could be felt, as a large number of congressmen owe favors to Fiuza. In the opinion of the government leader in the Chamber of Deputies, Luiz Carlos Santos (PMDB-SP), the growth of these groups "is making politics, institutions, and parties unfeasible." According to him, the constitutional reform was a failure because the groups demanded favors in exchange for the approval of important modifications to the Constitution. To make the situation worse, some blocs -- such as the rural bloc -- tried to introduce their demands into inappropriate documents, such as the text of MP 457. Smaller than the nationalist and rural blocs, the Health Parliamentary Front unites congressmen of all ideological trends, and insists principally on the allocation of funds to hospitals that have agreements with the Health Ministry. This bloc joined the rural bloc and made the government decide not to have MP 457 voted on in a plenary session. The rural bloc always reacts by defending its financial interests. In several cases, however, the groups gather around different banners, be they political or religious. The Protestants, a group comprised of nearly 30 congressmen, are always ready to fight for the reestablishment of censorship on all means of communication or to request favors, particularly the allocation of national budget funds to their churches. When Congress was voting on a five-year mandate for then President Jose Sarney, almost all Protestants were given radio stations. Who Makes the Decisions in the Plenary Sessions The multiparty blocs that defend group interests in Congress are: - Nationalists -- 300 members: They affirm they have the majority of votes in the plenary sessions whenever issues that are of interest to them are being voted on. One of their main banners is to preserve monopolies. Their leaders are: Senator Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA), and Deputies Miguel Arraes (PSDB-PE) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Pernambuco], and Haroldo Lima (PC do B-BA). - Bank of Brazil -- 10 members: A small, but influential bloc that always obtains the support of other congressmen when the privileges of the official bank are at stake. Their leaders are: Deputies Augusto Carvalho (PPS-DF) [People's Socialist Party-Federal District], Paulo Bernardo (PT-PR) [Workers Party-Parana], and Paulo Mandarino (PPR-GO) [Progressive Renewal Party-Goias]. - Protestants -- 30 members: In the last few years they have lost some of their power, but whenever the issue being voted on at a plenary session refers to religion or behavior, they still act as a bloc. Their leaders are: Deputies Maviael Cavalcanti (PP-PE) [Popular Party-PE], Costa Ferreira (PP-MA) [PP -- Maranha], and Benedito Domingos (PP-DF). - Judicial Branch, Attorneys -- 10 members: Few congressmen come from the attorneys' offices or the judicial branch, but these sectors are helped by deputies interested in defending their issues, such as Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul], Jose Luiz Clerot (PMDB-PB) [PMDB-Paraiba], and Nilson Gibson (PMN-PE) [National Mobilization Party-PE]. - Rural Bloc -- 206 members: It unites small and large producers in defense of the sector's profits. The group is headed by Deputies Ronaldo Caiado (PFL-GO), Odelmo Leao (PP-MG) [PP-Minas Gerais], and Jonas Pinheiro (PFL-MT) [PFL-Mato Grosso], as well as Senators Ronan Tito (PMDB-MG) and Saldanha Derzi (PRN-MS) [National Reconstruction Party-Mato Grosso do Sul]. - Union Leaders -- 30 members: Comprised mainly of leftist congressmen who began their political careers as members of labor unions. They are led by Chico Vigilante (PT-DF), Pedro Tonelli (PT-PR), Carlos Santana (PT-RJ), and Carlos Alberto Campista (PDT-RJ). - Public Administration Employees -- 10 members: Although they have no expressive power in Congress, their group makes a lot of noise in the corridors. Their main leaders are: "Shi'ite" Maria Laura (PT-DF) and Trotskyist Maria Luiza Fontenelle (PSTU-CE) [PSTU-Ceara]. - National Health Front -- 200 members: They seek to have the widest program possible but have to face dissidence. A group led by Deputy Eduardo Jorge (PT-SP), who is a doctor, charges the front with being an instrument used by Chafic Farhat (PPR-SP), who defends the hospitals' interests.
