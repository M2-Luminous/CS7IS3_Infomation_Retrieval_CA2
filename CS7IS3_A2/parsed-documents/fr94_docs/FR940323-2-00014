FR940323-2-00014 FR940323-2-00012 We also adjusted USP for imputed consumption tax in accordance with the decision made by the Court of International Trade (CIT) in Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993) (Federal-Mogul). In Federal-Mogul, the CIT rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(c) of the Tariff Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the U.S. merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to the foreign market sales (Federal-Mogul at 12). In accordance with the Court's decision, the Department has added to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the U.S. merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department has also adjusted the USP tax adjustments and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and are included in the U.S. merchandise price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment. These adjustments to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent our methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales. This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the basis for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment includes many expenses that are later deducted when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the U.S. merchandise containing more expenses than the price of the foreign market merchandise. The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP ( Zenith Electronics Corp. v. United States, 988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV ( Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. v. United States, 760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991) (Daewoo)). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in Daewoo. No other adjustments were claimed or allowed. Foreign Market Value The Department used home market price, as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, to calculate FMV. Because the home market was viable, we compared U.S. sales with sales of such or similar merchandise in the home market. Home market prices were based on the monthly weighted-average, packed, F.O.B., ex-factory, or delivered prices to unrelated purchasers in the home market. Where applicable, we made adjustments for home market warranty expenses, home market rebates, packing expenses incurred in Sweden, home market credit, and home market inland freight. We further adjusted FMV by adding U.S. direct selling expenses (credit, warranties, and post-sale warehousing and commission expenses). However, since commissions were paid only in the U.S. market, we offset the U.S. commission expenses by deducting home market indirect selling expenses from FMV in an amount not exceeding the amount of U.S. commissions. We also adjusted FMV for imputed consumption tax in accordance with the Federal-Mogul decision as described above, and for differences in physical characteristics. However, because we did not receive the information necessary to support OAB's reported difference-in-merchandise (difmer) amounts, for all U.S. sales to which we matched home market sales of most similar merchandise, we used the largest positive gauge and alloy difmer amounts reported by OAB ( i.e., the most adverse difmer amounts) as the best information available. See analysis memorandum of February 24, 1994 for further explanation. OAB also claimed a tool-setting expense as a circumstance-of-sale (COS) adjustment. Based on information obtained at verification, we determined that because this expense was a manufacturing cost and not a selling expense, it did not warrant a COS adjustment. As a result, we did not adjust for this expense in these preliminary results. See analysis memorandum of February 24, 1994 for further explanation. No other adjustments were claimed or allowed.
