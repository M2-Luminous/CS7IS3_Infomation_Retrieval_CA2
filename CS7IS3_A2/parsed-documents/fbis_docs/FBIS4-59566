"My country has always been pressing for the ban to be lifted," Mr. Watt told a business luncheon. On April 25, the United States said it has accepted a Jordanian proposal on a new land-based system for verifying compliance with the international sanctions, and His Majesty King Husayn said the al-'Aqabah siege was being lifted, after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in London. Mr. Christopher told reporters at a joint press conference with King Husayn that the U.S. had accepted the proposal to have the London-based Lloyds Register verify al-'Aqabah-bound cargo once it is unloaded in the port instead of the sea-inspections, which have caused the Kingdom enormous economic losses. The American decision was followed by a French announcement it was withdrawing from the international forces inspecting the al-'Aqabah-bound shipping. The U.S. confirmation that the siege was being lifted came on May 9, when Washington officially informed Jordan of its acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal. "We were never part of the inspection groups, and Britain never supported the inspection from the beginning," Mr. Watt said. Addressing a group of business people, Mr. Watt said the new process was a sign of optimism for the Jordanian economy, adding that Jordan has become a market which all industries are looking at. "We are beginning to see some signs of hope after the peace process, and people are looking towards a bright future, making Jordan a very attractive market," he added. Mr. Watt said Britain's policy was to encourage he Jordanian market, and to open up other markets in the region, "including Israel."
