With a surprise decision, the Democracy Party [DEP] announced that it was withdrawing from the 27 March local elections. This is how DEP leader Hatip Dicle announced this decision, which was made following a two-day Party Assembly meeting and shocked the political arena: [Begin recording] [Dicle] Following a two-day meeting, the Party Assembly overwhelmingly decided to withdraw from the 27 March 1994 nationwide local elections, in which we were being forced to participate only for show after our wings were clipped under the oppression of the village guards, special teams, soldiers, and police so as not to become tools of these anti-democratic policies that aim at eliminating our people's will. Despite the importance of the elections, our Party Assembly, moved by the consideration to assist in the holding of democratic and free elections, made this decision in the belief that the local elections have now lost their legality and that no other alternative was left open to the party. I hereby announce this to the public. [applause] [Unidentified reporter] May I ask something? [Dicle] Friends, I am making the following request from the reporters: Our party's decision and everything else are found in these [video shows Dicle holding a two-page statement from which he read the party decision]. There is no need for questions. [Unidentified reporter] There is something missing there. [Dicle] No, everything is there. [Unidentified reporter] Is the decision to withdraw in the form of boycotting the elections, or..... [Dicle, interrupting] It is a withdrawal from the elections. This is what the Party Assembly decided. [Unidentified reporter] So, your electors are free to vote for any party? [Dicle] There is no such thing. We had already announced that our party will cast no votes for any of the regime's parties. [end recording] This decision made by the DEP was voted on and adopted after two-day marathon discussions. The DEP's second consultative meeting took place at the very time when all the attention was focused on this party. While the party's provincial and district chairmen, assembly members, municipal candidates, and parliamentary deputies were attending this meeting, the public was still discussing Hatip Dicle's statement on the Tuzla massacre. Before the meeting, there was talk that the wing opposing Dicle was going to raise the question of the party's leader. But, during the meeting the cadre problems were put aside and the proposal to withdraw from the local elections were put up for debate. Though the candidates from the western provinces opposed the decision to withdraw, upper-level party officials put their weight in favor of a withdrawal. And the withdrawal decision was made when 36 members of the Party Assembly joined the leaders.
