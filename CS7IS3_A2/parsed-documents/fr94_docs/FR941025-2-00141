FR941025-2-00141 FR941025-2-00076 [Release No. 34&hyph;34861; File No. SR&hyph;CSE&hyph;94&hyph;08] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Exchange Membership Fees October 19, 1994. On August 16, 1994, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend the membership application fees imposed by the Exchange. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34654 (September 12, 1994), 59 FR 47964 (September 19, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. The CSE is increasing its membership application fees as follows: ␣ 1Item 1Current fee 1New fee Yearly membership dues $2,500 $2,500. (Quarterly Charge $625) ␣ (No change). New Member Application Fee 100 1,000. Transfers: Responsible Party Change 75 350. Firm Registration/Name Change 75 350. CBOE Exercise Application 75 350. The increases apply to the initial application fee, as well as the fee to exercise a Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'') membership. 3 Additionally, intra-firm transfers of individuals assigned to a membership are being raised to reflect the cost of processing the transfers. The Exchange states that the increase in fees will more accurately reflect the costs associated with the processing of applications and will make the fees comparable to those charged by other markets. 3 Pursuant to an agreement signed in November 1986, a CBOE member may be eligible to become a proprietary member of the CSE without having to purchase and own a certificate of proprietary membership ( i.e. , a seat on the Exchange), provided that the CBOE member meets all of the other requirements for eligibility set forth in the CSE's By-Laws. See Article II, Section 5.2 of the CSE's Code of Regulations (By-Laws). The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). 4 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(4) requirements that the rules of an exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members, issuers, and other persons using the Exchange's facilities. 5 The Commission believes that the increases in membership application fees are equitable because the Exchange has proposed the increases to offset rising costs, and the fees do not have a discriminatory or anti-competitive effect. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change. 4 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). 5 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) (1988). It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 6 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CSE&hyph;94&hyph;08) is approved. 6 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 7 7 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
