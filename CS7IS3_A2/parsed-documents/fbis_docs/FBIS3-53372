The newspaper says al-Bashir gave these instructions during his meeting with a Coptic delegation led by Bishop Daniel, head of the Coptic Church in Khartoum. The newspaper quotes al-Bashir's allegation that the government serves all Sudanese, regardless of their religions and creeds!! Several thousand Copts and Christians live in Sudan. They originally came from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and other Middle East countries. The al-Bashir government has recently come under heavy criticism because of its continuing persecution of Christians in the south and the escape of over 100,000 northern Christians to Western states.
