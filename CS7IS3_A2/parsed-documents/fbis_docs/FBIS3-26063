Tang held the first meeting this afternoon with Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary general of SEF, who arrived in Beijing yesterday. Their meeting lasted two hours. The two organizations also agreed that issues concerning economic exchanges between the two sides across the Taiwan Strait should be put on the agenda, tang said at a press conference right after his meeting with Chiao. According to Tang, they reached understanding on two important issues. First, being two authorized non-governmental organizations, the two organs will continue to insist on the unofficial nature of their agreements. Secondly, neither side should force upon the other its political viewpoint through discussions of such issues as "repatriation of hijackers", in other words, political viewpoint of one side should not be included in agreements of the two sides. He said that the understanding would contribute to the discussion of the issue of the repatriation of hijackers. Both sides regarded the framework for a repatriation agreement the two organizations reached in Taipei as a positive beginning. The remaining issue of literal expression should be resolved on its basis, Tang said. "We should avoid sensitive political issues and search for methods of literal expression acceptable to both sides," Tang said. He said that some progress has been made on the issue during their previous talks in Xiamen and Taipei last year. He believed that it is absolutely possible to solve the divergence on the issue with efforts from both sides. Tang said that ARATS, as a non-governmental organization, was not empowered to discuss such political issues as "judicial administration right" and such issues should be avoided in the discussions. Tang said that avoiding the issue is not a matter of disrespect, because he is not authorized to discuss the issue. Now that both sides should avoid sensitive political issues in discussing routine affairs, legal issues no doubt should not be excluded, Tang said. He said that the two organs have decided to set up two groups to discuss routine affairs and some issues concerning economic exchanges. According to Tang Shubei, the Chinese Mainland has drafted a law to protect Taiwan investment, which will be submitted to the National People's Congress for deliberation. "We hope that Taiwan may consider the opinions of the mainland on the basis of mutual benefit," Tang said. Tang said that Taiwan should cancel restrictions on making investment in the mainland and open its market for manufactured or partially-manufactured goods of the mainland and the labor market. Tang said that the possibility of a non-governmental agreement on such issues between ARATS and SEF is not excluded.
