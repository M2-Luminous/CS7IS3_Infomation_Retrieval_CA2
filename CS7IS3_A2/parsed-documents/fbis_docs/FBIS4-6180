The meeting decided to appoint Princess Norodom Marie Ranariddh, chairman of the Central Committee and Her Majesty Norodom Monineat Sihanouk, honorary chairman of the Cambodian Red Cross Federation. On behalf of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, Samdech Chea Sim stressed that this meeting's objective is to set up the Red Cross Federation by grouping the country's three Red Cross organizations: the Red Cross of the State of Cambodia, that of the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), and that of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF). The Cambodian Red Cross Federation was recognized on 24 March 1994 among member countries of the Red Cross and of the Red Crescent. The federation has seven basic principles, taken from the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross), including humanitarian action, justice, neutrality, and independence. The National Assembly Chairman expects that the executive committee of the federation would forge good relations with international circles in order to respond to the Cambodian people's needs.
