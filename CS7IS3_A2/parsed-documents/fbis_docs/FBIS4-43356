With this statement, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at a news conference in Luxembourg warned the governments in Prague, Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Bucharest, and Sofia, which have associate membership agreements with the European Union, against too high expectations from Bonn's imminent EU presidency. Nevertheless, the Federal Government will do everything to lead the six associated partners "closer to the European Union," and knows that Paris and Madrid, which will take over the EU presidency in the first and second six months of 1995, respectively, will do the same, Kinkel said. As far as the plans for nominating a successor to EU Commission President Jacques Delors are concerned, Bonn and Paris will "not ignore the opinion of the smaller member states." The fact that he will not comment on the plans of the two governments to nominate the Belgian Jean-Luc Dehaene at the upcoming EU summit on Corfu can be interpreted as "meaningful silence," Kinkel added cryptically. At the summit meeting at the end of next week, one will also have to clarify whether two representatives of the Parliament of Europe and the governments of Austria and the three Scandinavian EU membership candidates will be involved in a "preparatory group" for the revision of the Maastricht Treaty, the minister said. Only Germany, Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands have so far come out in favor of the participation of the Parliament. According to the four membership treaties, which will be signed on Corfu in a ceremony, the candidate countries will be entitled to participate in all EU Council sessions and in the EU Ambassadors' Committee with a "seat and vote." Italy has raised objections in the EU Council of Ministers against preparing an EU associate membership agreement with Slovenia. Rome and Ljubljana must first settle compensation claims of Italian "expellees."
