Nomura-Jafko [as published] Investment Asia (NJI), the group's investment promotion company, will construct a large industrial complex in Vietnam in cooperation with a local corporation, and will invite into it 100 medium Japanese companies which are trying to cope with the problem of high-yen. Nomura Securities Company will also raise venture funds [preceding two words in English] to procure the necessary funds. In China, Nomura Citic [as published], the group's management consulting company, will help subsidiaries of large corporations establish plants there. The group's operations are drawing attention as they show a new way of helping fund-short medium companies go overseas. NJI and a development corporation in Haiphong, Vietnam, will build an industrial complex of about 170 hectares in the Kuantwan [as published] District in the suburbs of Haiphong. All the required construction costs, which are expected to run to about 10 billion yen, will be borne by the Nomura group, which will then levy rents on the companies to operate in the complex. The companies using the complex are expected to be those making electric appliances and auto parts, for whom the impact from the recent high yen is most serious. This is the first time that a group made up of financial institutions and securities companies will take a lead in constructing an industrial complex in Vietnam. By helping the companies advance overseas, the group can strengthen ties with them, and gain the chances of doing business like brokering fund procurement. A final preliminary survey will be done by the end of this month. With details of the project such as total investments and construction period finalized, a joint venture company to implement the project will be set up in August. Vietnam is expected to open a stock exchange next year. As such, if the Japanese companies to move into the industrial complex form joint ventures with local firms, they will be able to have their stocks listed on the Vietnamese stock exchange. In future, Nomura Securities will raise 10-20 billion yen in venture funds for the companies listed with the stock exchange. The idea is to recycle funds from Japan's institutional investors back into the Vietnamese market and to make the Japanese companies use them as their working funds. In China, Nomura Citic in Beijing is now functioning as a channel for inducing Japanese companies. There is a plan for subsidiary companies of large electric appliance manufacturers to move to Shanghai in a group together. The Nomura group will support the efforts to transfer production bases to China. The reason the medium-sized enterprises want to move their production bases to Vietnam or China is because labor costs in these countries are cheaper than in Japan and because high-quality labor forces can be secured despite this. Some people complain that this can lead to a hollowing out of the domestic industry, but the Japanese companies' transfer of plants to the cheap-labor Asian region is expected to grow to be able to maintain their international competitiveness in the current situation of the yen's value continuing to rise.
