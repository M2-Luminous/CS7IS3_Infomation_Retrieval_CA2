It was attended by M. Farooqi, secretary of the National Council of the Indian Communist Party, Jitendra Sharma, general secretary of the Indian Association of Lawyers, and others. The participants strongly denounced the South Korean authorities for imprisoning and persecuting Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, prisoners of war, for more than 30 years, in wanton violation of the international law, far from sending them back to the northern half of Korea where their families are waiting for them. A letter of protest to the chief executive of South Korea was adopted at the meeting. The letter condemned the South Korean authorities for unreasonably refusing to send Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan back to the North and demanded that they be repatriated without delay so that they may reunite with their families and relatives in the North.
