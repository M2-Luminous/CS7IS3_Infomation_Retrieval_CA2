"Mobilise to bring down the French treason plan. You are Rwandan, you must live or die in Rwanda and not elsewhere," RPF politburo member Jacques Bihozagara said in a statement issued here. The appeal to "general mobilisation" also called on "African countries which want to follow France in carrying out its sinister plan" to think again. "Maybe you have debts to France, but find other ways to repay them than with Rwandan blood," the statement said. Earlier in the day, French President Francois Mitterrand told a meeting of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in Paris that the setting up of the "humanitarian protection force", proposed by France, was a matter of "hours and days". France also wants to involve other African countries in sending to Rwanda a peace-keeping force of some 1,000 to 2,000 soldiers under UN guidance. "Today, France, rounding off its plan, flies to the rescue of the executioners on the run," the RPF statement also said, speaking of France's alleged support for the embattled Hutu-dominated Rwandan government. The head of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] bureau in Brussels, James Rwego, said the text was a "call to take up arms against France on Rwandan territory." If French troops went to Rwanda, they would be considered "a hostile force," he told AFP. He said the statement had been drawn up after consulting RPF officials in Rwanda.
