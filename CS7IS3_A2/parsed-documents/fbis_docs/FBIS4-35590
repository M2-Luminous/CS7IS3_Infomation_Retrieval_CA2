Lebanon was the seat of this organization before the Lebanese incidents broke out. This organization employs a large number of experts as well as locals. Lebanon can benefit from those employees, from the conferences to be held by this organization, and from the studies it will make for the Lebanese state and institutions. The decision to return ESCWA to Beirut was not an easy one, and it required a secret vote. However, I believe that Lebanon is entitled to repatriate this organization since it can provide the academic, scientific, and cultural atmosphere needed for its work. [Correspondent] A report by the UN accuses Israel of stealing Lebanese waters, as is known. What will Lebanon do about it? [Buwayz] This is a very delicate matter. We have repeatedly asked the UN and a number of organizations to thoroughly verify the matter. I cannot say as yet that we have proof that there is direct stealing of water in the south. So far, we have not had any clear reports pointing to that direction. The term stealing of water can be interpreted in various ways. First we have to define if we are talking about subterranean or surface water, underground water or river basins, rivers that originate and pour its water onto Lebanese territory or rivers that originate in Lebanon and flow into other territory. I believe that a careful examination of this matter is essential before taking any decision about it. [Correspondent] The report mentioned the al-Litani and al-Wazzani rivers in particular. [Buwayz] We will study this file thoroughly and we will act accordingly. [Correspondent] Reports say that an informal meeting of the Security Council will be held to discuss Lebanon's complaint against Israel. What can you tell us about Lebanon's activity in this regard? [Buwayz] As you know, despite the suspicions we have about the Security Council's treatment of the Israeli operation in Lebanon [to kidnap Faithful Resistance leader Mustafa al-Dirani], we wanted the Security Council to live up to its responsibilities. We hope that the Security Council will prove that it is still in existence, fair, and still reflects international justice. [passage omitted]
