FBIS3-38204 "drweu020aa_94019" FBIS-WEU-94-020 Document Type:Daily Report 31 January 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS NATO To Send `Partnership' Missions to East Europe AU3001142394 Paris AFP in English 1127 GMT 30 Jan 94 AU3001142394 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Brussels, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is sending two missions to East Europe this week to promote a U.S.-inspired Partnership for Peace initiative for enhanced East-West military cooperation. One mission will be going to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Slovakia, and the other to Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) source said here at the weekend. The job of the missions will be to explain details of the Partnership which was announced at a NATO summit here on January 10, and find out exactly how the East European countries intend to exploit it. The first mission will be led by the German and Danish ambassadors to NATO, Herrmann von Richthofen and Ole Bierring. Heading the second is NATO's assistant secretary general, Gebhardt von Moltke. So far, 15 countries mainly of the former Soviet bloc have said they plan to link up with NATO. But the NATO source said Russia and Ukraine had not yet given a firm response. Romania and Lithuania signed a framework agreement here last week. Poland and Estonia are scheduled to do so this week. Partnership for Peace was devised by the United States to promote military cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet bloc and prepare some of them for membership of NATO at some unspecified future date. But NATO has refused to give firm membership commitments to Moscow's former Warsaw Pact allies for fear of angering Russia. The Partnership involves a menu of participation levels from which each candidate can choose. The options range from joint military manoeuvres, peace-keeping, search-and-rescue, disaster relief, military communications, defence planning, training and the clean-up of old Soviet military bases. The choice depends partly on what each country can afford. Each will be expected to pay the bulk of the costs involved, particularly in modernising their military machines to mesh into NATO activities. Poland has already estimated that its participation will cost 22 million dollars a year. The countries most interested in a deep involvement in the Partnership initiative are those which are pressing hardest for full membership of the trans-Atlantic alliance -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics.
