[passage omitted] [Correspondent] In Stanislaw Shushkevich's opinion: [Shushkevich, interviewed at home] If monetary union is a payment for Russia agreeing to a customs union, I am for a union of this kind. If it is yet another game, and we have monetary union but there will be no customs union, I am categorically opposed to it. [Correspondent] It is true that the political games behind this agreement are quite convoluted. It is interesting that Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich even agrees that the rumors of a political plot in Moscow may be connected with an attempt to disrupt the agreement on monetary union between the two countries. [Kebich, interviewed standing in corridor] It could be, yes. Unfortunately I cannot exclude that. [passage omitted]
