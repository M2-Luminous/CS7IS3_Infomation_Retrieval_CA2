"One should not expect from it better relations and tranquility. On the contrary, the seeds of discord and suspicion have been planted", Gorbachev believes. Initially, there was the issue on an early admission to NATO of new members, but, seeing Russia's disapproval of this possibility, the North Atlantic Alliance "resorted to maneuvering and devised the `Partnership for Peace' initiative." It's clear that NATO has, in fact, not given up the idea of expanding the bloc, he remarked. In Gorbachev's words, "it turns out that in U.S" Russia "is suspected of threatening its neighbors." "That's merely an insult to the people of Russia", the ex president said. In his opinion, a positive response to the concept from Russia's president and government at the recent NATO summit Brussels testifies to the absence of an integral home and foreign policy concept in Moscow.
