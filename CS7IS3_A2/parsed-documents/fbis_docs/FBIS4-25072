The development of Taiwan-funded enterprises in Jiangsu has been very rapid. In addition to labor intensive industries, Taiwanese businessmen have also made investments in high-tech enterprises, infrastructure projects, and tertiary industry in the province. Those Taiwan-funded enterprises which have been put into operation have gained good results. Chairman Wang Daohan and Vice Chairman Tang Shubei fully affirmed Jiangsu's work in improving the investment climate and in providing good services for Taiwan-funded enterprises. Chairman Wang Daohan said: Under the leadership of party committees and governments at various levels, Taiwan affairs offices at various levels in the province have made outstanding achievements in absorbing capital from Taiwan to serve Jiangsu's economic development. In 1992 and 1993, Jiangsu topped the whole country in absorbing capital from Taiwan as compared with the total annual investment by Taiwanese businessmen in other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. In particular, Jiangsu has utilized Taiwan's capital to transform old enterprises and achieved very good results. Accompanied by responsible comrades of the Taiwan Affairs Office of Jiangsu Province, the General Office of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee, and party committees and governments of various prefectures and cities, Chairman Wang Daohan and Vice Chairman Tang Shubei inspected Taiwan-funded enterprises and economic and technological development zones in Nanjing, Yangzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou. They also held discussions with Taiwanese businessmen in Nanjing and Suzhou. Chairman Wang Daohan and Vice Chairman Tang Shubei attentively listened to reports by chairmen of the board and general managers of various Taiwan-funded enterprises. They expressed satisfaction with the production and operation of Taiwan-funded enterprises; and encouraged Taiwanese industrial and commercial people to closely cooperate with entrepreneurs in Jiangsu on a mutually beneficial basis, give full play to the advantages of both sides, and make greater development together. Chairman Wang Daohan asked authorities in Jiangsu to actively adopt measures to serious implement the "Law on the Protection of Investment of Taiwan Compatriots" promulgated by the National People's Congress and make further efforts to protect the lawful rights and interests of Taiwanese businessmen who have invested in Jiangsu. They hoped the authorities in Jiangsu would continue to improve the investment climate; strengthen consultative services for investment by Taiwanese businessmen; and create good conditions for the establishment, production, and operation of Taiwan-funded enterprises. Wang Daohan fully affirmed the preparations for the establishment of associations for Taiwan-funded enterprises in Yangzhou and Nanjing cities. He hoped that other locales with large numbers of Taiwan-funded enterprises would also establish associations for Taiwan-funded enterprises as quickly as possible when conditions are ripe so they can act as bridges between Taiwan-funded enterprises and governments at various levels and serve Taiwanese businessmen in a better way. During their stay in Nanjing, Chairman Wang and Vice Chairman Tang also met with a number of students from Taiwan who are studying at schools of higher learning there, and held cordial talks with them and listened to their opinions. Chairman Wang expressed his welcome to those students who have parted from their parents and come to study on the mainland. He warmly encouraged those students from Taiwan to study hard, welcomed more students from Taiwan to come and study on the mainland, and hoped the younger generation on both sides of the straits would strengthen exchanges. Chairman Wang asked concerned departments in Jiangsu Province to show good concern for students from Taiwan and help them solve their practical problems. Wang Daohan, Tang Shubei, and their party arrived in Jiangsu on 24 May. On the afternoon of the same day, Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee and governor of Jiangsu, met with Chairman Wang Daohan and Vice Chairman Tang Shubei.
