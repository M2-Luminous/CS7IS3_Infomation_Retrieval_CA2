Northern proposes to construct and operate a new delivery point, the Readstown # 1 town border station (TBS), in Vernon County, Wisconsin, to serve the communities of Readstown, Soldiers Grove, Gays Mills, Bell Center, and Mount Sterling (communities that do not currently have natural gas service) and to upgrade the existing Elroy # 1 town border station in Juneau County, Wisconsin, to accommodate increased natural gas deliveries to serve the communities of Wilton and Norwalk. Northern explains that MG&E has requested the installation and upgrade of the delivery points due to the expansion of its distribution system into new areas. Northern estimates that the total cost would be $138,000. Northern estimates that the peak day and annual deliveries of gas at the Readstown TBS would be 1,461 and 150,000 MMBtu, respectively. Furthermore, Northern estimates that the peak day and annual deliveries at the Elroy TBS would increase from 889 to 2,250 MMBtu and from 100,000 to 300,000 MMBtu, respectively. Northern states that the end-users would be residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Northern advises that the increased service would be provided under currently effective transportation service agreements.
