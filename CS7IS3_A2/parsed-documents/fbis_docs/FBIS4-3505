Meanwhile, Beijing yesterday rejected Britain's request for clemency for Xi, saying the incident was China's "internal affair" and that Xi's 12-year sentence for "spying" and stealing state secrets was "appropriate". The protesting China-beat journalists will submit a statement to the Hong Kong branch of the official XINHUA News Agency, China's de facto embassy here, tomorrow. The statement said the journalists were shocked by Xi's imprisonment because Xi's reporting style, which was described by China as "spying", was similar to theirs. They said they were also in danger of being detained. The Chinese government subsidises the press tours. The boycott would last until the end of May, the journalists said. The statement also urged the Hong Kong and British governments to continue following Xi's case and the Chinese authorities to clarify the definition of "state secrets". In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman, replying to British Ambassador to China Robin MacLaren's appeal for clemency for Xi, said: "The Chinese judicial departments' trial of Xi Yang according to law is China's internal affair." The United States has also voiced its concern over Xi's jailing.
