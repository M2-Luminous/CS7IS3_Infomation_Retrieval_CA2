"The developed countries are raising democracy issue and good government as the integral part of development process, mainly in the developing countries," Suharto said opening the leadership meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministry here on Monday. Suharto stressed there is no a single form of democracy which could be applied universally. "Democracy is not a static concept which is limited on the standard forms and practices although it has universal principles and aspects," Suharto said. Suharto said that cultural values and historical experience of every nation are very variable. If every nation is demanded to apply the basic principle of democracy by ignoring the values in inter-nations relationship, this would really deny the basic principle of democracy, Suharto sald. Suharto argued that democracy and democratisation are dynamic process which is harmony with fundamental values of every nation and it is necessary to be adjusted with the developing reality [sentence as published]. "Therefore, democratisation remains relevant with national life," Suharto said. Suharto said that in a such dynamic world, Indonesia and other developing nations are implementing their respective national development. "There is no a single nation that could be developed from outside," Suharto stressed. Therefore, the president added the development of the developing nations must be based on principle of national self-reliance. "However, we are aware that with all fund and capability deployed by the developing nations for their development, it would be difficult to achieve a success if international environment is not conducive. Suharto believes that the advanced and developing countries need to reach a new agreement since almost all international issues are interrelated and have global impacts. "It is time for the North and South to create a new consensus on the international development and establish democratic partnership, especially in dealing with global issues," the president stated. Only this way all nations in the world can reorganize the international economic order to make it fairer and more reliable. On the changing world, he said no country can isolate itself from the prevailing change. Therefore, every nation must improve its capability of understanding the change and adjust itself to the situation, he added. "Adjusting ourselves does not mean that we have to follow whereever the wind blows, but we have to strengthen the positive elements to boost peace and welfare, and on the other hand we have to try our best to avoid the negative elements," the president explained. He said the world is now still far from being peaceful, safe, and prosperous despite the end of the Cold War. Meanwhile, Minister Alatas reported that the meeting lasting until March 26 is attended by 78 ambassadors and representative heads, 20 consul generals, five consuls, an ambassador-at-large, and some senior officials of the foreign ministry.
