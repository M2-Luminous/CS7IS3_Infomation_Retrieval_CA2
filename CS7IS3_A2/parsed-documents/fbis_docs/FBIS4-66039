FBIS4-66039 "drweu103_o_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-103 Daily Report 26 May 1994 CYPRUS Denktas Meets With Boucher, Feissel 26 May Denktas Meets With Boucher, Feissel 26 May NC2605211794 Nicosia BRTK Television Network in Turkish 1630 GMT 26 May 94 NC2605211794 Nicosia BRTK Television Network Turkish BFN [Text] President Rauf Denktas said that the promise that changes would be made in the 21 March document, which violated the package of confidence-building measures to the detriment of the Turkish Cypriot side, has not been fulfilled. He held talks on developments related to the confidence-building measures today with U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher and then with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative. In a statement after his nearly two-hour meeting with Ambassador Boucher, Denktas drew attention to the difference of opinion between the UN secretary general and U.S. officials on the talks. Replying to a question on the difference of views between the UN secretary general and U.S. officials, Denktas said: [Begin Denktas recording] We have been clearly informed [by UN officials] as follows: The United States is the United States. Its representative represents that country. We represent the UN secretary general. We do not interfere in what U.S. officials say. So, do not attach importance to what they say. We are confused because we are wasting hours and days on the matter. We have been trying to explain our case, requests, and problems to the U.S. representative. On his part, he has said this or that. Meanwhile, Gustav Feissel has made various promises. However, he then crossed into south Cyprus and informed the Greek Cypriots that the 21 March document will not be changed. That is not the way to maintain the talks. The United States and Feissel must make an effort to change the document. I mean that the document will be changed if the promises that have been made to us are included in the agreement. A promise has been made to us in that regard. However, it seems that everyone has forgotten that. Well, in that case we cannot be blamed for obstructing the talks. [end recording] Explaining that a promise had been made to the Turkish Cypriot side that the 21 March document, which was added to the original confidence-building measures package but was rejected by the Turkish Cypriot side, would be changed, President Denktas recalled a statement by Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis that his side would object to a reduction in any point. Stressing that the existing confusion must be stopped, he asserted that the Turkish Cypriot side continues to act with goodwill on the package. Regarding the recent map on Maras [Varosha], he said that pressure is still being put on the Turkish Cypriot side to accept it. Denktas said: That is their most serious mistake. However, they are trying to force us to agree to it. Stressing that he drew Ambassador Boucher's attention to Kliridhis' statements that the Greek Cypriots will reach Kyrenia and place the entire island under their control, Denktas said Kliridhis' approach, which is supported by Greece, conflicts with the spirit of the talks and the concept of partnership. [Begin Denktas recording] Kliridhis talked about traveling to Kyrenia and placing the entire island under his control. Naturally, all that cannot be linked with the talks that have been held for so many years and with the establishment of a new partnership republic, which is called for by those talks. Kliridhis has adopted an irresponsible and dangerous approach. Greece has definitely played a role in it. PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] has adopted a resolution for a unitary state in Cyprus. That resolution is common knowledge. Acting in light of that resolution, the Greek Cypriots have decided to allow Greece to establish a naval base in Paphos. That, too, is common knowledge. Meanwhile, we are well aware of the Byzantine tactics the Greek Cypriots have employed to acquire 90 tanks from France. Greece argued that it supposedly scrapped those tanks. However, they can be modernized in France to be used as effective combat vehicles. All those preparations, statements, activities, and steps to join the European Union indicate that the Turkish Cypriot side is not being taken seriously. No one wishes to recognize the conditions that have compelled the Turkish Cypriots to establish their own state in Cyprus. Likewise, no one wishes to realize that the Government of the Cyprus Republic does not exist and that the Greek Cypriot Republic in south Cyprus has been misleading the world into believing that it represents the legal Cyprus Government. I have explained those realities to Ambassador Boucher. They have headed the Cyprus problem in the wrong direction. They have done a great injustice to the Turkish Cypriots for 30 years. No one in the world can force the Turkish Cypriots to accept the Greek Cypriot Administration as their government. [end recording] Replying to a question, President Denktas said that it is very appropriate on the part of Ozker Ozgur, deputy prime minister and leader of the Republican Turkish Party, to send letters to him on the negotiating process. He said that Ozgur outlines his party's views on the confidence-building measures package and the negotiating process in his letters. Speaking after his meeting with Denktas, Ambassador Boucher described the confidence-building measures package as a good opportunity for the two communities in Cyprus and stressed that it must not be missed. Asserting that his country intends to establish the arrangements required for reactivating the process on the confidence-building measures package, Ambassador Boucher said the opportunity for accepting the package has not yet been missed. He also noted that the confidence-building measures package must be maintained and progress must be achieved in the talks with the UN officials. In a statement to the correspondents after his luncheon with Gustave Feissel, which lasted for nearly two hours, President Denktas said that vague points must be clarified so the Turkish Cypriot side can be in a position to reply to the points in the nondocument, dated 21 March. Asserting that another point is also important for the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas said: That is the fact that the nondocument has been converted into a proposal by the UN secretary general. Stressing that an opportunity has been given to the Greek Cypriot side to hide behind the nondocument, Denktas described that approach as a Byzantine design. He noted that the embassies of the UN permanent members in Nicosia are aware of the fact that almost all of the Greek Cypriot political party leaders have rejected the confidence-building measures package. Replying to a question, Denktas said that the UN secretary general's report has not been deliberately postponed and noted that the postponement creates an opportunity for the sides to maintain their work. Denktas also said that certain issues have to be discussed and the benefits that have been promised to the Turkish Cypriot side have to be given a tangible form and outlined in writing. Denktas expressed the hope that the UN secretary general will maintain a balanced approach in his report. Asserting that the Turkish Cypriot side has not arrived at the point where it can say yes or no, Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot Council of Ministers may take up the matter if necessary after he returns from his visit to Turkey. On his part, Gustave Feissel said the points discussed were those that Denktas asked to be clarified or confirmed. However, he declined to explain them. Feissel recalled that the Turkish Cypriot side has been expected to give its reply on several key points in the confidence-building measures package. He noted, however, that the expected reply was not given today. Feissel also recalled that the UN secretary general's report is about to be published and described the present stage in the talks as the latest point reached in the negotiating process. He said that he will inform New York of the developments and noted that he will be in touch with President Denktas before and after the UN secretary general's report is published.
