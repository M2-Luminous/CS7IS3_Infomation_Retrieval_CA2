Consumers have become more price-conscious amid uncertain prospects for employment and income under the recession, MITI said in a commerce survey. Sales in the wholesale sector declined 4.1 percent and those in the retail sector 3.8 percent, both suffering a drop for the second year in a row, MITI said. The annual survey report, called Japan's Commerce, is compiled on the basis of various commerce-related indicators.
