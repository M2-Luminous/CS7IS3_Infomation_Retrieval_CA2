Those who sow the wind, reap the whirlwind. UNITA today got what it deserved. UNITA left several dead bodies behind as others fled in disarray. Today's clashes were the fiercest since the start of the hostilities on 26 May. Military sources with the Angolan Armed Forces Operational Command in Bie Province said this morning that UNITA rebels, who are still in the outlaying areas of the city, continue to receive reinforcements for yet another attack on Cuito. As we file this report, clashes are still in progress and UNITA continues to shell the city. One cannot yet take stock of the human and material losses of the past 24 hours. In view of the unstable military situation, Belgium's Doctors Without Borders and Mr. (Hans Peter), a World Food Program official, left the city of Cuito for Luanda this morning. Mr. (Dominic Henry), delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross for Bie Province, refused to leave the city.
