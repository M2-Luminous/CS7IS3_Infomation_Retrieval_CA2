North Korea's atomic power plants, for example, are known to be equipped with old nuclear reactors, and, accordingly, the danger of accidents is very high. As such an accident will also affect us, special measures need to be taken. Yim Yong-kyu, director of the ROK Technological Institute for Atomic Power Safety, emphasized this at the workshop on ``North Korea's Science and Technology and Prospects for North-South Exchange in Science and Technology'' held on 8 December at the Tower Hotel in Seoul under the auspices of the General Union of ROK Scientific and Technological Organizations. At the workshop, Director Yim stressed ``it is very important and urgent for us to diagnose the level of North Korea's atomic power technology and its safety,'' and added ``however, it is very difficult to grasp the whole picture of North Korea's atomic power as it was hidden for a long time.'' According to Director Yim's research published during the workshop, North Korea initiated its research on atomic power in 1956. After concluding an agreement on atomic power research with the former Soviet Union, North Korea established the atomic power engineering department at Kim Il-song University and Kim Chaek Engineering University and the atomic power research center at Yongbyon. With this as an occasion, North Korea began full-scale research activity on atomic power. North Korea introduced a research reactor from the former Soviet Union in 1965. In the latter part of the sixties, North Korea began developing its atomic power industry, by exploring uranium, mining and smelting ore, processing nuclear fuel, and constructing power plants. At present, North Korea has about 20 atomic power facilities, including a 200 megawatt [MW] atomic power plant now under construction in Taechon, the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon suspected of being reprocessing facilities, and uranium mines. Director Yim said: North Korea asserts that it is developing atomic power to meet its rapidly increasing demands for electricity. However, considering the fact that it has no commercial-purpose atomic power plants, its refusal to accept nuclear inspections, and its development of missiles, this assertion by North Korea lacks credibility. On the other hand, Director Yim expressed deep concern about the safety of North Korean atomic power plants by saying ``North Korea's atomic reactors are old type, graphite-moderated, gas-cooled reactors from the fifties. Fuel rods of such old reactors can be broken easily, and energy accumulated in graphite can be emitted in one shot. This may result in an accident.'' He added: ``If North Korea has pushed ahead with the development of nuclear weapons secretly, the safety issue would not have surfaced due to the peculiar nature of North Korean society.'' Director Yim guessed that ``The reason why North Korea has adhered to using graphite reactors, the safety of which is very low, is because graphite reactors can increase the yield of plutonium and can easily extract plutonium by using the natural uranium they exploit as fuel.''
