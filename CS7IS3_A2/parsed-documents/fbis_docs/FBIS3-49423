In Zagreb, they assessed this measure of the Slovene Economic Ministry as an unprecedented ultimatum and called for negotiations. Irena Majce reports: [Begin Majce recording] Minister Dr. Maks Tajnikar, therefore, kept his promise. His pronouncement that after this synchronization Croatia will no longer receive electricity from Krsko is about to materialize in the next few hours. At least, this is what the minister asserted this morning. The station is expected to receive the final permission for operation today. Following the second request of the power station regarding the modification of chlorine detection, the Republican Directorate for Nuclear Safety concluded that the problem could be temporarily resolved by two hand-operated portable monitors. The ordered and already paid for automatic sensors are expected to arrive in Krsko within six to eight weeks. By extending another two decrees until the halt this summer, the power station now meets the conditions to resume operation. It is expected that it will operate normally, that is to say, it will gradually, with interim tests, reach its 100 percent capacity. Half of the electricity, that is, over 7 million kwh per day, that Krsko has so far produced for Croatia will now be partially used at home while the rest will be exported abroad, that is, to those who will pay for it. Minister Tajnikar communicated this in a special letter to his Croatian colleague last week and added that the neighboring country will be able to get electricity again after 26 January, but only on the condition that it settles its debts by 19 January. Zagreb, in its letter to Ljubljana today, replied that such a measure, which they call an ultimatum, could have grave political and material consequences. They, therefore, reject it, with the proposal that all open questions connected to the nuclear power station be negotiated between the states in a package, and not merely the finances. Minister Tajnikar reiterated today that Slovenia will insist on payment for electricity and that it is initially willing to negotiate on finances only, and on other questions once the financial issues are settled. Most of other issues are supposedly already regulated by Slovene legislation, with the exception of property transformation, regarding which the government has not taken a stance yet. Croatian Energy Secretary Vladimir Kramberger believes that the problem lies precisely in property transformation because he believes that Slovenia is avoiding the preparation of new interstate documents about the power station because it would like to take it over entirely. Croatia still owes 38 million German Marks to Krsko, after it has paid altogether 2 million German Marks on Friday and Monday. Slovenia has settled all of its obligations prior to this change of fuel. [end recording]
