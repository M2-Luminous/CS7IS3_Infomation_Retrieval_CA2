And We Must Not Be Afraid To Say So"] [Text] Russia's close neighbors were wrong to take offense at Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's statement to the effect that the CIS and Baltic countries are the focus of our vital interests and that the main threats to these interests emanate from there. Take Tajikistan at least. The internal conflict and its proximity to unstable Afghanistan generate a host of problems for the whole CIS and Russia in particular. Drugs, weapons, the future of the Russian-speaking population, and the economy cause Moscow concern. The Russian leadership has not hidden its commitment to settling the Tajik crisis, as it has repeatedly stated, by organizing dialogue between the Dushanbe authorities and the opposition. Admittedly, according to our information, that country's government is reluctant to enter into contact with its opponents. And for the moment the Russian Federation's 201st Motorized Rifle Division and Russian border outposts are forced to maintain the defenses. After all, there are no longer any guarded borders beyond them. In the past year alone 350 clashes and attempts at infiltration have been recorded on the Tajik-Afghan border. Some 31 service caps have lain on fresh graves. A similar picture can be painted as far as producing a more stable internal situation in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan is concerned. The latter's border with the PRC has been guarded by everyone. After the latest "demobbing" the Ukrainians and Belarusians went home. The latest draft in Russia produced a tremendous shortfall, and the Kazakhs do not have the forces or the experience to cover many hundreds of kilometers. So the border has come unlocked, and hordes of people from adjacent states are crossing it to enter the wide expanses of the CIS. And not all the "boys" involved have Chinese blouses and slippers in their rucksacks. It is not only Russia that is the destination of this stream of people, but also the west of Europe, including the Baltic countries. There is another aspect to the border problem. The republics of the former USSR have become autonomous and sovereign, and no one is encroaching on their sovereignty. But Ashgabat, Baku, and Tashkent are using a simplified, problem-free procedure to issue Iranians and Turks with visas. Are there Islamic fundamentalists among them? Virtually nothing prevents them then taking a ticket to Moscow. Take another of the "hot spots" -- Nagorno-Karabakh, over which a war is blazing between Azerbaijan and Armenia. What makes Russia take vigorous action in that region? Economic interests on the one hand. And the refugees on the other. Every family must be provided with housing and a means of existence. We are equally alarmed by the influx of mercenaries into the conflict zone from Iran, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and even Russia. There are irregularities in Russia's relations with Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, and the Baltic countries. In some places they are due to internal conflicts. And in others, like Latvia or Estonia, the rights of the Russian-speaking population are being flouted, as even international organizations do not deny. The Russian diplomatic service says that militarily no one poses a threat to us. Sooner or later the question of our troops' withdrawal will also have been resolved. There is no intention of providing Russia's new borders with technical reinforcement. And not just because the state cannot financially stretch to it. The main point is that a security strip and barbed wire cast doubt on the idea of a single economic area and economic union. And who, apart from ourselves, including the Baltic, needs the goods produced at the former Union departments' enterprises? It looks as though the interests and threats that Kozyrev mentioned to his ambassadors are often shared.
