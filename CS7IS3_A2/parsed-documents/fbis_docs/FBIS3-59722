Introduction Though electric power is essential in our present lifestyle, as energy consumption increases, frequent reliance on fossil fuel energy for power has led to problems such as destruction of the global environment and the pollution of urban environments. Thus engines for power generation that prevent these problems are needed. Crucial to this end is the ability to reduce exhaust emissions themselves through the use of motors with good heat efficiency, and the ability to further reduce global environmental pollution from exhaust through the use of clean fuels. Currently, low-speed, two-stroke diesel engines exhibit the highest heat efficiency among commercial heat engines, and LNG is the most promising clean fuel. However since conventional diesel engines were built to run on liquid fuels (light and heavy oils), advantageous use of clean fuels has not been achieved. Amidst the trend of energy resource diversification, since 1978 we have been developing a novel engine, the Mitsui Gas-injected Diesel Engine (GIDE), that allows the use of natural gas with heat efficiency and output efficiency akin to that of conventional diesel engines. In 1985, as part of the Western Australia LNG Project, a gas fueled Mitsui MAN-B&W 6L35MC-GI low-speed, two-stroke GIDE was successfully demonstrated in public. For the first commercial model, gas-related parts for the Holeby 16V28/32-GI (3.52 MW) medium-speed diesel engine were also jointly developed with MAN-B&W Diesel, Inc. (MBD) and entered commercial operation in Denmark in May, 1991. The Mitsui MAN-B&W 12K80MC-GI-S introduced here is the world's first large-scale, low-speed, commercial GIDE in which gas injection technology we have developed on the basis of the foregoing technology and experience is applied to a large-scale, low-speed diesel engine licensed by Mitsui in conjunction with MBD. With a single unit output of 40.7 MW and gross thermal efficiency of approximately 48%, the engine also possesses world class output and peak heat efficiency among current power-generating diesel land engines and is naturally the world's largest gas-fueled engine. Testing and research facilities making use of the engine are now under construction at Mitsui's Chiba site with anticipated completion in July, 1994. Plans call for development of low-speed, gas-injected diesel engines and development and trials of land power plant-related technology, including high-efficiency scrubbers (SCR) for removal of NO<inf> x</inf> from exhaust. A structural description of the engine and an overview of testing facilities are given below. 2. Advantages of Gas-injected Diesel Engines MC-GI engines are based on Mitsui MAN-B&W L/S/K-MC engines, for which considerable practical results exist, and represent enhancements of an engine capable of efficient use of gas fuel as a primary fuel. These engines derive the following superior advantages from their use of so-called diffused combustion systems in which, unlike conventional (low pressure) gas-fueled engines, high pressure gas fuel (250-300 bar) is injected directly into the cylinders, ignited by a small amount of pilot fuel injected nearly simultaneously, and consumed. (1) Achievement of diesel engine-equivalent heat efficiency and output efficiency at virtually all load regions. (2) Excellent responsiveness to load variance. (3) Excellent structural safety eliminating internal leakage of gas fuel into scavenger chambers during the compression stroke. (4) Capability for both a wide range of multifuel combustion of gas and heavy oil fuels, and monofuel combustion of heavy oil fuels. 3. Engine Construction In GI conversion of MC engines, MC engine parts with demonstrated reliability and durability are used without modification as principal structural parts of the engine and structural parts of combustion chambers. Only the following parts are added or partially modified. In other words, the engine is of proven safety and reliability. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show, respectively, a vertical cross section and an outline view of the engine. Table 1 gives principal data for the engine. Figure 1. Mitsui MAN-B Figure 2.

Gas fuel is supplied to the gas compressor under medium pressure, raised to a pressure of 250-300 bar, and directed to the engine's main gas fuel pipes. By way of thin, flexible branch pipes, the fuel is then directed from the main pipes to a valve block in each cylinder attached to the side of a cylinder cover. Valve blocks are internally equipped with an accumulator to prevent a reduction in gas pressure during gas injection, various safety valves that comprise part of a safety apparatus described below, and a pressure converter. Two gas injection valves per cylinder are provided at cylinder covers, and [gas] passes from the accumulator to each gas injection valve by way of a gas pathway inside the cover. Gas injection valves are opened and closed by oil pressure raised by a control oil pump structurally identical to the fuel pump, and a safety apparatus described below ensures that gas fuel is injected only when pilot fuel has been injected. Two pilot valves structurally identical to fuel injection valves for a diesel engine are provided at cylinder covers, and operation proceeds through these valves alone at load ranges during starting and at up to roughly 30%, but at higher load ranges, a small amount of heavy oil A is injected as a pilot fuel used to ignite the gas fuel. Two fuel regulating shafts are installed in the engine to control these two fuels, and the respective regulating shafts are driven by separate electrical actuators that operate under the instructions of a controller controlling the entire power plant. 4. Newly Developed Parts Major newly developed parts for use the gas-injected engine are described in detail below. 4.1 Gas Injection Valve Figure 4 shows an assembled cross section. As seen from the figure, the valve has a previously employed spindle-type structure but differs from conventional fuel valves in the following points. - Regular supply of high pressure gas fuel. - Regular supply of sealing oil - Supply of control oil for spindle opening and closing Specifically, in contrast to conventional automatic valves used with liquid fuels, 250-300 bar high pressure gas fuel is continually supplied around the gas spindle, and injection of gas fuel is therefore controlled by the increase and decrease of control oil pressure. When control oil pressure between the control oil chamber and the gas supply component of the spindle is not raised, sealing oil of somewhat higher pressure than the gas fuel is supplied in order to prevent the gas fuel from infiltrating the control oil chamber. Sealing rings are provided around the outside of gas injection valves to prevent leakage of the high pressure gas fuel. The material of these sealing rings has both adequate sealing properties in the relatively high temperature environment inside the cylinder cover and endurance versus sudden pressure changes. A double pipe structure equipped with drain holes both within gas injection valves and within cylinder covers prevents accidental leakage of gas fuel directly to the outside. The structure of this gas injection valve is identical to that of injection valves for Holeby engines and the Mitsui MAN-B&W 6L35MC-GI supplied for equipment testing in the Western Australia LNG Project in 1985, and has thus enjoyed substantial actual use. The functioning and endurance of this injection valve will also be further checked with a testing apparatus for the gas injection system alone. Figure 4. Cross Section of Gas Injection Valve 4.2 Cylinder Covers Though the structure of the cylinder cover is identical to that of the cylinder cover used with the K80MC base engine, starting valves have been miniaturized and their position changed to accommodate a pair of gas injection valves and pilot valves. Gas injection valves provide capability ranging from a minimum injection quantity corresponding to an approximate 30% load to a maximum injection quantity covering the rated load, but because this engine is used to drive a land power plant, pilot valves consist of fuel valves with the capability to handle only low load ranges extending through starting and conversion to gas fuel operation. The double pipe structure concept has also been applied within the cylinder cover, in the provision of gas drain holes and holes that supply gas to gas injection valves. Valve blocks are bolted to the camshaft side of cylinder covers. 4.3 Valve Blocks Figure 5 shows an assembled cross section of a valve block. Within a valve block are provided a large capacity gas accumulator, emergency cutoff valve, emergency release valve, gas release valve internal to the accumulator, check valve, and pressure transducer for monitoring gas pressure within the accumulator. The volume of the accumulator is sufficient to allow gas injection with combustion unimpaired simply by the expansion of gas fuel accumulated during one stroke, supply of gas from branch pipes until the next injection begins, and maintenance of a constant gas supply pressure. Gas fuel from the branch pipes of each cylinder passes through the check valve provided at the accumulator inlet, enters the accumulator and, during normal gas operation, is directed from the emergency cutoff valve to gas holes within the cylinder cover. When gas operation ends, the emergency cutoff valve closes and the emergency release valve simultaneously opens and immediately releases gas fuel within the cylinder cover into gas drain pipes. A backflow of gas contained within the accumulator by the check valve is released into the gas drain pipes by the gas release valve, and the release of gas fuel from around the engine is completed. A safety apparatus is also provided such that if the gas valve spindle should stick in the open position, or other abnormalities occur, the pressure transducer used to monitor gas pressure within the accumulator detects an abnormal drop in gas pressure, valve operations identical to those at the end of gas operation are carried out, and abnormal gas flow into cylinders is kept to a minimum. Gas fuel sealing components, like other parts, are all of double seal construction. Figure 5. Cross Section of Valve Block 4.4 Gas Supply Pipes Engine gas pipes are all of double construction and consist of main supply pipes, main drain pipes, and branch pipes that connect both sets of main pipes to the valve block of each cylinder. During gas operation, ejectors provided at double pipe outlets continually ventilate the double pipe spacing so that its pressure is lower than that of the engine room. The ends of main gas supply pipes are equipped with check valves and connected to (nitrogen gas) purge lines. As shown in Figure 6, the main pipe internal to the double pipes is supported from the outer pipe at three points to allow free sliding in the axial direction, which counters mechanical oscillation and differences in deformation of the inner and outer pipes due to thermal expansion. Figure 6. Gas Supply Pipe 4.5 Fuel Pumps and Fuel Regulating Shafts Figure 7 shows the location of a pilot oil pump and a control oil pump. The pilot oil pump provides the capacity required to handle injection at starting and up to an approximate 30% load. Naturally, a normal K80MC fuel pump may be used when operation up to the rated load with heavy oil fuel is required, as with an LNG main ship's engine. (tab)The control oil pump has the same basic structure as the fuel pump but has a tip constructed as a safety device to prevent the injection of gas fuel, as shown in Figure 8, if the pilot plunger sticks and pilot fuel injection pressure is insufficient; thus preventing a situation in which only gas fuel has been injected into a cylinder and remains uncombusted. As shown in Figure 9, both pumps are controlled by respective fuel regulating shafts, and the fuel regulating shafts are driven by electrical actuators controlled by a computer that controls the entire power plant (or PPC; programmable process controller). PPC-directed electrical actuator control is as follows. In pilot oil monofuel operation during starting and at low loads, only the pilot regulating shaft is controlled and the control oil regulating shaft is held at a zero position. When the instruction to begin gas operation is issued, control switches to the control regulating shaft and the pilot regulating shaft recedes at a constant speed to a preset minimum injection position where it is held.

Safety Devices Preventing leakage of uncombusted gas fuel outside the engine room and cylinders is crucial for safe utilization of gas fuel. Equally important is the prevention of accidents through essential measures such as early detection of any leakage that does occur, stopping leakage before dangerous conditions are reached, and engine shutdown. To these ends, the following special safety devices are provided in addition to those included in typical engines. Signals from these safety devices are all received by the PPC, which takes actions appropriate to operating status. Tables 2 and 3 summarize major trouble and responses thereto. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Among these, the combustion gas pressure monitor normally monitors the pressure within all cylinders and terminates gas operation mode if the compression pressure or maximum pressure of any cylinder greatly differs from the average for all cylinders. Devices monitoring gas pressure within gas accumulators operate as previously stated. In either case, the change in operating mode is rapid; the valve operation described in 4.3 is carried out within one stroke after detection. 5.2 Exhaust Gas Temperature Deviation Alarm If operation becomes unreliable due to an inadequate gas injection valve seat seal or the like, a small amount of gas fuel will leak into a cylinder during operation. Since the exhaust gas temperature of that cylinder will rise above that of other cylinders, cylinder outlet exhaust gas temperatures are monitored, and a temperature deviation alarm terminating gas operation mode is triggered in such cases. 5.3 Pilot Fuel Injection Failure Prevention Apparatus Gas fuel is not ignited by the rise in cylinder temperature produced by diesel engine compression alone. Thus a small amount of pilot fuel is required as a heat source for ignition and is injected into the cylinders before the gas fuel. However ignition will fail if the pilot fuel is not injected due to a stuck pump, malfunctioning intake valve, or bad pipe coupling connection or the like, and a risk of explosion in the exhaust receiver can result. The pilot fuel injection failure prevention apparatus noted in 4.5 is provided to prevent this situation from occurring. In addition to failed pilot fuel injection, this system also detects pilot spindles stuck in the open position. 6. Power Plants and Pollution Prevention When a diesel power plant is installed in a Japanese city, it must clear pollution regulations governing exhaust gas, warm discharge water, oscillation and noise, etc. Ichihara, Chiba Prefecture, in particular, where this test plant was installed, is a Specially Designated Regulated Pollution Area and the prefecture, city, and company have therefore agreed to special regulatory values. This equipment is designed to satisfy all regulatory values. The adoption of LNG as a primary fuel makes sulfur oxides and soot in exhaust non-problematic, but considerable NO<inf> x</inf> exhaust from this high-efficiency engine itself requires special countermeasures. Thus a catalytic reduction-type exhaust scrubber (SCR) is provided as shown in the conceptual view Figure 10. In a 4-stroke engine produced in 1980, we introduced Japan's first plant combining an SCR and diesel engine and have considerable experience in the field. The development of such large-scale, high efficiency scrubbers is a world first. In general, this type of scrubber is located in an engine supercharger backflow, but in the case of a large 2-stroke engine, the exhaust gas temperature in the supercharger backflow is below the optimal operating temperature range of the scrubber, which is therefore located between the engine and the supercharger in the current test plant. This location results in the denitration of high pressure gas, which is advantageous for allowing greater miniaturization than under atmospheric pressure. Figure 11 shows a full layout view of the test plant. Figure 10. Conceptual View of Exhaust Gas System Figure 11. Full Layout View of Test Plant 7. Conclusion The GIDE introduced here is one solution to future environmental problems that stems from our experience and technical ability as the world's largest producer of large-scale, two-stroke, marine diesel engines. The high heat efficiency of large-scale, two-stroke, gas-injected diesel engines (GIDE) themselves and the use of clean LNG as a primary fuel are expected to bring about future low-pollution power plants using these engines, especially in the form of large-scale plants suitable for suburban installation. For this test plant, we plan long-term operation of several thousand hours per year designed to establish large-scale GIDE-related technology and reliability; looking forward as well to its utilization as a proven, large-scale GIDE power plant incorporating high-efficiency denitration equipment to counter exhaust gas.
