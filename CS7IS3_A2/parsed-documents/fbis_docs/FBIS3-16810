The Estonian Government ruled to cut back from March 11 the time that Ostankino broadcasts are available to viewers in Estonia, after the Moscow television company failed to pay for the transmission of its program on Estonia's national network. The government ruling says the broadcasts will be cut off completely from March 28 if Ostankino by that date has not signed a new agreement with the Estonian Telecommunications Company or has paid its debts for the last months. The step would negatively affect the Russian-speakers' loyalty to the Estonia Government, Estonia's Russian Assembly says. The document also says that the assembly has already called on the respective Russian institutions to resolve the financial problems connected with the transmission of Ostankino broadcasts. The assembly suggests that the Ostankino program be transmitted in Estonia via a cable network. The representative body says a respective agreement together with a financing project should be signed at the level of the two countries' governments. Ostankino owes to the Estonian company about 105,000 German marks for the transmission of its broadcasts in 1993, plus some 80,000 German marks for January.
