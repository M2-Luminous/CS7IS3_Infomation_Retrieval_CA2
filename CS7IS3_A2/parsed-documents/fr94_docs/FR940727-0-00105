FR940727-0-00105 FR940727-0-00025 Figure G&hyph;4. Sample of Doctor Approval Letter Department of the Army, Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, Fort Smith, North Dakota 84165, 15 April 1993 Mr. T. Hudson Taylor, Attorney At Law, 105 Hay Street, Whynot, ND 84167 Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request to depose Dr. (MAJ) J. McDonald, Fort Smith Medical Treatment Facility. Pursuant to 32 CFR §§516.33&hyph;516.49, you may depose him subject to the following conditions: He may testify as to his treatment of his patient, Sergeant Rock, as to related laboratory tests he may have conducted, or other actions he took in the regular course of his duties. He must limit his testimony to factual matters such as his observations of the patient or other operative facts, the treatment prescribed or corrective action taken, course of recovery or steps required for treatment of injuries suffered, or contemplated future treatment. His testimony may not extend to hypothetical questions or to a prognosis. He may not testify as an ``expert.'' This limitation is based on Department of Defense and Army policy prohibiting present or former military personnel and Army civilian employees from providing opinion or expert testimony concerning official information, subjects, or activities in private litigation. See 32 CFR §§97.6(e), 516.42. The witnesses may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public disclosure. To protect the Army's interests, CPT Taylor or another Army attorney will be present during the depositions. To overcome restrictions imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. §552a, Dr. McDonald may not discuss matters derived from the patient's medical records absent the patient's written consent or a court order signed by a judge. A subpoena issued by someone other than a judge or magistrate is insufficient. See Doe v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74 (D.C. Cir. 1985); Stiles v. Atlanta Gas Light Co. , 453 F. Supp. 798 (N.D. Ga. 1978). The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the witness, subject to the approval of his supervisors to be absent during the period involved. Finally, because this is private litigation, the witnesses' participation must be at no expense to the United States. See 32 CFR §516.48. If you have any questions, please call me or CPT Taylor at 919&hyph;882&hyph;4500. ␣␣Sincerely, Robert V. Jackansi, Major, JA, Chief, Administrative Law.
