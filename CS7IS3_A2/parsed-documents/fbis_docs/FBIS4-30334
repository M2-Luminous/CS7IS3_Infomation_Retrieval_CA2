Fujii told a press conference held immediately after the cabinet resigned that he expects the succeeding administration will continue to seek a higher consumption tax and lower income taxes, so as to prepare for the aging society. He said he hoped the final draft on the issue will be compiled as soon as possible in line with earlier plans to create a final version by the end of June. Hata gave up his two-month-old cabinet just hours before the House of Representatives was to convene to vote on a no-confidence motion against his administration. Fujii acknowledged the political turmoil will not be good for the economy which is trying to crawl out of the recession. Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told reporters that the tax issue is already the next administration's problem. But Kumagai said the present administration is willing to wrap up the deregulation plan, which is expected to be unveiled next Tuesday in line with the March market-access program.
