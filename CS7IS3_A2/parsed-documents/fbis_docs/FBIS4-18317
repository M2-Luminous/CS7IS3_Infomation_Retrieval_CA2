After further consideration of the terrorist's move -- and a meeting between Dublin Prime Minister Albert Reynolds and his deputy Dick Spring -- a senior source said: "To say we are disappointed is putting it mildly. Ministers are really annoyed that the IRA did not come up with something more meaningful." Mr. Reynolds, in particular, was understood to have been partcularly angered at the brief length of the ceasefire. Mr. Spring reported after the ministerial exchanges in Dublin's government buildings: "The prospect of people not being killed in Belfast for three days is to be welcomed. ``But at the same time, it is very disappointing. We have been working with the British Government in the context of the Downing Street-Northern Ireland peace declaration to bring about a permanent cessation of violence, and that is not happening." Unless there is a permanent cessation of violence there cannont be any negotation between Sinn Fein and either government.'' Mr. Spring, also the Irish Foreign Minister, said the best chance of progress might now lie with the communities of Northern Ireland: "If people can see over three days what happens without it, they can convince the men of violence it should come to an end." Irish Goverment aides made it clear that Dublin felt there was little more they could now do in response to last night's IRA statement. Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee, said: "We're not interested in ceasefires...I don't think that a tactical pause in murder is something to be welcomed." Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said the IRA move "represents an important initiative" and urged Mr. Major to authorise immediate talks with his party. Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said: "This is a tactic that has to do with placing the IRA and Sinn Fein in a stronger position than they are presently in." John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, said: "It's a very risky road but it's a worthwhile road if the ultimate objective is a total cessation of violence and therefore no stone should left unturned." Prime Minister Albert Reynolds called it "a very small step in the right direction."
