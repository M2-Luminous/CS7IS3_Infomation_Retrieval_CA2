More than 16,000 Russian servicemen have now been mobilized to fulfill tasks in various parts of the former Union. The problem of "peacemaking" has acquired such topicality for our Army that this circumstance was reflected in the "Main Provisions of Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation." As is known, the document defines the main internal sources of military threats, to counteract which the Armed Forces may be used. Such actions are by no means a novelty for the world community. Considerable experience of carrying them out has been accumulated. Thus, since the adoption of the UN Charter (1975), when their legal status was defined, 26 peacemaking operations have been carried out under UN auspices, of which 13 have been completed to date and the rest are continuing. At the same time this problem has not yet been worked out in our military theory -- which is fraught with unjustified combat losses when carrying out actions of this kind. I believe that it now appears possible, on the basis of the accumulated experience, to draw certain theoretical and practical conclusions in respect of the conditions, forms, and means of preparing for and conducting peacemaking operations and the participation of armed forces in them. All the more so because great attention is being devoted to this question in a number of states -- for example, in the United States, the FRG, France, and Britain. Thus, U.S. politicians believe that under conditions of increasing instability in various parts of the world there will be an increasing likelihood of military interference in events which do not attain the scale of a war. This is also confirmed by the main provisions of the new U.S. military doctrine, which is known unofficially as the "Clinton doctrine." Special regulations on the conduct of peacemaking operations are being drawn up in accordance with this doctrine. In principle, a peacemaking action is aimed at settling a conflict which arises and normalizing the situation by peaceful, diplomatic means, without bloodshed. In practice, however, this is not always achieved. While in the buffer zone, the "blue helmets," who are called upon to separate the warring sides and to monitor observance of a truce, frequently find themselves as kind of hostages when the situation becomes exacerbated, as is happening in Yugoslavia, for example -- they fall between two fires. In this instance the UN Charter (Article 42) does not rule out the use of strong-arm methods to restore peace. But in our case, as already stated, a great deal in this matter has not yet been settled. It is, above all, necessary to settle legal questions within the CIS relating to the conduct of peacemaking actions and to elaborate and realize in practice the main principles for building and utilizing both Russian and interstate, coalition peacemaking forces of the CIS. To this it should be added that the problem of carrying out peacemaking operations concerns not only the specialized peacemaking forces but also other troops which under certain conditions can also be drawn into the maelstrom of crisis events. Let us recall tragic events in the USSR, particularly in Tbilisi (1989), Vilnius (1990), Baku (1990).... The sending in of troops to resolve the crisis that had arisen not only did not yield the desired result, since it had no legal basis, but also elicited an extremely negative reaction in society and helped to fuel anti-army hysteria. That is, practice has shown that troop forces, just like law enforcement organs, are not in themselves capable of eliminating a crisis situation caused by political, economic, social, ethnic, and other contradictions. They are only capable of creating the necessary preconditions for normalizing the situation. Which principles, by which we should be guided in the use of peacemaking (troop) forces to resolve a conflict situation, have been formulated to date? The principle of legality should be numbered among them above all. This principle requires the personnel of the peacemaking forces to know well and carry out most stringently the legal norms and legislative acts laid down for operations in an emergency situation and to infringe in no way the freedom of the individual or human rights. This predetermines the conditions and limits of the use of physical force, special means, weapons, and combat hardware to maintain public order. Complying with the principle of preventive-precautionary actions means envisaging measures well in advance and taking them in time so as to prevent the development of a conflict situation, while at the same time managing, as far as possible, without the use of strong-arm methods and relying on the mechanism of talks. But moderation [mera] is needed here -- tolerance and indecision must not be manifested when the situation starts to get out of control and illegal forces go over to armed violence. The success of a peacemaking action further depends on the thoroughness of its preparation. The Americans believe, for example, that it takes at least four to six weeks of intensive exercises and individual drill and training sessions to prepare subunits of the peacemaking force. The important principles also include the principle of efficient cooperation between the peacemaking forces and the local administration, law enforcement organs, and internal troops of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. Thus, the nature of the peacemaking forces' operations in a conflict zone depends on many circumstances. In some cases they assist the local administrative and law enforcement organs and MVD internal troops to ensure the maintenance of public order and public security. In others they bear the brunt of normalizing the situation in a region in the grip of combat operations. In the event of the exacerbation of a conflict, when it assumes the form of an armed confrontation, the peacemaking forces must take control of the development of events so as to stop insurgent actions in time, to prevent the seizure of weapons by gunmen, and to avert acts of terrorism, shooting, and attacks on state establishments, the population, military camps, military columns, railroad trains, etc. The package of measures to be implemented in this case can conventionally be divided into three types: reconnaissance actions to expose illegal groupings, gunmen, and bandit formations; precautionary measures taken for the purpose of patrolling, cordoning off, and monitoring road traffic; strong-arm measures conducted to search for and disarm gunmen and bandit formations and, in case of resistance, to render them harmless. At the same time it should be emphasized once again that a peacemaking action which takes the form of combat operations against illegal armed formations can only be justified if there is no alternative to it. It is understandable that in this case the actions of the peacemaking forces are highly specific. What is needed here is a special tactic, which we also have not yet elaborated. Although it is possible to make certain recommendations on this score on the basis of an analysis of the existing experience accumulated in Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan, Abkhazia, and the Dniester region. So, on arriving in a conflict zone, it is important for the commander of the peacemaking forces to establish contact primarily with the local administration, the law enforcement organs, and the temporary operations group of the Internal Affairs Administration in order quickly to gather data on the operational situation, analyze them, and adopt a decision on implementing the necessary measures for the peacemaking forces' participation in ensuring the legal regime of the state of emergency. In a number of instances it will at once be necessary to create special reconnaissance and search groups for helicopter patrols of the terrain and monitoring of traffic on roads and in population centers. By analyzing the operational situation which has taken shape in the zone of responsibility, it is necessary to make a forecast: how the crisis situation might develop further, what new hotbeds of tension might arise, what is the composition of bandit groups, their armament, their base regions, their operating tactics, and their control and support system, what are the sources of reinforcement and supply, what is the local population's attitude toward them. In particular, it is known from experience that uncoordinated detachments of 100-160 gunmen armed with assault rifles and pistols are created in a conflict zone at first. Centralized leadership of the gunmen's actions is organized subsequently, individual detachments unite into larger formations, base regions, training centers, and dumps are created, weapons are accumulated, including heavy weapons, and a system of observation and identification is established over an extensive territory. Gunmen usually employ the tactics of partisan operations and periodically carry out night sallies and surprise raids, chiefly against weapons dumps and military camps. The chief purpose of their actions is to acquire weapons, means of transport, and ammunition. Depending on the nature of the gunmen's actions and their equipment and training, the decision is made to carry out a special operation for the purpose of rendering them harmless. One of the most widespread tactical methods used for this purpose is the search. It is carried out in those cases where the gunmen's exact base has not been established and only the approximate area of their operations is known. Therefore ground and air (helicopter) reconnaissance is primarily organized. Special groups are created for a search, and their actions are backed up chiefly by combat helicopters. The pace of a search on a moderately rough semiopen terrain is of the order of 1-1.5 km per hour. As the gunmen's location is established, the decision to comb the terrain might be adopted for the purpose of rendering them harmless. Combing can be unilateral and bilateral (from opposite directions). The starting point and the finishing point (meeting point) on a terrain offering concealment are set for subunits, and, in addition, the direction of movement is defined. When combing, subunits at first advance in a column and are then deployed in a chain, with intervals of 12-15 meters between servicemen on semiopen terrain. It is particularly important to provide for security measures and to establish clear mutual identification signals. If, when a detachment of gunmen is detected, it offers active resistance and there prove to be inadequate forces and means for an immediate rout, then it is expedient to organize blocking by means of erecting obstacles so as to neutralize its actions. Given a favorable situation, the bandit grouping is surrounded and subsequently broken up and routed. The most acceptable tactic for rendering harmless a large, well armed bandit formation operating over an extensive area can be the tactic of search and strike operations according to the "seek and disarm" ("destroy") principle. In this case active air and ground reconnaissance conducted over a wide front is combined with a prompt strike by helicopters and airmobile detachments (groups) landed in the region of operations against the groupings of gunmen which have been brought to light. The decision to rout a bandit formation includes the selection of the most dangerous groupings to be rendered harmless first of all and the determination of the combat structure and modi operandi of the reconnaissance and search, strike and fire, air assault (airmobile), raid landing, and blocking detachments (groups), of the means of organizing killing zones [ognevyye meshki], ambushes, and obstacles, and of the system of control, cooperation, and support. This is just a small proportion of the questions connected with the preparation and implementation of peacemaking operations. Information to ponder, you might say. But it can be seen from this that the practical preparation of the peacemaking forces is a problem which concerns the Armed Forces to one degree or another.
