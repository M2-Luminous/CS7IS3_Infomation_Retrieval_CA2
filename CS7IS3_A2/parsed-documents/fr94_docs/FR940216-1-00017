FR940216-1-00017 FR940216-1-00008 The term ``Plan of operations'' would be added in order that one standardized term can be used throughout this part to describe the various documents authorizing mineral-related operations conducted pursuant to 36 CFR part 228 or 36 CFR part 292, subpart D. The term ``Scenic easement'' would be added to support two proposed rule additions at 36 CFR 261.9(i) and 36 CFR 261.10(r) which provide for the enforcement of requirements or prohibitions associated with such easements. Section 261.3␣Interfering With a Forest Officer, Volunteer, or Human Resource Program Enrollee or Giving False Report to a Forest Officer As currently written, this section prohibits interference with a Forest officer, interference with a volunteer or human resource employee, and the giving of a false report to a Forest officer. It is proposed to revise the section's heading to read ``Interfering with agency functions'' for clarity and brevity. Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to combine the two ``Forest officer'' and ``volunteer'' interference rules currently found at paragraphs (a) and (c) into a single prohibition. Existing paragraph (b) would be revised for clarity. Two additions are proposed for this section. A new paragraph (c) is proposed to support on-site control of the public and maintain order during firefighting, law enforcement, or other operations. A new paragraph (d) is proposed to prohibit the impersonation of Forest officers, volunteers, or human resource program enrollees. At present, the only option available to the agency is to prosecute an impersonation as a felony (18 U.S.C. 912). The proposed regulation would provide the opportunity, where appropriate, to treat these cases as misdemeanors, rather than to proceed under felony statutes. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.4␣Disorderly Conduct The proposed changes to §261.4 result from situations encountered by Forest officers, usually in developed recreation areas, that require immediate attention such as breach of the peace or other illegal activity which, if not resolved, threatens the health, safety, rights, or enjoyment of forest users. Usually, Forest officers encounter these situations due to the unavailability of State or local authorities to patrol recreation areas. Often Forest officers are the only recognized authority with law enforcement responsibilities that the public may encounter. In other cases where State authorities do perform patrols, they may not be in a given location when law enforcement action must be taken, requiring Forest officers to initiate action until the State or local authority can arrive. The above scenarios are occurring routinely in some Forest Service recreation areas, and while the agency has the authority to regulate activity of this nature, it has no current regulations on which to support actions being taken by employees. The section heading would be revised to read ``Public behavior'' to encompass the broader area of prohibited conduct included in the proposed rule. Existing paragraph (a) would be revised to include the words ``or any other violent behavior'' in addition to prohibiting ``fighting.'' Existing paragraph (b) currently prohibits ``offensive, derisive or annoying communication.'' The proposed revision of this paragraph is a narrower approach, identifying with more specficity the types of language or action that is prohibited and adding the element of intent to cause, or knowingly or recklessly creating the risk of, public alarm, nuisance, jeopardy or violence. Existing paragraph (c), which prohibits making ``statements or other actions directed toward inciting or producing imminent lawless action'' would be removed, as this provision would be covered in revised paragraph (b). A new paragraph (c) is proposed to prohibit the possession, selling, cultivation, dispensing, or bartering of controlled substances, alcoholic beverages, or contraband if such acts are a violation of State or Federal law. While the Forest Service has the authority to investigate controlled substance violations under the National Forest System Drug Control Act of 1986, as amended, and make arrests under that Act, it may not be practical to prosecute all as felony cases, such as the possession of small amounts of controlled substances intended for personal use. Therefore, the agency proposes to establish a rule which provides for a misdemeanor penalty. Alcoholic beverages have been included as the agency is currently without a rule prohibiting underage consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages in violation of State or Federal law on the National Forest System. Forest Service regions report continuing problems in both developed and undeveloped areas pertaining to large ``keg'' parties and other parties where underage alcoholic consumption is occurring. In many cases, State and local officers are unavailable to take the necessary enforcement actions in order to protect other forest users who are affected by this problem. The rule would also prohibit the possession of contraband (i.e. where the very possession of an item is illegal, as defined by either State or Federal law). Some examples of included items would be certain animal parts or unregistered automatic weapons. A new paragraph (e) would be added prohibiting ``being under the influence of any controlled substance or alcoholic beverage,'' if it is a violation of either State or Federal law. This would be a companion rule with the proposed new paragraph (c) and is needed for the same reasons. Finally, new paragraphs (f) and (g) would be added to allow for federal prosecutions of persons who victimize forest visitors or other persons and their property on the National Forest System. No other revisions are proposed to this section. Section 261.5␣Fire One change is proposed to this section. As written, paragraph (b) prohibits the firing of tracer or incendiary ammunition. The wording of the paragraph requires that a Forest officer must prove that a person actually ``fired'' the ammunition, something that is very hard to do. Accordingly, this prohibition would be expanded to prohibit the possession of tracer or incendiary ammunition as well. The possession of tracer or incendiary ammunition on the National Forest System can be harmful to persons as well as resources and is clearly not within the public interest. If persons are prohibited from possessing such ammunition, there is less likelihood of it being fired. Section 261.6␣Timber and Other Forest Products Existing paragraphs (a) and (h) would be revised to include the term ``approved plan of operations'' and ``permit'' as exceptions to the stated prohibited acts.
