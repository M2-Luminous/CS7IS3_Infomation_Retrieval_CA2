FBIS4-24264 "drafr124_c_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-124 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 28 Jun South African Press Review for 28 Jun MB2806130694 MB2806130694 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Mining Woes -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 28 June in a page-16 editorial notes South Africa's "need to wean itself away from its mining roots," since old mines "cannot survive soaring cost pressures without a gold price that is galloping ever upward." The "unfortunate consequence" is that many jobs are being lost, but now is the time to make the adjustment while there are "(hopefully) improved job opportunities flowing from embryonic economic revival and heightened expenditure on social infrastructure." MPs Privilege List -- A second editorial on the same page states that "it is entirely right" to cut free flights for former parliamentarians. "The big problem is the parliamentarians of the present, whose privilege list grows longer by the day and whose own free flight schedule has just been magnified. They should rediscover that their role is as public servants, not public parasites." BUSINESS DAY Mine Closures -- The impending closure of the Durban Roodepoort Deep gold mine "will have devastating economic and social effects" on those who are dependent on the remittances of migrant workers employed at the mine, says a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 28 June. "None of this, though, would justify a permanent and probably growing subsidy to a mine which has done what all mines eventually do -- reach the end of their natural lives. A subsidy would set a precedent for state assistance to numerous other lossmaking, marginal enterprises, outside the mining industry too." However, there should be "routine but comprehensive contingency planning to mitigate the effects of decline and closure in the industry." This should be the responsibility of "mine managements and other stakeholders -- including employees and adjacent local authorities -- at enterprises which are still going concerns to begin this work now." BEELD Kasrils Appointment a Mistake -- "Up to now President Nelson Mandela has treated appointments in and around the cabinet with great sensitivity," notes a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 27 June. However, "with the appointment of Mr. Ronnie Kasrils as deputy minister of defense, Mr. Mandela has made his first significant mistake." The integration of the South African National Defense Force is a "difficult process" which has to be handled "with great caution" since there are already danger signals in this regard. "If the individuals and component parts of the new defense force do not have confidence in the leadership and the process, the defensive shield could become a threat" since the political heads of this integration are both two former top figures of Spear of the Nation, the ANC military wing, with little known about their underground activities, even though an investigation "has pointed a finger at Mr. Modise." Mr. Kasrils's role in the Bisho massacre is "too well known, but further we don't know for which murder and maiming he has been responsible." "The appointment of a hardened communist in a key portfolio such as defense will shock many. One wonders what the international world will think while South Africa is urgently seeking investments." "We do not believe that Mr. Kasrils's appointment will promote reconciliation and national unity." Confusion Over Amnesty Law -- A second editorial on the same page says "last week the Ministry of Justice announced that 63 prisoners were released. Among them were four very controversial former policemen who were released on the basis of the Law on Further Amnesty, despite having been found guilty of murder. It would appear as though the amnesty order in question had already been signed by former President F.W. de Klerk even before the election, after which it was discussed with the new minister of justice and the new cabinet." Meanwhile, the new justice minister and Mr. Mandela are distancing themselves from this decision. "Such a situation is untenable" because if each amnesty case -- intended to bring about reconciliation -- has to be "accompanied by such controversy and discord" then it would be "better to suspend the whole process."
