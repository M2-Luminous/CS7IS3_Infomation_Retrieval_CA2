'Ammar al-Musawi, deputy head of the Hizballah political bureau, told MENA in Beirut today that the present visit to Damascus by a party delegation is part of the constant consultations and meetings with Syrian officials to discuss local and regional developments. He denied that the meetings seek to make any contacts or arrange meetings with the members of the Congressional delegation visiting the Syrian capital at present. Asked whether Hizballah has agreed to let Syrian officials act as mediators between Hizballah and the Congressional delegation to discuss the missing Israeli soldiers, al-Musawi said: The brothers in Damascus have not approached us about the possibility of holding a meeting with the Congressional delegation or about their readiness to mediate in the matter. Al-Musawi pointed out that the party has no objection to discussing the issue of the missing Israeli soldiers provided that the discussion is conducted through UN-affiliated humanitarian organizations, like the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Human Rights Organization. He said that the party has repeatedly emphasized that it has nothing to do with the missing Israeli pilot Ron Arad. All we have are two Israeli soldiers who were taken prisoner in 1986, he said. The Hizballah official said the U.S. Administration and Congress are biased toward Israel and hence not qualified to discuss the issue of the missing Israelis, particularly since they both totally ignore the issue of the missing Lebanese nationals and the detainees in Israeli prisons. The Congressional delegation arrived in Damascus yesterday from Tel Aviv to discuss the fate of a number of Israeli soldiers who are missing in Lebanon, in the wake of a promise by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad to U.S. President Bill Clinton to facilitate the U.S. team's visit. Reports have noted that the U.S. team arrived in Damascus at the same time as a senior Hizballah delegation was visiting the Syrian capital. Both sides, however, denied holding meetings. Lebanese newspaper AL-SAFIR today reports that the Hizballah delegation had returned to Beirut the evening before last. However, AL-SAFIR adds, the party delegation returned to the Syrian capital yesterday in the wake of high-level contacts held yesterday morning. Meanwhile, official Lebanese sources refused to comment on the possibility of a visit to Beirut by the U.S. Congressional delegation to meet with Lebanese officials. The sources stated that no arrangements have been made for such a visit.
