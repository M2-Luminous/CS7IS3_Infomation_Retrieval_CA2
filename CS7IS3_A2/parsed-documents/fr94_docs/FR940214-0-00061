With the advent of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), we have found that more emphasis must be placed on analyzing persons whose incomes qualify for LIHTC. This means families who earn 60 percent or less of the median income as established by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Therefore, feasibility for projects expecting to receive tax credits will also be based on the incomes required to support the tax credits. This could mean a level of incomes either slightly lower or higher than FmHA very low-incomes. For those tax credit units occupied by low-income families, the monthly gross rent cannot exceed 30 percent of the family income. Gross rent includes utilities, but excludes payments of rental assistance by Federal, State, and local entities. The applicant will be responsible for notifying FmHA and the market analyst of the amount of tax credits being requested, the income percentage on which the credits will be based, and the percentage of project units targeted for tax credit eligible persons. In those cases where less than 100 percent of the units will be designated for tax credit eligible persons, the incomes needed to support the non-LIHTC units will need to be analyzed. Income data will be shown for total and renter households. This information will be presented as follows: (It is recommended that decile distribution of incomes be obtained from HUD. Other sources are acceptable and must be identified.)
