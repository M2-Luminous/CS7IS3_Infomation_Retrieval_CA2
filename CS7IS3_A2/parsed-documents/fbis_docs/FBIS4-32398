Karoly Szunyogh, the head of the President's Office, said the document is based on the country's interests and establishes all conditions of parliamentary democracy. Secretary-General of Parliament Istvan Soltesz announced that a draft proposal will be completed by Monday [27 June], in which each parliamentary faction enlists who they wish to delegate to the committees. Under the agreement, the Speaker of Parliament will be nominated by the faction that holds the majority of mandates, i.e. the Hungarian Socialist Party. The six groups suggest that the new Parliament elect three deputy speakers: from the Alliance of Free Democrats, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, and the Independent Smallholders' Party, respectively. The new Parliament will have 17 committees: 13 permanent and four special ones. The Socialists will chair 9 committees, the Free Democrats three, and the four opposition parties will preside at five. The four opposition parties of the new Parliament will get 12 deputy chairman posts on 17 committees, not nine, based on votes in the elections, not proportions of deputies. Viewing the chamber from the Speaker of Parliament's pulpit, the six parliamentary groups will be seated from left to right: Hungarian Socialist Party, Alliance of Free Democrats, Hungarian Democratic Forum, Independent Smallholders' Party, Christian Democratic People's Party, and Federation of Young Democrats. The farthest section on the right-hand side will be left vacant. Under the rules of Parliament, candidates for parliamentary posts are proposed by faction leaders, and the list of candidates is to be presented to the deputies by the chairman of seniority. In the last part of the document, parliamentary group leaders fix that the agreement comes into force only if the Socialists and Free Democrats form a coalition, and lapses if they split up. The June 28 founding session of the new Parliament will be opened by President Arpad Goncz, followed by Prime Minister Peter Boross's announcement of the ending of his cabinet's commission. But Boross and his ministers are to keep their offices until the establishment of the new government.
