On Wednesday [30 March], well-informed circles referred to Germany's immediate interest, in view of scientific-technical cooperation with both countries in the field of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Peter Kurt Wuerzbach, disarmament policy spokesman of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group, talked of a further important step to strengthen nuclear nonproliferation. Moreover, according to his information, Argentina, which, like Brazil, has not acceded to the Nonproliferation Treaty so far, announced that it wants to accede to the treaty. Precisely against the background of the topical discussion on access to the nuclear facilities in North Korea, the CDU/CSU Bundestag Group regards this development as significant progress and an important contribution to stabilization and confidence-building in the region, the politician stressed. IAEA spokesman David Kyd had announced in HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that the control agreement with Brazil and Argentina will come into force in late spring and the first inspections can take place in the middle of the year. Above all German-Brazilian cooperation in the nuclear sector, which was initiated in the seventies, continues to be controversial. The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] repeatedly called for its abandonment because it feared that Brazil might work on the military use of nuclear power. This was repeatedly denied by the Federal Government. Originally, the German power plant builder Siemens-KWU [Kraftwerksunion] was supposed to build eight nuclear plants in the country. So far, the first plant "Angra II," whose construction was started as early as in 1976, has not yet been completed because of domestic policy problems. The enterprise supplied the power plant "Atucha" to Argentina.
