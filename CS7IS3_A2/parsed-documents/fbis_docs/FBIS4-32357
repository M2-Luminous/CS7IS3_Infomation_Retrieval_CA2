He said the government's failure today to support the bill, put forward by ODA Deputy Chairman Jan Kalvoda, was the result of excessive procrastination with regard to the material, which had been at the government's disposal for a long time. Unwillingness to discuss the material was also the result of some coalition parties being unable to form an opinion on the issue. "I could show most evidence of this inability in the Civic Democratic Party (ODS)," Kuzilek said. Chairman of the Deputies' Group of the Christian Democratic Party (KDS), Marek Benda, said the government's decision could have been expected. "There were fairly substantial reservations towards the material, and from different coalition parties," he told journalists. The fact that the government was going to discuss the problem again next week was a signal that there was, however, a will to finish dealing with it, he said. With regard to speculation that the government might suggest shifting the deadline of June 30 by which it had undertaken to put a bill on the matter before parliament, Benda said he did not believe the KDS would consider June 30 uncrossable. While KDS leaders would be willing to consider putting back the deadline, they were not able to consider rewriting the constitution. "For us, the constitution is a law which we intend to honor," Benda said.
