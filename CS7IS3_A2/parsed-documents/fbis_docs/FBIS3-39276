Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta seemed less happy about certain "toxins" that the international situation could cause to circulate in the organism of Italian politics. He thus described as "crazy" the ideas of those making "territorial demands" vis-a-vis the former Yugoslavia. They include Gianfranco Fini, the National Alliance leader, who has spoken about the "historical rights" of Italians in Istria. Andreatta demanded peremptorily of those who have reached electoral agreements with the National Alliance, first and foremost of [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, that they "immediately sever any joint responsibilities." This, because "in the event of a victory by the right, the world's governments will perceive the most dangerous sign of a complete turnabout in Italian foreign policy" and in the country's international position. "I do not believe," Andreatta concluded, "that Berlusconi likes the role of Italy's [Russian nationalistic leader] Zhirinovskiy. He must see to this while there is still time." [passage omitted] [Fabiani] Minister, some people still believe that the ultimatum issued to the Serbs will not be implemented, that Europe will exploit any sign of amenability to refrain from using force. [Andreatta] To fail to honor the commitment made would entail a very high cost. It would jeopardize NATO's credibility far beyond the Bosnian question. But everyone now is convinced of the need to act. The likelihood of success has improved. Now it is important to maintain this pace, to avoid falling back into the swamp of unproductive diplomatic activity when everything deteriorates, and again paying the cost to our nerves of our action in recent months. [Fabiani] Why are you now less [as published] optimistic or, if you prefer, less pessimistic, about the chance of halting the war in Bosnia? [Andreatta] First, because of the rapprochement between the United States and Europe. This was achieved when the French said that their country's honor would not permit them to keep their men in Bosnia as blue helmets without taking action. For a moment France and the United States were close to a confrontation. Then, faced with the threat of Paris' withdrawing its troops, the American administration realized the implications of a split with its allies. The diplomacy of the Twelve also helped to persuade the Americans. This 24-handed approach scored its first success since the Maastricht Treaty, after several attempts. A part was also played by France's traditional tactic of pushing its relations with Washington to the limit. The public in the various countries, shocked by the pictures shown in the media, also greatly influenced the decision to take action. [Fabiani] Will it be possible to overcome Russia's objections? [Andreatta] Despite Zhirinovskiy and despite the blackout in communications with Washington that lasted a couple of days, Russia has never sought a rupture, not even at the worst moment. I felt this clearly when I met in Geneva with Deputy Minister Vitaliy Churkin, and I explained to him the rationale behind the decision that NATO was reaching at that very moment. [Fabiani] But has anything changed between the warring parties? [Andreatta] Some positive signs, some more rational attitudes, can be seen here too. The sanctions against Serbia have not yet caused a final crisis for the government, but economic normalization is now a serious objective for Milosevic. And during the latest elections he has also rid himself of the extremist nationalism represented by Seselj. The Croats felt that Bonn's support had weakened. Tudjman now seems more moderate. Then there are the Muslims. Within the space of a few months a near-miracle has taken place -- the creation from nothing of a Bosnian military force comprising 200,000 men. On the one hand this sets back a long way the plan to totally eliminate the Muslims, which some people were nurturing. But, on the other hand, it could prompt the Bosnians to form too optimistic an assessment of their own strength. But now the Americans can recommend realistic objectives to them. [Fabiani] What do you think of the Serbian threats of retaliation against Italian territory? [Andreatta] That is a problem for the Serbs. It is our problem too, of course, but it is their problem first and foremost. Relations between the two countries are fair. I do not think that they could be jeopardized by some carelessness on the part of Belgrade's secret services -- which are in fact fairly efficient -- with respect to Serbian terrorist groups. [Fabiani] Are you satisfied with the Italian public's response to events in the former Yugoslavia? [Andreatta] At present our country is threatened by the most brazen form of videocracy. The media are no longer an expression of public opinion but a training forum for politicians. So there has been excessive reaction, though some commentators well-informed about international matters have tried to contain these reactions within more correct limits. [Fabiani] What is your opinion of the political debate on foreign policy matters? [Andreatta] The territorial demands put forward by the National Alliance raise some very serious problems concerning the possibility of a country's continuing to be a trustworthy partner in foreign policy. To claim "historic rights" in Istria could prompt the same dismay in Europe as the German neo-Nazis prompt when they talk about Sudetenland or German Silesia. I expect Fini's allies to sever all responsibilities and to break all electoral links too. Otherwise this creates a major grouping that has some chance of forming a majority and therefore of leading the country, and that embodies some crazy ideas. We must create scope for the voters' sense of reason, so that they will not vote for fairy stores, not vote for "beautiful." [Fabiani] But do Italian politicians think of citizens only as voters? [Andreatta] Generally, this is so. It is no coincidence that some people want to prevent the citizens that they do not like from expressing themselves, as in the case of postal votes for Italians abroad. [Fabiani] Minister, you seem to have formed an enthusiasm for what is a new job for you. Would you agree to stand for a possible second term at the same ministry in the next government? [Andreatta] I am optimistic by nature. So I can even envisage a victory by the moderate center, however unlikely it may seem. If that did happen, I would certainly accept.
