According to Illanes, there is an oil and gas potential of 53 percent in the 386,000 square miles of national territory, and it is considered that only 15 percent of that area has been explored and developed. He described the petroleum as light, and noted that there are extensive fields with natural gas deposits. He also indicated that proven reserves of gas have amounted to 6 trillion cubic feet over the past 10 years, and that current gas exports to Argentina amount to 200 million cubic feet per day. Illanes indicated that projected natural gas exports to Brazil could exceed 1.1 trillion cubic feet at a rate of 250 billion cubic feet per day, bringing investments to more than $2.8 billion. Regarding investment opportunities in the electricity sector, Illanes reported that generating capacity is 550 megawatts, with the possibility of rising to 900 megawatts by the year 2000. He explained that the National Electric Power Enterprise (ENDE) expects to build some 1,000 kilometers of transmission lines. Among the incentives that will encourage foreign investment are the efficiency of generation and the installation of distribution companies. In addition, he indicated that the growth rate is estimated at 7 percent a year, and that the new investments in the sector could generate more than $300 million between 1995 and 2000. Concerning opportunities in the telecommunications sector, he described the following: - Telephone density of 2.7 lines per 100 inhabitants. The lowest percentage is 5.8 lines per 100 inhabitants. [as published] - Eighty percent of service is concentrated in La Paz, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba, with 40 percent, 25 percent, and 15 percent, respectively. - Only 45 percent of international calls are completed. He explained that unsatisfied demand today amounts to 100,000 lines, 50 percent more than the number currently installed, and that density is expected to be 5.2 lines per 100 inhabitants by the year 2000. In this regard, an investment of $630 million will be required over the next 10 years, and some 400,000 new lines will be installed by the year 2000. Regarding the National Telecommunications Enterprise (ENTEL), Illanes stated that in 1992 it had approximately $42 million in current operating cash, and it paid $25 million in dividends. Illanes explained that the national airline, Lloyd Bolivian Airline (LAB), primarily services international routes, but it also dominates the domestic market. He added that LAB has an inadequate, old, and fuel-guzzling fleet, so the capitalization of the firm will require some $40 million. In addition, the privatization of airports and air services is contemplated. He stressed that the National Railway Enterprise (ENFE) has a monopoly on that service, and noted that the state-run railway has reduced its surplus employees from 5,000 to 2,900. ENFE has a net value of approximately $80 million, he said, and its operational costs cover its operational income. After stating that Bolivia is primarily a mining country, he explained that mining exports from the private sector exceeded those of the public sector, and that in the last few years foreign investment has amounted to $10 million.
