The peculiarity in this increase is that the price adjustment is lower than the inflation rate. The fuel price adjustment for January will stand at 36.3 percent, compared with 38.6 percent in December. This means the adjustment is 2.3-percent less. The drop is based on a cut in international oil prices and an increase in the productivity of Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. This increase will have a 0.7-percent impact on the wholesale price index calculated by the Getulio Vargas Foundation. Winston Fritsch, Finance Ministry economic policy secretary, said that the policy of correcting prices below the inflation rate will be extended to all the utility rates.
