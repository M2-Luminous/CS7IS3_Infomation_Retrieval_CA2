Vil Mirzayanov, who was detained on 27 January, was released yesterday on condition that he would not leave Moscow while his case was being reexamined. He is shown at home with his wife and two children. He says the conditions in the prison were unbearable and told a story when a fellow prisoner was severely beaten up by a warden. In the past Mirzayanov headed a technical counterintelligence department at a Scientific Research Institute in Moscow. Mirzayanov cannot explain why his colleagues in the West keep silent. He expresses the hope that scientists working on similar weapons for NATO will rebel against the system. He says: "Although my colleagues told me that there was a breakthrough in the field of developing new types of chemical weapons in the United States too, but, you see, this is nothing more than a guess. Of course, most likely, scientific research, whether we receive information about it or not, usually goes in parallel. I will not rule out that the United States has also developed similar substances." According to Sergey Dorenko, Lev Fedorov, Mirzayanov's colleague and doctor of chemical sciences, says that Russia has already developed a chemical agent formula that was not included in the conventions prohibiting tests of chemical weapons and therefore, was not subject to elimination. No international organization can check whether that was true. In Fedorov's words, even Yeltsin "will never be able to check the fact that there are binary chemical weapons that are ready for use in combat operations."
