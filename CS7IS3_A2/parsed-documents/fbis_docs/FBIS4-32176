"As we have been informed by the LDP leadership, Zhirinovskiy's visit will not take place due to foreign and internal political developments in Russia," Lauko said citing a fax he had received from Andrei Losev, head of the office of the LDP deputies' group in the State Duma, the low chamber of the Russian parliament. He said, however, he was convinced that Zhirinovskiy would in the long run come to Bratislava on a suitable date. Zhirinovskiy and four other members of the leadership of the ultra-nationalist LDP were to have come to Slovakia for a four-day visit on June 25. Zhirinovskiy already planned to visit Slovakia already in May but the visit was canceled due to a corruption scandal which erupted in the Russian parliament then.
