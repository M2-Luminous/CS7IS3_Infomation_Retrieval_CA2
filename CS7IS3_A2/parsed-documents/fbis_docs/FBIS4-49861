Gui Shiyong, deputy minister of the State Planning Commission, said this in his speech at the opening of the "94 China Beijing Senior Economic Seminar" here today. Gui said that from now on the task of planning is to rationally define the strategies of national economic and social development, macro-control targets and industrial policies; carry out economic calculations; and draft plans for major economic structures, the arrangement of the productive forces and land management, and construction of key projects. All economic activities which should be, or are qualified to be, regulated by the market, will be brought under market regulation, he added. He said that the existing planning management style will be reformed, so as to realize the shift from direct control to indirect control, mainly using economic policies, regulations and other economic levers to guide the operation of the economy. Gui said that China will also rationally define and perfect the economic management rights between the central and local governments. The unity and authority of macro-control by the central government should be guaranteed, while bringing the enthusiasm of local governments into full play, he stressed. Meanwhile, he said, more attention should be paid to the participation of enterprises, market mediation organizations, scientific research units, universities, non-governmental organizations and other social circles in drafting plans. Efforts must be made to open planning work further, he said. Gui said that the major contents of the reform of the investment system include the intensification of the investment risk restraining mechanism; the reform of the investment and fund-raising patterns; the reinforcement of macro-control on the investment volume and structure; and the establishment of policy-oriented investment and fund-raising systems by the central government and the State Development Bank.
