According to an official note released yesterday, the list could be expanded if the Finance Ministry identifies other sectors that are considered oligopolies and for which there is world competition. Of the approximately 132 products in the list, 103 are medicines. The others are hygiene and cleaning products, like matches and steel wool, which have little effect on living costs. Margarine and the materials for producing it are the only food products in the list. The resolution with the list, which was signed by Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, can be suspended at any time. The ministry declined to report whether the sectors that are affected by the resolution have actually increased their prices above inflation. The resolution says only that "the government has detected that in various sectors in which just a few enterprises are operating, the process of commercial opening that began in 1990 did not go far enough to check significant price increases in real terms." The 41 products, of a total of 13,000 products on the Brazilian Custom Tariffs list, were compiled so as "not to produce excessive lack of protection, which might have caused unemployment in the national industry," the resolution states. The list of products did not meet the expectations of economic team members. FOLHA learned that the initial proposal included home electrical appliances, electrical and electronic products, and petrochemicals. This would have had repercussions on the textile, ink, and dye production sectors. The ministry of industry, commerce, and tourism opposed reducing taxes in those sectors on the grounds that it would have harmed the medium and long-term industrial policy. Yesterday morning, before publication of the list of products whose import tariffs would be reduced, Minister Cardoso said that the reduction of the tariffs paid on products whose prices suffered abusive increases should make prices return to their normal level. "It is quite an effective measure, and we should try carefully to avoid any demagogic use of it," he said. According to the minister, any country in the situation that Brazil is in, with a high level of international reserves and an open economy, would also have reduced import tariffs. Cardoso asked entrepreneurs to respect people's aspirations and to refrain from imposing abusive price increases. "Enterprises are important, and we should appreciate both enterprises and entrepreneurs, but they should also understand that they cannot ignore the aspirations of the people. People cannot bear irresponsible price increases," the minister said.
