According to Juan Manuel Eguiagaray Ucelay, the minister of industry and energy, the Spanish Government is willing to help SEAT, but without disregarding the European Union [EU] rules set down for competition and as long as the work force reduction of 4,500 jobs wanted by Volkswagen is carried out in a nontraumatic way. [Begin Eguigaray recording] The Spanish Government will of course have to contribute what it can; I underline, it will be done according to the rules. The cut in the work force will cost all Spaniards -- through the state's budget -- some 30 billion pesetas, and if we have to add subsidies for technological equipment -- and we are quite willing to do so -- it will cost us more money. [end recording] The government's subsidies are to be conditional on Volkswagen -- the parent company to which SEAT belongs -- fulfilling its promises regarding research, development, and the survival of the make and its distribution and repairs network.
