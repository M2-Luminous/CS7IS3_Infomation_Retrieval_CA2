Rozhok, who holds Russian citizenship, was accompanied by Russian Deputy Consul Valeri Chalovsky. Rozhok told BNS that "nothing came of the talk with the police," since he demanded the services of a Moscow lawyer. The interrogation was attended by an Estonian lawyer, an interpreter, and Chalovsky. The Security Police summoned Rozhok for another session of questioning on March 16. Estonian authorities started on Feb. 4 investigating Rozhok under Article 72 of the Estonian Criminal Code for "inciting racial, national or religious hatred." If convicted, Rozhok faces a fine or up to a year in prison. Rozhok stated he will not have an Estonian lawyer and that he doesn't intend to pay for any lawyer's services. In an interview with BNS, he said in justification of his refusal, "You made the mess, you clear it up." Holger Siigart, deputy director of the Security Police, told BNS investigation of Rozhok's case continues and that Rozhok is in any case obliged to turn up for questioning. Siigart said the problem of the lawyer will somehow be solved, but wouldn't say how exactly.
