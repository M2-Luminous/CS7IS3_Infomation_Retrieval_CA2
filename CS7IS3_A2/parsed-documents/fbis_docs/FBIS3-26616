Will you please explain why? [Ma Kai] Allowing production factors to circulate in the market is an essential requirement and a necessary condition for giving the market mechanism a fundamental role in the allocation of resources. When the commodity market system has developed to a certain extent, the accelerated development of the market for production factors becomes an urgent need for developing the socialist market economy. [Reporter] What fields do you think we should pay special attention to at the present stage of developing the production factors market? [Ma] Of the market system for production factors, the most important are the markets for funds, land, and labor. In addition, there are markets for technology, information, and property rights. Land is a kind of rare and nonrenewable natural resource, while labor is the most dynamic and active factor among the productive forces, and the two are the most basic production factors, as well. Under the market economy as a money economy, funds are the most important resource. The circulation of all important factors -- including banknotes, funds, land, and labor, as well as the supply of banknotes and funds -- is essential to operation of the market economy as a whole, while the financial market is the hub of the entire market system. Therefore, to develop the market for production factors, it is necessary to focus on developing the financial, land, and labor markets first and the markets for technology, information, and property rights later. [Reporter] Would you mind giving an account of the present state of China's financial market, and plans for financial reforms for the next stage? [Ma] Before the reform, China basically had only unitary bank credit [dan yi yin hang xin yong 0830 0001 6892 5887 0207 3938], and introduced the planned allocation of funds and planned deposits and loans. Under the planned economy, the bank was a subsidiary body to the treasury and could hardly play a role in financing. After the reform, however, China's financial system and its operating system underwent a change, and a financial market began to take shape, but all this has a long way to go to meet the demands of a socialist market economy, the main problems being the insufficient development of the financial market and a lack of effective supervision. The basic goal of cultivating and perfecting the financial market is to form a unified, open, competitive, orderly, and strictly managed financial market system. To this end, we must fulfill the following specific tasks: First, the money market should develop standard inter-bank lending so as to turn it into a real money market; it should promote the development of the bill market and vigorously develop the bill discount; and it should carry out energetic and prudent reform of the interest rate formation mechanism so as to gradually form a market interest rate system based on central bank interest rate, a system under which the interest rate will change in accordance with the supply and demand of the funds in the market. Second, we must develop stock and bond markets enthusiastically and prudently. It is necessary to improve the market for government bonds and to enact laws to stop the treasury borrowing money from the Central Bank. Financial deficits must be covered by issuing government bonds. Policy-lending banks should be allowed to issue financial bonds. National commercial banks should be allowed to take out a mortgage on government or financial bonds from the central bank, and other financial institutions also should be allowed to take out a mortgage on government and financial bonds from the banks other than the central bank in order to create conditions for the Central Bank to set up an open market for funds. It is essential to improve the stock market and to create conditions for establishing unified markets for corporate, individual, A, and B shares. [Reporter] What will the labor market be like and how will it be set up? [Ma] The new labor market will be a market in which free labor mobility is allowed; wages are determined mainly by labor productivity, as well as the supply and demand for labor in the labor market; and the market mechanism plays a fundamental role in resource allocation. To this end, we should take the following specific measures: 1. Speed up reform of the employment system and of the job-assignment system for graduates, and set up a public service system. The state no longer will be the main employer, enterprises will be granted autonomy in hiring workers, and workers are allowed to choose their jobs so as to form an employment mechanism for the two-way choice between employing units and employees, and for rational labor mobility. In the meantime, reform of the wage system should be stepped up, remuneration for work should be monetized, and wages should be determined mainly by productivity and by supply and demand for labor in the labor market. The minimum wage will be stipulated by law, and wages will be subject to state adjustment through taxation. Again, the residence registration system should be reformed. All these measures are essential for the cultivation of a labor market. 2. Set up labor markets with different levels and forms including national-, regional-, urban-, and township-level labor markets. Ordinary employment service centers, a market for advanced scientific and technological personnel, and an export labor market also should be set up. 3. Cultivate employment service centers. Vigorous efforts should be made to develop intermediary organs and service entities in the service of the mobility and allocation of labor. It is also necessary to set up more employment service systems providing employment services, vocational training, arbitration services, and so on, as well as a national unified information network providing information about supply of and demand for labor. 4. Accelerate housing reform, and establish and improve the social security system. This provides an important guarantee for the normal development and operation of the labor market. And, 5. Set up and improve various labor regulations so the labor market gradually will be standardized and modernized, and so the legitimate rights and interests of employees and employers will be protected. [Reporter] Will you give me a brief account of the development of the property market? To what fields should we mainly direct our efforts in developing the property market in the future? [Ma] The key tasks of land reform in urban areas are to cultivate and develop the land market and to change the system under which land is provided by the administration without compensation, without time limits, and without permission for circulation [wu liu dong 2477 3177 0520], into a system under which land will be provided with compensation, with time limits, and with permission for circulation -- in other words, a system under which the allocation of land will be decided by the market. The relevant reform began in the 1980's. At the beginning, we made "a charge" for land use (such as levying a land use tax) and then allowed land to "circulate," resulting in the formation of a land market and in the greater role for the market in land allocation. In the process, however, a number of problems arose which must not be ignored. 1) The total supply of land is getting out of control. The situation in which land is granted by the authorities at various levels or by the authorities overstepping their power is grave. 2) Laws are being ignored in the transfer of land-use rights, meaning that transactions for land are concluded mainly by administrative means, or illegally or spontaneously. 3) The market mechanism for the formation of land prices is irrational. Land prices are usually fixed at random; some localities vie with one another to lower land prices, and some localities even offer land free, thus giving illegal businessmen engaged in real estate speculation an opportunity that can be exploited to their advantage. In the urban land market system, the primary urban land market should be monopolized by the state, and the secondary land market should be free, though state control will continue to be necessary. The primary land market, meaning the market where land-use rights are transferred, must be managed by the state alone, but the method of transferring land should be reformed. It is necessary to introduce the market mechanism and put land-use rights on the market so as to expand the area where the market can play a role in the allocation of land, under the principle of separating the ownership of land, which must be retained by the state, and the right to use land. We should implement a system for the compensated transfer of land-use rights, with time limits and for particular purposes. With regard to the sale of land-use rights for commercial purposes other than for public use, we should change the negotiated-lease method into one of public auction and bidding. In the secondary land market, meaning the market for the transfer of land-use rights, the land transferred by the state should be allowed to be retransferred, leased out, and mortgaged at a price determined by the competitive market. The state, however, will still need to strengthen control over the secondary land market, for instance, the state must see to it that the land user plans the use of the land transferred, registers with the relevant authorities for the land transfer, reports the price at which the land was transferred, pays the value-added land tax, and so on, in order to forestall any attempt to illegally "speculate on land" to reap excessive profits in real estate transactions and to prevent the loss of state profits. In the countryside, it is necessary to ensure that the amount of cultivated land will not be reduced, preventing land for agricultural use being turned to nonagricultural purposes.
