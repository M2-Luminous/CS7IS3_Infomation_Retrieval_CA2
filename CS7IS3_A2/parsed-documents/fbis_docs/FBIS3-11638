Caracas Stock Exchange President Noris Aguirre and Finance Vice Minister (Luis Javier Grisanti) also participated in the meeting. Minister Sosa indicated that in his opinion, a special powers bill would only serve to expedite measures he has already proposed. He emphasized that Venezuela has gone from an exchange rate of 4.30 bolivares per U.S. dollar to 115 bolivares per U.S. dollar without knowing for certain the reasons behind such a currency devaluation, which is most probably related to the fiscal deficit. He also pointed out that the government is very concerned about this situation and believes that there cannot be any in-depth changes to the Sosa Plan. Nevertheless, the possibility of a special powers law has not been rejected. [Begin Sosa recording] I do not think modifications can be made and then a special powers law promulgated, because what they would really be doing is evaluating the same laws that allow them to promulgate such a law. If it is a special powers law, they are really passing the responsibility to the Executive Branch. [end recording] Minister Sosa Rodriguez also emphasized that his visit to the United States had been positive because he felt that investors were receptive to Venezuela's proposals. He also stated that he did not understand a report in THE ECONOMIST [previous two words in English] that states the VAT should have been applied only at the retail level since implementing such a proposal is very difficult. In addition, in reference to gasoline, what the government can earn in revenue is merely 20 to 50 billion bolivares, which is insufficient to solve the country's problems. Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez concluded by insisting that right now the most important thing is to pull Venezuela out of the economic and fiscal crisis it is currently facing.
