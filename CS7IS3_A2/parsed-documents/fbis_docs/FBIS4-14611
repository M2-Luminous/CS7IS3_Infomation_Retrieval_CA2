Following examination of the report, none of the proposed draft resolutions was adopted. After that, the parliament decided to end its session, and the work of Lukashenka's commission as well. However, in a conversation with journalists, A. Lukashenka stated that the commission will continue to operate in spite of the fact that six out of its nine members said they no longer want to participate in it. In an interview with a BELAPAN correspondent, Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb said that no decision was made with regard to Lukashenka's report because the commission failed to present deputies with specific evidence proving any wrongdoing on the part of officials accused of corruption.
