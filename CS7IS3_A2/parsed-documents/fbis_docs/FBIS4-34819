TGC President Carlos Jaramillo said that on this occasion the Constitutional Court of the Supreme Court, the first appeals court and the definitive court on constitutional matters "will not have any pretext to challenge the TGC resolution, because this court has six legally appointed members." The leftist Democratic People's Movement (MPD) asked the TGC to declare the controversial law unconstitutional. The Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) did the same on Tuesday. The resolution is aimed at totally suspending the law, which was hastily approved by right-wing deputies, as well as by deputies from the ruling party, who control the Ecuadoran parliament. The law was finally signed by the rightist head of state, Sixto Duran Ballen, who is in his seventies. The resolution was handed over to the MPD and Conaie, as well as to the president. The case documents were also turned over to the Constitutional Court of the Supreme Court so that it may issue its final ruling, which cannot be appealed. The Indian protests left a total of at least five peasants dead, and beginning early Wednesday morning the Army cleared the Andean and Amazon highways of the barricades that had been erected there, which had paralyzed the country's transportation system for 11 days causing a shortage of food in the cities.
