Ministers of the European Community may think they did something, as the three negotiating sides signed a 20-day cease-fire and as the same people are supposed to meet again in the middle of January, hoping to sign a final agreement -- but that is just another deception and self-illusion. If Europe is still not aware of its responsibility for the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for consequences of its utterly incomprehensible and irrational policies, perhaps it will realize it now. The Serbs are still defying it and demonstrating the impotence of its policies, degrading them to the level of the influence of the United Nations. It is not even capable of making them agree to or force them to allow the opening of Tuzla airport for humanitarian purposes, let alone remove their artillery around Sarajevo or stop them advancing the borders of "greater Serbia." German Minister Klaus Kinkel seems to have finally realized where things are headed or has been the first to say what the world already knows: That Europe will pay a high price for their ill-conceived policies toward the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Kinkel was not led to that evaluation only by the failures of the Geneva and Brussels negotiations, but probably by a much wider European context of political events. It is now certain that, for the first time since World War II, tanks are determining state borders in Europe, and that European politicians accept that. Now it is difficult to imagine what such a precedent could mean for the future and destiny of all Europe. We can perhaps imagine it, but how to face such a concept when it could prove to be disastrous for the entire continent? If that is not a convincing enough argument for Europe -- which persists in removing the hands of the United States from Bosnia-Herzegovina -- to come to its senses and collectively start defending freedom and democracy, perhaps the results of the recent parliamentary elections in Russia, where the "Russian Seselj" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy won the largest share of the vote, will help Europe in that. These are first significant political moves of the Russian right, whose full blast is yet to come. These elections showed that even Yeltsin does not have a ready-made answer for that challenge or better than dim prospects, and that political processes have not even begun in Russia, and this encourages the events on the territory of former Yugoslavia, as well as the fact that the world has not been willing or able to stop Serbian expansionism. If it could not stop the Serbs, how can it stop the expansionism of Russia? Zhirinovsky is not a political clown as some naively think. Many monsters of the world seemed like clowns at the beginning of their political career, but that did not prevent them from misleading the masses and dragging them into major political adventures. And the postcommunist vacuum is ideal for such leaders. The new Russian political fact called Zhirinovskiy -- if that means anything to Europe at all -- has already come up with a political slogan that can set the Russian as well as other orthodox masses into motion to the point where they will form an unpredictable political deluge. And while, on the one hand, Kinkel spoke about the high price that Europe will have to pay for its misguided politics, on the other Zhirinovskiy has revealed his ultimate political goal: Creating an alliance of countries stretching, as he said, from the Bering Straits to Warsaw and Belgrade. Yes, yes, to Warsaw and Belgrade. Does that mean anything to Europe? And Zhirinovskiy's dream borders of a greater Russia are too narrow for him, and he wants to expand them, having said "Where there is as many as one member of the Orthodox Church, that is Russia." There is not much time left before the Geneva talks resume. If the European Community really intends to halt one aggression before having to deal with another, incomparably more dangerous one, it will have to present far more radical demands to the Serbian side at the next Geneva conference, and it must be prepared to implement them to the full, or, as Kinkel says, one day it will have to pay a high price for its policies. There is not much choice.
