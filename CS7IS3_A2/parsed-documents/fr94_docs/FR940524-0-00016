FR940524-0-00016 FR940524-0-00007 16. We will retain the discretion to declare at any point in a simultaneous multiple round auction that the auction will end after one additional round or some other specified number of additional rounds. We also reserve the discretion to vary the duration of bidding rounds or the interval at which bids are accepted in order to move the auction toward closure more quickly. We will announce by public notice, and may vary by announcement during an auction, the duration and intervals between bidding rounds. 17. Activity rules. In order to ensure that simultaneous auctions with simultaneous stopping rules close within a reasonable period of time, it is necessary to impose an activity rule to prevent bidders from waiting until the end of the auction before participating. The rule proposed by Professors Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson (``Milgrom-Wilson rule'') will best achieve the Commission's goal of affording bidders flexibility to pursue back up strategies, while at the same time ensuring that simultaneous auctions are concluded within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, to award higher value narrowband PCS licenses, we plan to use the Milgrom-Wilson rule with a simultaneous stopping rule. 18. Under the Milgrom-Wilson rule, the minimum activity level, measured as a fraction of the self declared maximum eligibility, would increase during the course of the auction. The auction would be divided into three stages. During the first stage of the auction, bidders would be required to be active on licenses encompassing at least one-third of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. In the second stage, bidders would be required to be active on licenses encompassing at least two-thirds of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. In the third stage, bidders would be required to be active on licenses encompassing 100 percent of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. Under this rule, bidders would be required to meet these activity levels to retain their desired eligibility. A shortfall in activity would reduce eligibility levels accordingly. However, bidders will be permitted five automatic waivers from the activity rule during the course of an auction. We also retain the discretion to use less complex activity rules. Procedural, Payment, and Penalty Matters 19. Pre-auction procedures. We will follow the procedural, payment and penalty rules established in the Second Report and Order with certain minor modifications designed to address the characteristics of the narrowband PCS service. Before each scheduled narrowband PCS auction the Commission, or pursuant to delegated authority, a Bureau will release an initial Public Notice announcing the auction. This initial Public Notice will specify the license(s) to be auctioned and the time, place and method of competitive bidding to be used, including applicable bid procedures. The initial public notice will also specify the filing deadline for short-form applications. 20. All bidders will be required to submit short-form applications on FCC Form 175 by the date specified in the public notice. If only one application is received, the Commission will by public notice cancel the auction for this license and establish a date for the filing of a long-form application, the acceptance of which will trigger the procedures permitting petitions to deny. The Commission will issue a second Public Notice listing all defective applications and applicants will be given a chance to cure and resubmit applications with minor defects. 21. After reviewing the corrected applications, the Commission will release a third public notice announcing the names of all applicants whose applications have been accepted. These applicants will then be required to submit the full amount of their upfront payment to the Commission's lock-box bank by a date specified in the public notice. A fourth public notice announcing the names of all applicants that have been determined to be qualified to bid will then be issued. Each of these applicants will receive a bidder identification number and further instructions regarding auction procedures. 22. Upfront payments. We will require all auction participants to tender in advance to the Commission an upfront payment as a condition of bidding. We believe that a standard upfront payment formula of $0.02 per pop per MHz for the largest combination of MHz-pops a bidder anticipates bidding on in any single round of bidding is appropriate for narrowband PCS services. If licenses covering the nation are being auctioned simultaneously, a bidder will not be required to file an upfront payment representing national coverage unless it intends to bid on licenses covering the entire nation in any single bidding round. We will announce the upfront payment amount for each license in a public notice issued prior to the auction. 23. We believe that the minimum upfront payment of $2,500 established in the Second Report and Order may be too high for some narrowband licenses in sparsely populated areas, which may have values below this amount. Therefore, we will establish a lower minimum upfront payment of $1,000 for narrowband PCS applications. The specific procedures to be followed in the tendering and processing of upfront payments are set forth in Section 1.2106 of the Commission's rules. 24. Down payment and full payment for licenses awarded by competitive bidding. Winning bidders will be required to supplement their upfront payments with a down payment sufficient to bring their total deposits up to 20 percent of their winning bid(s). The down payment must be submitted by cashier's check or wire transfer to our lock-box bank by a date specified, generally within five business days following the close of the bidding. All auction winners, with the exception of certain designated entities, will be required to make full payment of the balance of the winning bids within five business days following the award of the license. Small Businesses will be permitted to pay 10 percent of their down payment amount within five businesses days after bidding is closed and the remaining 10 percent within five days after grant of the license. As discussed below, small businesses will also be permitted to pay the balance of their winning bid amount for certain licenses in installments over the term of the license. License grants will be conditioned on full payment of the bid amount.
