According to a communique released by the Finance and Prices Ministry [name of ministry as received], the decision was made because private automobile owners still have gasoline ration cards that were distributed months ago. The government decided that "during June, prices and sale conditions for such ration cards will be the same as those that were in effect prior" to the 20 May official agreement, the communique noted. The Finance and Price Ministry, however, did not indicate if the price increase will go in effect in July or at a later date. Private automobile owners have restricted access to gasoline through ration cards that are distributed by gasoline distributors periodically. Up to 1991, consumers received cards that allowed them to purchase up to 230 liters of gasoline each quarter. The quota has dropped progressively since then however. Ration cards for 20 liters were distributed in April and ration cards for this month were for a similar quantity. Premium gasoline will rise from 38 cents to 1.20 pesos per liter and regular gasoline will go from 28 cents to 1 peso. A Cuban peso is equivalent to one dollar but the local currency is exchanged at a rate of 100 pesos per dollar at the black market. In addition to gasoline, the government approved increases for the prices of cigarettes and rum, as well as all transportation fares.
