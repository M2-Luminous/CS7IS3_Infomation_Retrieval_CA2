The rise follows November's increase of 195 million dollars from October. As a matter of policy, Finance Ministry officials do not provide detailed reasons for changes in the nation's foreign exchange reserves. Foreign exchange reserves consist of foreign currencies, gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) at the International Monetary Fund. According to the latest monthly data available, Japan appears to have kept its position as the largest foreign exchange holder as its reserves were 95.2 billion dollars at the end of October. Taiwan came second with 85.6 billion dollars, followed by Germany with 82.2 billion dollars and the United States with 77.8 billion dollars. Statistics for Taiwan were those at the end of September. In 1993 as a whole, the nation's foreign exchange reserves increased by 26.9 billion dollars, the first increase in five years and the second largest annual increase following the 39.2 billion dollar rise in 1987. During the year, the dollar traded in Tokyo in a range between 100.40 yen and 125.95 yen as the yen picked up upward momentum last summer to prompt the Bank of Japan to buy dollars for yen to stem the yen's upswing. The central bank's dollar-buying intervention serves to push up foreign exchange reserves, although monetary authorities usually do not confirm such intervention.
