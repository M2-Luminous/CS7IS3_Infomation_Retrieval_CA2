At the party, Qian Qichen proposed a toast wishing a smooth transition for Hong Kong will have a smooth transition and long-term prosperity and stability in the future, which was warmly echoed by the guests. Qian Qichen said that he was very pleased to see so many new and old friends joining the ranks and files of advisers on Hong Kong affairs and members of the Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR. He said: Only three years remain until Hong Kong makes its transition. Generally speaking, the current situation in Hong Kong is fairly good. This can mainly be attributed to the reform and opening as well as to the sustained and stable economic development on the mainland which enables Hong Kong to maintain a strong momentum for its economic growth. What is especially encouraging is the fact that as 1 July 1997 is approaching, more and more Hong Kong residents are conscientiously joining the contingent of people who want to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and promote a smooth transition by Hong Kong. With a great sense of responsibility and enthusiasm, they pay attention to and participate in affairs relating to the organization of the Hong Kong SAR and the realization of a smooth transition in Hong Kong. This is a sense of responsibility and participation becoming to the masters of Hong Kong. This is also a prelude to the successful realization of the goal that "Hong Kong be governed by Hong Kong residents." While talking about the cooperation between China and Britain, Qian Qichen said: Although the Sino-British negotiations on the Hong Kong elections in 1994 and 1995 broke down, we still hope to maintain cooperation with the British side in other respects. However, cooperation is bilateral. We can not mainly entrust our hopes for a smooth transition of Hong Kong and its long-term stability and prosperity on cooperation by Britain. More importantly, it is necessary to conscientiously carry out a series of correct principles and policies of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong, whose future is guaranteed by the Basic Law. We should depend on the active participation of the broad masses of Hong Kong residents and the support of people across the country. As long as we base our tasks on a foundation like this one, we will be completely able to resume our sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule and to achieve the goal of a stable transition in Hong Kong. Attending the banquet were Luo Gan, Ji Pengfei, Lu Ping, Zhou Nan, and other leading cadres.
