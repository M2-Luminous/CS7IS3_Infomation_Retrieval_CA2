I asked him to speak honestly, which he promised to do. I inquired about his background. ['Abd-al-Baqi] My name is 'Adil Muhammad 'Abd-al-Baqi. I was born on 9 April 1961 in al-Fayyum, one of eight children, to an ordinary family. My father is a government employee, my mother does not work. We are a religious family that observes the rites and prays regularly. I did very well in school and every year I received various honors from the governor and other officials. [Musa] How did your links with the extremists in your town begin? ['Abd-al-Baqi] In late 1977, I frequently went to the club and the nearby mosque, whose imam was Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. The very first time I entered the mosque I was given a buoyant reception by 'Abd-al-Rahman's followers, who treated me like one of their own. One of them was 'Imad Khalifah, a student at the al-Haram Physical Education Institute. I grew attached to the mosque and its imam. Once when Khalifah was back in town from Cairo he invited me to go to Cairo with him and meet some of his colleagues who he said "are a real embodiment of true religion." I went with him to Fatimah al-Zahra' Mosque in al-Sahil in Shubra [in Cairo] where I was welcomed with enthusiasm similar to that displayed in al-Fayyum. Among those who welcomed me were Muhammad al-Aswani, Khamis Muslim, 'Isam al-Qamari--the three who staged the big escape from Turah prison in 1988 and were later killed in clashes with police--and Salah 'Abd-al-Basir. My extremist schooling began with them. I started by reading the "Four Terms" book by Abu-al-A'la al-Mawdudi, which taught me four new concepts about government, godliness, worship, and religion. A second book was "New Rules of Propagation" by Ibn-Rajab al-Hambali. This one included ideas about religious licenses, sanctions for killing and theft, and rulings about apostasy. A third book was "Milestones" by Sayyid Qutb, who concludes that all secular governments are atheistic and must be overthrown. At that time my ideas on change took shape. What completely made up my mind was the 28th volume of "The Doctrine of Jihad" by Ibn Taymiyah. The 600-page volume was summarized by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Salam in a 54-page book entitled "The Missing Rite." The group's Shura Council concluded that fighting the regime should be our sole occupation. I left school because we ruled that teaching is a sin and those who engage in that profession are atheists who know nothing about religion. Back home I told my family that they were all atheists and left the house, never to see them again. This was in 1980. [Musa] What was your specific mission when you set up the organization? ['Abd-al-Baqi] I conveyed the information and ideas I had to other groups, particularly because I am a tactful and convincing speaker. It occurred to me to call for burning down movie theaters and shops. Our first sabotage operation was against the 'Abd-al-Hamid movie theater in al-Fayyum. We burned it down when it was showing the film "Islam al-Masih" ["Christ's Conversion to Islam"]. We burned it again after it was renovated and destroyed many other shops. With the growing number of operations, the security apparatus started to summon me and the group working with me, 18 members at first. At that time the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' incidents occurred and were followed by the late President Anwar al-Sadat's decision to place 1,553 persons under custody. My name was 81st on the list and I was the youngest one, 20 years old. I went to jail with 'Imad Khalifah. Al-Sadat was assassinated in 40 days. We rejoiced that the head of the regime had fallen. Eighteen persons of Yusuf al-Badri's group were jailed. Among them were Shawqi al-Shaykh, a student at Hulwan Technological Institute; Rafi' Mustafa Sayyid, who is now wounded in Pishawar; and 'Abdallah al-Samawi. I spent 14 months in the same room with Shawqi and al-Samawi. We spent our time reading and isolated ourselves from the rest of the inmates, who had no specific orientation at the time. The three of us even used to perform our prayers alone. I agreed with Shawqi to establish a group under our leadership. He was released four months before me but was rearrested for harboring a fugitive from Cairo. When I was released from jail, I formed the first group of this organization. It included Kamal Tawfiq, "the present leader"; al-Sayyid Khalid Mahmud, sentenced to 10 years in the case of the al-Zaytun jeweler shop robbery and the assassination of Lieutenant Colonel 'Ala' al-Barrawi of the State Security Detectives; Ahmad al-Khawli, a suspect in the case against 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman; and Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im. The number of members reached 25. Al-Khawli asked me to leave al-Fayyum for al-'Arish, which was a new area. He succeeded in convincing a large number, who were arrested as soon as they arrived in al-'Arish. I rented a flat. I had Â£4,000 that I had taken from my mother to trade chickens. I had spent the money on my colleagues after two months. [Musa] Where did you obtain the funds for your group members? ['Abd-al-Baqi] Regrettably, the idea of sanctioning [al-istihlal] was first introduced by 'Abdallah al-Samawi, alias Tahah. Our robberies were first confined to bicycles and motorcycles despite the small amount of money. But they helped provide food and clothing. When Shawqi left prison, I visited him in his Sinaru al-Qibliyah village. He was in very bad psychological condition. We agreed not to go to the mosques and perform the Friday prayers with only our group. We relied on the "Al-Tawhid" group book by Shaykh Muhammad Bin-'Abd-al-Wahhab. We centered our activities in the villages of Kahk al-Qibliyah, Kahk al-Bahriyah, and al-Rashidiyah. We extended our thefts to various governorates, including Cairo, Bani Suwayf, and al-Fayyum. The robbery of motorcycles spread during this period, and al-Shawqiyun was responsible for all the thefts that occurred between 1983 and 1984. We also carried out highway robberies and seized passengers' money. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman was acquitted in the al-Jihad case in early 1984. He returned to al-Fayyum as a spiritual leader and became a larger-than-life figure. Some 500 members joined our group. It was proposed that we work under the leadership of 'Umar or just use his name. The group was divided and was vehemently attacked by 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. 'Abd-al-Rahman has a vicious tongue, is good speaker, and a polygamist. We closed down the Markaz Ibshaway and banned 'Umar and al-Samawi from entering. The area was free for our group. I started to visit villages and hamlets from Naja' Hammadi in the south to Shaykh Zuwayd in the north and Matruh in the west. This caused problems with the security services because I recruited thousands of youths. Then the burning of cars and clubs occurred. Later, the "Hesitation and Confirmation" group was seized and I, as its leader, was imprisoned for six months. After I was released, I asked Shawqi al-Shaykh to rejoin our group as agreed in Abu-Za'bal. [Musa] Who were your recruits? ['Abd-al-Baqi] Those who actually carried out the orders given to them. My role was to overcome whatever reservations they may have had. [Musa] What were the reasons underlying the organization's specialization, as compared to other radical organizations, in robbing jewelry shops? ['Abd-al-Baqi] With the increase in the number of members and the costs involved, we thought of robbing jewelry shops, including that of the "three brothers" in al-Zaytun, "Mishmish" in al-Matariyah, "al-Batul" in al-Khusus, and "Hakim" in 'Ayn Shams. Those were some of the fiercest operations carried out by groups from al-Shaqiyun and included 'Ali 'Abd-al-Wahhab, Ramadan Mustafa, Hilal Shafi', Khalid 'Abd-al-Hamid Imam, 'Ali Fayid Mayhub, Muhammad Ahmad Farghali, and Kamal 'Abdallah. Some of these have been sentenced to death and executed and others were sentenced to various periods of imprisonment. They collected huge amounts of gold jewelry in these incidents, which were accurately planned by specific groups. [Musa] It is obvious that when the members of your group fell no further robberies were committed. Are there elements around that can perform these special tasks? ['Abd-al-Baqi] It is certain that al-Shawqiyun was solely responsible for these tasks; they had no partners from other organizations. The leaders' fall does not mean the termination of these operations. But the security agencies are tightening their control on jewelry shops in all cities and governorates. This makes the success of these operations uncertain. Moreover, there are no leaders among the remnants of al-Shawqiyun. They are currently in the making. [Musa] What about the other organizations: The Vanguards of Conquest, al-Jihad, Those Delivered From Fire, and Repudiation and Renunciation, and their leading cadres? ['Abd-al-Baqi] I did not join the Islamic Group because I detest 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman personally. The operations they carry out, particularly in Upper Egypt, are part of their public actions. They often claim responsibility for the crimes they commit. The examples are numerous. I believe that the group has weakened considerably after the security agencies' successive blows to their leading cadres, who are actually responsible for running the criminal operations. I recall that Tharwat Hajjaj was one of the most reliable cadres in his organization because he was a good thinker. He was rivaled only by Safwat 'Abd-al-Ghani and Mamduh Yusuf, both accused of assassinating late People's Assembly Speaker Rif'at al-Mahjub. [Musa] What about other elements? ['Abd-al-Baqi] Muhammad al-Najjar, the third defendant in the al-Mahjub case, is a Maxton Fort [a liquid amphetamine] addict. Traces of injections are all over his body. He joined the group to be beside 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. Muhammad Shawqi al-Islambuli is living off the reputation of his brother Khalid, who killed the late president. 'Izzat al-Salamuni, implicated in the al-Mahjub case, has no vision of religion or organizational action. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman: The press and the security turned him into a star. He is talkative and sharp-tongued. After raiding the Asyut Security Directorate's building and killing 23 officers and soldiers on 8 October 1981, 'Abd-al-Rahman ordered members of the organization to fast in the prison for 60 days to atone for their failure to consult with him over the operation. (This is mentioned for the first time.) Tal'at Yasin Hammam: One of the most important fugitives. He is actually responsible for carrying out criminal operations. He conveys messages to certain elements to accomplish certain objectives. Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, alias Abu-Talal al-Qasimi: Good for talking and sending leaflets from abroad, but he is unable to lead the group. The Vanguards of Conquest: This organization is more dangerous and more active. The advanced equipment seized from its members indicates this. The organization adopts an intricate system in its operations and its members receive thorough training in the apartments they rent; they know how to use coded messages, and most of those who now join the group had travelled to Afghanistan with "al-Jihad, the Islamic Group, or Notification and Propagation." The organization focuses on selecting new members who have not been monitored by the security services and have no identity cards. These members, therefore, manage to enter ports and airports normally. The organization's members remain under observation and psychological training until they themselves ask for assignments. They often carry out crimes that draw widescale reaction, like the attempts on the lives of Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi and Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. Through such crimes they seek to show that the regime is impotent, which is more dangerous than guns. Repudiation and Renunciation: The most dangerous criminal mentality on the scene was that of Shukri Mustafa. The organization has not disappeared; it is only dormant. After the Shaykh al-Dhahabi incident and the murder of Shukri Mustafa, Muhammad al-Amin 'Abd-al-Fattah assumed its leadership. He travels between several countries. A split took place and Dr. Wahid Abu-Salman was put in charge of the organization. Those Delivered From Fire: Their leader is Amin 'Abdallah, not Yusri 'Abd-al-Mun'im or Majdi al-Safti. Amin's mission is to give lessons to the organization's members, who include 'Adil Musa 'Atiyah and 'Abdallah Abu-al-'Ula. As regards Muhammad Qasim 'Abd-al-Qawi, who was "killed at the Santaris battle," he only knew a collection of short Koranic verses. Al-Jihad: Muhammad al-Aswani and his brother Tariq, Khamis Musallam, Muhammad Sa'd, Hasan al-Hillawi, and 'Abbud al-Zumur are its leaders. Under the slogan "the end justifies the means," members of the organization use their wives to carry weapons and ammunition. Al-Jihad carries out secret organizational actions; this was the principle of the unified organization before the 1981 events. Al-Shawqiyun: A group of thieves and robbers; they are no different from the other groups although their armed operations are violent and vicious. They do not mind killing scores of citizens to ensure the success of their operations. The organization has reached a level where every group assigns itself some task, such as assassination or armed robbery. The crimes are not organized because the organization has so many members with different thoughts. [Musa] What is your explanation of the competition among terrorist groups to perform the largest number of operations? ['Abd-al-Baqi] What the so-called Islamic Group is doing--striking here and there--has no noticeable effect. Their intention is to create a state of confusion and panic. As for the Islamic Jihad, their operations are intentional and have a definite objective. The Vanguards of Conquest's problem is choosing a target and finding the way and means to attack it. Despite the different sizes of the operations, their objectives are the same: to embarrass and pressure the government. [Musa] You were responsible for one of the terrorist groups and know the size of its expenditures. Where does the funding for these groups come from? ['Abd-al-Baqi] The al-Shawqiyun and Repudiation and Renunciation groups did not get any funding from abroad. They relied on robbery, theft, and contributions. The others definitely have foreign contacts and receive funding from numerous countries. I was present one day when a famous lawyer handed over 250,000 Egyptian pounds that he had obtained from alms taxes. The objective was to spend this money on the needs of the organization. There was more than the amount we saw. There are people abroad whose responsibility is to gather funds and send them over. In one of the seminars he held in al-Salam Mosque in New York, 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman gathered $200,000 in one day. Part of these funds were transferred by various means to his aides in Egypt. [Musa] This leads us to wonder about the leaders of the terrorist groups who have fled abroad and the extent of their influence on their bases in Egypt. ['Abd-al-Baqi] Over 70 percent of the incidents in Egypt take place upon instructions from abroad. As proof, we note what has been reported about instructions issued by al-Zawahiri, Tal'at Qasim, and Makkawi to assassinate the prime minister and the ministers of interior and information. [Musa] Why has al-Fayyum been transformed from a hotbed to a large ambush? ['Abd-al-Baqi] Religious activities in al-Fayyum decreased and the security grip was tightened on the governorate and on criminal hotbeds, thus weakening the presence of these currents and toppling their leaders. However, fears still exist. There are three fugitives in an Asian country who have contacts with some of their aides. This requires much attention and awareness. [Musa] Is there a similarity between the type of armed operations taking place in Egypt and Algeria? ['Abd-al-Baqi] There are similarities between the terrorist operations in both countries. No one can deny this similarity because groups from both countries receive their training in Afghanistan and fight side by side inside the same camps. [Musa] Where do the members of these gangs get their weapons? ['Abd-al-Baqi] You do not need any evidence to know this. Most houses in Upper Egypt have weapons. As long as there is money one can buy weapons anywhere. It is difficult to stop groups from obtaining automatic weapons and machine guns. However, the numbers that they have are not as large as some people imagine. This is evident in the operations that are being carried out and the weapons that are being used. [Musa] Describe for us the secrets of the organizations, such as marriages and divorces? ['Abd-al-Baqi] Many things that go against Islamic teachings are practiced inside these groups. There are many women who get married while still married to their first husbands. We once heard that one of the members of the organization met a married woman and had a relationship with her after he ordered her to leave her infidel husband and marry him. They also had a daughter together. However, the organization condemned him as an infidel and forced her to divorce him and get married to another member without any contractual agreement. After some time she divorced him again. This is how marriages take place among the members of these organizations. We heard reports about a rich man in Port Said who would pay Â£1,000 to each member who joins the group and provide them with an apartment. This amir married his sister off to a member of the organization without having the couple sign a single sheet of paper. How can you describe such a marriage? Does Islamic shari'ah sanction these satanic abominations that are committed by those who claim to have come to deliver the people from destruction? [Musa] What about your own marriage? ['Abd-al-Baqi] I got married to the sister of 'Abdallah al-Samawi. When I asked for her hand in marriage, I offered him only Â£500. We were married within the week in a small bare room. In two years we had two children, 'Abd-al-Rahman and Hasna'. My wife traveled with me on my trips around the governorates. When my differences with the organization started, she left me and joined my colleagues. This was the beginning of our troubles. I asked Shawqi to discuss the issue of sanctioning robbery. He told me that the issue was out of his hands, especially because there were over 5,000 people working for the organization and reaping the yield. He would not be able to inform them all. Suddenly, one day, Shawqi al-Shaykh, Sayyid Khalid, and Kamal 'Abd-al-Ilah came to see me. They were carrying automatic weapons. They asked me to leave al-Fayyum and never come back. After some time, clashes took place with the police and Shawqi was killed. [Musa] How did the assassination of Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad 'Ala' al-Barrawi, an officer in the state security in al-Fayyum, take place? ['Abd-al-Baqi] I was not in al-Fayyum at that time. The crime upset me a great deal although I hated the officer and everyone who was related to the regime. However, he helped me a great deal with things unrelated to his work; this made me like him. His assassination was a major turning point in my relationship with the members of the organization and their crimes. [Musa] Why have you left your two children in this terrible swamp and not looked after them? ['Abd-al-Baqi] Deep in my heart, I will resort to any power, including the devil himself, to rescue my children from this swamp as soon as my financial and psychological situation is sorted out. I have suffered much brainwashing for 17 long years. These 17 years have had a great effect on me; I had to stop my studies and am now unemployed with no identity. My whole future has been wasted as a result of destructive concepts. I left these groups and now haven't a single penny in my pocket, despite the fact that I used to spend around Â£10,000 to 15,000 a week on these groups. Nevertheless, I am still convinced that these groups are thieves, robbers, and criminals. ['Abd-al-Baqi] Recently the security agencies dealt major blows to these groups. What is your view of this confrontation and the role of the remaining organs? [Musa] The current confrontation indicates that the security agencies have modernized their methods. The terrorists currently are reacting to police attacks--the opposite of the situation in previous years. The police should continue to take the initiative to deny these groups the opportunity to commit crimes that confuse the concerned parties. I regret that the other ministries have not played the necessary role in the confrontation. Sermons inside mosques do not persuade. There must be urgent alternatives and solutions. The government is currently exerting efforts to partially solve the unemployment problem. The police agencies are banning these groups to isolate them from society. These measures will limit terrorist activities. I call on the media organs to refrain from publishing dialogues with terrorist leaders. The interview published in a certain newspaper with terrorist Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim is considered a code that raises the morale of the terrorists inside Egypt. ['Abd-al-Baqi] Do jails serve as sites to spawn terrorism and pass orders? [Musa] True, jails in the past few years served as spawning sites for terrorism. Any convict who was jailed on charges of robbery would later leave prison an effective member of these groups. Most current leaders of these groups met in jail and organized their plans and groups inside jails. The jail authorities now separate prisoners and limit mingling. Orders are passed from prisoners to visiting women. Orders might be passed through certain signals or words that represent a code and passed to another party outside the prison to be carried out. ['Abd-al-Baqi] Lists of figures who are targets for assassination are usually discovered in terrorist dens. How do you prepare these lists and who is in charge of choosing the targets? [Musa] In principle, every organization has its own rules about the targets it selects. Customarily, the groups seek to kill officials and police officers connected with the regime although terrorists generally dislike reporters because they believe the media are responsible for guiding and consolidating the regime. ['Abd-al-Baqi] But certain officers are constantly targeted? [Musa] Yes, especially those who deal with prisoners in political cases.
