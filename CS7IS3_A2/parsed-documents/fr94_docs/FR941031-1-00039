FR941031-1-00039 FR941031-1-00011 C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. DOE certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act No new information or recordkeeping requirements are imposed by this rulemaking. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq .). E. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act DOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule falls into a class of actions which would not individually or cumulatively have significant impact on the human environment, as determined by DOE's regulations (10 CFR part 1021, subpart D) implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq .). Specifically, this rule is categorically excluded from NEPA review because the proposed amendments to the DEAR do not change the environmental effect of the rule being amended (categorical exclusion A5). Therefore, this rule does not require an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA. F. Review Under Executive Order 12612 Executive Order 12612, (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of Government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order requires the preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. This proposed rule, when finalized, will revise certain policy and procedural requirements. States which contract with DOE will be subject to this rule. However, DOE has determined that this rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional functions of the States.
