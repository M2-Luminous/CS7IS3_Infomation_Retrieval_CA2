Do you agree with this evaluation today? [Deak] Kalman Lorincz obviously had a reason to say these things when he left. I think that the mood of the personnel of the Hungarian Army is very important. The mood is a reflection of our current situation, and the situation of the army personnel is indeed not very rosy, especially its social situation. I think Lorincz was right. [Gulyas] In evaluating the social situation, he also said that the officers' mood was bad because they had not taken a really active role in the changes of the past four years. Do you agree with this, given that you have also participated in this process? [Deak] The Hungarian Army has been a stabilizing factor in Hungary over the past four years. The Hungarian Army and its officers have done some excellent work. Our officers' corps is excellent, and their activity in the army has been exemplary. I do not think they should have played any other active role in the society. [Gulyas] Nor did Kalman Lorincz think that; instead, he thought that the officers' corps had not played a sufficient role in shaping the issues within the army. [Deak] We did everything in our power to make it possible for the Hungarian Army to start reorganizing and carrying out all the tasks that have been carried out over the past four years. We worked together with General Lorincz, who personally did some rather successful work, too. [Gulyas] It was also said and it also appeared in the press that a third of the officers' corps were living at about the minimum subsistence level. Let us try to examine what percentage of the defense budget you are spending on wages. How much money can you allocate for maintaining the current level and how much is left for development? [Deak] We have already presented these figures many times. I would like to present the situation from another angle. We spend a considerable proportion of our budget on personnel expenses, and another part of the budget goes for material expenses, so no money is left for development. For example, the monthly net pay of a first lieutenant is about 17,000-18,000 forints, and I do not think that I need say anything else. Hoping that the bill on soldiers' legal status will be adopted, we think that the income of our officers, warrant officers, and civilian employees will increase, and we will also be able to give a better monthly payment to our conscripts. [Gulyas] This law will probably not be passed by the present Parliament. Something might come out of this in September at the earliest. [Deak] We very much hope that this will then take place in the autumn. I cannot say that the bill will not get to Parliament in the current legislative cycle. This is a decision for Parliament. However, if we cannot submit it to Parliament now, we very much hope that it will get there and will be adopted soon. [Guyas] I read an evaluation that, with the exception of the MiG-29 aircraft, the army's equipment will become practically totally obsolete. Can we accept this evaluation? [Deak] Not this way. We worked out a long-term military technology development concept and the government accepted it. There is also agreement with the parliamentary parties on this issue, but Hungary's capacity did not make it possible for us to start the implementation of this plan. We think that the situation of the Hungarian Army requires action. Regarding spare parts and certain replacements, we depend on Eastern imports. On the other hand, we would like to get high technology from the West and, most importantly, we would like to develop the armed forces based on a Hungarian military industry, something that perhaps does not yet exist. I would like to say that guns will be guns after the year 2000 too. We need Western technology mainly for our air defense, air force, electronic combat units, reconnaissance units, and command. We hope to purchase such technology when Hungary's economic performance permits. [Gulyas] You mentioned our military industry. Many people complain that the Hungarian Army does not place orders, although there is a background and basis on which to build such an industry. People mention Videoton, MOM, and other enterprises. In your opinion, is this complaint justified? [Deak] Absolutely. We need the minimal support from the current budget for projects that we can carry out. The Danube Aircraft Repair Factory has been mentioned recently. We could only place 400 million forints worth of orders this year. I think this whole situation will have to be considered differently. We need a Hungarian military industry in any case. [Gulyas] In the long term, this country is interested in approaching NATO. In your opinion, to what extent can our joining the Partnership for Peace program help us to bring our technical level closer to that of NATO, because we cannot expect NATO to accept a country whose technical level is decades behind that of the NATO countries? [Deak] The approach to NATO or other European alliances is a process. The Partnership for Peace initiative and process is a possibility for this approach and an opportunity to get to know one another. We must obviously get closer in technical systems too. [Gulyas] What is the official duration of your appointment? [Deak] My appointment lasts until the end of 1996. [Gulyas] In your opinion, can you imagine a situation after the elections in which you will have to leave earlier than planned? [Deak] We always carry out what the state leadership determines for us. We serve the army as long as we are needed and for as long as we can.
