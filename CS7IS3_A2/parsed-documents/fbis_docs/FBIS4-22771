Productions at GAZ [Gorkiy Automotive Plant], Rosselmash, and AZLK [Automotive Plant imeni Leninskiy Komsomol] were shut down or switched to a partial work week. Yesterday there was a conference of the labor collective at the enterprise, in which FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] Chairman M. Shakov participated. ZIL general director Ye. Brakov briefed the worker association on the situation at the plant. In his words, ZIL operated relatively stably during 1992-1993. During this time it produced 373 billion rubles' [R] worth of products. And the net profit remaining with the enterprise amounted to R38 billion. But today the plant has encountered the problem of selling its products. Mainly because of the inability to pay on the part of the traditional motor vehicle consumers--the army, agriculture, industrial enterprises. Moreover, the enterprise, like, incidentally, all law-abiding domestic taxpayers, is gasping under the pressure of taxes. In spite of the fact that ZIL is maintaining all of its facilities of the social sphere at its own expense, the enterprise has to make considerable deductions into the state budget and nonbudget funds for social development. As a result, ZIL first switched to a four-day work week and soon after that production had to be halted. In Ye. Brakov's words, for this year the enterprise concluded agreements for the delivery of 159,000 motor vehicles. But according to the estimates of experts, it will manage to sell only 55,000. Because of the sharp drop in demand and the reduction of production, the number of workers at the enterprise decreased this year from 92,000 to 84,000. Wages average only R90,000. Apparently the deterioration of the situation at ZIL threatens to be catastrophic. In the opinion of the leaders of the enterprise, the state, which owns 20 percent of the ZIL shares, should help the plant. ZIL specialists have calculated that R30 billion would save the plant today. And ZIL would be able to repay this credit and settle some of its debts, which have already reached R115 billion. Moreover, it would seem that the state should settle first of all with those who purchase products from ZIL. Obviously, the plant would not then start holding out its hand for regular aid.
