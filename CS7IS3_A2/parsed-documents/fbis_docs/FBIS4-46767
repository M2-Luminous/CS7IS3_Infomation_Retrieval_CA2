This was the main theme of the literature and arts evening held on Thursday by the ZAVTRA newspaper at the Izmaylovo indoor complex. The evening began with declamation of poems, spiritual canticles, and folklore collectives' performances, which formed an integrated musical-poetic composition and was over while the spectators continued to fill the 4,000 floor and bleacher seats in accordance with purchased (at 500-2,000 rubles [R] each) tickets. The soundtrack of tolling church bells announced the beginning of the official part, and a large group of leaders of right and left, radical and centrist opposition, whose speeches made up the contents of the evening, walked up to the podium. The master of ceremonies was Aleksandr Prokhanov. The first production number was Aleksandr Rutskoy. The former vice president informed viewers that the disparate forces of the opposition have been brought together not by thirst for power but thirst for a decent life. Mr. Rutskoy expressed his pain for Russia, which has lost its status of world power because of "Kozyrev and Yeltsin's foreign policy course," which Aleksandr Vladimirovich, with an apology to the listener, called "bastardly." Then he emphasized once again his desire to celebrate the next 9 May under Soviet power, which, in Mr. Rutskoy's conviction, will represent people's power in the 21st, 22d, and 23d and all subsequent centuries." Communist Party of the Russian Federation leader Gennadiy Zyuganov complained that over the years of reforms the communists were left "without leaders, without money, and without office space;" noted that "the communist idea is the Russian idea;" and informed the audience that "we have hundreds of newspapers, our own administrative and economic managers," and insistently demanded of all other leaders that they complete mutual consultations before the end of May and convene a "national assembly," which will work out a program of joint action. In the opinion of Aleksandr Nevzorov, one can clearly see that "we definitely have a majority in the State Duma:" In the deputy-reporter's words, three-quarters of the Duma members will shed a tear "at the sound of the Soviet Union's national anthem." The only ones who continue to support the enemy camp are the "dem-schizophrenics," whose typical representative is Gleb Yakunin. The only woman among the speakers--nun Angelinya from Serbia--exhorted Russia: "Wake up!" Being "God's bride," the nun insisted on turning "the secret was between Americanism and the Slavs, between Zionism and Orthodoxy, into an open war." Albert Makashov brought his own unique flavor to this evening of literature and arts; he was introduced by Mr. Prokhanov as the author of "Suvorov's expression": "...neither mayors, nor sirs, nor herrs [peckers]." Drawing a historical analogy between the October events of last year and the Kronshtadt and Tambov rebellions, the organizer of the storming of the mayoralty and Ostankino said no agreements on any accord with "Ye-Be-eN" [Yeltsin's initials, which, when spelled this way, form the Russian equivalent of "fucking"] are possible. Then, having dashingly rapped out: "Yes to the Russian government! Yes to the Russian economy!"--Mr. Makashov moved on to the spiritual sphere, imparting on the audience his prayer to the Lord "to kick out of the Kremlin the crooks, prostitutes, thieves, cosmopolitans, and other scum." "And if you are too busy, Lord," he continued his tale, "then let me do it!" Albert Makashov volunteered to give "his knowledge, his strength, and his rank" to the leader who will be able to unite the entire opposition. In conclusion, the general informed the audience that he "has the honor" and "serves the Soviet Union." Others who voiced their support for the idea of a unified opposition with a unified ideology and one leader included Ilya Konstantinov, Sergey Baburin, Cossack Captain Viktor Morozov, the amnestied "minister of defense" Vladislav Achalov, the "glorious GKChP member" Vasiliy Starodubtsev, and Ruslan Imranovich Khasbulatov, who sent to the gathering his written address. According to Aleksandr Prokhanov, words of solidarity were received from Aleksandr Barkashov, who could not attend for reason of poor health; Valeriy Zorkin, who "probably was delayed by a traffic jam;" and others. The final coda was delivered by Viktor Anpilov. The RCWP [Russian Communist Workers Party] leader announced the precise date for the all-Russia general strike--it has been moved to 21 September--and proposed to hold a "primary round of presidential elections" by distributing among the population the list of candidates from all opposition parties and movements. The winner, in Mr. Anpilov's design, will become the sole candidate from the unified opposition at the official early presidential elections. With this, they parted. The spectators leaving the Izmaylovo indoor complex were offered at the door the purchase for R1,500 of ATTACK--the first issue of the first Russian nationalist magazine with a swastika on the cover. The magazine, according to those selling it, is intended "only for Aryans" and those "in whom the lack of Aryan blood line is compensated for by great-power spirit." "Black shirts" were offered a R200 discount.
