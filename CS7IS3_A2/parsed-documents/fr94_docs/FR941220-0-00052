FR941220-0-00052 FR941220-0-00010 Issue 1: Several commenters questioned the validity of both the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter as taxonomically distinct species. Response: These two fishes were recently recognized as species new to science by prominent ichthyologists highly knowledgeable of fish in southeastern United States streams. A few years prior to the status survey for these species in the Etowah River system (see response to Issue 5 below), the Cherokee darter had been considered the Coosa darter ( Etheostoma coosae ) and the Etowah darter had been considered the greenbreast darter ( E. jordani ). Status survey collections in the Etowah River system provided material sufficient for ichthyologists to determine that the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter were indeed valid biological entities distinct from the species they had heretofore been confused with. Specifically, unique color differences in nuptial (breeding) males of both species were discovered. Publication of a species description in scientific journal and peer review by the scientific community is the primary safeguard to ensure that species descriptions are based on sound scientific information. Therefore, the Service accepts the biological basis of species validity provided in the forthcoming scientific description and distinction of the Cherokee darter from the Coosa darter (Bauer et al. in press), and the published scientific description and distinction of the Etowah darter from the greenbreast darter (Wood and Mayden, 1993). Issue 2: One commenter wanted clarification as to the timing of the determination of the Cherokee darter as a valid species in relation to the impoundment of Allatoona Reservoir, and insinuated that since the Cherokee darter was not formally recognized as a species at the time of reservoir construction, the preimpoundment records for populations of the Cherokee darter alluded to in the proposed rule referred actually to the Coosa darter. Response: As stated in the response to Issue 1 above, these two species were recognized as new species within the past few years, and decades after Allatoona Reservoir was completed in the 1950's. However, the Service is not indicating that these two fishes evolved into separate species since construction of this reservoir. The evolution of new species is a slow process that takes thousands or millions of years. There is no scientific basis to suggest the Cherokee darter or the Etowah darter evolved since the construction of Allatoona Reservoir, or that this reservoir played any part in the evolution of these species. Therefore, the preimpoundment records of Cherokee darters stated in the proposed rule pertain to that species, and do not refer to populations of the Coosa darter. Issue 3: Some commenters thought that since the Cherokee County Water and Sewerage Authority (County) had taken the habitat requirements of the federally threatened amber darter ( Percina antesella ) into consideration in the design of the proposed dam impounding the Yellow Creek Reservoir, that the habitat requirements of the Cherokee darter or Etowah darter could also be considered having been addressed. Response: There are over 150 recognized species of darters in 4 genera and approximately two dozen subgenera. Darters occupy a wide variety of habitats in rivers, lakes, and swamps from the Appalachian Mountains to near sea level throughout much of eastern North America. The Etowah River system alone harbors at least 11 species of darters. Each species inhabits discreet portions of the drainage and specific habitats within its streams. The habitat requirements of the Cherokee darter differ significantly from those of the amber darter. However, the habitat requirements of the amber darter are similar, but not identical, to that of the Etowah darter. The habitat requirements of the Cherokee darter have therefore not been taken into consideration during the design of the proposed dam. Issue 4: Numerous commenters questioned the timing of the proposed rule to provide protection for the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter in relation to the proposed Yellow Creek Reservoir project, and one commenter made the same assertion concerning a proposed regional connector highway (Atlanta beltway).
