FBIS4-37717 "drnes121_u_94001" FBIS-NES-94-121 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 Nepal & Bhutan Nepali Ruling Party Chief Demands Koirala's Removal Nepali Ruling Party Chief Demands Koirala's Removal BK1806075494 Hong Kong AFP in English 1541 GMT 17 Jun 94 BK1806075494 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Kathmandu, June 17 (AFP) -- The head of the ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party Friday [17 June] again called for the removal of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, a party source said. Ganesh Man Singh returned to the capital Friday after launching a five-day "Remove Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and save democracy" campaign in southwestern Nepal. Singh also boycotted an NC Central Working Committee (NCCWC) meeting which was attended by the prime minister and other NC members including party president, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai. The NCCWC meeting was held 10 weeks after its last meeting at which the committee authorized Bhattarai to take action against Koirala for his alleged role in upsetting Bhattarai's election chances in a February by-election. Bhattarai supporters have said that speeches made prior to the election by Koirala were detrimental to the party chief and damaged his election chances. But at the meeting the party chief appeared to signal a change in his stand, party sources said. "Bhattarai had earlier wanted to remove Koirala for the deceptive role played against him but now he seems to be growing a soft corner for the prime minister," a highly placed NC source said. "Now Singh is not happy with Bhattarai because he is trying to save Koirala's head," the source said. The next meeting of the NCCWC is scheduled to be held in Pokhara, west of here, on June 22 after it ended Friday inconclusively, the source said. During his five-day whirlwind tour Singh spoke to party rank and file, attacking the prime minister's alleged failings and the "deceptive role" played by Bhattarai who, he said, was trying to save Koirala. Singh told the NC youth members, activists and district leaders that he would not compromise on the issue. "If Koirala continues to be in office for the remaining two years, the Nepali Congress will lose the May 1996 general elections, not to talk of getting a two-thirds majority of votes," Singh said.
