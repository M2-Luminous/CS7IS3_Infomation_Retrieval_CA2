This was one of the main ideas of the recent visit to Brussels by Algirdas Brazauskas, the country's president. At the same time the head of state stressed in particular that in beginning to participate in the "Partnership for Peace" program Lithuania's clear ultimate goal is to become a full-fledged member of NATO. However, he said, more and more people in Lithuania are coming to realize that the desire alone is not enough. "We ourselves are obliged to create in our country not only the military basis for integration but also the political, economic, and psychological basis corresponding to the level of the NATO states," he stated. Meanwhile time some interesting details of the visit have emerged. The leaders of the supreme headquarters of the armed forces in Europe were particularly cautious in talking about Lithuania's possible full membership of NATO. Lieutenant General Klaus Steinkopf, special adviser to the armed forces in Europe, called the "Partnership for Peace" program an invitation to take part in a common security system. He noted that this was the first time that NATO had gone outside the limits of its traditional territories to cooperate closely with other states in Europe. Gerhard von Moltke, policy adviser to the NATO secretary general, said that the organization does not want a new division of Europe or new lines drawn on the maps. "We want to cooperate with Russia, Ukraine, and other states," he stressed. By signing the main document of the invitation to "Partnership for Peace," according to its president, Lithuania is expressing a readiness to start work on exercising democratic control of its defense structures and on a process of openness with respect to the defense budget, joint planning, exercises, and maneuvers. "We are working toward the creation of opportunities for cooperation with NATO forces in such spheres as peacekeeping operations, search and rescue operations, humanitarian aid, and so forth," he said. "Lithuania sees its integration with NATO as a complex evolutionary process which will require great intellectual and material resources." In the president's opinion, Russia's statements on its special interests in the neighboring foreign countries or on the territory of the former Soviet Union do not fully accord with the spirit of international law and the "Partnership for Peace." He is particularly alarmed by the statements on Russia's special interests in the Baltic states. A. Brazauskas expressed the view that the admission of the Baltic and other Central European states into the European Union and NATO would be a powerful incentive to economic and political reforms in those countries. He is convinced that this would also give significant support to the strengthening and continuity of the democratic processes in Russia. The Lithuanian leadership approves the Western states' efforts to help Russia implement its political and economic reforms and create a democratic Russia.
