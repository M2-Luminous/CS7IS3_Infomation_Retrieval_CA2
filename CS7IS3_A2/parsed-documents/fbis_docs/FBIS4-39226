FBIS4-39226 "drsov109_g_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 WESTERN REGION Belarus Kebich Accuses National Bank of Treason Over Credit Refusal Kebich Accuses National Bank of Treason Over Credit Refusal LD0606170994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1404 GMT 6 Jun 94 LD0606170994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich described the refusal of the National Bank to grant a credit for the government to buy animal food as treason. He told a rally of agriculture workers in the Nesvizh District, Minsk Region, that the bank was politically rather than economically motivated. Still, he said that the government would manage to help the country's agriculture. IF Note: Stanislav Bogdankevich, National Bank of Belarus chairman, disagreed with the recent agreement on the merger of the Russian and Belarusian monetary system, which, he said, curbed the bank's rights and threatened its independent existence. Nor does Bogdankevich support the Kebich government policy of granting large credits to the agriculture. In Kebich's words, the government used three quarters of all centralized credits to support the agriculture in 1994. The budget allocation to the agriculture amounted to 3380 billion rubles, or over a quarter of all the expenditure. Over one trillion rubles were invested in the sowing campaign which was therefore a success. Kebich also said that the government intended to compensate the deposits in saving banks. If he is elected president, the deposits which had been made worthless by inflation will be fully restored to the working people, he said. He added that his government had made a decision to compensate 60 percent of the deposits' worth. Kebich believed that the village had to run the reform itself by combining various kinds of ownership. As president he would keep productive farms alive and enable the peasants to dispose of their products as best as they could, once the taxes were paid and the state contracts honored. In his view, only the land and the property had to be taxed in agriculture. Experts believe that these promises and proposals are part of his electoral campaign. In an exclusive INTERFAX interview he had earlier called for having two state languages in his country, Belarussian and Russian. He thought that this issue had to be decided in a referendum. IF Note: Under the Belarussian Constitution Belarussian is the state language, Russian being a tool of inter-ethnic communication. Kebich wanted the term "ethnic minorities" out of the official language. He said that the Belarussian people did not have to be divided into minorities and majorities. He said that the country had been stable because its leader had been nipping all manifestations of nationalism in the bud. Observers believe that equality of the Russian and Belarussian languages is as important in Kebich's program as monetary union with Russia and eventual integration of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine.
