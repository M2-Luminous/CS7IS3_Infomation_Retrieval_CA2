Yesterday, Carlos Gonzalez Ramirez, Panamanian ambassador to the GATT Secretariat said Panama has proposed two dates in March to begin meetings that will open the way for the nation's entry into GATT. The dates were accepted by all member-nations except the EU. Gonzalez Ramirez said the EU's decision has delayed Panama's admittance into GATT, adding that the EU position is "greatly" coincidential, considering Panama maintains a decisive position in Latin American's struggle against some European countries' decision to establish controls on banana imports from the region. He said: "This may or may not be the case. We will have to wait a few days and see what this is all about." EU members say they thought Panama wanted to begin the GATT meetings in May, adding that it would be difficult to hold the meetings before that time because the Europeans will be very busy finalizing the Uruguay Round agreements. Panama is expected to negotiate standards issues with all member- nations at the first meeting, and it will discuss bilateral tariff agreements at the second meeting. Gonzalez Ramirez said the EU's decision represents a one and one- half month delay in Panama's plans for admittance into GATT. He added that the nation's entry into GATT could be further aggravated by the need to present a report on the results of its GATT negotiations to the National Assembly before 15 April 1995. He also said the GATT Secretariat headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, believes the meeting could be held on 19 or 20 March, although Panama would prefer to meet before that date.
