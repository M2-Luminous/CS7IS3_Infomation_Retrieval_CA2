Asked his initial response to the contact, Han said the results were "insufficient. But we do need to examine them." Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, and Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the United Nations, met in New York for approximately two hours. Kim Sam-hun, ambassador in charge of nuclear issues, refused to say what was discussed in the New York meeting but described it as both positive and unfulfilling. "Seoul and Washington will need to examine what went on at Friday's meeting. Any decision has to wait until after the full review," Kim said. The meeting was Pyongyang's first official response to a contact Nov. 24, where Washington explained the results of a summit a day earlier between Seoul and Washington. Washington reiterated two demands before the next high-level dialogue with Pyongyang -- that North Korea allow continued safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and talk with South Korea on denuclearizing the Korean peninsula. Despite reports of nearing a deadline on the issue, Foreign Ministry officials strongly indicated that the mood in Seoul and Washington is that the choice is still for dialogue. "We have said all along that we will try to solve the problem through dialogue. This effort will continue as long as they have a chance," Kim said. Seoul officials refused to say which of the two demands made progress, but a White House spokesman said North Korea did not give any clear indications on accepting international nuclear inspections. North Korea has been telling the IAEA that it will allow only a change of films and batteries in inspection cameras, but inside sources said it has been more flexible on the inspection scope in contacts with the United States. Pyongyang and Washington may hold further contacts after the South Korean and U.S. Governments examine the results of the New York meeting, Kim said.
