What was already apparent at the 9th EMO [World Machine Tool Fair] in Paris 1991 and became even more so at the 10th EMO in Hannover last September could now have reached its bottom and, under favorable conditions, could possibly recover. The first signs indicate a slight improvement, which will perhaps translate into the concrete form of orders placed at the 1994 Metav in Duesseldorf. In anticipation of this so much hoped for "Metal Processing Market," the Association of German Machine Tool Manufacturing Plants (VDW) drew up a balance sheet which, for lack of requisite official 1993 statistics, is based on official semiannual figures and on the Association's own projections. The year 1993 was painful to the German machine tool manufacturers, a direct consequence of the already third downward trend seen in all the relevant indicators: --Production decreased to an about 5 million DM lower level (-25%) by midyear and then to an about 10 billion DM lower level (-29%) level by the year's end, thus to the level which the old Federal States had last time reached in 1985. --In foreign trade imports decreased, owing to a weaker domestic demand, by 42% (in the first half-year period of 1993) and thus even more than did exports (-20%). The foreign trade figures for 1993 must be interpreted with caution, however, because conversion to European Community covering statistics results in an underestimation of especially the import volume. In the import structure all the 15 main seller countries, except the People's Republic of China, post only minus figures. Imports from the three top ranking seller countries -- Switzerland, Italy, Japan -- still head the list, as they have before, and may even claim larger shares of the total imports (55% as of now). The larger than 50% decline of imports from competitors in the Far East reflects a downfall of Japanese sales on the German market. In the export structure, although minus figures prevail here too, there can be detected some encouraging signs. During the first half-year period of 1993 the top position among the largest foreign markets for the German machine tool industry was taken over by Italy, following a huge order from the Italian automobile industry. Most of all metal cutting machine tools are being delivered to the People's Republic of China, which has in the meantime fallen into the third position behind the U.S. on the list of the largest foreign markets. Particularly high growth rates were last reported here for processing centers, transfer lines, lathes, and gear cutting machines. Taking this development into consideration, the Association of German Machine Tool Manufacturers (VDW) has in August 1993 opened a liaison office in Peking so as to ensure their constant presence in this important growth market. The unusually large increase of exports to the Portuguese market, attributable to delivery of presses to the automobile industry, should be regarded as a once occurring phenomenon rather than a sign of a continuing market growth. It has to do with the Ford-Volkswagen joint "AutoEuropa" venture in Palmela near Setubal, rated as the largest investment made in Portugal in its entire history. When the evaluation of market opportunities is based on orders received from foreign countries, then those which had come (by the end of September 1993) from the U.S., the People's Republic of China, CIS countries, France, Italy, and South Korea top the list. The total orders from abroad, though, had remained weak at a 25% lower level than during the corresponding period of the previous year. Then, however, first increases (+ 9%) in foreign orders took place during the August-October 1993 period: --The decline of orders to a 50% level since 1991 unmistakenly characterizes the prevailing conditions in this industry. --With a 4.6 months' long lead time for filling orders, a nearly constant level was reached during the last few months which, however, must be viewed against the background of quite visibly reduced capacity levels. The same applies to matching under-full capacity levels, which last (end of September 1993) was 73% and thus 10% lower than in the previous year. --The employment level in German machine tool manufacture follows the same trend, despite efforts by enterprises to hold the line: the number of people employed in this industry nationwide having been necessarily cut from over 89,000 by 30 December 1992 to about 75,000 by end of September 1993 and likely continuing to be cut. Under these circumstances there is nothing to conceal or embellish. Two years ago, in anticipation of the 1992 Metav, an analysis had been made by the Enterprise Consultants in Munich (UBM) and its results then published in a brochure under the title "Small Cause -- Large Effect: Why Millions of Jobs Nationwide Depend on a Few Thousand Jobs in Machine Tool Manufacture" for distribution at the 1993 Hannover EMO and for thus educating the broad public. Publication of these facts has, indeed, raised the awareness above all among politicians and bankers as well as trade unions and employers. The extent of changes which within the past two years have taken place in the German machine tool industry was unprecedented since the end of the war. The machine tool manufacturers do everything they can to avoid further cutbacks. Unfortunately, the demand for short-term effective capital subsidies provided for in the enacted "Stability and Growth" Law is falling on deaf ears in Bonn. This so because slumps which are only "moderate" in terms of the national economy do not open the eyes of politicians to the fact that there is a connection between the decline of the German machine tool industry and a not only quality-wise but also already dangerous threat to Germany's production status. On the contrary: the strictest export control in Europe is now, as before, practiced in Germany and its bureaucratic procedures additionally burden the machine tool industry. These restrictions and changed currency exchange rates, have additionally impaired the position of German manufacturers on the international market and thus also their overall status in 1993.
