Defence Minister Vlado Popovski said on national radio: "If the (United Nations) Security Council approves an increase in the number of American peacekeepers or a replacement of the Nordic battalion, Macedonia will respond positively to that decision." Stressing the Scandinavian troops had done a "highly professional" job, Popovski added that he believed their replacement by U.S. forces would send "a warning to possible aggressors" against Macedonia. The minister added: "The work of the Nordic battalion on the northern border (with Serbia) has already led to a decrease in tensions and ensured a degree of stability in the region." [passage omitted] Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have a total of 800 troops in Macedonia.
