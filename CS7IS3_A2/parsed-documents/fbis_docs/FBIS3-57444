He believes this will be due to the government's economic policy in November-December 1993, including decisions on subsidies to miners, increase in wages for state sector employees and others made with the participation of Gaydar. "To tell the truth, he (Gaydar - IF) should have resigned in November or December when the decisions' adoption failed to be prevented," Shokhin told a press conference in Moscow on Monday. He repeated that it would be necessary to repay not less than 3 Bn rubles in the 1st quarter of this year to cover the debts of the 4th quarter of 1993. However, in his words, the total sum of debts is 2.5 times bigger. According to Shokhin, this means that Gaydar and other members of the government have "decided to avoid responsibility for the consequences of their policy." Moreover, according to the new economics minister, unemployment may increase this year. Now the official number of unemployed is about 1 million and the hidden one is about 5 million. These 5 million may become a part of the official rate of unemployment, he emphasized.
