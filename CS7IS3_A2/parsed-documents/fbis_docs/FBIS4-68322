Tsekhmistrenko, under the rubric "The World Over the Week": "Space Passions in Nonintegrated Expanses"; first paragraph in italic is from poem by Chingiz Aytmatov, "Stormy Flag Stop (And the Day Lasts Longer Than a Century)"] [Text] And again the trains were running from the east to the west and from the west to the east... And off to both sides of the railroad in those parts were all the desert expanses that had been untouched since time immemorial -- the Sary-Ozeks, the Midlands of the yellow steppes. There was not even any mention of the Sary-Ozek-1 cosmodrome back then. Maybe it was only being drawn in the plans of the future creators of space flight. But the trains still kept running from the east to the west and from the west to the east... Forgotten in the endless Kazakhstan countryside, the "stormy flag stop" of our day is Tyuratam (that -- from the name of the closest railroad station -- is what the Russian military are used to telling everyone is the name of the well known Baykonur cosmodrome), which has, unexpectedly for most of our contemporaries, found its way to the epicenter of the serious passions that have flared up in recent months between Russia and Kazakhstan. Who could have imagined that the Kazakhs at the end of the 20th century would want to trade their customary steeds and camels for places in space vehicles. But the cunning intrigue that has surrounded Baykonur was topped recently with a no less cunning decision. Nursultan Nazarbayev could easily be considered the creator and main persona of the intrigue. The bargaining with Moscow on Baykonur he conducted unhurriedly, having begun it when Kazakhstan announced its independence -- on 31 August 1991. That day, a delayed-action mine was laid: the cosmodrome, the city of Leninsk, and all the movable and immovable property in the city were declared to be the property of Kazakhstan. That moment could have signaled the end of the cosmodrome -- not wanting to invest any money at all in Baykonur (since everything would go to Kazakhstan anyway), Moscow nearly lost interest in it. But Moscow had a change of mind in time, after it apparently saw that carving out an alternative route to the stars would be fairly difficult in the coming years. And national pride played a role, too: why was it, specifically, that we had to give up what had been built by forces of the "new historical community -- the soviet people," where the Kazakhs are just a part of the whole? Such thoughts came to Nazarbayev's mind much earlier than they did to Yeltsin's mind -- as early as 1992. That was when he first got the idea to create an international consortium at Baykonur. To put it simpler, lure Uncle Sam to those virgin expanses. The idea was then buried -- because Uncle Sam already has a cosmodrome in Florida and wasn't very sanguine about pouring dollars into the Kazakhstan sand. Replacing that idea was the lease -- that was what Alma-Ata proposed that Moscow do with Baykonur last December. And Alma-Ata asked what seemed a very modest sum -- $40 billion a year, which later changed to $7 billion, and later yet was halved to $3.5 billion. Andrey Kozyrev, who had prepared the Russian-Kazakh summit, centered his dialogue with Alma-Ata in February on the last figure. The dialogue was reminiscent of the joke from bazaar life: "How much are the flowers?" "Twenty thousand each." "Why so expensive?" "I need money bad." In order to force Moscow to be more compliant, Nazarbayev prepared for it an almost Christmas surprise. Even two. Early in the year, rumors were circulated on a consortium, and the rumors were confirmed by the January visit to Kazakhstan of a delegation from America's NASA. The aeronauts [sic] signed an agreement with Alma-Ata about nothing less than the conduct of joint observations of outer space and of space-vehicle fragments that could be hazardous to orbital facilities (you can imagine the face of the commander-in-chief of the military space forces of Russia, Ivanov, when he got the news that Russian fragments would be studied by foreign uncles!). And Nazarbayev, who was in Kiev about that time, reached an agreement on some sort of joint space program with Leonid Kravchuk. Negotiations were held on the deployment at the cosmodrome of some sort of "international space forces" hardly under the aegis of the UN, in which the Russians certainly wouldn't have the role of first violin. Those steps were viewed by Moscow with poorly masked irritation -- it wasn't about to share Baykonur with anybody. Many years will have to pass before it becomes clear to what extent Nazarbayev's actions were calculated and to what extent they were a bluff. Certainly, aeronauts on the banks of the Dnieper couldn't even imagine themselves sipping fat through tubes one fine day aboard a spacecraft flying the yellow-and-blue flag. In actuality, there's enough money today to get to, maybe, the middle of that great river. The reaction across the ocean was much more interesting. Initially there, they sort of bit on the idea of a consortium -- the talks reached an apogee during Nazarbayev's visit to Washington. But then they rather rapidly came to nothing. Especially when people in the United States began talking about the unsuitability of Baykonur and its infrastructure for Western space hardware, not to mention the Western hardware specialists. But Nursultan Abishevich achieved his goal: by the time of the start of the Russian-Kazakh summit, Moscow was ready to agree to a number of Alma-Ata's conditions regarding Baykonur. For example, the term of the lease (20 years, instead of the 30 that Moscow had asked for). Or the lease payment being in hard currency (Moscow initially suggested payment in rubles, but the Kazakhs were too sophisticated to go for that). But those things didn't involve what was most important. And no one should be confused by Alma-Ata's consent -- too fast, at first glance -- to the amount for the lease, a paltry $115 million in all, which, in addition, is to be paid on a compensatory basis and in the context of mutual settlements between the two countries. I dare say that Baykonur, from the beginning, was regarded by Nazarbayev as a splinter in the country's side, as something that had to be removed at any price, but not without saving face. The splinter is now removed, and the face is glowing with profound, full satisfaction. Having solved the problem of the splinter, Nazarbayev, stung by the political battles, has now immersed himself in a more customary element, advancing the idea of creating a new Union -- this one, Eurasian -- across the broad expanses of the former USSR. Declaring that the "euphoria of sovereignty" is now a thing of the past, Nazarbayev has concluded that the successful development of the ex-Soviet peoples is possible only on the road to consolidation in a new union -- a union with one parliament, one economic and defense policy, one border, and one currency. Curiously enough, in fighting for the well-being of the peoples, the president of Kazakhstan allowed that now all of them are worthy of joining in on the new integration ecstasy. "Less equal" were those who, to this day, pay tribute to the god of war, Mars (the Armenians, the Georgians, the Tajiks, and the Azerbaijanis). The rest, according to Nursultan Abishevich's logic, will become members of some sort of "elitist club" that doesn't care about what's happening outside its walls. He was quiet about who would be in control of the club. One can only guess that the leader of Kazakhstan would give himself one of the leading roles in the EAU [Eurasian Union]. And in fact, it's true that Nazarbayev has long sat in the backyard of the CIS, and how can it be forgotten that they didn't call him to Belovezhskaya Pushcha? Only the lazy ones in Russia didn't take up Nazarbayev's idea, and everyone is trying to palm it off as his own (the first to do that have been those who have designs in the future on the biggest, most comfortable office in the Kremlin). The first to respond was Vladimir Shumeyko, who interpreted Nazarbayev's initiative in his own way: a new union could be created, in his opinion, on the basis of already existing institutions of the CIS, including (clearly) the Interparliamentary Assembly, which is headed by Shumeyko. And his friend and rival, Sergey Shakhray, even intends to publish on behalf of the PRES [not further expanded] in the next few days a draft of a treaty on a confederative union, the basis for which will be the "same idea that President Nazarbayev has, but written in legal language." In that, apparently, Shakhray has garnered much more experience than Nazarbayev has. The only one who has maintained a wise silence is the one who was the first to hear the idea of a Eurasian Union, Boris Yeltsin. And judging from everything, the Kazakhstan leader was a bit discouraged by the reaction of the Russian president -- or more precisely, by the absence of a reaction (it's no accident that, as he left Moscow, he kept saying that he wasn't joking and that his idea wasn't anything earth-shaking at all). The silence of the proprietor of the Kremlin lasted indecently long -- until Thursday, when, through his press-secretary Kostikov, Yeltsin uttered that he "showed a guarded interest" in the creation of an EAU. The morals to the story here could be two: "The cobbler should stick to his last" and "Don't eye someone else's bread." Anyway, we'll keep going and we'll see.
