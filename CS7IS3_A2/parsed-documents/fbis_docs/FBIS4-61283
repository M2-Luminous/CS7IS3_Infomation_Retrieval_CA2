This forum and the subsequent Second Peace Conference in 1907 were very important milestones in the world community's life, in the establishment of the principles of the international rule of law. The conventions, declarations, and other decisions adopted at it imparted powerful momentum to the creation of a system of peaceful settlement of disputes and humanization of the military sphere, and placed the problem of arms limitation and disarmament on a practical footing. Although they were unable to prevent the conflagration of two world wars, the conferences in The Hague were a great beginning, determining the main direction of the development of international life in the 20th century -- the desire for peace and the establishment of the foundations of philanthropy and justice. Today, as we approach the third millennium, mankind has no right to pass up an opportunity of strengthening international peace and asserting the principles of law which, in the conditions of the current multipolar world structure, must form the basis of a new global equilibrium. Vigorous steps will be needed to translate this age-old dream into reality. On behalf of President B.N. Yeltsin and on behalf of Russia as chairman of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conferences, the Russian Federation foreign minister proposes that all states discuss the idea of convening a Third International Peace Conference in 1999. In making this proposal Russia is guided primarily by the decisions of the Second Hague Conference in 1907, which recommended that the participating states "gather for a third Peace Conference." We are expecting interest in this proposal, in view of the position of the Nonaligned Movement, the decisions of the UN General Assembly, which declared 1990-1999 the Decade of International Law, and the recommendations in this sphere by the 1993 conference of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The preliminary agenda for the third conference might be as follows: -- improving the system for settling disputes, including the possible amendment or revision of the 1899 and 1907 conventions; -- filling the gaps in international humanitarian law to be applied during armed conflicts, and developing it; -- creating a system of international criminal justice in respect of crimes against peace and mankind and other international offenses. If there is support for these proposals, Russia is prepared to submit for examination by the states ideas on the program for the forum, as happened during the preparations for the First and Second Hague Peace Conferences. For our part, we are amenable to a dialogue on the content, organization, and holding of a Third Peace Conference. In accordance with the 1907 decisions, it is necessary to institute a preparatory committee two years before it opens in order to study proposals and to draft documents and also recommendations on the organization of its work and the procedure to be applied. We are willing to participate actively in the establishment and work of this body. Russia favors the formation of a steering committee within the framework of the Court of Arbitration Administrative Council to prepare proposals connected with revising the 1899 and 1907 conventions on the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Administrative Council's recommendations on the results of the steering committee's work could be a significant contribution to the preparation of a third conference. Of course, the organizational measures must be implemented in collaboration with the United Nations, within the framework of the Decade of International Law it has proclaimed. As for the venue of the Third Peace Conference, if the Dutch Government agrees, then, like the two previous conferences, it could be held in The Hague. One hundred years, particularly in the context of the dynamic 20th century, is an enormously long time. Although, leafing through old documents relating to the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conferences, one never ceases to be amazed that the values laid down then have not depreciated over the years. The link between the eras is eloquently demonstrated in the 12 August 1898 Russian Foreign Ministry note on convening the First Hague Peace Conference: "...This conference could augur well for the next century. It would join in one mighty force the efforts of all states that sincerely want the great idea of universal peace to triumph over the realm of trouble and strife. At the same time, it would seal their agreement through the joint recognition of the principles of law and justice on which the security of states and prosperity of the peoples are based." How relevant these words are to us now.
