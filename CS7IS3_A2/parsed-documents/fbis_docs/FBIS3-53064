Mr. Fukuda, who travelled overland to Jordan from Israel through the West Bank across the King Husayn Bridge, is scheduled to be received by Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali on Monday. A diplomatic source said Mr. Fukuda's visit was prompted by "rapid developments in the Middle East peace process." Describing the visit as very important, the source said: "Japan is closely following up all events in the peace process and likes to have a regular exchange of views of all parties involved in the peace negotiations." Mr. Fukuda, who leaves Jordan on Jan. 13, already met with Israeli officials in occupied Jerusalem, where he began his visit. He will also visit Syria and Egypt. The Japanese minister, who is paying his first visit to the Middle East after assuming office, is closely involved in his country's role in the multilateral phase of the peace process. Japan chairs the multilateral working group on the environment and is an active member of the working group on water. Mr. Fukuda's visit to the region follows a recent meeting in Tokyo of the steering committee of the multilateral groups. The Japanese minister will also be discussing Jordanian-Japanese relations and follow up on the recent visit to Japan by Prime Minister al-Majali. During the visit, Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, voiced appreciation of Jordan's active participation in the peace process and reaffirmed their government's commitment to helping the Kingdom address its economic concerns. Also expected to be reviewed during Mr. Fukuda's visit is an $80 million Japanese loan to help develop Jordan's energy sector. The loan, which will match a similar loan from the World Bank that Jordan has already received, could be merged into a $150 million soft-credit for Jordan under consideration by the Tokyo government. The credit will finance the expansion of the al-Aqabah Thermal Power Plant. Japan, which holds around $900 million of Jordan's foreign debts of $6.88 million, has promised to help Jordan alleviate its external debt burden through rescheduling arrangements. In principle, Japan opposes debt write-off and advocates "help for those who help themselves." Japanese officials have expressed appreciation of the measures adopted by Jordan and say that such policies are behind the continued Japanese interest in extending aid to the Kingdom. Jordan is expected to receive between $30 million and $40 million in Japanese aid during 1994, officials said shortly after Dr. al-Majali's visit to Japan last month. Japan, which grew from the ashes of its economy after the war to become one of the top international aid donors, insists that aid recipients depend on themselves to develop their economies and repay foreign debts in the long term rather than seeking debt relief in the form of write-off. The bulk of Jordan's dues to Japan (up to $800 million) is in the form of soft loans with one per cent annual interest and repayable in 30 years. The loans were mostly extended shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and aimed at helping Jordan absorb its economic losses from the crisis sparked by the invasion. Jordan does not qualify for outright Japanese grants since Tokyo continues to follow an international convention which allows assistance to be given to countries with less than $800 per capita income. Jordan's per capita income was $1.020 in 1992.
