Amorim charged that a Brazilian party has received money from the Italian mafia, but he declined to reveal the name of the party involved. PT members themselves, however, believe that Amorim was referring to the PT. Luiz Salomao, leader of the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, added more fuel to the fire by proposing the creation of an ad hoc committee to probe into the charge made by the judge, who will be called to testify. PT leaders have described the charge as another fabrication designed to undermine the presidential candidacy of Lula [PT leader Luiz Inacio da Silva], and noted the connection existing between Amorim and [PDT leader and Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel] Brizola. The suspicion stems from the fact that it was Brizola who during his first term in office appointed Amorim to the Rio de Janeiro bench. The charge caused excitement in the camps of other Lula adversaries, who speculated about further charges of foreign aid to the PT. Associates of union leader Luiz Antonio Medeiros have stated that Medeiros has evidence of the transfer of funds to the PT from the Communist Party of the now defunct GDR.
