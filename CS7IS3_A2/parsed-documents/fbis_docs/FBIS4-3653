Ople said here today. Ople, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that as he welcomed the Foreign Affairs Committee delegation of the National People's Congress of China at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. He said to a great extent it was due to China's efforts that the threat level to peace between the two Koreas has apparently now subsided. The senator, who just returned from Marrakesh, Morroco, where 97 nations signed the final act of the Uruguay Round of talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), said various delegations assembled in Marrakesh favored the early admission of China to GATT to be an original member of the new World Trade Organization (WTO), expected to succeed GATT by January 1995. The WTO, to be credible, needs to be universal, and that standard cannot be attained without the admission of China, Ople said. Zhu Liang, head of the Chinese parliamentary delegation, said Philippine-Chinese relations were a stabilizing influence in the East Asia region.
