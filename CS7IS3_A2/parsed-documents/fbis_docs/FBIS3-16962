This was stated on 17 March by Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the Tatar People's Assembly, in an interview with a NEGA correspondent. R. Chubarov personally supports the Ukraine president's edict canceling two points in Crimea President Yu. Meshkov's edict. In his opinion, "the war of laws unleashed between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine, which will have a continuation, will push Crimea into an abyss." In which case one would not be able to talk about any economic transformations on the peninsula, R. Chubarov thinks. The Crimea president's decision to put his representatives in charge of city and rayon executive committees is drawing negative reactions in the regions. In particular, Sergey Kunitsyn, chairman of Krasnyy Perekop town soviet and deputy of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, described these intentions "illegal and contravening the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea." Under the Constitution of Crimea, an executive committee is an organ of a soviet, and a soviet is formed through the holding of general elections, S. Kunitsin thinks.
