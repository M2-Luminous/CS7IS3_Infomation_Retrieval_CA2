FR940111-0-00072 FR940111-0-00019 The rulemaking staff and Presiding Officer published their respective Reports in June and July 1990, summarizing the record evidence and recommending, with minor differences, retention of the Rule, repeal of the affirmative telephone disclosure, prohibition of separate non-declinable fees, in addition to the non-declinable fee for basic services of funeral director and staff, such as so-called ``casket handling fees,'' and the adoption of several ``fine-tuning'' amendments. 25 In response to the Presiding Officer's published invitation, 26 forty-nine groups and individuals submitted comments on those reports by November 1, 1990. 27 25 See R-N&hyph;1 (SR) and R-O&hyph;1 (POR). 26 55 FR 30925 (July 30, 1990). 27 The commenters included 22 consumer organizations (19 local funeral and memorial societies, the CAFMS_two comments, the National Consumers League, and the AARP); three individual consumers; 12 funeral industry trade associations, including five state funeral director associations (California, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina and South Carolina), the Funeral Director Services Association of Chicago, the ACA, the CANA, the PAA, the MBNA, the Casket Manufacturers Association, and the NFDA and NSM) (joint comment); five individual funeral directors; two casket manufacturers or distributors; one cemetery/third-party casket seller, one economist, and two funeral industry financial consultants, including the FFDA. On June 20, 1991, the Bureau of Consumer Protection forwarded its final recommendations to the Commission on this review proceeding. The rulemaking staff continued the major recommendations contained in its 1990 Report, and, together with the Bureau of Economics staff, jointly recommended a separate amendment concerning the disclosures that are necessary whenever the fee for ``services of funeral director and staff'' is incorporated in the price of caskets offered for sale. 28 The Bureau of Economics concurred with all of the rulemaking staff's recommendations concerning substantive Rule provisions. 29 28 BE also recommended a clarifying change to the definition of ``services of funeral director and staff,'' in which the rulemaking staff concurred. 29 The Office of the Director, Bureau of Consumer Protection, favored a limited review by the Bureau of the amended Rule to measure its impact, in particular the prohibition of ``casket handling fees.'' See Memorandum from Gerald Caplan, Deputy Director, Bureau of Consumer Protection, to the Commission, June 20, 1991 at 5. The Bureau of Economics recommended the inclusion of a future and final mandatory review of the Rule under the rulemaking procedures of section 18 of the FTC Act. See Memorandum from Peter Vander Nat, Bureau of Economics, to the Commission, August 26, 1991 at 3. The Commission has not adopted either recommendation, but has scheduled the Funeral Rule for a mandatory ``notice and comment'' review in 1999, in accordance with its ten-year review schedule adopted for all Commission rules and guides. See 58 FR 11554 (Feb. 25, 1992). On November 21, 1991, representatives of the NFDA, NSM, AARP, CANA, ACA, MBNA and PAA made oral presentations to the Commission concerning this review proceeding. On January 28, 1993, after reviewing the rulemaking record as a whole, the Commission voted unanimously to retain and amend the Rule, incorporating all of the substantive changes recommended by the rulemaking staff and the Bureau of Economics. II. Basis for the Amended Rule A. The Legal Standard for Amending the Rule Section 18(d)(2)(B) of the FTC Act states that ``[a] substantive amendment to, or repeal of, a rule promulgated under subsection (a)(1)(B) shall be prescribed, and subject to judicial review, in the same manner as a rule prescribed under such subsection.'' 30 Thus, the standard of judicial review for amendment to, or repeal of, a section 18 rule is identical to that for any rule prescribed pursuant to section 18. Upon judicial review, a section 18 rule may be set aside if it is ``arbitrary, capricious'' or otherwise not in accordance with law upon any of the grounds set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) at 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A)&hyph;(D), or if the factual determinations upon which the rule is based are not supported by ``substantial evidence'' in the rulemaking record as a whole. 31 30 The Commission's rulemaking standards applicable to promulgation and amendments of a Section 18 rule require a preponderance of reliable evidence. See Statement of Basis and Purpose, Credit Practices TRR, 49 FR 7740 (March 1, 1984). 31 15 U.S.C. 57a(e)(3); Consumers Union of the United States, Inc. v. FTC, 801 F.2d 417, 422 (D.C. Cir. 1986). In their Proposed Findings, funeral director groups assert that the current rulemaking is subject to the same standards and procedures as a de novo rulemaking. Therefore, they appear to contend that the Commission must support any decision, including the retention of the Funeral Rule, on a new administrative record compiled afresh. 32 32 R&hyph;M&hyph;9 (NFDA/NSM) at 213&hyph;214. The NFDA/NSM further suggest that any change in the Rule's requirements (other than repeal) must be based on new evidence that current practices are unfair or deceptive, in accordance with the Commission's regulatory authority. Id. at 220&hyph;221. The amended Rule, however, except as noted, covers no other new acts, practices, or sellers of funeral goods or services. Moreover, the Commission concludes that the NFDA/NSM position is inaccurate. The Commission when it promulgated the Rule determined that the covered practices were unfair or deceptive, as the Rule states. The Rule, however, also contains many ``preventive requirements'' designed to remedy those practices. Those preventive requirements may be modified without an entirely new record, as discussed in the accompanying text. As the Commission stated in mandating this review, one of its purposes was to determine whether the Rule is operating as expected in reducing barriers to price competition and increasing consumer choice, or whether some modification is necessary to facilitate those benefits. R&hyph;B&hyph;5 (SBP) at 42299. This view is incorrect. A decision to retain any portion of the current Rule may be based upon evidence gathered during the original rulemaking and the Commission's subsequent enforcement experience, as well as evidence adduced during the current rulemaking. Indeed, to the extent that nothing supplements evidence from the initial rulemaking, there is a presumption that the existing rule should be retained. 33 33 See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983). As discussed elsewhere in this Statement of Basis and Purpose, the Commission has evaluated the relative costs and benefits of the Rule, industry compliance, the Rule's effect on competition and consumer awareness, and a number of other factors, to determine whether to retain, amend, or repeal the Rule. In making that determination, the Commission has taken into account, among other things, the comments received in this rulemaking as well as the record established in the original rulemaking proceeding and the Commission's experience in enforcing the existing Rule. The Commission believes that its decision to retain certain provisions of the Rule while supplementing or amending others, as described in this Statement of Basis and Purpose, comports with the legal standards discussed earlier governing Section 18 rules. B. Overall Costs and Benefits of the Rule 1. Repeal vs. Retention: Participants' Views The vast majority of rulemaking participants supported the Rule's retention, or its expansion to cover other sellers. Of the 189 NPR commenters and 83 public hearing witnesses, only eight unequivocally advocated repeal of the Rule. 34 Two participants suggested repeal as an alternative, if the Commission declined to make various substantive amendments; two advocated repeal because, in their view, existing state laws were deemed adequate to protect consumers. 35 34 Those eight were: The NFDA (R&hyph;G&hyph;6, R&hyph;M&hyph;9); the Funeral Directors Service Association of Chicago (R&hyph;G&hyph;5)(repeal or sunset); Mr. Ninker, funeral director (R&hyph;G&hyph;1); the Conference of Funeral Service Examining Boards (R&hyph;J&hyph;1); the National Concrete Burial Vault Association (R&hyph;E&hyph;2); Mr. Hahn, FFDA, Tr. Vol. II, 674&hyph;675, 678 (because he believes the marketplace will not change significantly as a result, even though the Rule has made providers more aware of their cost components and those few consumers who are interested more aware of funeral prices); Mr. Yurs, funeral director, Tr. Vol. II, 554; and the Illinois Funeral Directors Association (R&hyph;G&hyph;2). 35 Those four include: The NSM (R&hyph;G&hyph;3; R&hyph;M&hyph;9 at 224) (repeal unless major amendments are adopted as proposed and a ``sunset'' date is mandated); the NYS Funeral Directors Association (R&hyph;G&hyph;4) (Rule is redundant to New York law); Mr. Hocker, President, NFDA, Tr. Vol. III, 1399, 1400, 1444&hyph;1445 (NFDA advocates repeal, but his personal objections are limited to three areas_affirmative telephone disclosure, GPL timing and distribution, and prior permission to embalm; otherwise, the Rule has educated consumers about the funeral process and many providers say they are not overly burdened by the Rule); and Mr. Farrow, Exec. Dir, Texas Funeral Service Commission, Tr. Vol. III, 550&hyph;551, 573 (Rule is unnecessary in light of Texas funeral law, which is patterned after the Rule and benefits consumers).
