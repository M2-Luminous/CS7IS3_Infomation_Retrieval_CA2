Vitaliy Churkin, Boris Yeltsin's representative for the former Yugoslavia, spoke Wednesday of a "new turning-point" in the peace negotiations. He thinks that the Washington agreement "if it is correctly implemented," does not threaten the interests of the Bosnian Serbs, but should instead contribute to a settlement to the extent that "it makes it possible to solve the complex problems which were hampering the discussions" like that of access to the sea for the Muslims. In Paris, the foreign minister welcomed this "first step," while stressing that the test would be the actual implementation of this Croatian-Muslim agreement on the ground, starting with respect for the cease-fire, especially in Mostar. Five or six shells fell on Tuesday evening on this city in Herzegovina whose Muslim district is being besieged by Croatian forces, but the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] reports a calming of the situation on all Croatian-Muslim fronts. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic announced on Wednesday that Zagreb was going to withdraw 1,000 men from constituted units of the Croatian army still present in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He explained that the negotiations on what practical measures with regard to the establishment of a Croatian-Muslim federation, and then confederation with Croatia would be continued in Vienna as of 4 March. They will try to draw up a constitution before 15 March. Mr. Granic was due to have talks in Paris this Thursday with Alain Juppe. The previous day, during a luncheon discussion, the French foreign minister, while welcoming the involvement of Washington and Moscow in the handling of the Bosnian crisis, called for a meeting between Americans, Europeans, and Russians to prevent "diplomatic proliferation" and "put cohesion into the inititatives." With regard to the Washington agreement, the minister stressed that many questions still had to be given an answer: What territory does this agreement apply to? How can it be delimited? What are the Serbs being told? Can Croatian-Serbian relations be ignored? "A three-sided problem cannot be solved by two," Alain Juppe said, adding that the European Union's plan (partition into three entities) "remains valid in principle" although it is not "impossible to change." Ankara and Athens welcomed the Croatian-Muslim Washington agreement, as did the UNPROFOR, whose spokesman in Sarajevo said that it "was in harmony with the efforts being made on the ground." In northern Bosnia, the Serbs are still besieging the Muslim city of Maglaj which, according to Sarajevo Radio, was again subjected to heavy shelling and several infantry attacks on Wednesday. The Serb forces have also stopped a HCR [High Commission for Refugees] convoy near Sarajevo which was heading for Maglaj.
