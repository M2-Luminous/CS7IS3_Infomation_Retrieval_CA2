The conference was attended by the representatives of the interior, foreign and other ministries, representatives of 35 provinces and cities nationwide which have been involved in the program. Over the past five years, the Vietnamese Government, with the assistance of UNHCR and international community, have received more than 62,000 voluntary repatriates, and helped them in bringing their lives back to normal and learning a trade to support themselves. Today, the UNHCR and the ECIP [EC Integration Program] have sponsored nearly 200 job training centers in Vietnam for returnees. Since June 1992, ECIP was expanded to 18 provinces and cities throughout the country with total expenditure set at $130 million. Addressing the conference, UNHCR representative Mr. Christopher Carpenter highly valued the goodwill, humanitarian policy, and great effort made by the Vietnamese Government in helping returnees to settle down in their homeland. By the end of 1995, the UNHCR is prepared to receive more than 52,000 Vietnamese voluntary repatriates still living in camps in foreign countries.
