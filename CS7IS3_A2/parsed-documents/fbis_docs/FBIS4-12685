This is the first operation of its type in the territories occupied by Israel. Giovanni Bocco reports: [Bocco] It was a lightning visit by the delegation of international observers in Hebron. Two officers from the Italian carabinieri force were also present. They spoke with the Palestinian mayor of the city and with the Israelis about the organizational aspects of the mandate. There will be 35 Italian observers, but only 15 will be permanently stationed in Hebron. After leaving the private room, the negotiators entered the council chamber, which was full of people. There was a handshake between the mayor, a UN delegate, and Yitzhaq Rabin's representative. However, the smiles did not hide the fact that there were still many things to be decided. The two Italian delegates are Colonel Pietro Pistolese and Major Giovanni Trullio. They come from the Tuscagna carabinieri parachute regiment, which has already seen action in Somalia as part of the Ibis mission. Here is the head of the Italian delegation, Colonel Pistolese: [Pistolese] This is the first contact... [Bocco, interrupting] Have you overcome the obstacle of security? [Pistolese] No. For the moment there are no security problems. We are welcomed and we hope to be good guests. [Bocco] Will you be completely disarmed. I have heard that this will be so? [Pistolese] We are working on this. We are just at the beginning of our mandate. It is premature... [Bocco, interrupting] How do you think that this meeting has gone? [Pistolese] Well. [Bocco] The 160 UN observers: 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes, and 35 Italians will have to operate in a difficult situation. Hebron is a fortress of the Islamic fundamentalists, but four kilometers away there is a colony of some 5,000 Jewish settlers. Friction is the order of the day.
