Einseln discharged Opik the same day the general staff officer gave his consent to being nominated for the ministerial post. "Since he got mixed up with politics, that's where he's going to remain," Einseln told reporters. "Military men have no place in politics, nor politicians in the defense forces." Opik as a candidate for defense minister has already faced several parliamentary factions. While some political forces have remained neutral, others, like some members of the Estonian National Independence Party [ENIP] and the Liberals factions, are opposed to him. There is a rumor that, because of opposition from the ENIP, the premier has considered other possibilities. The name of Juri Valge, an advisor to the defense forces commander, has been mentioned in this context. Prime Minister Mart Laar hasn't so far submitted any names for the president's approval. Opik, who served on the general staff of the Estonian Defense Forces, has graduated from Tartu University in biology and taught his subject at several schools in Tallinn. In November 1993 he completed a course for U.N. peacekeeping forces' staff officers in Sweden. He has done a stint in peacekeeping in Croatia. Several general staff officers predicted that Opik would have a brilliant military career in the Baltic peacekeeping battalion under formation.
