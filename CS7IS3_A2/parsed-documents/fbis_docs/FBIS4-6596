However, Ghazali Gaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, warned of a "more protracted and rigorous" struggle by Muslim rebels if the government's current peace talks with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) bogs down anew. Gaafar said the MILF "will not ask for more" as long as the government and the MILF will agree on the full implementation of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement. "The success of the RP [Republic of the Philippines]-MNLF talks depends much on the government's willingness to abide by such agreement," he added. Gaafar refuted earlier reports that the MILF has had direct participations in earlier atrocities in Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, and Maguindanao provinces to attract attention and "force" the government to hold separate talks with their front. He said, the MILF consider the MNLF a "friendly force" and that there is no difference in the two fronts' objectives. Sources said the sudden attitude of the MILF leadership towards its rival MNLF could be a result of the recent "consolidation dialog" between leaders of the two fronts, in a bid to strengthen the Bangsamoro rebels' revolutionary stature. MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari, in his "incognito visit" here last Good Friday, had avoided "to contemplate on the alternative to peace," a statement interpreted locally as a gesture of all-out efforts by the MNLF to end the peace talks successfully. Corroborating Misuari's statement, Gaafar said, "there can be no other solution to the Mindanao problem except the grant of genuine autonomy in the area." Both the MILF and the MNLF have been demanding for the full implementation of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement, which calls for the grant of autonomy in Mindanao. Under the Aquino Administration, a plebiscite was conducted on the 13 provinces and 10 cities, but only four opted to join the Constitutionally-mandated Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, an institution both the MNLF and MILF have rejected. The agreement's implementation "in letter and in spirit" is the main agendum of the resumed RP-MNLF peace talks which began last year in Jakarta, Indonesia and resume this month or the next in the same host foreign country.
