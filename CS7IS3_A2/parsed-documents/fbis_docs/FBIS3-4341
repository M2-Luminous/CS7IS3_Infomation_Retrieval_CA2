J. Tzou and Sofia Wu] [Text] Geneva, March 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan has taken a step forward in its bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a Taiwan delegate said here Friday [25 March] after wrapping up bilateral tariff reduction talks with six countries. Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of Foreign Trade told a group of Taiwan reporters that all the six countries -- Hungary, South Africa, Chile, Turkey, New Zealand and Australia -- have reaffirmed their support for Taiwan's GATT entry during the tariff reduction talks. Huang, who arrived in Geneva March 20 at the head of a 14-member delegation for the first-round tariff talks with the six countries in connection with Taiwan's GATT bid, said the talks proceeded smoothly. "Nevertheless, all of the six countries have asked US to remove tariff and non-tariff trade barriers in accordance with GATT requirements," Huang noted. They were particularly concerned with Taiwan's quota and area restrictions on farm trade and some industrial products, such as compact cars, Huang said. "We must accelerate trade liberalization and adjust our agricultural development strategies in order to facilitate our GATT bid," Huang added. Taiwan will hold further bilateral or multilateral tariff talks with the six countries later this year. Taiwan already held informal bilateral tariff reduction talks with the United States, and more than 10 other countries have requested similar talks with Taiwan. Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and is expected to become a full member by the end of this year. Huang, who is leaving here for home Sunday, said he will return to Geneva in May to attend a meeting of the GATT working party screening Taiwan's GATT application.
