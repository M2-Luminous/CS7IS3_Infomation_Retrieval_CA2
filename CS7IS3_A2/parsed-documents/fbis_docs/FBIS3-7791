This was announced by Lech Walesa today. [Reporter] My representative, a lower-ranking one, is going to return to the commission for formal reasons, the president said before leaving Gdansk for Warsaw. It had seemed that the constitution should be created at the Sejm, but there is no good atmosphere for the president there, Lech Walesa said. He announced that in using a different political setup and other opportunities he will be preparing his own draft constitution and perhaps in the future, under favorable conditions, it might be possible to combine both. Asked about reports in some newspapers to the effect that Piotr Kolodziejczyk is considering appointing a deputy national defense minister from among the present government coalition, President Walesa said: This appointment must not be made. Anyone who seriously thinks about the state knows that no divisions must be created. He offered assistance to the heads of the presidential government departments. Lech Walesa would not reply unambiguously to the question of whether his press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski would be either resigning or dismissed in the immediate future. Are you feeling tired? he asked Drzycimski, and added: I don't think he looks all that bad yet.
