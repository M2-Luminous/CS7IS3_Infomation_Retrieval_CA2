Official sources said later that Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi voiced "very deep concern" over the threat, urging a greater European commitment to the search for a negotiated solution. Both Muslim countries, Turkey and Albania are concerned for the future of the Bosnian Muslims. Sources said Turkey, at least, looks kindly on proposals now emerging for a Bosnian truce next month, new proposals for the geographical division of the disputed ex-Yugoslav territory, and heavier sanctions against those who reject them. The talks with Serreqi covered the whole arc of southern Balkan Europe in which the Bosnian war has come to be seen as a decisive threat. One issue is Kossovo, the Serbian enclave where the ethnic majority is Albanian; another, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], whose recognition Greece is loth to grant because of its fears of future territorial claims; and a third, the Greek and Albanian ethnic minorities whose presence in the two countries has led to a sharp rise in tensions recently. Speaking for one of a number of states on the edge of the Balkans, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec urged that the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] of which Italy holds the duty presidency should be given a peacekeeping capability. Zieleniec asked Martino to move in that direction before the CSCE summit planned in Prague in December. Martino said he agrees to giving the organisation more agile and effective mechanisms. The talks also covered bilateral ties. Turkey's Ciller urged moves to right the trade balance, and Serreqi described Albania's moves towards a market economy, Martino offering words of encouragement.
