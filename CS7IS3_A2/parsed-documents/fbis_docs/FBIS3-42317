The Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] militants were reluctant to show the current situation of their camp to the correspondents. However, they claimed that only seven of their colleagues were killed in the air attacks and noted: "We are not afraid of bombs. As you have observed, we are still here in the camp." We reached the vicinity of the camp with great difficulty. We arrived in an area which had many craters created by exploding bombs. That area was 500 meters from the Zhalah Camp. One of the PKK militants who blocked our way identified himself as the person in charge of the camp. He claimed that the Turkish newspapers are being used as an instrument and said that we could not enter their camp. The correspondents said: "If you claim that the Turkish Government is lying, then you should allow us to enter to determine the true state of affairs." However, the PKK militants were determined not to allow us into their camp, which had been destroyed by the military aircraft. Two buildings close to the entrance of the camp seemed to be intact. However, the main camp was hidden deep in the canyon. The PKK militants refused to show us the results of the bombing raids. Although the PKK militants claimed that no damage was caused to the camp, a resident of Shele village, which is near the Zhalah Camp, said: The Turkish aircraft dropped many bombs. It was like hell. Even Saddam Husayn was not bombed by the United States to that extent. I saw buildings collapse." He also said that he was in the camp when the Turkish aircraft attacked. It has been ascertained that the bombing of the camp frightened nearby villagers a lot. However, residential areas and civilians around the camp were unharmed except for some individuals who were smuggling contraband goods on mules. The journalists did not observe any damage in the villages around the camp. The PKK militants claimed that the Turkish aircraft dropped their bombs from an altitude of 20,000 meters [as published] to stay out of range of their antiaircraft guns. They also claim that they shot down two aircraft, but were unable to describe exactly where they crashed or to provide any evidence to confirm their claim. Several Kurdish sources in northern Iraq have said: "The PKK militants have not been completely evicted. Although significant damage has been caused in the camp, the PKK militants are still there. However, they are demoralized. The air attack was a very serious deterrent measure." It has been ascertained that one of the villagers, who transported goods from Iran to northern Iraq on mules, was wounded. The air operation caused significant anxiety in northern Iraq.
