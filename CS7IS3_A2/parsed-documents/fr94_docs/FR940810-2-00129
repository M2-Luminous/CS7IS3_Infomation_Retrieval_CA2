FR940810-2-00129 FR940810-2-00077 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applications' Representations 1. Each of the Nuveen Fund is either a Maryland corporation, a Minnesota corporation, or a Massachusetts business trust, and is requested under the Act as an open-end management investment company. Several of the Nuveen Funds have multiple series, each of which has separate investment objectives and policies, and separate assets. All of the Nuveen Funds currently charge varying front-end sales charges in connection with the purchase of their shares (ranging from 4.75% to .50%, depending on the amount of purchase). 2. The Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Distributor, acts as investment adviser for each of the Nuveen Funds. Each of the Nuveen Funds has entered into an investment management contract with the Adviser under which the Adviser provides the fund with investment management and administrative services. The Distributor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the John Nuveen Company, acts as the principal underwriter of the shares of the Nuveen Funds, and distributes shares directly to the public and through selected broker-dealers. 3. Applicants propose to adopt a multiple class distribution plan (the ``Multiple Class Plan'') for shares of the Funds. Under the Multiple Class Plan, each Fund initially will offer three classes of shares, which would represent interests in the same portfolio of investments and be identical in all respects, except for sales charges, class designations, the allocation of distribution expenses, service expenses and certain other expenses (as set forth in condition 1 below) applicable to such class (``Class Expenses''), voting rights, exchange privileges, and conversion features. The Multiple Class Plan would be implemented by designating all currently issued and outstanding shares of each Fund as Class R shares, and creating to additional classes of shares of each Fund: Class A shares and Class C shares. The Funds also may offer an additional class of shares designated as Class B. 4. Class R shares will be available for purchase by (a) unitholders of Nuveen-sponsored unit investment trusts (``UITs'') who, on or prior to the effective date of the Multiple Class Plan, have purchased such UITs and elected to reinvest distributions from such UITs in shares of a Fund, (b) holders of Class R shares of a Fund who elect to reinvest Fund dividends and capital gain distributions in Class R shares of that Fund, and (c) certain identified categories of investors described from time to time in the Funds' prospectuses, such as employees of the Funds' authorized dealers or members of their immediate families, bank trust departments investing funds in a fiduciary capacity pursuant to investment discretion, and certain specified categories of financial advisers on behalf of their customers. Purchases described in clauses (a) through (c) above will not be subject to any sales charge, distribution fee, or service fee under a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or otherwise. 5. Class A shares will be subject to a front-end sales charge and a plan to be adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 (a ``Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan'') providing for a service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net assets of Class A shares. 6. Class C shares will not be subject to any sales charge, but will be subject to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan that will provide for a distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, and a service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net asset of Class C shares. Class C shares automatically will convert to Class A shares a specified number of years after purchase, pursuant to the conversion feature described below. 7. The Funds may from time to time create one or more additional classes of shares, the terms of which may differ from the classes of shares described above. These may include classes subject to a CDSC, as well as classes subject to combinations of front-end sales charges, distribution fees and service fees different from those of Class A shares, Class C shares, and Class R shares. A Fund may, for example, offer a class or classes of shares, with or without front-end sales charges, that are subject to a service fee under a service plan substantially identical to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan, but not adopted under rule 12b&hyph;1 (a ``Shareholder Service Plan''). 8. The provision of services under a Shareholder Service Plan or Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan (collectively, the ``Plans'') will augment (and not be duplicative of) the services to be provided to a Fund by its distributor, adviser, transfer agent, custodian, and other providers of recordkeeping services. Applicants will comply with Article III, Section 26, of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD regarding asset-based sales charges and service fees. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30897 (July 7, 1992). 9. A Fund may determine, on a Fund-by-Fund basis, to offer investors a class or classes of shares subject to a CDSC and distribution and service fees under a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or a Shareholder Service Plan (``Class B shares''). In the event that a Fund decides to issue Class B shares, such shares would be offered for sale without the imposition of a sales charge at the time of purchase. An investor's proceeds from a redemption of Class B shares made within a specified period after purchase generally would be subject to a CDSC payable to the Distributor. The CDSC typically would be established in an initial amount that could range from 1% to 4% (but could be higher or lower) on shares redeemed during the first year after purchase, and typically would be reduced at a rat of either 1% of .5% per year for each subsequent year of the applicable CDSC period, so that redemptions of shares held after that period would be subject to a CDSC. Redemptions of Class B shares held by identified categories of investors also would not be subject to a CDSC. Class A shares following a specified number of years after purchase.
