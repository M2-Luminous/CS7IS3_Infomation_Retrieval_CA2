FR940223-0-00039 FR940223-0-00018 We simplified this requirement in response to comments from the Postal Service. The Postal Service interpreted proposed rule ยง3001.54(j)(5)(vi) to require it to (1) Multiply the after-rate fixed weight price index by the after-rate volume forecast for each subclass, (2) compare the result with the after-rate revenue forecast for that subclass, (3) determine if the difference exceeded specified thresholds, and (4) explain differences that exceeded the thresholds. The Postal Service asserts that ``comparisons to the suggested thresholds (three percent of subclass revenue or $20 million) add nothing to the ultimate answer.'' It characterizes steps ``1'' through ``3,'' above, as a ``wasteful and burdensome exercise.'' Postal Service Comments of December 2, 1993, at 5. Although the added burden would have been slight, in our view, we have nevertheless decided to delete the requirement that the Postal Service inventory instances in which such differences exceed a threshold. The Postal Service also asserts that explanations of the difference between estimated and implied subclass revenues would not be ``meaningful because, in every instance, the explanation would be the same: any difference between the two numbers will be attributable to the different billing determinants (before rate and after rates) used in their calculation.'' Id. at 4. Apparently because proposed rule ยง3001.54(j)(5)(vi)(e) asked the Postal Service to ``explain'' differences between its estimated revenues and those implied by its volume forecasts, the Postal Service interpreted that rule merely to require a recitation that different billing determinants give rise to different revenue results. We agree that such a recitation would not be meaningful. The ``explanation'' intended by the proposed rule was not the perfunctory one assumed by the Postal Service. The intent of the proposed rule was to elicit from the Postal Service a theoretical or conceptual justification for using different billing determinants to forecast volume than it does to estimate revenue for the same period. If the Postal Service based volume and revenue forecasts on different assumptions as to, for example, the portion of the mailstream impacted by a proposed new rate category, or its implementation date, the proposed rule contemplated that the Postal Service would provide supporting reasons. To clarify this intent, final rule ยง3001.54(j)(6) asks for ``supporting rationale'' rather than an ``explanation.'' The Postal Service's comments appear to recognize that the Commission's concern is that the Postal Service articulate a rationale for basing volume and revenue forecasts on different assumptions. It argues, however, that it would be more efficient if the desired rationale were asked for and provided after a general rate hearing begins. Id. at 5. We disagree. Where it is foreseeable that an aspect of an analytical method will routinely be placed in issue during the hearing, it expedites the hearing if supporting rationale for that method is elicited ``up front,'' through standard filing requirements. Other Proposals and Comments The OCA proposes that this docket include rules that would identify a minimum level of sampling error that the Commission will tolerate in the Postal Service's volume estimates. The premise of the OCA's proposal is that the amendments proposed in this docket might require further disaggregation of the volume and revenue estimates presented by the Postal Service, potentially reducing their reliability. OCA Comments of November 24, 1993, at 1. Although the OCA's objective has merit, it is only indirectly related to the initial proposals in this docket. The focus of the rules that we adopt in this docket is on documentation of the Postal Service's revenue estimates. Their effect is not to further disaggregate those estimates, but merely to bring our rules into conformity with the Postal Service's recent practice. They do not satisfy the premise of the OCA's proposal. The OCA's proposal should be the focus of a separate rulemaking where its ramifications could be explored in depth. The Council of Public Utility Mailers (CPUM) proposes that current rule 54 be amended throughout to add ``rate categories'' to each reference to ``all classes and subclasses of mail and service.'' The objective of CPUM's proposal is to require the Postal Service to present data ``at the most discrete, disaggregated level that is feasible.'' CPUM Comments of November 29, 1993, at 3. We agree with the objective of CPUM's proposal, but do not think that requiring rate category data throughout rule 54 is feasible or wise. The final rules adopted in this docket require that revenue estimates be disaggregated further than the rate category level. Consequently, the primary impact of CPUM's proposal would be on volumes. Current rules ยง3001.54(j) (5) and (6) require that volume forecasts at the class and subclass level be derived from an econometric demand study. It would not be appropriate to extend that requirement indiscriminately to rate categories as well. For small rate categories, sample data are too thin to allow reliable econometric modelling. In this respect, CPUM's proposed language could require data disaggregated beyond the maximum feasible level.
