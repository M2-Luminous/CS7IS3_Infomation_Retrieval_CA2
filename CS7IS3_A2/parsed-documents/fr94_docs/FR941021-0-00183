Mr. Bernard Trudell (Trudell) states that in cases of emergency all MSS providers should be required to comply with standards and call routing that will ensure the safety and well being of the public. 266 Additionally, Trudell states that most MSS providers indicated that they would provide distress and safety services in part as justification for license authority. 267 Trudell concludes that the Commission should require MSS providers to address these issues. The U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard) states that it will depend increasingly on 9&hyph;1&hyph;1 type services and caller ID for its SAR operations and to prevent hoaxes. It requests, therefore, that Big LEO systems be required to provide standard location and caller ID information. 268 Several commenters expressed similar opinions stating, generally, that the Commission should require that Big LEO systems be required to provide standardized information that would identify the calling party, give the calling party's location and route emergency messages to an appropriate emergency organization. 269 The Interagency Committee for Search and Rescue 270 (ICSAR) noted all proposed Big LEO providers had stated that their systems will be available for distress and safety communications and recommends that the Commission develop requirements to ensure that MSS systems meet public safety needs. 271 ICSAR also recommends that these issues_standardized location, caller ID and routing of emergency or distress calls_be addressed in a separate rule making. 272 The National Emergency Number Association states that the Commission should adopt a rule to require that licensees of Big LEO systems cooperate in the provision of National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) communications. 273 266 Trudell Comments at 4. 267 Id at 2. 268 Coast Guard Comments at 1. 269 See, e.g. , Comments of the National Association of EMS Physicians at 1; Comments of the Texas Advisory Commission on State Emergency Communications at 2, Reply Comments at 2; Reply Comments of the National Institute for Urban Search and Rescue at 2 and 3; and Reply Comments of the National Emergency Number Association at 3. 270 ICSAR is made up of representatives from seven Federal agencies including the Federal Communications Commission.

LQP states that it supports the Commission's proposed rule regarding distress and safety communications and in principle its obligation regarding distress communications, but opposes having to provide search and rescue or disaster response communications as a general service offering. 274 LQP stated that the Commission should follow its decision reached in the Little LEO proceeding. 275 Motorola states that it does not object to the proposed rule and notes that consistent with the Commission's decision in the Little LEO proceeding, the Commission did not intend to require that Big LEO MSS licensees show specific means of interconnection to route distress calls and did not intend for big LEO MSS stations to be used in lieu of emergency beacons required to be carried by international agreement or statute. 276 Motorola strongly opposes the imposition of a specific technical model for the 9&hyph;1&hyph;1 interconnection and location information delivery. 277 274 LQP Comments at 116, Reply Comments at 94.

Many of the Big LEO applicants acknowledge that they may carry distress and safety or disaster response communications. They argue that this would be, however, no different than the capability of cellular radios today or future personal communications services that may be used in the event of a distress or an emergency. In the Notice, we reminded licensees of their obligations under the Communications Act regarding distress communications and noted the potential for such systems to complement existing services, but, also recognized that Big LEO systems are not intended to replace existing international safety services. Further, the Commission has begun to examine matters related to enhanced 9&hyph;1&hyph;1 capability including position locations in PCS, cellular and other mobile services in a recently initiated rule making. 278 We are, therefore, denying commenters requests that the Commission require caller ID, standardized position information and automatic routing for distress and safety communications or disaster response communications. We will address those issues in our rulemaking proceeding on enhanced 9&hyph;1&hyph;1 capability, 279 and we will adopt section 25.143(f) substantially as proposed. 278 See Second Report and Order, Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314, 8 FCC Rcd 7700 (1993), at para. 139. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in CC Docket No. 94&hyph;102, FCC 94&hyph;237 (adopted September 19, 1994) (Enhanced 9&hyph;1&hyph;1 Notice). 279 Id. 200. We also noted, however, that we expected any satellite licensee that chose to offer emergency or safety communications to coordinate with appropriate SAR organizations. 280 No commenters opposed this suggestion and we are adding it to the proposed rule. 280 See Notice, note 2, supra , at para. 86. 201. Comsat states that because of the critical nature of distress and safety communications to the maritime community and the extensive international effort that is underway to implement the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), 281 the Commission should determine the extent to which applicants for Big LEO systems will provide distress and safety communications and participate in the GMDSS. 282 Mobile Datacom requests clarification of the proposed requirement for position determination capability for Big LEO systems related to distress communications. 283 Specifically, it requests that the Commission clarify whether Big LEO systems will be permitted to arrange for radio determination satellite service (RDSS) from companies such as Mobile Datacom. 284 . 281 Certain U.S. ships are required to carry radio equipment. Carriage requirements are established by statute, treaty and in the Commission's Rules. See, Sections 351 through 386 of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. 351&hyph;386; Amendments to the 1974 SOLAS Convention concerning Radiocommunications for the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System, Ch. IV, International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 32 U.S.T. 47, T.I.A.S. 9700 (1974); and subparts Q, R, S, T and W of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR subparts Q, R, S, T and W. 282 COMSAT Comments at 14. 283 Mobile Datacom apparently believes that the Commission proposed a requirement for position information because of the requirements in the Communications Act related to distress and safety communications. The proposed requirement for position information is, however, related to interference protection for the radio astronomy service. 284 Mobile Datacom Comments at 14.
