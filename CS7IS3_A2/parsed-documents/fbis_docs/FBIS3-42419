Zhilin, Volga Military District, under the rubric "The Problem Demands a Solution": "Troops of Peacekeeping Forces Must Operate Decisively, Firmly and Without Delay..."] [Text] There has been a steady increase in the number of armed conflicts on the territory of the CIS countries in recent years. And there have been many causes. The main one, in my opinion, lies in the inability of authorities to forestall a developing outbreak of violence and particularly to extinguish the flames of fratricidal war by political and economic means. It is also apparent that local authorities are unable to extricate themselves from such crises without external assistance involving the use of force. This has been confirmed by recent events in the Dniester Region and South Ossetia, where peacekeeping forces have had their say. The only peacekeeping division in Russia has been formed in the Volga Military District. Some of its units and subunits are already performing missions in hot spots. Although it should be said for the sake of the truth that units and formations of the Ground Troops, the VDV [Airborne Troops] and the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] have performed such functions and continue to do so today. A careful analysis of all the conflicts and their localization by means of MS [peacekeeping forces] leads one to believe that the peacekeeping forces are not very effective. Soviet Army and MVD units separated the sides in the conflict in Nagornyy Karabakh and on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. They did not achieve the desired results, however. Something similar is occurring right now. Units of the 201st Motorized-Rifle Division were able to do practically nothing in Tajikistan until they received reinforcements and authorization to take decisive action. The situation in South Ossetia is unstable. There is an exception, to be sure: The positive experience in the Dniester Region. We succeeded in extinguishing the flames of civil war there at the very height of the battle. It was not peacekeeping forces, though. When these arrived from Russia, the armed conflict had already been basically put down by units of the 14th Guards Combined-Arms Army. It was the competent action of the regular Russian Army which halted the carnage on the streets of Bendery. It is a well-known fact that the commander of the 14th Army set up posts on the most dangerous sectors. The people called them "Lebed barriers." It would be naive to assume that these were weak posts with six soldiers and an armored personnel carrier, however. The fact is that Lieutenant-General A. Lebed, relying upon a superb intelligence network which he had set up, inflicted such damage upon attacking units of the opposing side with mobile artillery groups it became clear to them that it was pointless to continue the bloodshed. Surprise, precise, powerful, preemptive strikes, as well as the availability of back-up mobile armored groups, forced the initiators of the military conflict to come to the negotiating table. And it can be boldly stated today that, backed by the powerful 14th Guards Combined-Arms Army, the peacekeeping forces have successfully performed their functions for a year now. It would be difficult to say how events would have developed had the Russian formation not been in the area. Reports that Moldova is demanding the withdrawal of units of the 14th Army from the Dniester Region have recently appeared in the press. But let us imagine what would become of the peacekeeping forces in that case. Obviously the same thing which occurred with the UN subunits in Lebanon in 1962, when Israel committed aggression. Flouting international law, its troops passed through the combat formations of the UN forces swiftly and certainly. The same thing was done by units of the Croatian Army this spring, when they pushed back the UN battalions insolently and with impunity and launched offensive operations against the Serbian Kraina. We have our own bitter experience as well. Last summer, when we were assigned the job of converting one of the district formations into a peacekeeping formation, we recommended setting up separate motorized-rifle battalions both on BTR-80s and BMPs [infantry fighting vehicles], as well as separate mobile artillery units (with intelligences assets) and subunits of army aviation. In view of the fact that the peacekeeping forces would be operating independently, we proposed including rear service and technical support subunits. However... a version involving a light, regiment-type military unit was adopted. As a result we have a thin chain of peacekeeping troops and patrols at hot spots. The commander of a regiment (or battalion) is unable to set up a reserve of long-range guns and mobile forces. That sort of day-to-day service would seem adequate in a peacetime situation, of course. But where is the guarantee that we will not have a repeat of what occurred in Central Asia or in the Caucasus? Seeing that the peacekeeping forces there were incapable of providing a decisive rebuff, mobile armed groups and bands began operating actively. And the flames of civil war flared up with even greater force. This is why I share Lieutenant-General A. Lebed's opinion: "The main experience in preparing peacekeeping forces consists in the following: If a decision is made to use troops, they must be employed decisively, firmly and without delay. And it must be clear to everyone that a force has arrived capable of putting every insolent, encroaching bandit in his place. Anyone attempting to throw a wrench into the works will be arrested or destroyed." (VOYENNYY VESTNIK, No 1, 1993). The composition of the forces and the organizational structure of the units must provide for the bloodless accomplishment of all the assigned missions. In other words, the military strength of the peacekeeping forces and their preparedness for decisive action must be such that the opposing sides immediately lose their desire to continue the war. Incidentally, the American command element understands this very well. The experience of units and formations of U.S. forces in the performance of peacekeeping actions is deserving of attention. The Americans keep a close eye on the development of every conflict. And if the government makes the decision, the command element has adequate intelligence and rapidly prepares and dispatches to the given area an adequate number of troops. To the Americans an adequate number is an absolute superiority over the enemy. Moreover, it is an absolute superiority primarily in equipment and modern weapons. When a large body of supermodern combat equipment, with a deafening roar amplified many times over by special propaganda machines, appears suddenly from the air, land or sea, the warring parties automatically develop a desire to solve all the problems by peaceful means. And should some field commander still open fire, a devastating strike will be inflicted upon him from air and land. The American troops are operating in this pattern in Somalia. This unquestionably requires a lot of personnel and assets. It is justified, however. There is a large probability that the fratricide can be halted without bloodshed. If we take this route (and there is apparently no alternative), then, based on our experience in the Dniester Region, we must first of all give the peacekeeping forces political status. Then their units and formations must be reinforced. In the CIS situation peacekeeping forces with light weapons cannot separate the sides (this was demonstrated by the events in Central Asia and in the Caucasus). I repeat, the men in the blue helmets must have real power. Let the soldiers man the posts and patrol with small arms in a jeep or an armored personnel carrier, but they must be backed up by a powerful striking force, as they say, of self-propelled, long-range artillery groups and subunits of combat helicopters and ground-attack aircraft. And, naturally, also by a mobile reserve of tactical forces in tanks or infantry combat vehicles. There should be special stress on intelligence. Peacekeeping forces must be equipped with surface reconnaissance radar, night vision devices and sets of reconnaissance and signaling devices. These should make it possible to monitor areas and forestall an attack by formation bands. Units which perform special missions are manned and outfitted in this way. Take the expeditionary brigade of US Marines, for example. Its members can carry out its assigned missions on their own. Such a brigade includes a field landing group of Marines, a composite air group and a brigade rear service group. Such a tactical and operational formation has more than 50 tanks, over 120 guns and mortars, around 120 Tow and Dragon ATGMs and other antitank weapons. It includes as many as 100 air defense weapons, more than 100 infantry combat vehicles and amphibious armored personnel carriers, around 200 combat planes and helicopters. A Marine expeditionary battalion includes a battalion airborne group, a composite air squadron and a battalion rear-service support group. Its arsenal includes as many as five medium tanks, six 155mm howitzers, 40 antitank missile systems, around 20 mortars, 20 Stinger air defense systems, almost 30 helicopters and 15 armored personnel carriers. These formations are not intended for peacekeeping missions, of course. Their structure could provide the basis for structuring and manning Russian peacekeeping forces, however. It is the opinion of specialists in the Volga Military District that a division of peacekeeping forces should be a part of the Russian Army's mobile forces; more specifically, of its rapid-reaction forces. Such a formation could be employed in its entirety or in part in the case of a full-scale war or limited (local) wars. If necessary it could perform peacekeeping missions as well. Such a formation should have a brigade composition, since this is the optimal organization. Let us say that it could include 12 separate motorized-rifle battalions, of which four would be "heavy," that is, armed with tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, while the rest would be on BTR-80 wheeled armored personnel carriers. And certainly, three or four support subunits. This would enable the command element to execute missions with greater flexibility, to put together and sent to a designated area the optimal grouping of personnel and assets. You will agree that in one situation two light battalions (on armored personnel carriers) with a support battery and a flight of helicopters is sufficient, while another would require five battalions, two of them "heavy" battalions, a couple of separate, self-propelled artillery battalions for overall fire support, and one or two squadrons of mixed helicopters. They would be headed by brigade staffs and supported by appropriate material and technical support groups. And so, a formation should have four or five separate, self-propelled artillery battalions, army air subunits and separate units of all types of support forces. Yes, this is reminiscent of a US mechanized division, but the purpose of the formation, which would ordinarily be employed not at full strength but in part, necessitates the adoption of precisely such a structure. In the case of peacekeeping missions, the subunits in armored personnel carriers would perform patrol service. Their authority, however, would be backed up by intelligence subunits and helicopters of the army aviation, a general support group and strike groups of "heavy" battalions. It is not possible in a single article to cover all of the problems involved in the use of peacekeeping forces. Some people will probably disagree with my suggestions for the employment and the composition of peacekeeping units. So let us argue the matter. After all, controversy brings out the truth.
