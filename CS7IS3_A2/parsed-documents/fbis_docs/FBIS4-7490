For that reason, during the Thursday, 10 March, KERM [Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers] meeting, it was decided that a coordination meeting would take place on Thursday, 17 March, and, on Friday, 18 March, KERM would state precisely its position concerning this issue. It turns out that the proposals went very far, when, practically speaking, there is another privatization philosophy--the divergence between KERM members concerned about who is to initiate the privatization procedures, who is to represent the State Treasury, the role of the chief of the privatization ministry, and the role of particular ministries. Even during the interministerial coordination meeting, as RZECZPOSPOLITA learned, it was proposed that the Ministry of Privatization [MPW] convert state enterprises into commercial operations, with the enterprises' concurrence. During the KERM proceedings, Marek Pol, minister of industry and trade, proposed instead that the decision on the whole process of privatization pass into the hands of branch ministries. The MPW would, in practice, have the role of a consulting firm at the level of preparing the privatization process as well as a store with the enterprises, with the signing of the contract. And the Ministry of Industry would like to be involved not only with the privatization of these industrial and trade enterprises, for which it is currently the founding body [organ zalozycielski], but also with those under the jurisdiction of voivodes [administrative heads of the voivodships]. This idea was accepted by the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations would like to go even further, separating foreign trade enterprises and independently attending to their privatization. In the meantime, the Ministry of Privatization, as stated by Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek at a press conference during a break in the KERM meeting, assumes granting the enterprises far-reaching powers that would allow them to decide on the means of privatization. It was also proposed to abolish the half-year time period allowed to select the privatization path, leaving the enterprises with possibilities not restricted by time to undertake these initiatives. Minister Kaczmarek, when asked by reporters how he would react if the idea presented by Minister Pol were to be accepted, said that he would protest such a move because it was not the privatization direction to which he had agreed. In his opinion, this is an attempt to rebuild the branch structures. In Minister Kaczmarek's opinion, discussion would be easier if the package of laws concerning the State Treasury were to be considered first. The other subject of discussion dealt with the range of preference for the employees. The Ministry [of Privatization] takes the position that there should be 15 percent of free shares, along with an absolute limit (the value of the preferences cannot exceed 18 average wages). On the basis of the discussion, KERM members aligned themselves rather with the 10-percent free shares concept, but with restrictions on the rights to their transferability. They could be, for example, registered shares (as KPW [Securities Commission] wants to have), or they could be transerred in lots of up to 5 percent annually. In response to questions, Minister Kaczmarek said that there is no concept for privatization of the agricultural-food-processing industry. On Friday [11 March], the minister was in Lowicz, and he spoke with representatives of the food-processing industry there and came to the conclusion that a concept of merging agricultural producers with the privatization of that sector (regardless of whether they get 10 or 15 percent of the shares) is not a solution for privatization. What is necessary are ideas and money for that industry to make marketable products. The minister's resistance also brings up the proposition that cooperatives have the right to a portion of the shares of processing industries, the more so because there are many individuals in, for example, the budget sphere, who do not have such privileges.
