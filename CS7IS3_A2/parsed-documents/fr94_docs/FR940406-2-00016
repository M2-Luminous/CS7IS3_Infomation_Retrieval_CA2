FR940406-2-00016 FR940406-2-00007 [A&hyph;421&hyph;806] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Antidumping Duty Investigation of Color Negative Photographic Paper and Chemical Components Thereof From the Netherlands AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Beck, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;3464. Preliminary Determination We preliminarily determine that color negative photographic paper and chemical components thereof (CNPP) from the Netherlands are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margin is shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on September 20, 1993, (58 FR 50331, September 27, 1993), the following events have occurred. On October 15, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination. On November 19, 1993, the Department presented an antidumping duty questionnaire to Fuji Photo Film B.V. (respondent). Respondent submitted its responses to the Department's sales and cost questionnaires in December 1993 and January 1994. The Department issued deficiency sales and cost questionnaires in February 1994. Respondent submitted its responses to these deficiency questionnaires in February and March 1994. On December 14, 1993, respondent submitted a statement in support of the Department postponing the preliminary determination in this investigation. On December 23, 1993, Eastman Kodak Company (petitioner) requested that the Department postpone the preliminary determination until March 29, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c) (1993). The Department granted this request on January 6, 1994 (59 FR 1927, January 13, 1994). On March 2, 1994, petitioner submitted an allegation that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of CNPP from the Netherlands. On March 4, 1994, the Department sent respondent a critical circumstances questionnaire. On March 18, 1994, respondent submitted its response to the questionnaire. On March 8, 1994, respondent requested that, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination, the Department postpone the final determination. Scope of Investigation For purposes of this investigation, color negative photographic paper is all sensitized, unexposed silver-halide color negative photographic paper, whether in master rolls, smaller rolls or sheets. Chemical components include sensitized (whether chemically or spectrally) and unsensitized emulsions, couplers, and coupler dispersions used in making color negative photographic paper. Unsensitized silver-halide emulsions consist of silver-halide microcrystals dispersed in a gelatin and water matrix after preparation and washing to remove soluble salts. Unsensitized emulsions are naturally sensitive to blue and ultraviolet light, but cannot efficiently convert light to form a color image without further processing. Sensitized emulsions have been treated to increase their sensitivity across the entire spectrum and/or treated by the addition of spectral sensitizing dyes to make the emulsions selectively sensitive to specific wavelengths of light. A coupler is a colorless, water-insoluble chemical capable of reacting with a silver-halide development product to form a dye. A coupler dispersion consists of a coupler dispersed in a water-gel solution, and may contain organic solvents, chemicals to stabilize the coupler and other substances. Specifically excluded from this investigation are all paper and chemical products not used in the silver halide process which are used in other imaging technologies. Products outside the scope include toner and developer chemicals used in electrostatic or indirect imaging processes (e.g., xerography), products used in laser printing, and instant photography products.
