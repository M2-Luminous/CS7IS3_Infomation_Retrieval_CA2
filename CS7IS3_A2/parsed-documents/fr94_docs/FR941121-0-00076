B. PRO Review of Decisions for Hospital Discharges Section 1154(e) of the Act, as amended by section 9351 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Public Law 99&hyph;509), provides Medicare beneficiaries with the right to an immediate review by a PRO and, in some cases, certain financial protections when a hospital, with the concurrence of the attending physician, determines that the beneficiary no longer requires inpatient hospital care. To exercise the immediate review right, after receiving the hospital's notice of noncoverage, the beneficiary must request (by telephone or in writing) that the PRO review the validity of the hospital's decision. The beneficiary must make the request by noon of the first working day after receipt of the notice. The PRO then must determine within 1 full working day of the request (and receipt of pertinent information and/or records from the hospital) the appropriateness of the hospital's decision that the beneficiary no longer requires inpatient hospital care. The hospital cannot charge the beneficiary for the cost of additional hospital days until noon of the day after receipt of the PRO's determination that the hospital's decision was correct. Under current law, if the hospital (rather than the HMO or CMP) sends the discharge notice, the beneficiary is entitled to request immediate review by a PRO whether or not he or she is enrolled in an HMO or CMP. However, while a beneficiary enrolled in an HMO or CMP may be protected from being charged by the hospital, he or she is not necessarily protected from potential financial liability. If the PRO upholds the hospital's notice of noncoverage, there is no regulation prohibiting the HMO or CMP from billing the beneficiary for the extra days of care while the PRO is reviewing the case if the extra days result in additional costs to the HMO or CMP. (Depending on the payment arrangement with the hospital, it is possible that the HMO or CMP will not incur any additional costs by virtue of the patient's additional days in the hospital. For example, if there is no contract between the HMO and the hospital, the hospital may not charge more than the amount Medicare would pay. Under the prospective payment system (PPS), that amount remains the same regardless of the length of the hospital stay, unless outlier payment is involved, that is, additional payment for covered services for extended length-of-stay cases. Similarly, a contract between an HMO and a hospital might provide that the hospital is paid on a basis similar to PPS, rather than on a per diem basis.) If the HMO or CMP, rather than the hospital, makes the determination of noncoverage, the current regulations do not specifically afford an immediate PRO review right to the enrollees. Therefore, we proposed to amend §417.440 (``Entitlement to health care services from an HMO or CMP''), §417.454 (``Charges to Medicare enrollees''), and §417.604 (``General Provisions'') and add a new §417.605 (``Immediate PRO review of a determination of noncoverage of inpatient hospital care'') to provide the Medicare HMO or CMP enrollee with the same administrative review rights and financial protection as are available to beneficiaries under the fee-for-service system. We proposed to require that an HMO or CMP that has not delegated the discharge decision to the hospital and attending physician: (l) Have the concurrence of the attending physician before making a determination that an enrollee no longer needs inpatient hospital care; and (2) give the beneficiary a written notice of noncoverage that specifies the effective date of his or her liability, states why the HMO or CMP believes he or she no longer requires a hospital level of care, and explains immediate review procedures.
