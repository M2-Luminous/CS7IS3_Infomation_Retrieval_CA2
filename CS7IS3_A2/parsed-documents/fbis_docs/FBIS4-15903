FBIS4-15903 "drsov071_s_94006" FBIS-SOV-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Georgia Zugdidi, Gali Refugee Situation `Aggravated' Zugdidi, Gali Refugee Situation `Aggravated' LD1204194094 Tbilisi First Program Television Network in Georgian 1600 GMT 12 Apr 94 LD1204194094 Tbilisi First Program Television Network Georgian BFN [Text] We have learned from reliable sources that the situation in Zugdidi Rayon has been aggravated recently by a campaign conducted in Gali Rayon by Abkhaz separatists. The Abkhazians are trying to persuade the local population to influence their relatives, who fled to Zugdidi and neighboring areas, to return to Gali Rayon. They say the tragedy which took place in Gali Rayon was just a misunderstanding between the Abkhazians and Mingrelians and that it is necessary to restore traditional kinship ties between them. At the same time, the Abkhazians promise to introduce the Mingrelian language [spoken by Georgians in Mingrelia and Abkhazia] in Gali Rayon schools and to register the local population as Mingrelians. Refugees who have returned to Gali Rayon were issued with a so-called registration card, giving their nationality as Mingrelian. It seems that the agreements on the return of the refugees and on a peaceful settlement of the problem of Abkhazia reached at the recent talks have caused anxiety among the most extreme Abkhaz separatists. Therefore, they resorted to the dirtiest trick of all and decided to pit the population of Mingrelia against the rest of Georgia.
