Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim arrived in our country to sign it. It should be recalled that Bolivia and Brazil signed a partial agreement in 1983. The new agreement not only grants preferential tariffs -- which involve reduced taxes on imports -- but also provides for business cooperation and the exchange of commercial information. [Begin Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar recording] It proves the fruitful talks and exchange of viewpoints that we maintained during an active day with Foreign Minister Amorim. [end recording] There are two very important points in the joint communique. For example, Bolivia and Brazil reaffirmed their predisposition to make efforts so that the agreements between Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries and Bolivia -- aiming at allowing Bolivia's full participation -- will be given priority within the regional process. As for Bolivian-Brazilian integration in the energy field, the two ministers reiterated the importance and priority that the governments of Brazil and Bolivia have attached to the natural gas purchase contract signed by Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] and Bolivian Government Oil Deposits. [Begin Amorim recording] At this meeting I obviously could not discuss technical details because this must be done by the Petrobras people. But I believe the important thing is the political reaffirmation of our determination to develop this project, which is important for Bolivia and also very important for Brazil. [end recording] This was the conclusion of the official visit paid by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who thanked Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar for the expressions of appreciation and friendship extended to him.
