This is a clear manifestation of the firm and invariable determination and will of the Government of the Republic and all the people to brilliantly realize the plans and intent of our party, which has established the upcoming three years as a period of adjustment in the historic turning point of entering a new high stage of socialist construction and set forth a revolutionary economic strategy. As unanimously stressed again at the current SPA session, the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction set forth by our party is a most correct and revolutionary economic strategy that has proceeded from the prevailing situation, the changed international circumstances, the demands of our developing revolution, and our present economic situation. Reflected in the strategy are our party's lofty will and revolutionary intent to rapidly improve the standard of the people's living and to develop our economy into a chuche-oriented economy that is not shaken by any economic blockade of the imperialists. Our party's establishment of the adjustment period in socialist economic construction and its decision of the rewarding tasks to be fulfilled in this period is another proud demonstration of the extraordinary leadership ability of our party, which has set forth the wise and expedient tactics by familiarizing itself with the demands of the developing revolution, the rapidly changing situation, and realistic possibilities with brilliant wisdom and scientific insight and which is constantly leading the revolution and construction along a single road of victory by turning adversity into prosperity and misfortune into fortune with matchless courage and iron-like will. Successfully fulfilling the task of the adjustment period is of important significance in constantly advancing socialist construction, in firmly defending the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style, and in further enhancing its superiority and invincible vitality. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: "The revolutionary economic strategy established by our party is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy, the light industry-first policy, and the trade-first policy in the adjustment period; to firmly give priority to coal industry, power industry, and railway transportation, which are the leading sectors of the national economy; and to continuously develop the metal industry." The task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction set forth by our party is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy, the light industry-first policy, and the trade-first policy; to firmly give priority to the coal industry, power industry, and railway transportation, which are the leading sectors of the national economy; and to continue developing the metal industry. The basic goal of this revolutionary economic strategy is to completely solve the problem of the people's living by concentrating all possible efforts on developing agriculture, light industry, and trade for two to three years to come; to normalize production in all sectors by giving priority to the leading sectors of the national economy; and, thus, to fully enhance the might of the existing economic foundation. The economic task in the adjustment period is a brilliant milestone and an honorable revolutionary and rewarding struggle task, which promises a new advance in our people's struggle for socialist economic construction. When the party's revolutionary economic strategy is materialized a new turn will be effected in agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade and, thus, our people's long-cherished desire to live in tile-roofed houses, eat rice and meat soup, and wear silk clothes, will be brilliantly realized in the near future, and the people's material and cultural life will be more affluent and prosperous in conformity with the inherent nature of socialist society. At the same time, along with the development in agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade, the leading sectors of the national economy will be firmly advanced, and metal industry will also vigorously develop. As a result of this, other economic sectors will also be further strengthened, and our self-reliant economy and its might will be extraordinarily strengthened. In this way, our people will be able not only to live independently without being shaken by any economic blockade by the imperialists, relying on the firmly deepened self-reliant economic foundation and the chuche-oriented economic power, but also to brilliantly solve their food, clothing, and housing problems according to their ideal and desire and to further enhance the superiority and might of the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style. The economic task for the adjustment period presented by the party firmly guarantees a great new upsurge in our country's socialist economic construction, as well as guarantees our people a worthwhile future. As the brilliant milestone of the adjustment period was presented, our people came to have a powerful guarantee for actively coping with the prevailing situation and for firmly occupying a new attack position to reach higher uplands of socialism. Our party's presentation of the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction is vigorously arousing all the people to launch into a new struggle and register heroic feats. It also serves as a great encouragement that gives hope and faith to the progressive people of the world who is advancing toward socialism while dealing a hard blow to imperialists and reactionaries who disparage and attack socialism. All the working people should brilliantly implement the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction, with great faith and dignity in struggling with revolutionary economic strategies under the wise leadership of the great leader and the great party. The WPK report on successfully implementing the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction, which was deliberated at the recent SPA meeting, and relevant decisions adopted at the meeting are generally reflecting the goals for each unit to achieve in implementing the task for the adjustment period, the direction to push ahead with the goals, and specific measures and means to achieve them. The decisions on general measures to successfully implement the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction, which SPA made after due consideration, are obligations that our functionaries and all working people should regard as a law, a supreme order, and should completely implement. The decisions are also the SPA's task to implement through the sublime struggle to realize its aspiration and desire to achieve the growth, prosperity, and development of the country and to improve the people's welfare. All functionaries and working people should have fresh resolution and determination to become vanguards of the rank carrying out the worthwhile struggle to implement the economic tasks for the adjustment period and to become creators of miracles and feats. What is the most important here in struggling for this aim is to thoroughly understand the party's strategic intent behind the presentation of the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction and to have firm ideological resolution and determination to unconditionally implement the task. Our party's strategic intent behind its presentation of the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction is to remarkably elevate the people's living standard in a few years, to firmly strengthen the country's economy into a chuche-oriented economy that enables us to live on our own strength, and to occupy a new attack position to reach higher uplands of socialism. Only when we deeply understand the party's revolutionary intent, consider it a firm faith of ours, and fill ourselves with extraordinary resolution and stern fighting spirit to implement it without fail, can we successfully implement the immense and worthwhile task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction that we are faced with under the grave situation today. With fervent loyalty to the party and the leader, all functionaries and working people should make active efforts to deeply understand the party's idea and intent and make it their flesh and blood, as well as their firm faith. In particular, they should sincerely study and learn the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's teaching and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's remarks regarding the party's new revolutionary economic strategy, the great leader's New Year's Address, the decisions made at the 21st plenary session of the Sixth WPK Central Committee, recently announced party documents regarding the party's economic strategies, and the decisions made at the recent SPA meeting, so that they can master the basic ideology of the party's economic strategies, the strategic tasks, and the means to implement them. Along with this, they must brilliantly fulfill without fail the tasks for the adjustment period for their sector and their unit to all the more firmly consolidate the determination and will of magnificently fulfilling the revolutionary intention of the party and the leader. In particular, the state economy leadership organ and responsible functionaries in the related sectors and units must fully entrust their fate to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and have the firm determination to be able to die while on duty defending the revolutionary post. With this, they must be the standard bearer and hands and feet in upholding the party and the leader to honorably fulfill their responsible role as the commanding staff to fulfill the task for the adjustment period. Organizing the economic organization work and economic management work are a firm guarantee in successfully carrying out the task for the adjustment period. Functionaries of each class of the economy leadership organ must carefully organize the economic operation and organization work to implement a new economic strategy and party policy. They must also solve problems in the economic work at the appointed time and in a revolutionary way. All sectors and all units including the committees, ministries, and administrative and economic committees of the provinces must establish strong rules and order that thoroughly execute the Administration Council's decisions and instructions to realize the party's unitary leadership in the economic work. Also, the creativity of each unit must be highly manifested by the functionaries under the state's unitary leadership to carry out reliably the task for the adjustment period in a revolutionary way. From the principle of subordinating everything in implementing the party's new economic strategy, the economic guiding functionaries must establish the people's economy plan from a practical point of view, make it so that it can be carried out by the day, by the month, by the quarter, and by the indicators without fail, and always command the fight skillfully and with aspiration in front of the ranks and set practical examples. Along with this, in accordance with the demand of the party's economic strategy, the work to supply materials to the agricultural, light industry, and foreign trade sectors must be unconditionally carried out first, and the rest must be supplied to the other sectors. This must be carried out under the principle of thoroughly supplying necessary things to the leading sectors of the people's economy and the metal industry sector. According to the demand of the Taean work system, all the economy leadership organs, plants, and enterprises must manage and operate the economy scientifically and rationally under the collective guidance of the party committee. Also, labor management, facility management, materials management, and financial management must be improved to all the more highly manifest the true superiority of the collective economic management operation method. The production and conservation struggle must be vigorously carried out in all sectors and all units of the people's economy. With the attitude of a master, the functionaries and workers must manage the nation's economic life tenaciously and methodically, protect and manage the state's social assets, and effectively use idle materials, waste materials, and byproducts. Also, the struggle to all the more produce and effectively use the existing labor, facilities, and materials must be carried out with energy. The functionaries must bear in mind that an important reserve to produce more and conserve lies in the technological innovation. Therefore, they must go deeply into the producers to actively bring out their wisdom and creativity, motivate the patriotic enthusiasm and abilities of the scientists and technicians, and strengthen their creative cooperation with the producer masses so that many valuable scientific and technical inventions and technological innovations can be put forth. Such inventions and innovations must be made to be effectively used in production. All sectors of the people's economy must regard the sectors of agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade as if it were their own work, actively help in these sectors, and vigorously carry out an all-people's support movement for these sectors. The slogan of self-reliance and fortitude must be all the more highly upheld and thoroughly embodied in fulfilling the task for the adjustment period. The party's new economic strategy is no other than the strategy of self-reliance and fortitude, and where we carry out the work of self-reliance and fortitude lies the road to successfully fulfill the task for the adjustment period. All functionaries and working people in all sectors and units of the national economy should implement the economic task for the adjustment period while overcoming difficulties and obstacles, creating necessary things they do not have, and finding out what they lack, by displaying the same spirit and vigor as demonstrated during the period of anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, the severe days of war, and the great Chollima upswing period, upholding the party's militant slogan, "Let us vigorously accelerate the general onward march of socialism with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude." The single-hearted unity is the banner of our eternal victory in both the revolutionary struggle and economic construction. To strengthen the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks in every way is the basic guarantee for the successful implementation of the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction under the grave situation, in which the maneuver of imperialists and reactionaries to crush our Republic becomes all the more unscrupulous as days go by. Our single-hearted unity means all people's unity around the party and the leader in ideological will and moral sense of duty. It is a firm, vital, and invincible unity that no force can break. Limitless is the might of our people, who are firmly united as a strong social and political living body with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center, upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. We can occupy any fortress and overcome any obstacle when we extremely strengthen the might of this unity. All the people should arm themselves with the chuche-based revolutionary view of leader, firmly bear in mind the greatness of the party and the leader as an absolute faith, and thoroughly prepare themselves to become genuine, loyal, and filial sons and daughters who death-defyingly protect and defend the party and the leader politically and ideologically in any stormy circumstances and faithfully uphold the party's leadership. We should fully demonstrate our faithfulness to the leader [yongdoja] and more vigorously display the might of our revolutionary ranks' single-hearted unity in the course of the practice struggle to implement the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction, upholding the slogan of loyalty that we will do what the party decides. The economic task for the adjustment period is heavy and immense, and we may be faced with stumbling blocks and trials in the course of implementing it. All our people, however, bear deep in their hearts the strong will and faith that we are not afraid of any obstacle or any strong enemy as long as the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is with us. We also have the great potential coming from the powerful socialist independent economic ground with the chuche-oriented industry as the pivot. There is no force in the world that can impair the might of our people who are stoutly advancing, filled with faith in certain victory and revolutionary optimism, upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and under the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's wise leadership. Let us all keep on advancing and struggling in the spirit of Chollima, plus the speed of the nineties, firmly united around the party and the leader, upholding the banner of the three revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- and brilliantly implement the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction to occupy higher uplands of socialist construction.
