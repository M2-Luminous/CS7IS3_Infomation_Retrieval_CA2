KNSB, which is one of the two most influential labour amalgamations in the country, will probably come up with an official proposal on incomes policy countering the proposal of government experts, Mr. Neykov said. After three months of work in the Tripartite Council's subcommittees, three fundamental differences still remain between the proposals of the government and the KNSB, the confederation's Executive Secretary Mr. Georgi Georgiev told the news conference. The KNSB rejects the cabinet-proposed method of adopting projected inflation as a key element in the overall incomes policy. The amalgamation's experts claim that the 45 percent average annual inflation, projected for 1994, will be exceeded already at the start of the year. The KNSB also sees as unacceptable the government-suggested options for cost-of-living adjustment of pensions. The mechanism which is proposed now could make it impossible to abolish adjustment supplements in future, Mr. Georgiev said. Another option suggests merely a revision of the base of pension calculation and a one-time rise without adjustment payments throughout the year. The KNSB believes this will lead to an economically and socially unjustified increase of the difference between the lowest and the highest pensions. The confederation will suggest an option which will retain the inflation-related indexation of pensions. This will create conditions for a complete abolition of cost-of-living adjustment supplements to pensions in 1995, Mr. Georgiev said. The KNSB does not accept a method suggested by the Finance Ministry for wage formation and wage growth regulation in the state-financed sector. The amalgamation insists on guarantees of the availability of money for the payment of agreed wages in the state-financed sector irrespective of budget revenue, Mr. Georgiev said.
