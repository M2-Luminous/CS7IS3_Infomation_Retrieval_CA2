It is currently the most important economic issue because what is agreed today will govern this relationship for many years to come. However, Jordan continues to refrain from entering the real battle. The interest in the Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement is exaggerated. This agreement has not been signed because the Palestinian leadership does not consider it a priority, being busy pursuing more important things. It must be said that points in the draft agreement which the Palestinian leadership said needed more study are of no concern to anyone and can be deleted, and therefore, the delay in signing the agreement is intentional. We say that the Jordanian interest in the economic agreement with the PLO is exaggerated because even if it takes place, it will be no more than a moral obligation, nonbinding and inapplicable except in as much as Israel allows. The autonomy government is not empowered to negotiate with Jordan and reach agreements with it because it has no foreign policy powers and no sovereignty to reach agreements with states. Thus, the agreement is no more than an agreement of intentions with the PLO in Tunis and not with the autonomous government. Some Jordanian officials have reservations about the Paris Israeli-Palestinian economic agreement on the pretext that it does not give Jordan the economic advantages it had expected and were promised in the 7 January 1994 economic agreement with the PLO because the Palestinian side could not obtain more advantages for Jordan due to Israel's intransigence. However, the question is: Why does Jordan expect the Palestinian side, which is weak and has no sovereignty, to obtain for it rights and economic advantages in the West Bank and Gaza? Why doesn't Jordan seek these rights and advantages within the joint Jordanian-Israeli-U.S. economic committee? When will the Jordanian officials stop evading confrontation and blaming the Palestinian side for accepting an agreement that gives priority to Israel's interests at Jordan's expense? It is no secret that Mr. Yasir 'Arafat does not want strong economic relations with Jordan because he wants an independent state and is apprehensive of real or imaginary Jordanian domination. Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah Abu-Shukr, member of the negotiating Palestinian delegation, said that the delegation did not receive any instructions from the PLO leadership during the first five rounds of talks and that the delegation did not return to Tunis at all during these rounds, contrary to what used to take place during negotiations with Jordan when facsimile messages were exchanged with Tunis every half hour because Tunis had apprehensions with respect to Jordan that did not exist toward Israel.
