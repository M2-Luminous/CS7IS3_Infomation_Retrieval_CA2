As is known, Potosi peasant federation leaders first insisted that the dead person was Francisco Cruz, whose name was among those who were reported missing on 30 April. Francisco Cruz's relatives and friends were confused by the features of the face and body of the remains that were found. [passage omitted] Dozens of people insisted that they could recognize the body as belonging to Cruz, as there was an extraordinary resemblance between our fellow journalist and the features of the body that was found. In view of this reasonable piece of evidence, the mass media reported Cruz's supposed death. In his first statement, Cruz said he had been at the site of the roadblock until they were forced into the hills of (Ocoruru) on 30 October. He said he decided to leave for (Pisuri), his home town, because of security reasons and because his wife was about to give birth to their seventh child. In view of persistent reports of his death, Cruz decided to leave for Potosi at dawn yesterday, marching along with others who cheered him. Radio [name indistinct], which like other media reported Cruz's death, considered it necessary to issue a bulletin which in its main points reads: We have been able to ascertain that Francisco Cruz is alive, and that he is in Potosi to clarify reports disseminated by the mass media. In view of this, and as we have publicly expressed our firm willingness to help achieve peace in the country, we are hereby issuing this explanation so that the truth can prevail, in compliance with the teachings of the gospel that the truth will make us free.
