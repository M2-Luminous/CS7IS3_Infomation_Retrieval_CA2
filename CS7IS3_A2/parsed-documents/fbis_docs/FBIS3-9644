Prespa article: "Do the Serbs Have the Money To Colonize Kosova?"] [Text] Recent reports from Kosova mention new Serbian plans to colonize this part of former Yugoslavia. Various figures have been tossed out to the media, testifying to a fiendish policy in Belgrade to depopulate Kosova by expelling the Kosovars over the border. Fear of a Kosovar exodus is present in Albania, especially in areas bordering the former Yugoslavia. Asked about the danger of war, the Albanian authorities mention as one of the consequences a mass exodus of Albanians from Kosova toward their kin-state. Nevertheless, it seems that the Serbs want to accomplish their plans without the help of weapons, as in Bosnia, but with the aid of money. ATA reported a few days ago that Belgrade had placed an additional 400 million German marks [DM] at the disposal of Kosova colonists, with more to come. In the last four years, 120,000 Albanians have been dismissed from their jobs and about 300,000 have been forced to leave Kosova. These are alarming figures when one remembers that the population of Kosova is no more than 2.5 million Albanians or 400,000 families. A simple calculation shows that every family has been affected by exile or job dismissals. During the existence of the former Yugoslavia, colonists were brought to Kosova mainly from Croatia, Slovenia, or Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now, after the destruction of the Yugoslav community, Serbia's scope for activity has significantly narrowed and the colonists that can be cajoled into moving to Kosova are no doubt Serbs and Montenegrins. It is thought that Belgrade intends to bring 600,000 Serbs to Albanian-populated territories to change the population's ethnic structure. About 23 years ago, the Serbs forced the Kosovars to abandon their country and it is well known that hundreds of thousands of Albanians emigrated to Turkey under duress. As in the case of Bosnia, the Serbs consider the Albanians of Kosova as Muslims first and Albanians second. Nevertheless, their common nationality and language shared with the 3 million Albanians of Albania cannot be denied. Under the circumstances of the economic crisis that has engulfed the former Yugoslavia, where you need a suitcase full of dinars to buy a loaf of bread, it is astonishing to see mention of such astronomical sums, which could far better be invested in the development of Kosova. It seems that the Serbs invest for one thing alone: a Kosova without Kosovars. This would be the investment of the century, an investment to be used as an argument against anybody with any claims to Kosova and the 2 million Albanians living there. If Tirana is also aware of such figures, the Albanian Government must protest to all the international organizations, because the depopulation of Kosova would have immediate consequences for Albania. It is easy to imagine what would happen if hundreds of thousands of Kosovars were to enter Albania, forcibly expelled by Belgrade. The effects of such a policy, if it were to be tolerated, would be felt by every Albanian family from north to south, because every Albanian family would have to shelter an Albanian from Kosova. The time has come for government propaganda to sensitize the international public. Solely through the speculations of a few itinerant journalists, Belgrade has accused Tirana of militarily preparing the Kosovars for war, while remaining silent over the DM400 million and other figures. Tirana cannot accept a Kosova without Kosovars if it thinks even for a moment about Kosova and the Albanians living there and if it thinks for a moment about an Albania different from the one we have today.
