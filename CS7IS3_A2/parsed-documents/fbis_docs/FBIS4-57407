Provincial health director Dr. Pastor Castell explained that this plan seeks to gradually ensure that the necessary medicines are physically supplied by the medical-pharmaceutical industry, to perfect distribution, and to link every welfare institution to a particular pharmacy. Castell explained that the success of the new program also depends on knowing in advance what medicines these pharmacies have and, in keeping with this, prescribing those medicines to one's patients. Castell said that among the plan's objectives are to get the medications to whoever really needs them and to have the population feel satisfied. The plan will also combat speculation or illegal sales of medicines that are in short supply.
