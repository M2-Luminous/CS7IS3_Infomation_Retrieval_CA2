This was pointed out by Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the National Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], at a news conference on 10 May following a meeting of the SDS National Coordinating Council. The SDS is not sure that the prime minister will really present his plan for personnel and structural changes in the cabinet at the 11 May National Assembly session, but it hopes that the parliamentary majority will express its opinion on the draft decision on the cabinet's policy submitted by the SDS deputies. The SDS National Conference will be a closed forum. This also was decided today by the SDS National Coordinating Council.
