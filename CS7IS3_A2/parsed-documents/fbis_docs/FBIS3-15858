Tajik Opposition Agreed for the First Time To Hold Talks With Government" -- place and date not given] [Excerpts] The 6 March meeting of Russian diplomats with leaders of the warring Tajikistani opposition in Tehran has become an event of primary importance for the CIS' southern regions. Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy foreign minister, who headed the Russian delegation, gave an interview to Sanobar Shermatova. [Shermatova] Anatoliy Leonidovich, have the talks produced any results? [Adamishin] Two basic agreements have been reached. The opposition has for the first time agreed to sit down at the negotiating table with the government. Earlier, they refused to do so, wishing to speak directly to the "masters," as they called Moscow. The second point is that they agreed to come to Moscow for the first meeting (previously they mentioned Tehran or Geneva, fearing Tajik hitmen and being not completely sure that they will have adequate security in Moscow). This is understandable, given that very recently the Tajikistan prosecutor's office ruled that opposition chiefs are guilty and launched a search for them. Meanwhile, Tajikistan and Russia have an agreement on legal assistance... Before going to Tehran, I met with Tajikistan Supreme Soviet Chairman Emomali Rakhmanov, who guaranteed the opposition absolute security at the talks. [passage omitted] [Shermatova] You met with leaders of the warring opposition for the first time. What impression did they produce on you? [Adamishin] Both Mr. Turadzhonzoda and Mr. Khimmatzoda are people to talk to. As for former Tajik Foreign Minister Khudayberdy Khaliknazarov, I met with him earlier and this is a serious person. [passage omitted] [Shermatova] Tightly tied in the Tajik knot are sometimes conflicting interests of various circles in Dushanbe, Tashkent, Moscow, Kabul, and Tehran. What is your forecast for the evolution of events? [Adamishin] I do not expect quick results from the talks; to all appearances, they will be difficult and prolonged, all the more given the great human suffering and losses sustained by both warring sides in Tajikistan. But there is no other way -- either talks or further bloodshed. There can be no winners in civil war. [passage omitted]
