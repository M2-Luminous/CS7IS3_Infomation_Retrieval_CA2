Is South Africa directly involved? [Chikoty] Yes, we know that South Africa continues to deny that. As you know, recently there was a court case involving three South African pilots accused of ferrying weapons from South Africa to Angola in 1993. That confirms what we have been saying all along. We also know that there is an important logistical base in Zaire. It is headed by Colonel (Karizer). You should know that I was also a UNITA member. Col. (Karizer) lives in Kinshasa, and he supervises all the logistical aid earmarked for UNITA camps. Basically, all neighboring countries -- namely, Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia have revealed that in 1993 a considerable number of aircraft from South Africa overflew their territories and landed in southern and eastern Angola. Now the aircraft land in Zaire and then proceed to Angola. So, as you can see Zaire and South Africa are involved in the dispute. UNITA enjoys a great deal of assistance. UNITA has offices in the United States, Portugal, England, and France. We do not know what form of assistance they get from the governments of those countries, though we think there is a degree of tolerance. We believe UNITA has become a terrorist organization now that elections have been held in Angola. There is no justification for the claim that UNITA is fighting communism in Angola and for human rights and democracy. We believe the cold war is over. The only way of assisting Angola's democratic development is to stop the war. One cannot allow UNITA to destroy everything and kill innocent people.
