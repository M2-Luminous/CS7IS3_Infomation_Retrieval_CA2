This primarily concerns a return to clearing, the elimination of the National Bank of Belarus and, as a consequence, the direct refinancing of Belarusian banks by the Central Bank of Russia and Central Bank provision of loans to the Belarus Government. Speaking at a news conference, Bogdankevich stressed that not one of these points -- as well as a number of others -- was in the agreement signed between Belarus and Russia on 5 September 1993. Given this turn of events, the chairman of the National Bank believes that it is essential for politicians to invite in the experts to work out a joint decision, since private meetings between the two premiers are unproductive. After every such meeting, the demands of Russian experts become increasingly tough. If, however, the Russian side is ready to return to the already agreed position, then Belarus will not delay in joining the single ruble zone, Bogdankevich stated.
