On Friday [11 March], Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel did not want to confirm to the press in Bonn that the arrested man worked for the BND, but it was reported in a statement from the Chancellor's Office that the Moscow counterintelligence service had confirmed the arrest of a Russian citizen. However, effects on Russian-German relations were not feared. In answer to an inquiry, the BND refused to make any statement. Vogel continued by saying that it is a fact that intelligence services exist all over the world. Their work need not always have political effects. The intelligence services of Germany and Russia also cooperate in several respects. Vogel pointed out that official representatives of the German and Russian intelligence services are accredited in the embassies in Moscow or Bonn. In this way, cooperation, for example in the field of drugs and the combating of terrorism, is possible. The Russian counterintelligence service has not been able to produce any proof of intelligence service activities of the arrested man. The Chancellor's Office statement says that Bernd Schmidbauer, coordinator responsible for the German intelligence services, had a long and exhaustive talk with Safanov, deputy head of the Russian counterintelligence service, on Friday morning. "Mr. Safanov confirmed the arrest of a Russian citizen, but he made it clear at the same time that, from Russia's point of view, the affair is of no consequence for the political relations with the FRG." According to the Chancellor's Office, the open questions are to "be clarified exclusively in a constructive way at the level of the intelligence services," it was stated. Accordingly, Schmidbauer discussed the further proceedings with his partner in the talks. In the talks, the Russian side did not report on any details about the arrested person or on available proof of activities on behalf of a foreign intelligence service, it was stated. In Bonn security circles, it was stated that there might be a connection with the espionage affair around Aldrich Ames in Washington. On 21 February, Ames, a high-ranking employee of the U.S. intelligence service, the CIA, and his wife Maria Rosario were arrested on suspicion of espionage for Russia in the United States. The U.S. intelligence services had found the supposed double agent Ames, who is charged with the death of 10 U.S. agents, with the help of Stasi intelligence service documents. Security experts have assumed that the BND man in Moscow might have been exposed by information from Ames.
