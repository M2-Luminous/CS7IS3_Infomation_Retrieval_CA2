FR940802-0-00025 FR940802-0-00008 b. Senate_ The legislative history in the Senate likewise shows a desire to broaden EPA's authority in this area. The bill reported out of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works started from a more restrictive position and authorizing EPA to: (1) *␣*␣* promulgate regulations establishing specifications for fuel quality which will minimize, to the extent economically and technically achievable, emissions [of various pollutants] *␣*␣*. (2) In order to achieve and maintain attainment of ambient air quality standards, the Administrator may promulgate regulations *␣*␣* establishing specifications for fuels (including regulations requiring the availability or sale of fuels meeting the specifications in a nonattainment area or areas) to reduce emissions of pollutants subject to a standard under this title or hazardous air pollutants from motor vehicles. In establishing such specifications and availability requirements the Administrator shall consider other environmental effects which would result from production and use of fuels meeting the specifications. 5 5 S. Rep. at 639&hyph;40. The relevant portions of the Mitchell-Dole substitute, Amendment No. 1293, debated on the floor of the Senate, were identical to the bill reported out of the Senate Committee. 5 Leg. Hist. at 7552&hyph;54. This provision is much narrower than that reported out of the House Committee. The authority to establish ``specifications'' is clearly limited to specifications to reduce emissions of specified pollutants, and the specifications are limited to those aimed at achieving and maintaining attainment of the NAAQS. It also clearly requires that such specifications and requirements be written as performance standards. Most of the amendments and debate on this provision focused on a number of detailed minimum requirements that parallel the current reformulated gasoline provisions found in section 211(k)(2) though (10). However, certain very important changes were made to the general authority provisions. First, the second paragraph of the provision was replaced in its entirety with broader language that more closely parallels the version adopted by the House. The Senate approved a floor amendment by Senator Daschle requiring that: The Administrator, pursuant to paragraph (1) *␣*␣* promulgate regulations establishing specifications for reformulated gasoline to be used in conventional gasoline fueled vehicles [in specified ozone nonattainment areas]. 6 6 3 Leg. Hist. at 4383&hyph;88, 4 Leg. Hist. at 6816&hyph;18. This amendment removed the limitation that the specifications could only be designed to reduce emissions and achieve and maintain attainment, significantly broadening EPA's authority. Nonetheless, the provision passed by the Senate was narrower than the House bill. Even though paragraph one of the provision was somewhat similar to the second sentence of current section 211(k)(1), the Senate bill did not contain a general grant of authority as found in the first sentence of section 211(k)(1). It also more narrowly authorized EPA to establish specifications, instead of requirements. c. Conference Committee Bill_ The Conference Committee on the House and Senate bills rejected the Senate's narrower limits on general authority and instead reported out the broader, more general authority provision found in the House bill. 7 This provision was then adopted in the final bill. This legislative history indicates that both houses, to different degrees, moved to broaden the agency's authority to implement the reformulated gasoline program. The final bill adopted by Congress rejected the narrower approach from the Senate and instead approved the more general language from the House. While there was little discussion of this, the textual changes described above lead to the conclusion that Congress intended to provide EPA with broad general authority to establish regulatory requirements for reformulated gasoline. There are no indications that Congress intended otherwise. EPA's interpretation is therefore fully consistent and supported by this legislative history. 7 1 Leg. Hist. at 1548.
