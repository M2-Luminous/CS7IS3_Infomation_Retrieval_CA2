The German Government will continue to abide by the decision made by the Federal Security Council to ban submarine export to Taiwan, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today on behalf of Minister Claus Kinkel. Meanwhile, an Economic Ministry spokesman told reporters that the German Government had ruled out the possibility of exporting submarines to Taiwan via the United States a year before, adding that no German shipyards are currently applying for such exports. The denials followed reports in HANDELSBLATT and some other German papers that Germany may ship parts of submarines to the United States to be assembled there for sale to Taiwan. The reports said the deal is related to Germany's export of high- speed trains to Taiwan. On January 28, 1993, the German Federal Security Council had rejected requests from business circles for exporting submarines and corvettes to Taiwan.
