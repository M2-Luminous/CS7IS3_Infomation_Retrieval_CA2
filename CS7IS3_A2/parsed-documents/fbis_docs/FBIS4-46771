Second--the pro-government leaders: Viktor Chernomyrdin, Sergey Shakhray and others. They collected 5 percent. Last--the leaders of the irreconcilable opposition: Sergey Baburin, Gennadiy Zyuganov and Aman Tuleyev. Their supporters numbered 3 percent. The other politicians collected an insignificant number of votes. Around 15 percent of the respondents declined to answer the question. Boris Yeltsin leads in practically all the socio-demographic groups. The only exception is managers, specialists, students and the unemployed. In the first group, Aleksandr Rutskoy is in first place, and in the next two Grigoriy Yavlinskiy is the leader, while unemployed persons give preference to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. This represents an alarming symptom, considering the possible sharp increase in unemployment already this year. Among several of the groups, the leader of the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] edges out Grigoriy Yavlinskiy from second into third place. Thus, he is preferred by men as a whole, blue-collar workers, persons with little education, as well as those with per capita monthly income below 50,000 rubles (R). The former vice president is in stable fourth position, but among white-collar workers and students he is more popular than Zhirinovskiy. They place him in the third position, as do persons with per capita monthly income of from R100,000 to R149,000. We must add also that in such an important region as Moscow, Aleksandr Rutskoy is in second place, attracting the sympathies of 7 percent of Moscow residents. However, the positions of Boris Yeltsin are strongest in the capital--here 22 percent of the respondents are ready to vote for him. Yegor Gaydar makes it into the top three only in groups of entrepreneurs and among persons with income above R150,000. Table 1 presents the results in greater detail. For the present day, the president maintains the leading positions among urban residents, yielding them in groups with low level of adaptation. Moreover, the democratically oriented "unadapted" persons choose Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, while Vladimir Zhirinovskiy wins out among those who have found themselves in the worst situation. These two politicians aspire to second place in the presidential race. Their chances of winding up in a hypothetical run-off are equal. Aleksandr Rutskoy, who was right behind the leader, i.e., the president, up until September of last year, has fallen behind and has been unable to regain the second position in the months following the day of dismissal. Yegor Gaydar has practically no chance to enter the finals. Even among those who voted for the "Choice of Russia" block in December of 1993, 40 percent gave their sympathies to Boris Yeltsin, and only 11 percent would vote for the leader of the block.

Table 2 presents the structure of values which respondents consider to be the most important for Russia and its future. The first column presents the responses of all the population, the second gives the responses of those who at the hypothetical elections would vote for Boris Yeltsin, and so forth (see table). As we can see, the overwhelming majority of the respondents consider the most important thing to be "law and order and legality." This demand unites all the groups, with the exception of the supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. If we consider that the latter put the need for a "strong leader" in first place, evidently they believe that if there will be such a leader (Zhirinovskiy), he will bring about order. Ranking second is the "social protection of the population," whose importance evokes practically no doubt in anyone. Here again, the supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy comprise the exception. The demand for "strong authority, a real leader," which is ranked third in importance, fully reflects the paternalistic tendencies retained in society. Then again, no one wants to reject such a concept as "adherence to human rights and freedoms," which 10 years earlier was no more than a "figure of speech." We must remember that the proposed responses represent a certain stamp, but their meanings vary depending on the values of the respondent. The most obvious example of this is the attitude of supporters of Boris Yeltsin and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, on one hand, and those of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Aleksandr Rutskoy on the other to the concept of a "hard, freely convertible ruble." While the former believe that a convertible ruble may be achieved only under a "free market economy" (for them it is always more important than the "ruble"), the latter understand the "convertible ruble" as a ruble which is ordered to be convertible--a set ruble exchange rate and fixed prices. The concept of a "free market economy" does not even enter into the top ten priorities for supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Aleksandr Rutskoy. Behind the concept of "good neighborly relations with other countries and peoples," there is hidden the well-known expression, "just so there is no war." It is interesting that the supporters of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, and especially Aleksandr Rutskoy, are ready to part with such relations for purposes of "restoring the USSR and Soviet power." One thing that draws attention to itself is the fact that the supporters of the leader of the LDPR--the only ones out of all the groups--believe such a concept as a "Russian national state" to be important. They have ranked it in fourth place, while for the others it is not even in the top ten priorities. Summarizing all of the above, we may say that the proponents of one or another political leader are quite similar to their chosen candidate. Their collective portraits appear approximately as follows: The "Yeltsinists"--compared with the population as a whole or with the proponents of other leaders--are more pro-market and pro-democratically oriented. The "Yavlinists" are rather similar to the proponents of Yeltsin, although for them "social fairness" is more important than "social protection of the population." In other words, they are populists to a greater degree than are the "Yeltsinists." the "Zhirinovtsy" are supporters of a firm hand and a Russian national state. However, they cannot be considered "red" in the same degree as the supporters of the former vice-president. On the other hand, Aleksandr Rutskoy is specifically the leader of the "reds," at least for the present moment. The survey was conducted at the request of the newspaper SEGODNYA from 14 through 18 May, using a representative sampling of the urban population of Russia. A total of 1,620 persons were polled.
