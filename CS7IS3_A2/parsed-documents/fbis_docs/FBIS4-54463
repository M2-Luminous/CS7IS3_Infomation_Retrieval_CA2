They did not want to disclose where they obtained this information, saying only that it came "from well-informed sources." In their opinion the arrival of the Turks in Macedonia will be decisively opposed by both the Serbian and the Macedonian population. They assessed this deployment as an attempt to destabilize this area, adding that the only guarantee of peace and stability in this part of the Balkans was the arrival of Russian "Blue Helmets" as part of the UN Protection Forces.
