He also talked about the daily violence taking place in Algeria: [Begin Sifi recording] On the domestic front, we are determined to fight without respite against violence and terrorism until they are eradicated. Our external security is closely linked to the security of the Maghreb and the security of the Mediterranean region. This is why our message should be as clear as possible. It is in the interests of neither our neighbors nor our European partners that Algeria remain unstable for a long time or that a regime contrary to our traditions and human rights emerges. Europe knows that and knows that it is in its interests to see us through. That is why we are in a hurry to reach a new Algerian-European cooperation agreement that takes into account the changes that have taken place in our economy and our new vision of our relations with Europe.
