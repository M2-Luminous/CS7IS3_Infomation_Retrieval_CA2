"There are good opportunities to further develop the constructive and businesslike relationship which also exists between the two countries' parliaments," Rybkin said today in an interview with the DDP/ADN news agency in Moscow. This aim will also be served by his first visit to Germany as chairman of the State Duma. Rybkin will come to Germany next week on Wednesday [11 June] as the head of a Duma delegation. Germany's experiences in the development of a democratic and economically strong social state could be very useful for Russia. "In this connection, we want to acquaint ourselves with the move of the economy in the former East Germany from central planning to market economy principles," said Rybkin, who was elected chairman of the Duma on 14 January. The solution of this problem is a priority for Russia, too, to further advance reforms. Rybkin, who described his relationship with President Boris Yeltsin as "very good and constructive," came out in favor of continuing the democratic and economic reforms in his country. However, the changes must be well considered and implemented with the required social provision. "The time of quick decisions is past," the Duma chairman stressed. Russians have the capabilities and the will decisively to improve their lives. "But this requires effort from everyone every day -- from the president down to the ordinary citizen."
