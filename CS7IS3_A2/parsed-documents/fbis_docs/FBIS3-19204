Over the weekend Lower Austria's Governor Erwin Proell demanded that the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] check whether Western safety standards can be achieved at least at a rudimentary level during the expansion of the nuclear power plant. In addition, Proell called for a referendum on nuclear power in the Czech Republic. On Sunday [13 March] Johannes Hawlik, environment spokesman of the Viennese section of the Austrian People's Party, called for an antinuclear policy including an antinuclear coordinator in the chancellor's office the establishement of a 1-billion schilling Eastern Ecological Fund to promote alternative energies and higher energy efficiency. Peter Marizzi, federal manager of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, said that in the future the Austrian people will think twice whether they should buy products of the U.S. company Westinghouse, which reequips Temelin with safety technology on the basis of Eximbank financing. The Global 2000 environmentalist organization is taking hope from a letter by Democratic Congressman John D. Dingell, dated 10 March 1994, to Eximbank President Kenneth Brody. In this letter Dingell, chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House of Representatives, requests all relevant documents for a "review" of the Eximbank guarantees for Temelin by 25 March. Global 2000 doubts that the Eximbank even has the requested documents.
