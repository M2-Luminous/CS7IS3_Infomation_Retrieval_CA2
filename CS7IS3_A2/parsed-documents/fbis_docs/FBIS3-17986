And that accords with our peoples' aspirations," stated Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev at a meeting with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov in which representatives of business circles and the intelligentsia took part. This meeting was a kind of summing up of the results of the Kazakhstan leader's first official visit to Russia. Nursultan Nazarbayev shared with those present his thoughts about the situation in Kazakhstan and Russia and the prospects for the development of bilateral relations. In particular he noted that he does not agree with the model of the reforms which have been implemented in Russia. Privatization from below has not succeeded and "has merely led to chaos" so Kazakhstan has decided to create state holding companies. In agriculture they have rejected the privatization of land and allowed its leasing for a period of 99 years with the right of inheritance. Kazakhstan has taken the path of retaining strong collective and state farms but on new terms. Here those who want to can always leave and start their own business when they have received their share. The president dwelled in detail on the nationalities problem. He said that it has arisen as a result of the collapse of "one state in which we all lived." Then Kazakhstan "was pushed out of the ruble zone" and that merely created additional difficulties for people. "If there was the certainty that dual citizenship would make it possible to resolve the problem, we would introduce it. But in this case the problem would still remain at the daily routine level." Nursultan Nazarbayev stated that as president of a sovereign state he cannot accept the formation that is the CIS. Of the 270 documents adopted by the CIS one of its members has approved 40, another 140, another 150. By creating independent states all former republics of the USSR hoped that they would sell their goods to Europe and receive dollars in exchange. But it has turned out that we had a common market and our goods were only necessary to us. "The time has come for a tougher association," he said. A Eurasian Union based on principles completely distinct from the present community could be such an association, the president said.
