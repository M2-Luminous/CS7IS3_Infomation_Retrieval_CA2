Has trust been established once again among the factions, and have both the incidental and basic disputes been settled? What is the future of Yemen's situation in view of this document, and how is it possible to put it into practice? 'UKAZ brought up these questions with some experts, and here are their opinions. Dr. 'Abdallah al-Qabba', professor of political science at King Sa'ud University: Gaps in Document Threaten to Paralyze It If we take a careful look at the population map, economic situation, and political legacy of both parts of Yemen, we will find that the atmosphere that led to the unification of the two countries was, and still is, characterized by a type of suspicion and mistrust. We would also find that the tribal mentality, difference in political experience, and disagreement in views are some of the factors that have prevented the achievement of an ideal pattern of unity anticipated by the Yemenis. Due to lack of clarity, the fact that political leaders resorted to delusions and wishful thinking, and refusal to recognize reality, the Yemeni experiment was pregnant with a host of contradictions and surprises, leaving the field wide open for individual interpretations and an approach that is unregulated, undisciplined, and does not involve political practices that possess modern administrative and constitutional frameworks. Yemen's experience has been that of using assassination as a means of expressing protest and lack of satisfaction during past regimes, and the current ruling elite still deals with its opponents and enemies in this fashion and with this mentality. We often find expressions of this in the ethics of political acts in Yemen as well as in the terms used by thinkers and political parties. Although Yemen's modern political history has already witnessed many reconciliation agreements--in particular, those which took place in Cairo, Tripoli, Kuwait, and Sudan--many people interested in Yemeni affairs are still hoping for success in the case of the Pledge and Accord Document which everyone prays will solve the problems that still exist between the two leadership groups that are fighting for power in Yemen. Without entering into the details of the document, we hope that Yemen's leaders will rise to the occasion of the events and give priority to the factors of stability, and particularly that wisdom triumph over personal interests and aspirations and that disputes over trivialities not lead to a destructive civil war. The Pledge and Accord Document is full of gaps and holes. There is also fear that there will once again be a dispute concerning interpretation of clauses dealing with local rule, merging the armed forces, and the right of disposal of public wealth and resources, and that this will lead to total paralysis of this agreement and consequently a return to the sanctioning of division and fragmentation of the country, as a prelude to a situation that could be even more deadly for Yemen and its people. Hassan al-Mudallal, Yemeni writer: The Time-Bomb Agreement The agreement that bears a promising and ambitious name is called the "Pledge and Accord Document," and was made by the parties who took part in the Political Forces Dialogue for Building a Modern Yemeni State. It was an emergency rescue action that can, at best, be effective during its first phase. Although the agreement has created an atmosphere of optimism, it is necessary to call attention to the time bombs contained within it. These time bombs could cause matters to revert to their previous state or even worse, particularly since some people have already begun to speak of "victories." It is clear that the agreement, in large part, constitutes a response to the document of eighteen points drawn up by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] during the beginning of the crisis. This is something that has made it possible for some people to talk about "victories," and something that has postponed, by a few months, the matter of taking up issues that require the establishment of an immediate mechanism for implementation, such as the merging of the armed forces, the anchoring in place of administrative decentralization, and the fear that a dispute will erupt once again concerning this point--which, it appears, was one of the basic reasons for the outbreak of the crisis. Verbal duels took place between the leaders of the General People's Congress [GPC] and the YSP just a few days after the agreement was arrived at. This has not allowed Yemenis to feel reassured and has impelled 'Abdallah al-Jifri, a member of the National Dialogue Committee and the leader of the People's Congress Party, to say that he does not believe that the parties of the coalition will implement the Pledge and Accord Document because it lacks a sound mechanism for implementation. He adds that these parties do not trust each other, and that this makes it difficult for them to implement the agreement. Some observers point out that what is happening is a postponement of the big explosion. Others believe that the Yemenis have chosen an appropriate moment to make a detour in order to avoid falling into the abyss of a civil war. Only a few believe that the agreement constitutes a firm basis for putting an end to the political crisis that is occurring in Yemen, particularly since the two parties in the crisis, during the last few months, have undertaken redoubled efforts to create ruptures in the fabric of Yemen. At this juncture, two things have to be pointed out. First of all, a large segment of the Yemenis consider that the agreement recently arrived at is more important than the act of unification itself. Secondly, stability is what is demanded regionally and internationally, in addition to the fact that stability is demanded by the Yemeni people who are very anxious to preserve the unity and stability of their country from destruction by contentious parties. Dr. Hasan Abu-Talib, head of the International Affairs Unit at AL-AHRAM's Strategic Studies Center: The Search for Mechanisms for Implementation There are several contradictory trends taking place at the same time in Yemen. Since the Document of Pledge [and Accord] was arrived at on 18 January of this year, after a dialogue that lasted four continuous months between all the political forces, reaching [actual] agreement still is a matter that faces a number of obstacles. They began with the problem of officially signing the document--which was accomplished yesterday. However, there is another problem, which is that of the appropriate mechanism for the implementation of the clauses written in the document, particularly since the political forces that participated in its formulation have felt that it represents a way out of the economic and political crisis that has been devastating the country for about the last two years. After reading the document, my first remark is that it is an extremely comprehensive document. It will require tremendous political effort, whether from the leglislative or the procedural point of view, or even from the standpoint of making a series of great decisions that will affect the general social, political, and economic realms of the nation. It is our belief that the fact that the agreement arrived at represents a positive development. However, this positive aspect faces a series of obstacles, as we have indicated. On the negative side, there is a series of collapses that have been taking place in various realms, both economic and security-related. This is also happening in the sense that Yemen's citizens have a profound feeling that there is a deeply-rooted crisis and that there are a large number of disputes between the political forces, both those participating in the coalition and those not participating in this coalition. Dr. Siraj Zamzami, professor of political science at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz University: How Can We Deal With the Mountain of Contradictions? It is difficult for anyone following the "thermometer" of the political temperature in Yemen to provide even an approximate picture of the future prospects for Yemen after the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document, and there are numerous reasons why this is so. One reason is that there are areas of dispute that go beyond what was mentioned in the text of the document. This document, as such, could be considered to be an indicator of the intensity of the sources of disharmony in the political thought of the parties concerned, in spite of the sincerity of feelings and the desire to proceed toward anchoring the foundations of unity and non-fragmentation and not to fall back into the traps of engaging in verbal hostility or taking up arms against each other. If we take a cursory glance at the text of the document, we find that there are 33 articles and about 180 paragraphs and semi-paragraphs. Some of the paragraphs, if they are to be implemented, would require the services of an integrated government apparatus. This alone is sufficient to cause analysts to have the desire to decisively say that the document will be tantamount to a temporary or competing constitution. On the other hand, bringing up all the fears and solutions and coming to agreement concerning them confirms what was said by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, member of the General Committee of the GPC and head of the Political Bureau's delegation in the National Dialogue Committee: "We are prepared to accept anything in order to ensure the survival of our united Yemeni nation." Perhaps the document's conclusion prophesies in advance the role that must be played by all of the main forces in the coalition or those who are outside the power structure: "Implementation of this document, in accordance with what is mentioned in it, would constitute a strong basis for reforming our country's political and economic situation and would pull it out of all of its crises. This will require a strong political will which is united both in terms of word and deed in our actions and activity, as well as keeping promises, being sincere, and being committed....as long as our goal is that of maintaining unity." There is no doubt that marathon-like exhaustive efforts were expended in order to formulate the Pledge and Accord Document in such a way that it would please all of the parties participating in the government. The parties signed it because they were not prepared to take historical responsibility for causing the agreement to fail. This is in spite of the fact that there are many strong indicators that the situation in Yemen is becoming increasingly complicated and causes one to have serious doubts as to whether it is possible to implement the agreement because of the huge mountains of debris that have been dumped onto the crossroads of its paths in an attempt to obstruct it after it was signed. This is because the military and security-related problem, which the agreement began to deal with, could be solved if the soldiers returned to their barracks and if responsibility for taking care of internal security issues were once again put into the hands of the authorities [normally] concerned with them. But the fact is, apparently, that the crisis exists because of the lack of bases for the existence of elements of trust between the two pivots of the triangular pyramid. Mr. Muhammad Basindwah, the minister of foreign affairs, has already said: "Yemen is experiencing an undeclared break-up." Perhaps it is experiencing a break-up inside its united leadership, not to mention the traditional trend of the provinces to serve as alternatives to the system of hereditary local power structures. Perhaps the recently-held al-Mukalla conference provides an indicator of these inclinations. But objectivity also obliges an analyst to attempt to seize upon some of the merits of the document and see in them, in case they are put into practice, a better political future that will guarantee Yemen the stability to turn the wheels of the slumping Yemeni economy and bring trust back to the masses....who know that a united caravan is better than one that is split up, especially if it goes in the same wrong direction.
