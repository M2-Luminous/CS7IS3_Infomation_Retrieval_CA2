On 3 and 4 February three working committees were formed to prepare reports on these issues for the National Council, taking into consideration the grass-roots discussions held in each department. Thus a consensus agenda was approved, and the National Council session was scheduled for 19 February. However, suddenly a devious maneuver took place, an ambush prepared by some small departmental groups, led by the Managua delegation, which persuaded the National Council not to discuss the points on the agenda, but only one point: the internal strengthening of the JS. The National Council was persuaded to discuss issues that Managua had been working on for the last eight months. A document different from the agenda document was presented, prepared by the Managua general secretary, using biased arguments that had nothing to do with what the national committee had approved for presentation to the council. In the discussion it was said that the JS coordinator and deputy coordinator should be removed; the discussion on how we should now be preparing for our work with Nicaraguan youth was simply ignored. Ambushing Unity There was a vote. The Chinandega departmental committee--which had only five of its 19 comrades present, and because of financial problems had been forced to make a selection of its delegates--also fell into the ambush that had been prepared, and withdrew in protest, as did the delegations from Granada and Leon. This has created a definite division in Sandinist Youth, a division brought about by the National Council, even though we have been strong advocates of remaining open-minded and not taking positions on the different currents of opinion in the FSLN. We have been promoting a JS leadership that works to strengthen the party, without trying to back or strengthen individual personalities in the front, but rather the party as a whole. In the vote, 45 voted for the partial removal of the national committee--this included the coordinator and deputy coordinator--and 34 were opposed to this action. It was suggested that the secretary for international relations be left in place so as not to disrupt work in this area. The consequences for JS are now sadly negative: there has been an obvious polarization. For example, Bluefields and Esteli were not present and Nueva Segovia and Rivas were opposed to the results of that vote. The Matagalpa delegation's vote was divided, and only Managua voted unanimously. According to the bylaws, the only thing the National Council can do, once 70 percent of its members are in agreement, is to convene an Extraordinary National Assembly to choose new national officers. This is going to have a negative impact on our international relations, as we serve as the vice president for youth in the IS [Socialist International] and in COPPAL [Permanent Conference of Latin American Political Parties]. Damage has already been done both to JS and to the FSLN itself. Seeking a Mature and Honest Solution The saddest thing is that in order to bring Sandinist Youth into line with a particular position in relation to currents of opinion in the FSLN, they had to get rid of those of us who thought and who continue to think that JS should be broad and openminded, and that instead of taking positions, it should help create consensus within the party. This action has been instigated by a group that proposed that Sandinist Youth be defined and guided on the basis of a position in the FSLN. It would not have happened if the general coordination of JS had already taken one position or another among the FSLN currents of opinion. JS should not ignore the debate, but it should try to focus the debate within the confines determined by the FSLN's organic roots, without trying to create a position of dominance for a specific current of opinion. Unfortunately, this has already created a clear division among youth. The only solution that I see now is for each departmental committee of Sandinist Youth to discuss this situation with its grass-roots members, and with the national leaders who were disregarded, because in no department was there any discussion with the grass-roots members about a decision that emanated from the Sixth National Assembly of Sandinist Youth held in November 1992. The grass-roots members are the only ones who can decide on new Sandinist Youth officers. I appeal to all JS members to demand their right to decide in such an important situation. It is up to the members of JS to seek a political solution that is viable, acceptable, mature, and honest.
