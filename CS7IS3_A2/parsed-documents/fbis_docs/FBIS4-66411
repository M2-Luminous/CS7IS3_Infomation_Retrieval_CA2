Nagoya Institute of Technology, Chubu Electric Power Co. Develop Bi-Based Superconductor by Crystallized Glass Method 94FE0284A Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Dec 93 p 6--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0284A Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Nagoya Institute of Technology's Professor Yoshihiro Abe, et al., in cooperation with the Chubu Electric Power Company, has developed a new way to produce a high-temperature superconductor encased in metal tubing. Using a crystallized glass method, melted bismuth-base material is poured into a tube-shaped container (mold) made of an inactive metal such as silver, where it is solidified, formed, then reheated while still in the container, thereby becoming superconductive. The unique feature of this method is that a substance such as silver oxide, which releases oxygen at a high temperature and does not easily obstruct superconductivity is added to the startup raw material in advance so that superconductivity is achieved without supplying oxygen during the heating process. This is being noted as an easy method to produce superconductors with complex shapes, such as silver-shielded superconducting coil. To make superconductors practical, they need to be formed into wire, coils, pipes and many other shapes, but it is very difficult to do this with bismuth-based materials using powder-pressing or sintering, the methods normally used. In contrast, the crystallized glass method, the target of Professor Abe's R&D, can be used to make any shape because the startup raw material is melted at temperatures from 1000�C to 1400�C, poured into a container with the desired shape, and cooled and solidified quickly. However, superconductors made with this method are not superconductive at the solidification stage. Thus to become superconductive, the external container had to be removed, then the substance heated when air or oxygen could be supplied. To achieve phase 223 and other superconducting crystals, oxygen must be supplied to change univalent copper ions in the startup raw material to bivalent copper ions. It was thought, therefore, that superconductivity could not be achieved if the heat process was applied when the material was in a non-oxygen state of being shielded by a metal container. Methods are being studied to make bismuth-base superconductors into wire, either by cladding the wire with metal or by drawing the wire while already clad. Since processing would be greatly simplified if the metal container could become the shielding material, Professor Abe, et al., studied ways to achieve superconductivity while the material remained in the metal container, and tried to resolve the oxygen supplying problem by adding silver oxide to the startup raw material. The breakthrough occurred when it was found that most of the univalent copper ions became bivalent by the release of oxygen from silver oxide at high temperatures. Addition of silver oxide to the startup raw material to raise critical current density has been tried with the sintering method, but this was the first time that it was revealed that it was possible to achieve superconductivity through reheating without oxygen or in a vacuum by the crystallized glass method. Experiments with thin, long, tube-shaped containers made of silver have been successful, and it is hoped that this can be developed as a practical way to fabricate superconductors.
