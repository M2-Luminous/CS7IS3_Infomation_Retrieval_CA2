If the Vatican's policy has been criticized, this is because we look at the Vatican as one of this world's states. We distinguish between this state and Christianity, which is one of the heavenly religions. However, it is our duty to draw the Vatican's attention to the dangers involved in making peace or normalizing relations with the state of Israel and admitting, one way or another, the commission of a sin against the Jewish people. The state of Israel was proclaimed as a result of the Western Nazi's persecution of the Jewish people. And thence came the tragedy of the Palestinian people. Today the Vatican recognizes the state of Israel. This recognition may involve a second crime against the Arab people, with all their subdivisions and sects. We are entitled to draw attention to the possible political, ideological, and cultural implications of that recognition for the Arab world. 2. The stand taken by the Coptic Church, led by struggler Pope Shanudah, reiterated that the danger involved in normalizing relations with Israel--with Zionism--will harm Christians and Muslims alike. Pope Shanudah's stance is a historic one that goes back to pharaonic times and the Jews' exodus from Egypt during Moses' time. The Copts are the heirs of the Pharaohs, the original Egyptian natives. Even after Arab and Islamic conquests, the Copts without hesitation stood by Egypt's rulers, Arabs and Muslims alike, to confront foreign invasions, Crusades and otherwise. It is no coincidence that Salah-al-Din built them a church close to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem--the Dayr-al-Sultan Church. It is also no coincidence that Coptic figures assumed high- ranking positions, including ministers of finance and war during Salah-al-Din's time and later during Muhammad 'Ali's time. The name of [former Egyptian Prime Minister] Makram 'Ubayd was associated with that of Sa'd Zaghlul in rejecting the British mandate. This genuinely nationalist church has taken many other historic stances. The latest of these was when Pope Shanudah rejected the Camp David accords and was exiled by al-Sadat to the desert. That is why we always distinguish between the policy of the church, whether in the Vatican or in Lebanon, and the Christian people. We affirm that the return of the refugees will continue at the various levels and that it will not be affected by a statement made here or there. We appeal to the Egyptian opposition not to attack the Copts. Negotiations were forced on the Arabs by the United States. But the future of Arabs, Muslims and Christians, and the future of the Islamic region, are still in our hands. If we act properly, we can stand fast, even in peace, against the Zionist political, cultural, and economic hazards. In the cultural fields, it is necessary to consolidate the cultural immunity, in Asyut and elsewhere. The battle is with the Egyptian regime, its foolish rejection of dialogue with the opposition, and its persistence in carrying out executions. The battle is not and will not be with Egypt's Copts. 3. These historic points make it incumbent on us to draw up an Arab Islamic confrontation plan that goes beyond tactics for talks in Washington and elsewhere. This plan should involve the Christian, Islamic, and even some struggling Jewish sects that reject racism, in confronting Zionism. Not all Jews are Zionists; and it is not right to generalize. In history, prominent strugglers in the communist, socialist, and world labor movements, as well as imperialism-resisting movements, were Jews. A plan to guarantee political immunity must be developed, because Israel will only seek to destroy the region and divide its people into tribes, clans, and sects so that Jerusalem can become another Mecca, or the political and economic center for Arabs and Muslims. Containing such a hazard would make confrontation much easier, even if Israeli flags were temporarily hoisted in some Arab capitals. As far as the economic aspect is concerned, only an Arab, Islamic common market extending from Iran to the Islamic states in Asia Minor and Turkey can balance the Israeli strategy of seeking, among other things, to control the Arab and Islamic market and steal our wealth. These are some of the basic things that should be developed before it is too late to protect the Christians and Muslims of the Orient from the hazards of peace or settlement with Israel.
