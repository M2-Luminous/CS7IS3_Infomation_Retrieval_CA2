However, some members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan are increasingly taking the view that reform of the current electoral system should be deferred until later, and it remains unclear whether the joint committee will hammer out the compromise plan. With the current Diet session set to close soon, the tense situation is continuing.
