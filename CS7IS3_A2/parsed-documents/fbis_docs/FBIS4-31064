According to the maps, "western Bosnia, the Posavina area, and eastern Bosnia are all problematic," Krajisnik told Serb Sarajevo television and TANJUG journalists. "They are trying to take away the largest part of the corridor -- the towns of Derventa, Bosanski Brod, Odzak, Samac, and Orasje. There are also aspirations toward considerably enlarging the territories of the Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia, almost the whole of the left bank of the river Drina and the right bank near Gorazde." We explained why we cannot discuss those areas, Krajisnik said. We expressed concern, Krajisnik went on to say, because the division of 51 percent and 49 percent is being insisted upon, rather than the quality of the territory. We reminded them that the Srpska republic assembly in Pale had found it difficult to accept even the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which allocated 53 percent of the territory to the Serbs, and the rest to what has now become the Muslim-Croat Federation. Speaking about the stance of the Bosnian Serbs, Krajisnik said that it was a problem to go to the talks with pre-set percentages. He believes that each area should be discussed separately and viewed in the context of its distinct characteristics. According to the Serb delegation, "the Muslims are not playing their own game, but an entire bloc is trying achieve its interests through the Muslim-Croat Federation, and it is trying -- on behalf of the Federation -- to adjust the territories of future states to its strategic needs." "We know why they are insisting on eastern Bosnia. They need it as a springboard toward Serbia. As for the corridor, we will never agree on it being merely a road, a corridor. It has to be a populated area, an organic entity linking a Serb state" -- Krajisnik said. In reference to the constant delays in the negotiations to cease hostilities, Serb Republic President Karadzic told journalists that "consistent rumors are coming from well-informed sources in Europe that the Muslims are being constantly driven into a conflict first with the Serbs then with the Croats by the people who wish them harm, who hope for their total extermination." Karadzic said that the "Muslim side has again demonstrated that it favors war and that it is not willing to accept a peaceful solution for a period of four to six months, thus helping in the efforts to extinguish the conflagration in Bosnia." "The Muslims are not undermining the conference at their own initiative. To their detriment, someone is advising them to choose wrong tactics" -- Karadzic said. "No one will go before the international community to justify their attempt to undermine the conference, and I therefore believe that in the end, someone, most likely some circles from America, will try to bring them eventually to the negotiating table," the Srpska republic president said in conclusion.
