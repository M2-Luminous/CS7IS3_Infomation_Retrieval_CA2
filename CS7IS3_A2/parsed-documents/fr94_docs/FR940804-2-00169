FR940804-2-00169 FR940804-2-00088 2. OFA proposes to issue and sell in the United States debt securities unconditionally guaranteed by the Province (``Guaranteed Debt Securities''). The proceeds of the Guaranteed Debt Securities will be lent to various Public Sector Clients. Substantially all of the moneys borrowed by OFA will be re-lent to the Public Sector Clients. Funds not immediately lent to the Province or Public Sector Clients will be invested by OFA. In order to assure favorable terms to the Public Sector Clients, and in anticipation of their borrowing needs, OFA may borrow and then invest the proceeds of such borrowings temporarily in debt instruments, such as banker's acceptances, Treasury bills, and commercial paper until the Public Sector Clients require such funds. 3. Guaranteed Debt Securities will be direct, unsecured obligations of OFA, with the payment of principal, and any interest or premium, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by the Province (the ``Provincial Guarantee'') pursuant to an order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council under the Financial Administration Act (the ``FAA''). Section 22 of the FAA provides, in part, that the Lieutenant Governor in Council may by order authorize the Minister of Finance, on behalf of Ontario, ``to agree to guarantee or indemnify the debts, obligations, securities or undertakings of any person *␣*␣* [and] may fix such terms and conditions as are considered advisable *␣*␣*.'' Pursuant to this authority, Guaranteed Debt Securities will bear the irrevocable unconditional guarantee of the Province so that, in the event of a default, holders of Guaranteed Debt Securities may proceed directly against the Province under such guarantee without first proceeding against OFA, and such amount will then be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Province. 4. The Capital Investment Act is the primary legislation governing OFA and sets out OFA's constitution, functions, and powers. The Minister of Finance of the Province is responsible for the administration of the Capital Investment Act in respect of OFA. Pursuant to the Capital Investment Act, OFA is required to submit an annual report on its affairs, including audited financial statements, to the Minister of Finance within 90 days of the end of its fiscal year. The financial statements are audited by the Provincial Auditor. 5. The Lieutenant Governor in Council is empowered to make regulations respecting the management, control, and administration of the affairs of OFA. OFA's board of directors may pass by-laws regulating OFA's proceedings, specifying the powers and duties of the officers and employees and generally for the management of OFA. In particular, the power of OFA to borrow, issue securities, make short-term investments, manage risk associated with financing and investment, or incur liabilities in order to facilitate financings by others only may be exercised under the authority of a by-law that has been approved by the Minister of Finance. 6. Substantially all of OFA's assets are expected to include: (i) Obligations of Public Sector Clients to repay loans made to them by OFA; (ii) the assets, consisting primarily of deposit obligations, of The Province of Ontario Savings Office; (iii) obligations of certain Public Sector Clients to repay loans made to them by the Province and transferred to OFA; (iv) investments to facilitate OFA's cash flow management and maximize the return on its surplus funds and those of Public Sector Clients; and (v) such other assets, which may consist of obligations or investments, as permitted by the Capital Investment Act. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. Section 3(a)(3) of the Act defines an investment company as an issuer engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owning ``investment securities'' having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer's total assets. Because substantially all of the moneys borrowed by OFA will be lent to Public Sector Clients, a substantial portion of OFA's assets will consist of obligations of the Public Sector Clients to repay such loans. In addition, OFA will invest its own surplus funds and those of other Public Sector Clients, as well as make temporary investments. Such obligations and investments could be deemed to be ``investment securities'' within the meaning of section 3(a)(3). As a result, OFA could be deemed to be an ``investment company'' under the Act. 2. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to grant an exemption from the provisions of the Act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary and appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors, and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 3. OFA believes that granting the exemption would be appropriate in the public interest. It would benefit United States investors by making the Guaranteed Debt Securities more readily available to such investors. It also would expand the United States' market for OFA's Guaranteed Debt Securities and thus encourage the free flow of capital among nations. 4. OFA further believes that granting the exemption requested would be consistent with the protection of investors. The payment of the principal of, and any premium or interest on, the Guaranteed Debt Securities will be irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by the Province. As a result, the Guaranteed Debt Securities will be backed by the sovereign credit of the Province and not merely the credit and assets of OFA. 5. Finally, OFA believes an exemption would be consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. OFA is a governmental central financing and investing authority that was organized to obtain and arrange efficient financing and investments for the requirements of public authorities of the Province. OFA is thus a statutory body with characteristics different from the types of investment companies at which the Act generally is directed and for which its substantive provisions are necessary or suitable.
