The crisis of confidence of international investors in the economic and monetary policies of the three major industrial powers (the United States, Germany, and Japan) began in February. It was to continue, severely threatening American growth. It is compromising recovery in Japan and Europe. Tension is running extremely high among dealers, who are waiting expectantly for a hike in short-term American interest rates. While waiting for this action from the Federal Reserve, agitation can be expected to continue both in the bond markets and on the stock exchanges. A brutal fall in the U.S. currency or in share prices is no doubt out of the question, but pessimism and doubt remain the order of the day, auguring what some are beginning to call a hidden crash. The concerted intervention by 17 central banks led by the Federal Reserve on Friday, 24 June, ended in bitter failure. Despite the $3 billion or so thrown into the battle, the greenback once again lost value. It has lost 10 percent of its value against the yen and 9 percent against the German mark since the beginning of the year. This serious reverse suffered by the monetary authorities underlines how much their tactical sense has failed them. By waiting too long to intervene so as not to prove the markets who were calling for action from them to be right, they enabled speculators to make tidy profits without, however, arresting the fall. Beyond this, it is visibly their whole credibility which this crisis is calling into question. The messages between central banks and the markets are not getting across any more. Every movement on short-term rates is misinterpreted. The meaning of every declaration is twisted. Financial circles are maintaining a sense of alarm which can no longer be taken lightly, given its serious threat to economies. The White House's declarations this weekend indicating that the dollar was not a weapon in the trade war with Japan go in the right direction. It finally appears that the level achieved by the yen, which is now worth 1 U.S. cent, is considered sufficient by Washington. Despite everything, it will need more than that to convince traders. The G-7 meeting, to be held between 8 and 10 July in Naples, could provide an opportunity if the date did not appear too distant. In the meantime, the markets would like a hike in U.S. short-term rates and a fall in Europe, just as the Fed and the Bundesbank have decided on a pause. The central banks are trapped, because giving in immediately to the markets would weaken their long-term credibility. While remaining inflexible, it remains the job of the political and monetary authorities to remind people constantly that the fundamentals of the world economy do not justify the present panic.
