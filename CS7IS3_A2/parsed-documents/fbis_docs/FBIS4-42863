Replying to correspondents' questions this evening at the Astir Hotel in Vouliagmeni, Prime Minister Papandreou also referred to other current issues. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Roula Kambouryiani] Prime Minister Papandreou sees an increase in the Turkish provocations, despite the attempts by Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to calm the situation. Papandreou talked about an attempt by Turkey to create an artificial tension that is dangerous. [Papandreou] As you know, a short while ago Cetin said there was no such meaning in Ciller's statement, and what appeared momentarily as an artificial tension with an unknown aim has been relieved somewhat, which we welcome. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you expect Turkish provocations to increase following the Kurdish issue? [Papandreou] There is already an increase. There has been a small drop off in that increase of tension, because Demirel also made a statement referring to President Konstandinos Karamanlis, saying that they signed agreements together. This is an attempt to tone down their rhetoric. We hope that this continues, because all these problems are artificial and, of course, dangerous. [Correspondent] The issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] is at a new round of negotiations. Next week Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will meet Cyrus Vance. What do you expect? [Papandreou] What do I expect? I do not know. We hope that this issue ends quickly. [FYROM President Kiro] Gligirov thinks it will take time. We will see. Nothing is assumed.
