Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said the Yemeni Government had issued no military communiques since Tuesday [24 May] evening because it is all quiet on the front. He declined to say who the message will be from or what it would be about. In Sanaa, Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has called in the ambassadors of the permanent member states of the United Nations Security Council. Diplomatic sources said Mr. Salih told the ambassadors that if the council were to say anything, Sanaa would prefer that it be a council president's statement rather than a resolution.
