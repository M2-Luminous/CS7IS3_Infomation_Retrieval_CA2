He added that in 1992, Petrovietnam struck production sharing contracts with foreign companies to explore and exploit oil and gas in the northern continental shelf and in the onshore basin of the northern Red River delta. In addition a number of other deals have been signed for the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas from oilfields on the southern continental shelf. As a result of this progress, oil and gas production in Vietnam may exceed 20 million tonnes a year by 2000. Petrovietnam in 1994 expects to tap 7.1 million tonnes of crude oil, up 800,000 tonnes over last year's level. This would include the first amount of 0.3 million tonnes pumped from the Rong (Dragon) and Dai Hung (Big Bear) Oilfields. The oil and gas industry has good prospect in the coming years as the operation and development in Dai Hung and Thanh Long (Blue Dragon) nearby Dai Hung Oilfields come into production. By then Vietnam would rank one of the world's biggest oil producers. According to foreign entrepreneurs, a well of the Dai Hung Oilfield which was successfully drilled recently could be put into operation in the third quarter of this year. It is expected that more than 1,000 tonnes of crude oil could be tapped per day from this well. Petrovietnam also actively carries out a project to gas from Bach Ho into the mainland in 1994 for electricity generation, chemical fertilizers manufacture and other products processed from crude oil for export. The country's first oil refinery has been under construction since 1993 with a view of introducing its products refined from crude oil and the natural gas to the domestic market before 2000. To this end another project for building of the second oil refinery was carried out last month.
