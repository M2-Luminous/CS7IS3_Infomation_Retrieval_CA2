The statement urged the DPRK to fulfill the nuclear safety accord and to allow International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspectors to complete the activities prescribed by the agreement reached between the agency and the DPRK last 25 February. A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said: Since the DPRK is in the special position of temporarily suspending its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it is "utterly unjustifiable" to ask the DPRK to fulfill the nuclear safety accord and to accept additional inspections. On the other hand, the DPRK urged the United States to stop exerting pressure on it and to settle the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue between the two countries. This move by the DPRK undoubtedly made the "nuclear crisis" on the peninsula even more subtle. The United States Is Determined To Exercise a War Deterrent Zhuang Jianzhong, senior analyst in international strategy and researcher at the Shanghai International Strategy Institute, while analyzing the case, said: As far as the United States is concerned, the main purpose and direct effect of bullying the DPRK is to guard against nuclear proliferation. The chief U.S. strategic consideration since World War II is that the greatest threat to the United States comprises nuclear weapons. Hence, the United States is extremely sensitive to the issue of nuclear proliferation. Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the CIS no longer trains its nuclear weapons on the United States, thus eliminating the greatest U.S. nuclear enemy. Hence, the United States holds that, with the end of the Cold War, the fact that extremist countries in some regions may possess nuclear weapons poses the greatest threat to the United States. Therefore, its chief task is to ban nuclear development in these countries. The abovementioned reason also explains the uncompromising stand by the United States on the DPRK nuclear issue. Meanwhile, the United States attaches great importance to stability in the East Asian region, which is the key part of Asia as well as an important component of the U.S. Asian-Pacific strategy, whereas the DPRK nuclear issue has become the serious hidden danger to the United States. As far as the political aspect is concerned, the United States intends to play a leading role in Northeast Asia and to show that both Japan and the ROK need U.S. support. The United States is resolute in bullying the DPRK into accepting nuclear inspection. As far as the U.S. military strategy is concerned, the 1970's theory of brinkmanship has changed into the theory of war deterrent in the 1980's and 90's. The United States holds that, apart from wielding military pressure to achieve results just as it did during the Cuban missile crisis, it can also resort to direct military operations as it did in Grenada and Panama. According to a report published by THE WASHINGTON POST on 31 March, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said that the United States would try its best to prevent the DPRK from developing nuclear weapons, even at the risk of waging a war. Viewed from a deeper angle, the DPRK in U.S. is the most hardline communist stronghold and the United States wants to compel the DPRK to give in through this incident. China in a Decisive Position China also hopes for a stable and denuclearized Korean Peninsula. China can be described as occupying a decisive position and having a great and unprecedented say in this matter because it interacts with both the DPRK and the United States. Jiang Zemin and Li Peng remarked separately on this matter, expressing the hope that the nuclear issue could be settled through peaceful talks between the DPRK and the United States. This has been very rare in previous regional conflicts and the fact that the UN Security Council adopted the chairman's statement as proposed by China also shows how influential China is. By comparison, Russia does not have much influence on it. In Zhuang Jianzhong's view, the DPRK does not really want to wage war with the ROK and the United States because its national power is too poor. At present, the DPRK still wants to upgrade its diplomatic standing by establishing ties with the United States and engaging in talks with them. It is then looking forward to receiving economic aid from others. The DPRK To Consent To Reexamination To sum up, squabbles and conflicts might arise but everything depends on the development of the situation. At present, the U.S. announcements to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK and to conduct joint military exercise with the ROK are just responsive actions, far removed from waging war against the DPRK. According to Zhuang Jianzhong, the DPRK will finally accept the UN Security Council's request to reexamine its nuclear facilities, as long as it is done in a dignified manner.
