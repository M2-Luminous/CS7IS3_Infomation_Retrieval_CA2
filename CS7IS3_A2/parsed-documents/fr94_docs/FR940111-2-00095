FR940111-2-00095 FR940111-2-00059 A. Index Design and Structure The Commission finds that the Nasdaq Index and reduced-value Nasdaq Index are broad-based indices, and thus it is appropriate to permit Exchange rules applicable to the trading of broad-based index options to apply to the Index options, including Index LEAPS. Specifically, the Commission believes the Index is broad-based because it reflects a substantial segment of the U.S. equities market. In addition, the basic character of the reduced-value Nasdaq Index, which is comprised of the same component securities as the Nasdaq Index and calculated by dividing the Nasdaq Index by ten, is essentially identical to the Nasdaq Index. The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's component stocks significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the Index represents and consists of the common stock values of 100 actively traded U.S. companies. Second, no one particular stock or group of stocks dominates the Index. Specifically, no one stock comprises more than 10.54% of the Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounts for 33.27% of the Index's value. Third, the overwhelming majority of the stocks that comprise the Index are actively traded, with a mean and median average daily trading volume of 631,631 and 407,639 shares, respectively. Fourth, the market capitalizations of the stocks in the Index are very large, ranging from a high of $26.8 billion to a low of $437 million as of October 25, 1993, with the mean and median being $2.54 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Fifth, the Index is comprised of stocks representing a diverse group of industries, the most heavily represented by Index weight including computer software products and service, semiconductors, telephone equipment and service, broadcasting, and retail. Sixth, 97 out of the 100 component stocks in the Index, comprising 98.82% of the weighting of the Index, currently are eligible for options trading. 20 Finally, the Commission believes that, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those securities will help deter as well as detect illegal trading activity involving the index option. 20 The CBOE's options listing standards, which are uniform among the options exchanges, provide that a security underlying an option must, among other things, meet the following requirements: (1) The public float must be at least 7,000,000; (2) there must be a minimum of 2,000 stockholders; (3) trading volume must have been at least 2.4 million over the preceding twelve months; and (4) the market price must have been at least $7.50 for a majority of the business days during the preceding three calendar months. See CBOE Rule 5.3, Interpretation .01. B. Customer Protection The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Nasdaq Index options (including full-value and reduced-value LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) The special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in Nasdaq Index options and Nasdaq Index LEAPS. C. Surveillance The Commission generally believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a stock index derivative and the exchange(s) trading the stocks underlying the derivative product is an important measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the stock index product less readily susceptible to manipulation. 21 In this regard, the NASD, which currently is the primary market for all of the Index's component securities, is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information. 22 21 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31243, 57 FR 45849 (October 5, 1992). 22 See note 18, supra.
