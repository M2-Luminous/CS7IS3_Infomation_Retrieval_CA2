Premier Li Peng and his entourage, who were inspecting work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, arrived by car at the home of Alengdai, a Mongolian herdsman, in Bulag Village, Ejin Horo Sumu [the preceding word denotes a Mongolian administrative division], Ih Ju League. Before stepping into the courtyard, a smiling Premier Li Peng extended his cordial greetings to Mr. and Mrs. Alengdai, his hosts who had come out to welcome him warmly. Using a Mongolian phrase she had just learned, Comrade Zhu Lin [Li Peng's wife] said: "Saibainu (How do you do)?" His tanned face betraying extraordinary excitement, a sturdy Alengdai, in a Mongolian gown, clasped Li Peng's hand with both of his hands and said repeatedly: "How do you do, Mr. Premier? How do you do, Mr. Premier." Premier Li Peng sat cross-legged on a heatable brick bed in the house. Following Mongolian etiquette, he gladly took the bowl of hot tea with milk from his host, with whom he chit chatted as he drank from the bowl. Alengdai profusely praised the dual contract responsibility system for grassland and animal husbandry that has been in place since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. He said: "Before the introduction of reform, I lived in a small mud house and our per capita annual income was less than 100 yuan. Things have got better in recent years, thanks to state policies and our own hard work. My family now has more than 140 sheep and goats, as well as some horses and cattle. We have built more than 70 mu of grass enclosures, as well as plastic heating sheds. Our 3-mu irrigated field yields more than 3,000 kg each year. Last year, our family income topped 5,000 yuan, or 1,200 yuan per capita." The premier asked solicitously: "How many children do you have? Are they in school? Is their schooling expensive?" "Two of my children are in school. My daughter attends paramedical school in Hulun Buir League. I have to send them money every year," Alengdai said. The premier said: "Good. Herdsmen are willing to invest in their children, who represent the new generation on the prairie." The premier asked: "Do you grow grain for your own consumption or for sale?" "Primarily for use as fodder." The premier asked in detail: "How much wool can a head of sheep yield per shearing? How is the quality of wool?" "Sheep yield two kg of wool per head, whereas each goat produces 4 liang of down. The quality of wool and down is not very good." The premier then said in an emphatic tone: "Well, you cannot sell your wool for a good price if its quality is bad. We need to improve our breeds of sheep and goal, raise them scientifically, and change our conventional method of raising livestock in an environment that is susceptible to the elements." Upon hearing the premier's remarks, Alengdai and other herdsmen nodded repeatedly. When the premier handed him brick tea [a mass of tea leaves in the shape of a brick], a gift he had specifically taken along, Alengdai said excitedly: "Why, Mr. Premier has us herdsmen on his mind!" Not long before, Alengdai had built a brick house with a floor space of more than 100 square meters. Upon seeing the television, videocassettee recorder, washing machine, and knockdown cabinets in the house, and upon learning from Alengdai that he had bought yet another diesel-powered pedicab a year earlier, the premier remarked joyously: "Herdsmen on the prairie are leading a different life than in the past. They will lead an even better life in the future." The drizzle linked the premier's heart with those of the herdsmen. As he shook hands with Alengdai before leaving, the premier asked: "What is Mongolian for `Good-bye'?" "Bayaritai," replied Alengdai emotionally as he reluctantly bid the premier farewell. The premier blurted out: "Bayaritai!" On his way home, Premier Li Peng told Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, and Wuliji, chairman of the autonomous region, who were traveling with him: "Although Inner Mongolia's wool output is not low, the wool quality is not good enough. We should adopt measures to improve quality and raise prices, cut down on intermediate links in the distribution system, and let peasants and herdsmen derive real benefits to encourage them to improve wool quality."
