FR940927-0-00045 FR940927-0-00007 IV. Director's Findings 1. The Navajo Nation Plan As discussed below, the Director of OSM, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 756.1, 884.15, and 884.14, finds that the proposed AMLR plan amendment submitted by the Navajo Nation on April 7 and 22, 1994, meets the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 884.14. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment. a. Nonsubstantive Revisions to the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 The Navajo Nation proposed revisions to the following previously-approved provisions of its code that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist of (1) minor editorial, grammatical, and punctuation changes, (2) recodification, (3) using the term ``Nation'' rather than ``Tribal'' or ``Tribe of Indians'' when referring to the Navajo Nation and the terms ``Navajo Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program'' and ``Navajo Abandoned Mine Reclamation Plan'' for the Navajo Nation's reclamation program and plan, and (4) clarifying the duties and responsibilities of NAMLRD, Division of Natural Resources, and Office of Navajo Land Administration in administering the AMLR plan for the Navajo Nation (corresponding SMCRA provisions are listed in parentheses): Introduction (introduction of SMCRA), Title I, section 101, Findings (Title I, section 101 of SMCRA), Title I, section 102, Purposes (Title I, section 102 of SMCRA), Title II, sections 201(a), (c) and (d), Duties of NAMLRD (Title II, section 201 and Title IV, section 405(1) of SMCRA), Title IV, sections 401(a) and (b)(6), Navajo Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and Purposes (Title IV, sections 401(a) and (b) of SMCRA), Title IV, section 402, Reclamation Fee (Title IV, section 402 of SMCRA), Title IV, sections 403(a)(4), (5) and (6), Objectives of Fund (Title IV, section 403(a) of SMCRA), Title IV, sections 405(a), (b), (c), and (f), Tribal Reclamation Program (Title IV, sections 405(b), (e), and (i) of SMCRA), Title IV, sections 407(a), (c), (c)(3), and (d) through (h), Acquisition and Reclamation of Lands Within the Navajo Nation Adversely Affected by Past Mining Practices (Title IV, section 407 of SMCRA), Title IV, section 408(a), Liens (Title IV, section 408 of SMCRA), Title IV, sections 409(a) and (d), Filling Voids and Sealing Tunnels (Title IV, sections 409(a) and (e) of SMCRA), Title IV, section 412, Fund Report (Title IV, section 412 of SMCRA), and Title IV, sections 413(b) through (e), Miscellaneous Powers (Title IV, section 413 of SMCRA). Because the proposed revisions to these previously-approved provisions of the code are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director finds that the proposed revisions meet the requirements of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed revisions to these provisions of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987.
