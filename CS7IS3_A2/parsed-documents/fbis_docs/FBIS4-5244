FBIS4-5244 "dreas068_n_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Vietnam Summit Meeting With Sweden Continues in Hanoi Summit Meeting With Sweden Continues in Hanoi AFP Cites Bildt on Human Rights BK0704145394 Hong Kong AFP in English 1359 GMT 7 Apr 94 BK0704145394 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] HANOI, April 7 (AFP) -- Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt accused Hanoi Thursday of being "unduly slow" in improving its human rights situation, following what he indicated were difficult talks on the issue with Vietnamese officials. "We have to use that phrase `a frank and open discussion' on this matter," Bildt told a press conference here using the diplomatic euphemism for a strong disagreement. Bildt said he had told Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet that "dialogue with Vietnam on human rights was making unduly slow progress" and urged him to look again at a number of cases raised by Sweden. "He said he would do this, but it remains to be seen if it has any effects," Bildt said, adding that Sweden would "stand firm on the issue". Bildt is the first Swedish premier to visit Vietnam despite close links between the two countries, which established diplomatic relations in 1969, long before most Western nations did so. His visit has focused on "broadening a relationship based on aid" and moving it towards trade and investment, he said. Sweden -- which has given a total of 1.2 billion US dollars in aid to Vietnam -- would no longer hand over large sums of money and then decide how it was to be used, but would instead target areas that would help the country's economic reforms, he said. Mistakes had been made in Sweden's aid policies in Vietnam, Bildt said. The Swedish-funded Bai Bang paper mill northwest of Hanoi has become a development white elephant, draining away 450 million dollars and only running at a fraction of its capacity. "Some of the countries around the world that have received the most economic assistance have faired the worst," Bildt said, while many countries that had received no aid "had achieved spectacular economic and social results". "There is no reason whatsoever why Vietnam, given the right policies, should not be able to achieve what other nations in the region have managed to achieve," the fervently free-marketeer premier said. Bildt said he believed he was witnessing "what might come to be called the start of the real Vietamese revolution." Dismissing a suggestion that Vietnam might be disappointed by his stand after years of almost unconditional support from the Scandanavian nation, Bildt said he wanted to build ties based on business and economic cooperation. "There was a time when countries signed communiques and pledged eternal friendship but it doesn't work that way in the modern world," he said. Sweden has been slow to capitalise on its position here, ranking 17th among international investors, with projects worth 60 million US dollars. Trade has been minimal, reaching only 10 million US dollars last year. Bildt, who visited Ho Chi Minh City before arriving in Hanoi, held talks with several other officials including President Le Duc Anh and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. He is to leave for Hong Kong Friday on the last stop of an Asian tour that has taken in Singapore and Malaysia.
