Also, Secretary of State Warren Christopher requested President Yasir 'Arafat to resume the negotiations with Israel "without prior conditions." While Moscow announced that Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit the region today. Responding to this, a high-ranking Palestinian source contacted by AL-HAYAH accused Ambassador Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the peace process, and the official in charge of the Middle East at the National Security Council "of returning to complete bias toward Israel and exploiting President Clinton's preoccupation with domestic matters to take control of U.S. foreign policy." [passage omitted] A PLO official, who asked to remain anonymous, pointed out that Christopher had phoned President 'Arafat and demanded that the PLO resume the negotiations without any prior conditions or agree to hold meetings between Palestinian and Israeli officials. The official said: "It is clear that the U.S. Administration is exerting pressure (on the PLO) in Israel's favor through its threat to use the veto." [passage omitted]
