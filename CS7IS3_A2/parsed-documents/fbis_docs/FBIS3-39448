The blockade of the access to the sea is "noted with concern," Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann stated on inquiry. Thus, the Federal Government has taken up a position against a European Union [EU] partner who is also holding the EU Presidency in the first half of 1994. The Federal Government wants "more and not less stability" in the region. FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will broach the new development within the framework of the EU troika, which had previously announced it would meet in Athens this Friday. The troika consists of Kinkel and the foreign ministers of Greece and Belgium. The three acting EU foreign ministers wanted to discuss the Russian attitude toward the Bosnian crisis and the NATO ultimatum. Greece's announcement that it will block Macedonia's only access to the sea has obviously surprised the ministers. Now the extraordinary case might come to pass that Greece must expect a contrary decision by the Brussels Commission. The Bonn Foreign Ministry pointed out that an EU member "simply cannot" block "the trade routes of other EU members" who want to conduct trade with the Republic of Macedonia through Salonika.
