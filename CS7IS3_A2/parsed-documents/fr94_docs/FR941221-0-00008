FR941221-0-00008 FR941221-0-00003 The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) corrects the geographic position coordinates of the Sabre Army Heliport and as a consequence the depiction of the Fort Campbell, KY, Class D and Class E airspace. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6005 respectively of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need for a regulation to correct the geographic position coordinates of the Sabre Army Heliport and as a consequence the depiction of the Fort Campbell, KY, Class D and Class E airspace, in order to improve air safety. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
