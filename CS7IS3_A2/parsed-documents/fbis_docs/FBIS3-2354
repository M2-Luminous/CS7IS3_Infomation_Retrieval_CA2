Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with all the participants and Premier Li Peng delivered a speech at the meeting. Since China began implementing the policies of reform and opening to the outside world 15 years ago, more and more foreign investment has poured into the country, especially in the past two years. The contracted foreign investment volume in 1992 exceeded the total for the 13 years before while that of 1993 doubled 1992's. Officials in charge of the foreign investment promotion work in the State Council, provinces and municipalities attended the meeting. In the meeting with the participants, President Jiang affirmed the accomplishments in using overseas investment in the past 15 years and encouraged the participants to do a better job in the use of overseas capital. Jiang noted that the overseas investment has played a positive role in China's economic development. To attract more foreign investment, Li Peng pointed out in his speech that China should better the investment environment, establish a comprehensive legal system, perfect the market mechanism, improve the work efficiency of the government and enhance the professional quality of the personnel. China not only has cheap labor and many technicians but also a market with large potential, Li said, adding that these advantages could attract more foreign investment and enable investors to obtain legal profits. However, Li stressed, China will not attract foreign investment at the expense of its socialist culture and morals. Li said that China would pay more attention to its cooperation with international financial consortiums and large transnational enterprises. Chinese enterprises and foreign investors should both benefit from cooperation, Li said, adding that China should not only concentrate on introducing foreign investment, but also protect the interests of overseas investors and strengthen its administration over foreign-funded enterprises according to law. Li said that China will draft comprehensive industrial policies to guide the distribution of foreign investment and avoid blind or redundant investments. China can also introduce foreign capital to transform old state-run enterprises, Li said. But the assessment of state-owned properties should be strengthened to avoid the drain-off of state-owned properties. As for China's ability to pay foreign debts, Li said the country should do its best to ensure its ability to repay the principal and interest. He added that as long as the economic efficiency of the enterprises is good, there will be no problem in repayment. The premier also stressed the necessity to protect the legal interests of Chinese workers in foreign-funded enterprises. Chinese vice-premiers Zou Jiahua and Li Lanqing also attended the meeting.
