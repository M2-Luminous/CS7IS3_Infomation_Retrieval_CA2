Once again there were reports yesterday of an important agreement at the talks but once again it seems to have been a mirage. From Lusaka, John Mukhela telexed this report. According to the UNITA delegation leader, Jorge Valentim, no factual agreement has in fact been reached between his team of negotiators and their Angolan Government counterparts, who are led by General Francisco Eugenio. Mr. Valentim told me this afternoon that under discussion was what is known as point 16 of the negotiations. He said that under point 16, demands had been tabled by UNITA to the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] government, urging it to give UNITA presidential and office accommodation for its top leadership. Mr. Valentim said the deliberations on point 16 have been taking place for the last two weeks. Tentative agreement on point 16 was reached, however, only yesterday. He said, however, that the government delegation has not been categorical on whether or not it could go along with the UNITA demands. As of now, the government delegation said it would consider the UNITA proposals on the understanding that only a total of 124 offices and houses would be handed over by the government to the UNITA officials. Of these 124 offices and houses, Mr. Valentim said two-thirds were situated right in the Angolan capital, Luanda. He said that this was not a happy outcome and that the current offer fell far short of what UNITA required. It did not match UNITA's status and responsibilities, he said. The need for office and residential accommodation was an important part of the negotiation process because the government had nationalized all UNITA-held property in 1975 when it originally came to power. Valentim added: Our leaders need proper facilities and they cannot continue indefinitely to operate from hotel rooms.
