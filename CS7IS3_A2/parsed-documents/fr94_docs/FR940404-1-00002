FR940404-1-00002 FR940404-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 915 [Docket No. FV93&hyph;915&hyph;2PR] Avocados Grown in South Florida; Revision in Maturity and Reporting Requirements AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would revise maturity requirements in effect on a continuous basis for avocados grown in Florida by revising the calendar dates in the various shipping schedules for some 60 avocado varieties to be applicable to any calendar year. This would ensure that only mature fruit is shipped to the fresh market, thereby improving grower returns and promoting orderly marketing conditions. This proposed rule would also suspend for the next two seasons, pack-out reports for avocado shipments sold or delivered in Florida by handlers within the regulated area. This proposed rule would reduce the burden of information collection requirements currently provided for under the marketing order. DATES: Comments must be received by May 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this rule to: Docket Clerk, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; or by facsimile at 202&hyph;720&hyph;5698. Three copies of all written material shall be submitted, and they will be made available for public inspection at the office of the Docket Clerk during regular business hours. The written comments should reference the docket number, date, and page number of this issue of the Federal Register . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Caroline C. Thorpe, Marketing Specialist, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: 202&hyph;720&hyph;5127; or William Pimental, Southeast Marketing Field Office, USDA/AMS, P.O. Box 2276, Winter Haven, Florida 33883; telephone: 813&hyph;299&hyph;4770. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 915 (7 CFR part 915), as amended, regulating the handling of avocados grown in South Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposed rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This proposed rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
