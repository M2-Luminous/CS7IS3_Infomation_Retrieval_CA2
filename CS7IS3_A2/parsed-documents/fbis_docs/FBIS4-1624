Officials of religious affairs said that more younger clergymen have been trained in Beijing and nearly half of all the 400-plus religious teaching staff in the Chinese capital are young or middle- aged. In the past several years, a few theological institutes including the Christian Yanching Theological Seminary, the Catholic Monastery, the Institute of Islamic Theology, and seminars including the Buddhist Monks' Class and the Lama Class at the Yonghe Lamasery have been restored in Beijing. Since 1989, some 22 graduates from the Catholic Monastery have become priests. Three others have been sent for theological studies in the United States and another two are scheduled to study in Hong Kong. In addition, 18 young sisters from the Catholic convent have become leaders of religious affairs and scores of graduates from religious schools have become imams, lamas and nuns. The religious officials said the emergence of these younger clergy has greatly reduced the lack of successors to carry on religious affairs. So far, there is a 35-year-old monk acting as vice-president of the Beijing Buddhist Association, and a number of other young clergy have been elected leaders of monasteries or the Beijing Islamic Association.
