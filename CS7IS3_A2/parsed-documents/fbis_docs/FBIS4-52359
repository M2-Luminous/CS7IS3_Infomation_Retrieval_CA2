It was a shock challenge to the political security of the 45-year-old prime minister. It came to light at a Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei [Fijian Political Party -- SVT] caucus meeting at which a handful of Rabuka's 31 SVT members of parliament, who were dropped from his ministerial line-up, asked questions about his personal life. The issue was discussed at the party's second caucus on March 16, the day before all parliamentarians were sworn in. Issues raised could have deposed prime minister Rabuka if more members were stirred by them. But for the most part, they dismissed it as a bygone matter and for the sake of unity and party survival supported him. Rabuka's frankness and his admission, to parliamentarians and management board members, of an extramarital affair won him points for frankness and transparency. His clear offer to them to choose another leader if they no longer had any confidence in his leadership also gained him support. But despite repeated assurances of full party support, since the issue was made public, questions could still linger in some minds about his suitability as prime minister. The doubts could make his leadership role rather uncomfortable and perhaps contribute to government uncertainty. Five former government ministers in his first government's cabinet were unhappy about Rabuka's personal life and questioned it. Two were formerly of cabinet rank, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola and Koresi Matatolu, and three state ministers -- Kiniviliame Taukeinikoro, Mesulame Narawa, and Joeli Kalou. They made their views known in a letter to Rabuka in which they withdrew their support from him as prime minister and asked him to resign immediately. They first criticized him for inviting the National Federation Party to join the SVT in a coalition government, without the "clear mandate or authority, let alone blessings" of the great council of chiefs and the general caucus. They also accused him of "committing adultery" in October last year, "with a woman journalist", on the chiefly island of Taveuni where his province of Cakaudrove was holding its provincial council meeting. Personal Attack When asked if he would have accepted a party decision that he was unfit to lead because of his extramarital affair, Rabuka responded: "Yeah, right, exactly, and I had already warned out the president." On whether he had discussed the challenge with others in the caucus before the general discussion, Rabuka said: "No I didn't need to. It was a personal attack on me and I had to deal with it the way I thought was proper." Rabuka was asked about the issue being raised in the light of his party's relative success at the polls and generally positive response to his more streamlined 12-member cabinet. He said: "It was brought up in caucus, it was dealt with in caucus, and it was finished in caucus. I don't think there is any need to do any more than that. It was our own internal one, within caucus, and that has been resolved. Going back to the number of cabinet ministers, that is solely the prerogative of the prime minister and if people believe that they have been unfairly dumped or they have not been favorably considered then it's up to them. But if we were to change our prime minister, can there be a guarantee that they (axed ministers) will come in? You cannot satisfy everybody all the time people. You might be able to satisfy some people all the time, all the people some time but never everybody all the time." He was also asked if he was satisfied that the issue had been resolved now: "I am satisfied that it is now behind us. If there are any who are still harboring those feelings I am sure it will come out and when it comes out, it comes out." On whether a prime minister's personal life, in this case an extramarital affair, was an issue for leadership, Rabuka said: "Within the party, within the group they might consider that and if it is something that we resolve in the party and the caucus feels, OK, you are no longer fit to be our leader, let's pick another one. So it's on that basis that I opened it up for discussion that day. And I asked those who tried to bring it up to say right, if you are defeated, will you come along and we all keep the party working together, because we owe it to the people to make this government work. And that was how it was resolved. So I don't know, these are personal things that people might want to bring up or question." Public Property He later said: "I think people in high office like presidents and prime ministers should expect that. They are no longer their own, they are in fact really public property and people want to look at what you are, what you are like, what you eat, what you wear, so they (leaders) must expect that and if the nation feels you are not good enough, or if your party feels you're not good enough to lead, you face it." The five who wrote to Rabuka were also members of a cabinet prayer group, along with Rabuka and others. Sources say they could also have been inspired by groups of people outside the parliamentary caucus who believed Rabuka should step down as prime minister. Concern also arose from the group's spiritual interest in Rabuka's life as an avowed Christian and Methodist lay preacher. He has reportedly stepped down from his position as lay preacher. Kubuabola, an official in the Baptist church, has been a close associate of Rabuka's and is reported to have confronted him about possibly compromising incidents in the past. Letter Party sources say before it was raised in caucus Kubuabola met him to suggest he resign. Rabuka reportedly told him to bring the matter up at the party caucus but Rabuka himself took the initiative to raise the subject at the meeting and read out the group's letter. Sources say prior to the discussion, Rabuka may have suggested Kubuabola and others would get cabinet jobs in a planned expansion immediately before or after the announcement of the new budget, this month. A close Rabuka confidante and backbencher reportedly tried to play the part of a go-between -- attempting to placate Kubuabola and the other four on behalf of Rabuka. Objections to the matter being raised by Kubuabola were heard from about a quarter of the parliamentarians and party management board officials before the party resolved to put the whole matter behind it. Sources say if there was any suggestion that Rabuka should step down because of the incident, these were brushed aside and his leadership and authority reconfirmed. Said one parliamentarian: "Rabuka was wise to bring it to caucus. This way he has cleared the air and once again gathered support." Some signatories to the letter withdrew after some discussion. Said Kalou: "The matter has been settled and I don't want to make any comment." One backbencher, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said: "I am glad the issue was discussed. It is good so that they (leaders) will know that we and the people are watching and they can behave." With the air cleared, government could get on with the business of running the country. It was a healthy sign for the party and they preferred the issue be discussed rather than having it swept under the carpet. They said open discussion meant an end to further grumbling and whispering in the back benches. There is some doubt as to whether Rabuka's judgment was altogether sound in taking the matter to caucus because he forced Kubuabola to discuss the issue in a forum where it was not altogether welcomed. By alienating Kubuabola in that manner, Rabuka has sacrificed a former political ally and right hand man. Kubuabola and Rabuka go back to the fiery nationalist marches leading up to the military coup of 1987 and the Taukei movement that was formed through it. Public Discussion The issue is an interesting test case for Fiji, where more public discussion is being generated about the private lives of public figures. Being a relatively small and closely knit nation of 758,000, discussion about questionable actions of Fiji's public figures and leaders are inevitably confined to informal yaqona bowl discussions and the cocktail circuit. The caucus challenge and the reasons for it were alluded to by Fiji's two English dailies, the Fiji Times and Daily Post, and first disclosed in the local monthly magazine The Review. The impact of this unprecedented public airing will perhaps not be known for quite some time. It could be used by opposition Fijian parties for political mileage against Rabuka, and other Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa parliamentarians at political and Fijian communal gatherings. If Rabuka had decided not to take the issue to the caucus he might have had a more difficult time dealing with Kubuabola and his group. Among the questions being asked now are: -- will other ministers or Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei parliamentarians be questioned about their private lives? -- would Rabuka have been confronted over the affair if he was a chief not a commoner? -- and Can Rabuka now expect to be queried about every aspect of his personal life? The issue of Rabuka's affair will hang over the prime ministership for quite some time. Even if it doesn't have any serious impact on his political position, it's the kind of headache party officials and supporters could well do without. Although the government now has 31 seats, one more than last time, its coalition with four General Voters' Party members has been cut by one. That, plus the support of two independent parliamentarians, gives it back its previous total of 37 seats. This time though, observers say their position is weaker because the five Fijian opposition parliamentarians of the Fijian Association are strongly opposed to the government, unlike their predecessors. Former Fijian opposition members from the Fijian Nationalist United Front and Soqosoqo ni Taukei ni Vanua had some empathy for government policies and supported Rabuka. Broken Ranks There are 37 seats for Fijians, 27 for Indians, five for Generals (islanders, part Europeans, and others) and one for Rotumans under the pro-Fijian 1990 constitution. The only Fijian non-SVT representatives elected were Fijian Association candidates from Lau in eastern Fiji and Naitasiri in central Viti Levu, Fiji's main island. Lau was seen to have broken ranks with the Great Council of Chiefs and its party, the SVT, by voting for the party which was endorsed by its provincial council and its own chief Ratu Finau Mara. He was previously the Lau member for the SVT, and it was primarily because of him that his party swept all three seats in his home province. Former deputy prime minister and foreign minister Filipe Bole was defeated by 684 votes. His loss was a loss for the whole government side, especially in government and foreign affairs. Bole's expertise in the constitution review process was also going to be a loss for the Jai Ram Reddy-led National Federation Party and for the Indian opposition as a whole. On the government side, Bole is the best versed with the whole constitution review process. Indian leaders know him and have worked with him. So government has appointed him their special consultant on constitution review and will be involving him as closely as possible on this issue. Naitasiri disproved the generalization that Fijians followed their chiefs to the polls. Steered by strong anti-government feelings, Naitasiri went against its more prominent chiefs, and backed lesser chiefs and a Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei dissident, Ilai Kuli, to vote against the ruling party. Fijian Association party leader and former deputy prime minister in Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara's interim government, Josevata Kamikamica, said support for the SVT came mainly from ties with the Great Council of Chiefs. "The election was also focussing on the leadership, on the style of leadership, and I think the results really show that the Fijian people prefer Rabuka and Rabuka's leadership." Grooming Kamikamica said the Fijian Association "would like to groom, and help in the process of developing younger leaders. We have some very talented young chiefs, Ratu Finau (Mara), Ratu Apenisa (Cakobau, son of the late governor-general and high chief Ratu Sir George Cakobau), Ratu Edward (Tuivanuavou, a former army officer), and Ratu (Viliame) Dreunimisimisi (son of Fiji's late deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ratu Edward Cakobau and a former cabinet minister in Rabuka's 1992 government). While theories have come and gone about different groups challenging Rabuka's leadership from within the party, Rabuka and party officials know they aren't out of the woods yet. Beyond the party circle and by Rabuka's own admission, cabinet is going to have to work hard to keep their enemies at bay. A piece of paper pledging loyalty and support for Rabuka, that all 31 SVT parliamentarians signed the day after their victory was announced, isn't enough to bind them. Rabuka may have to hand out a few more cabinet appointments to those on the back bench who want them and find other ways and means of keeping his team happy. The theory that February election gave him an opportunity to clear out detractors and gather true blue supporters is now being tested.
