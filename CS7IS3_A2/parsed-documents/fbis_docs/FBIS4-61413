The FIS Refutes Key Theses of a Book on Nuclear Espionage"] [Text] Last week, the Russian mass media started publishing excerpts from the memoirs of Pavel Sudoplatov, a grand master of Soviet espionage and sabotage in the 1930's-1950's. One of its main sections is devoted to the intelligence service's involvement in the creation of Soviet nuclear weapons and contains sensational revelations implicating the world's key scientists of the time -- Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and Robert Oppenheimer -- in leaking Western nuclear secrets to the USSR. Yesterday, your KOMMERSANT- DAILY correspondent asked Tatyana Samolis, press secretary of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] chief, to comment on the allegations. Ms. Samolis told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the FIS chiefs have already worked out their stance on the matter. They think that some passages in Sudoplatov's book are a compilation of actual events, half-truths, and pure invention. The FIS still holds the opinion that Soviet scientists made a decisive contribution to the creation of nuclear weapons in the USSR, whereas intelligence efforts, albeit important and qualified, had only a secondary role to play. The FIS director's press secretary did not deny that starting September 1941 the Soviet intelligence service did receive truthful information on efforts to create nuclear weapons in the United States and the United Kingdom, something which helped solve a number of technical problems and accelerate the process of nuclear arms development. But events related to intelligence activity in that area and the roles of many players were interpreted in too free, often even incorrect, a manner in Pavel Sudoplatov's memoirs. Although special services tend to avoid specific comments on their methods and sources of information, this time Ms. Samolis categorically denied allegations contained in the book that the Soviet intelligence service received information on the nuclear problem directly from as prominent scientists as Fermi, Szilard, and Oppenheimer.
