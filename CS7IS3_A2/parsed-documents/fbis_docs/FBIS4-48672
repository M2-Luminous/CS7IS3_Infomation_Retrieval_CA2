Inkatha central committee member and newly appointed KwaZulu/Natal education minister Vincent Zulu said the issue was discussed at length at the April 8 summit at Skukuza, attended by then president F.W. de Klerk, Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Zwelithini and Mandela and their negotiators. "Mandela said our demand was valid and he undertook to discuss it with his national executive," Zulu said. "He said he would do everything possible to satisfy the king's demand." Mandela and Buthelezi were scheduled to meet in Cape Town last night to discuss the growing row. De Klerk authorised the transfer of 1.2 million hectares of land to a trust controlled by Zwelithini on April 25. ANC acting presidential spokesman Carl Niehaus said yesterday Mandela had "nothing more" to add until he had met Buthelezi. Mandela said on Friday he became aware of the land deal only on Friday after media reports. He said the ANC had not been involved in talks on the deal. De Klerk, speaking in London on Friday, said it was "nonsense" to suggest there had been a secret deal. Zulu said the KwaZulu government, by legislating for the royal control of tribal land, had "just wanted to make sure" about the future. If government at central or provincial level wanted to develop tribal land in KwaZulu in future, for whatever purpose, it would have to negotiate with the king, he said.
