He was speaking on Thursday while meeting Swedish Prime Minister Karl Bildt who arrived in St Petersburg to attend Swedish Days there. In this connection, Sobchak pointed to widespread western rumors that St Petersburg had become a highly dangerous place for business activity. About a month ago, the U.S. consulate in St Petersburg compiled a report about the city's rampant crime which was later published by U.S. newspapers. The report warns businessmen and tourists against visiting St Petersburg and expresses concern over high crime rates in the region ahead of the Goodwill Games which will involve U.S. sportsmen. Sobchak and Bildt have both expressed satisfaction over the state of relations between Russia and Sweden.
