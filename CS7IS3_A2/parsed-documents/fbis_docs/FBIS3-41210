Their plans were foiled by agents from the Lvov Oblast Ukrainian Security Service Administration who arrested the suspects. Findings obtained in a preliminary investigation conducted by a department chief of the above-mentioned agency have been proved beyond any doubt in court. In a verdict announced last week, M.I. Kotov and M.V. Kanunnykov were sentenced, respectively, to 11 years in a maximum-security labor facility and seven years in a maximum-security correctional facility. The personal property of the convicts was confiscated. It should be noted the operational investigation was conducted by the Lvov Oblast SBU Administration in conjunction with the former Russian Ministry of Security.
