Just as the election campaign was a quiet affair, the results were equally unspectacular. The first conclusion to be drawn is that the Luxembourgers are generally unwilling to engage in uncertain or even risky experiments. As before, they are playing safe, giving preference to the proven grouping of the large, traditional parties. Second, the government's policy was widely sanctioned since none of the two parties who have governed together for 10 years was greatly discredited. The CSV [Christian Social People's Party] and the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg] suffered only minor losses. A third characteristic of these elections is the role played by the four minor parties in splitting the vote, despite the fact that the three major parties maintained their position. As a result, seats were lost by the parties capable of forming a government. It may be doubted whether this situation is of any advantage to the democratic power game in the state. Since the electorate largely confirmed the government's policy, it did not expressly desire any political change, logically enough. So the gains of the DP [Democratic Party], which is still the third strongest party, can by no means be taken automatically as a plebiscite for taking over government business. Nevertheless, the DP's gains are clear enough to make this party the real, albeit modest, winner of yesterday's elections. After the weak opposition and in view of the vague election program, however, the question was raised as to how the DP managed to make these gains and whether they are due more to protest votes rather than convinced supporters. It should also be borne in mind that this party reached a rare low point in 1989 with only 11 seats. The minor losses suffered by the governing parties are due first to the natural signs of wear and tear after 10 years of coalition politics. This government, which has borne the responsibility for such a long time and which has had to make many unpopular decisions during that period, came out of this remarkably well yesterday. The CSV in particular, as the leading party in government, is likely to feel that its policy and role have been vindicated, the respected figure of Prime Minister Jacques Santer having undoubtedly made an important contribution to this recognition. The LSAP has profited less from this government bonus. Just like the CSV, it lost many votes to the splinter parties. Moreover, it has had responsibility for certain departments which have recently provoked extensive discussions and disputes, e.g., the health reforms, which have made many citizens feel unsettled. Moreover, the Socialist Party derived no benefit from pushing the ideological claims of its rabble-rousers to the center of the election campaign, thus jeopardizing the nation's internal peace. The most annoying result for the major parties was undoubtedly that of the ADR [Action Committee for Democracy and Pension Fairness]. Nevertheless, the scandal that this party incurred, with the lies and smear campaigns concerning alleged party donations, was sanctioned retrospectively yesterday by so many voters via the polls that these people have been given five seats as a reward, believe it or not, and hence the status of a parliamentary group. What were these Luxembourgers thinking about when they made that decision yesterday in the polling booth? Were the shabby, nationalistic, anti-European slogans and the pensions policy used as a bait worth more to them than basic political honesty? The fact that the Greens did not achieve the breakthrough many people thought they would is all the more surprising because many young people have become eligible to vote in the five years since the last election, and it is widely assumed that the Greens receive the greatest response and acceptance from this group. Although with five seats the GLEI-GAP [Green Ecologist Initiative List/The Green Alternative] will now be able to constitute a parliamentary group, this result cannot hide the fact that they have lost their original impetus, and the young voters have turned clearly to traditional parties, and not necessarily to the left either. On the contrary, taken as a whole, the left has not been strengthened by any means by yesterday's election. The Communists and the New Left in particular were cast into oblivion. But they were not the only ones. The extreme right of the National Movement were also put in their place, and this against a background of an internationally increasing resentment of foreigners which seems to stop at Luxembourg's borders though, and after the second attempt to compete with the Democrats for seats in the chamber. The Luxembourger's rejection of the really extremist forces may placate those who, after the relative success of the ADR built on demagogy and lies, have yesterday evening lost their faith in the good sense of some of the voters.
