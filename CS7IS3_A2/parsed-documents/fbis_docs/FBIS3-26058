The State Administration for Industry and Commerce's analysis of these cases indicates the following special characteristics of "foreign exchange black-market transactions": 1. Foreign exchange transaction shops are established illegally and operate without licenses. All the "foreign exchange black- market transaction shops" that were investigated had not registered with the industrial and commercial administration department, but they dealt in illegal foreign exchange business under such names as "futures transaction department," "investment company limited," "international banking center," "representative office," and "liaison office." For example, Shihua Commodity Futures Transaction Division, International Banking Information Center, and Bailigao Investment Company Limited were all operating without registering with the industrial and commercial administration department. 2. They use advanced means to run illegal businesses, such as laser teleprinters and computer display units. As for telecommunication equipment, they use mobile phones and walkie- talkies. Whenever they sense any trouble, the shop owners will run away with account books and cash and hide out. Soon after a black- market shop is closed down somewhere, another new shop opens somewhere else. 3. In a certain sense they are cheating their clients. These illegal foreign exchange black-marketeers use official seals they made on their own without authorization. Claiming themselves to be "foreign exchange transaction agents," they lure clients into dealings. Usually they charge their clients 80 to 150 yuan for transaction of a lot (1,000 shares). And they remit the cash they collect from their clients soon after transaction, while the so- called "international financial market information" reflected in their computers is all outdated information. For example, a client coming to Shenzhen from somewhere else in China, was lured into foreign exchange transaction by a "Fuxing Trading Company" and a "Zhuhai Trading Company," which were established by two Englishmen. He first invested HK$100,000 [Hong Kong dollars] in the business. Then the agent lied to him that his investment had earned him an equal amount of profit. Feeling that it was easy to make money from foreign exchange transactions, the investor invested another HK$100,000. However, a few days later, the agent lied to him that the foreign exchange market had slumped and all his capital, HK$200,000, had been lost in the business. In order to recover his loss, the client invested an additional HK$700,000, and again all his money was lost in one month. When he realized that this was but a fraud, the cheats had already run away with all the money. 4. The agents cheat their clients, and the clients in turn cheat other clients. The pay an agent gets is proportional to the number of his clients and the amount of transactions he manages to conclude. Therefore, some innocent young people tried very hard to push others to invest in foreign exchange business. Some of them first cheated their families, relatives, and friends, and then induced them to cheat other relatives and friends. Thus they started a chain of fraud. The State Administration for Industry and Commerce believes that the main reason why "foreign exchange black-market transactions" persist despite repeated bans is because no strong action has been taken to fight these activities. The existing laws and regulations do not set any concrete penalties against black-marketeers, hence the law enforcers have no rules to follow in this regard.
