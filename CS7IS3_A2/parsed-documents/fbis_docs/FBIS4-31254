Members of [self-proclaimed leader of autonomous province of western Bosnia Fikret] Abdic's treacherous paramilitary were in action with antiaircraft weapons and heavy machine-guns along all lines of separation throughout the night and this morning. They indiscriminately shelled (?civilian) villages in the [word indistinct] regions of (Strbac), Pecigrad, (Lickovac), and (Skodrovo). Shots and bomb explosions could be heard throughout the night on the (Strbac)-(?Sturlic) line, which clearly shows that what is involved are new clashes between Fikret Abdic's mercenaries and (?renegades) with the local population, which no longer accepts the [words indistinct] conflict imposed on it.
