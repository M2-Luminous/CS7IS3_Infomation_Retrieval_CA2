Dee Hill: "Oil Pipeline Shutdown Serves as a Warning"] [Text] When the crude oil flowing through the pipeline from Russia to the Czech Republic was cut off for five days last month, it gave government and industrial users cause for alarm and served as a dire warning of what the future might hold for countries that rely on Russia for energy. No oil flowed through the Druzba--or "Friendship"--pipeline from Jan. 17 to 22, after several major exporters of oil from Russia apparently failed to receive the proper licenses for export from the Russian government. According to Jana Hejskova, a senior manager at Chemapol, which is the main Czech buyer and supplier of Russian crude, halts in the oil flow from Russia have become a common occurrence in the last two months. "It's the red tape and the generally unpredictable situation [in Russia]," she said. "If you ask the Russian ministry [that manages oil exports], they will tell you that everything is working normally, so they won't do anything about it." Chemapol buys about 500,000 tons of oil monthly--90 percent of the Druzba pipeline's supply to the Czech Republic. Hejskova said it took the company more than a week to return to normal after the shortage. An official with Synthesia, a large Czech chemical concern, said that while its production had not fallen behind during the shortage, it is now trying to strike its own deal with Polish and Western European suppliers. "We have no other supply," said spokesman Gregor Vavruska. By the time the oil flow resumed, the Czech Republic's three refineries in Litvinov, Kralupy and Vltavou and Pardubice had exhausted the reserves of Chemapol oil and were forced to buy oil from the reserves of Transpetrol in Slovakia, whose supplies would have lasted only four days. A crisis was in the making. Fortunately, however, the flow resumed and there were no reports of problems or panic at the refineries. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the situation could be repeated. The threat of a crisis highlighted the Czech Republic's precarious position as a country with a single-source oil supply. Chemapol would like to reopen a pipeline leading from Rijeka in the former Yugoslavia up through Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia. That pipeline has been inoperative since September 1991. The proposed Ingolstadt pipeline, leading from Bavaria to the Czech Republic, still faces many obstacles. Dusan Strauch of the Czech Material Reserves office said the government is building more reserve capacity for crude oil, which currently only exists with the refineries themselves. "I know very well the Western system, with 90-day reserves," Strauch said. "But when we were cooperating with the Soviet Union some years ago, they told our leaders that it was not necessary." Strauch declined to say exactly how long Czech industry could function with a cut in the Druzba supply, but he did not contest the report by Czech newspapers that the country can function without the pipeline for 30 days. New reserve construction, he said, will take several years, and the first storage facility will hold 500,000 tons.
