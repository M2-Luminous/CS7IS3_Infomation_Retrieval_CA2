Enquiries by Eastern Express show there is an almost equal split in the Legislative Council [Legco] between those who support Patten and those who support the package of amendments -- known as the 1994 package -- sponsored by the Liberal Party and some independents co-ordinated by Eric Li. Non-aligned members will be decisive in determining the outcome of the vote. A legislator, who did not wish to be identified, said yesterday Patten has been personally seeing non-aligned members to lobby them to support the electoral reform bill. The lobbying has focused on four appointed members -- Roger Luk, Vincent Cheng, Marvin Cheung and Martin Barrow -- who have been heavily courted by Patten in the past two days. These four legislators are understood to support the 1994 package. Last night Roger Luk said he would stand firm on his support for the watered down proposals despite lobbying by Patten. Patten is believed to have requested breakfast with the group of non-aligned legislators to lobby for their support. The Liberal Party and some independent members yesterday finalised and submitted their package of amendments to water down the government bill which will be debated on June 29. The main thrust of these proposals is to retain corporate voting in functional constituencies and reduce the size of the electorates. It is estimated that apart from the three government officials in Legco, there are 23 legislators in the Democratic camp who will vote for the government bill. These include the 17 United Democrats and Meeting Point members, and independents in the Democratic camp, such as Fung Kin-kee, Christine Loh, Anna Wu and Jimmy McGregor. Emily Lau, a committed Democrat, is also counted as a supporter but she said she was still considering her support as she had put in a private member's bill for full direct elections. Lau said there was still a "fighting chance" her bill would be passed by Legco. She said she has secured 17 votes. Hui Yin-fat is also believed to support Patten's bill. Simon Ip is another possible supporter. There are about 23 legislators who would support the 1994 package. They include the 15 Liberal Party members, and the independents Eric Li, Elsie Tu, Samuel Wong, Roger Luk and Vincent Cheng. Martin Barrow, Marvin Cheung and Alfred Tso are also likely to support it. A legislator who prefers to remain anonymous and who supports the 1994 package, said there would be at most 31 votes for the watered down proposals if pro-China legislators did not abstain. Because of the close vote, it is possible neither the government bill nor any of the amendments will pass. If so the status quo will be maintained. Last night, a senior government official denied allegations that the Government is panicking over securing enough votes for the reform package. Among the 1994 amendments is a proposal to set up a four-part election committee, each comprising 99 members returning 10 legislators.
