Talabani was due to meet yesterday with Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] Leader Mas'ud Barzani, his partner in the Kurdistan Front [KF] leadership, at the Shirin Palace Hotel in Shaqlawah for the first time since the fighting broke out between their two parties about a month ago. The fighting is believed to have left hundreds of casualties in northern Iraq. The purpose of the meeting is to confirm the reconciliation between the two parties. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, PUK sources have denied that Talabani sent an envoy to Baghdad to negotiate with the Iraqi Government. The Islamic Movement in Kurdistan had claimed that the Kurdish leader had sent Shaykh 'Abd-al-Latif al-Barzanji to Baghdad on 22 May and that the efforts of the latter, which coincided with the Kurdish infighting, made no progress. The sources said "al-Barzanji is an Irbil merchant who has no links with the PUK." [passage omitted]
