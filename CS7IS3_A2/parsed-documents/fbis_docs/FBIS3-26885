This is a contracting budget. According to the budget, the financial budget for FY1995 will be reduced to $176.1 billion through cutting defense expenditures, suspending over 100 government undertakings, laying off redundant civil servants, and administrative restructuring. The deficit will be $100 billion less than estimated by the Bush administration. If this plan can be carried through, it will be the first time since the Truman administration that the United States has succeeded in reducing its deficit for three successive years. The Clinton administration has focused on reforming the medical insurance system. If reform can be carried out successfully in FY1995, another $11 billion will be saved. According to the Clinton administration's new budget, total expenditure in 1995 will be $1.518 trillion, up 2.3 percent over the previous year, while the total annual revenue is 1.342 trillion, up 7.4 percent over the previous year. The increase in annual revenue is due to the tax-raising policy introduced last year and to increases in tax revenue brought about by economic recovery. The Growth Rate in 1994 is 3.1 Percent Since the Clinton administration's new budget will bring the deficit down to $176.1 billion, which is the lowest for the last six years, and the unemployment rate will go down slowly due to economic recovery, the United States' economic growth for 1994 and 1995 is estimated to hit 3.1 and 2.8 percent respectively, which shows that the U.S. economy is improving. Bill Clinton himself maintains that the goal of "a low inflation rate and a sustained and steady development of the economy" has been attained and he is more confident about future economic development. It should be noted that the improvement in some economic indicators, such as the improvement in the unemployment and inflation rates, began during the Bush administration and have become more evident recently. Therefore, we cannot attribute all the economic improvement to Clinton, who has only been in office for a little more than a year. Reduced Defense Expenditure in Post-Cold War Period Continued cuts in defense spending in the post-cold war period have made it possible for the Clinton administration to reduce the deficit and apply itself to revitalizing the economy. Total defense expenditure for FY1995 (from October 1994 to September 1995) is $263.7 billion, down 0.9 percent from the previous year. As a result, the Defense Department reduced its existing 1.6 million-strong army by 100,000 and decided to focus on improving the quality of national defense by building new aircraft carriers and more advanced submarines. Apart from the defense department, 10 of the 14 most important departments, including the agriculture, energy, and state departments, will slash their administrative expenditures according to their actual performance last year, which will result in, among other things, the laying off of 118,000 civil servants. But the foreign trade deficit cannot be reduced by a big margin. The foreign trade deficit for FY1995 is estimated to stand at between $135 and $175 billion, and the international payments deficit at between $105 and 145 billion, both higher than the actual figures for FY1993. What is of top importance is how Clinton will carry out reforms in the medical insurance system, the result of which is difficult to predict. Reforming the old, defective and wasteful medical care system involves the immediate interests of the American people. If the government cuts subsidies, this will meet great opposition from all quarters because smaller government subsidies means bigger individual burdens; but if the government gives in, the obstinate economic illness will defy a cure. In addition, the government will lay off 252,000 civil servants in the next five years. These people, who will become jobless, will certainly oppose the Clinton administration's austerity policy. Therefore, a number of economists are not optimistic about specific reforms to the medical care system. It is still too early to say whether the unemployment rate will be reduced.
