ACTION: Notice of Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review and Revocation in Part of the Countervailing Duty Order. SUMMARY: On June 3, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on ceramic tile from Mexico (58 FR 31505). We have now completed this review and determine the total bounty or grant to be zero or de minimis for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. In addition, because we have determined that the following companies have met the requirements for partial revocation from the order, the Department is revoking the countervailing duty order with respect to these companies: Azulejos Orion, S.A., Ceramica Santa Julia, Eduardo Garcia de la Pena, Jesus Garza Arocha, Ladrillera Monterrey, S.A., Pisos Coloniales de Mexico, S.A., Reynol Martinez Chapa, and Teofilo Covarrubias. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 19, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On June 3, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (58 FR 31505) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the countervailing duty order on ceramic tile from Mexico (47 FR 20012; May 10, 1982). The Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of Mexican ceramic tile, including non-mosaic, glazed, and unglazed ceramic floor and wall tile. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 6907.10.0000, 6907.90.0000, 6908.10.0000 and 6908.90.0000. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991, sixty-one companies, and the following programs: (1) FOMEX; (2) BANCOMEXT Financing for Exporters; (3) PITEX; (4) NAFINSA Long-term Loans; (5) Other BANCOMEXT preferential financing; (6) CEPROFI; (7) import duty reductions and exemptions; (8) state tax incentives; (9) NAFINSA FONEI-type financing; and (10) NAFINSA FOGAIN-type financing. Calculation Methodology for Assessment and Cash Deposit Purposes In calculating the benefits received during the review period, we followed the methodology described in the preamble to 19 CFR 355.20(d) (53 FR 52306, and 52325; December 27, 1988). We calculated a country-wide rate, weight-averaging the benefits received by the sixty-one companies subject to review to determine the overall subsidy from all countervailing programs benefitting exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. Because the overall weighted-average country-wide rate was de minimis, as defined by 19 CFR 355.7, we did not proceed any further in the calculation methodology.
