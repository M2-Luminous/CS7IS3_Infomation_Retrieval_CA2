Minister Strak said during the "Morning Signals" program that any suggestions that the prime minister succumbed to pressure from outside were untrue. [Begin recording] [Strak] I can say that the prime minister is conducting an entirely independent policy, and any suspicions that he is guided by anyone from outside are simply preposterous. I am surprised that these suspicions appear at all. [Unidentified correspondent] Is the coalition agreement going to be renegotiated? [Strak] I think that the coalition agreement is a good document, and I think the political part is being implemented. The economic part should be implemented as well, although the matter is much more difficult. There is great difficulty in reconciling what is necessary for maintaining a certain macroeconomic balance, which has been achieved in Poland and which is appreciated by the government, with the necessity to meet the most severe and urgent public needs. Public expectations in this domain found their expression in the demonstration. We are treating this event with full seriousness because people who took part in it carry the burden of economic change in Poland on their backs. There is undoubtedly a need to reduce the burden, to make it lighter, although this is an extremely difficult task. I think this government has been aware of the difficulties. Some decisions are made within the government's abilities, but we are fully aware that these decisions do not resolve the issue. [end recording]
