Rutskoy, at the Head of Combatants, Will Stand Up to Zhirinovskiy"] [Text] The somewhat dubious prospect of ensuring national concord hardly inspired the State Duma deputies during yesterday's voting for a package containing the elements "memorandum of accord, amnesty, political amnesty, abolition of the commission to investigate the October events." It is more logical to assume that lying behind the slogan of universal conciliation are quite concrete political interests whose coordination was reduced to commonplace bargaining. The agro-communist bloc, which sought to the very end to uphold the "investigation" commission, tried to use the package for just another attack on President Yeltsin. Gennadiy Zyuganov's supporters were ready to agree to the prospect that the inmates to be released from Lefortovo can pose serious competition for the "legal" opposition and cause just another split within communist ranks. Yet even the threat of renewed political activity by Russian Communist Workers Party leader Viktor Anpilov did not keep them from the temptation to demonstrate their fighting spirit to the Kremlin. True, it needs to be recognized that the liquidation of the parliamentary commission was a fairly tangible fly in the ointment for the Russian Federation Communist Party and the Agrarian Party of Russia. Sergey Shakhray, traditional author of various "compromises," according to Deputy Viktor Sheynis (Yabloko faction), "has won in his own game: Now he will be called the father of national accord." This accord, however, appears rather one-sided. It was the Communists who rushed to congratulate Shakhray on his impressive victory after the session. Shaking his hand, Zyuganov's associates were happy: "At last Sergey Mikhaylovich has waken up." The PRES [Party of National Unity and Accord] leader himself, however, did not share this joy over his own "awakening." PRES' "natural allies," i.e., Yabloko and Russia's Choice, did not display any particular ecstasy over the proposed formula for ecumenical conciliation. Moreover, the muffled hissing behind Shakhray's back clearly contained the word "treachery." Having tipped the scale in favor of the Communists (this conclusion follows from the voting results), Shakhray has for the first time dissociated himself from the "democratic bloc." In spite of this, he will always be received back into the fold with outstretched arms: His "natural allies" need heads too badly. Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar is waiting for the first results of the "national accord" -- the appearance of "Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and others at the head of combatants in Moscow streets." According to Viktor Sheynis, on the other hand, the political revival of the Lefortovo inmates is not a catastrophe. In fact Sheynis sees their release as a boon for the president and the entire democratic camp. The first "plus" is the possibility for the president to get gracefully out of the situation where the participants in the October events have acquired the aura of martyrs while "chances are that they will never be indicted anyway." Another "plus" is Aleksandr Rutskoy's participation in the upcoming presidential elections. According to Viktor Sheynis, Rutskoy has an electorate similar to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's, which they will share on an approximately equal basis. Therefore the chances for victory by a democratic candidate in the elections are still intact. It is dubious, however, that Boris Yeltsin has such a gift of prophesy and it was for the sake of these dubious advantages that under the Constitution he endowed the Duma with the power of amnesty, whereupon a corresponding bill to the parliament's lower chamber was submitted. Moreover, not to understand that the Duma majority will add political amnesty to this draft law points to a total lack of political acumen.
