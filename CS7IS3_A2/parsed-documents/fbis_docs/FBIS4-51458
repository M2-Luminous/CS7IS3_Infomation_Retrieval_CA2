The coalition had hoped to win acceptance of amendments that would bring the proposals closer to the post-1997 political structure envisaged in China's interpretation of the Basic Law. But a senior mainland official declined to give his blessing to adjustments that might reverse Beijing's present stance that the territory's political structure will terminate on July 1, 1997 and be replaced with one worked out between now and then. Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Chen Ziying, instead told a delegation of Hong Kong textile merchants in Beijing that "the British side can do whatever it likes to before 1997". Mr Patten's proposals come before the Legislative Council next month. Despite repeated attempts to broach the possibility that China might accept the coalition's compromise version of Mr Patten's proposals, Mr Chen would make no comment. Under the Liberal Party's model announced last week, the total size of franchise for functional constituency elections would be reduced to no more than 170,000. Mr Patten seeks to widen the franchise to about 2.5 million. Henry Tang Ying-yen, who ranks highly in the Liberal Party, said the delegation was told that the 1995 Legislative Council had a lifespan of 20 months and would be disbanded by June 30, 1997. Mr Tang said a compromise was desirable to avoid a "one-party-dominated" legislature in 1995, apparently referring to the likelihood that a Legco controlled by "small `l' liberals" could not survive the changeover because China would not accept the "through-train" arrangement. "Mr Chen has not said whether he would support our amendments or not," Mr Tang said. Leader of the delegation, Fong Hang, believed it was very difficult for China to commit itself on any Hong Kong affairs before 1997. Mr Tang quoted Mr Chen as stressing that the nine new functional constituency seats should not be turned into some form of direct elections in disguise. Mr Chen said workers should not be eligible to vote in the nine new functional constituency seats because there were already two seats for the labour sector. Mr Tang said Mr Chen agreed with coalition proposals that the existing corporate voting system should be adopted for the nine extra seats. The Liberal Party and some independents held the view that their model would have a better chance to get through the Legislative Council if they could secure support from their pro-China colleagues. A blessing from Chinese officials such as Mr Chen was regarded as vital in winning support from the pro-China side. Legislator Tam Yiu-chung of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong said his group "appreciated" the efforts of the coalition, but would probably abstain in the vote after the debate scheduled for June 29. "The Chinese principle is that `we will go ahead with our own plans' and will not make any positive statements on the amendments. The possibility of getting support from them on the amendments is virtually zero," he said. Mr Tam, a Preliminary Working Committee member who has just returned from subgroup meetings in Beijing, said officials from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office had not given them instructions on how to vote. "Whether the final blueprint is the original model or any revised proposals will make no difference to China," he said. Privately, mainland officials said they were not concerned which model Legco adopted. But at a separate meeting with the local businessmen, senior Communist Party official Wang Zhaoguo warned that the attempt by the British Government to "leave its colonial legacy and bring chaos to the territory after it retreats is doomed to fail". Mr Wang, the party's United Front Work Department, claimed that more Hong Kong people were now aware of the real motives of the British Government. "This will be very conducive to the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong in the transitional period," he said.
