This is how they drew the lessons of the party's failure in the election. Correspondent Edit Nagy interviewed Viktor Orban. [Begin recording] [Orban] National Executive Chairman Jozsef Szajer has resigned and so have I, from my post as party chairman. In effect, all the party officeholders have done the same -- including the deputy chairmen of the party. [Nagy] Why did you make this decision? [Orban] The party performed poorly at the elections--in terms of our expectations--and the responsibility for this must be borne by the party's highest-level elected officeholders, especially the chairman. [Nagy] The congress will decide whether to accept the resignations. What do you expect? [Orban] Until the next congress everybody will remain in place, in practice they will carry out their duties on a provisional acting basis, at least this is what I think. Tomorrow only the date for convening the congress will be debated, presumably sometime in June when--if the party thinks fit--it will be able to elect its new leaders.
