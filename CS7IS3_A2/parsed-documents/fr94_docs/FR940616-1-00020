FR940616-1-00020 FR940616-1-00008 In Donovan v. Hotel, Motel & Restaurant Employees Local 19, 700 F.2d 539 (9th Cir. 1983), however, the court held, after examining the legislative history of the Act, that the LMRDA does not authorize the Secretary to bring civil action against a union for failure to follow its concededly adequate officer removal procedure. Local 19 rejected the Secretary's reliance on section 402(a) as a basis for extending his authority under section 401(h) to intervene in officer removal proceedings where an adequate removal procedure exists. The court concluded that those regulations found in subpart B of 29 CFR part 417 which purport to give the Secretary general authority to intervene in union affairs upon a finding that a union has failed to follow its adequate removal procedures are void for lack of statutory authority. Local 19 is the only judicial decision that addresses this issue, and the Department has determined, upon review, that the holding of the court in Local 19 is correct. The Department therefore proposes to delete the language in subpart B of 29 CFR part 417 granting the Secretary authority to file suit against a union for failure to follow its adequate officer removal procedures. Administrative Notices A. Executive Order 12866 The Department of Labor has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 in that it will not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities, (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency, (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof, or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Agency Head has certified that this proposed rule, if issued, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The proposed rule will only apply to local labor organizations and would decrease the regulation of such labor organizations. However, the Department has determined that labor organizations regulated pursuant to the statutory authority granted under the LMRDA do not constitute small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection requirements. Therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended, is not applicable.
