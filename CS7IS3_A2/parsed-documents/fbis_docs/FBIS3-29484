Sanit Worapanya, deputy permanent secretary of Commerce Ministry, disclosed that the increase in the foreign shareholding limit required amendment of the law to allow this to be raised to 49 percent while the ministerial regulation must be issued to fix the annual increase rate of the shareholding. He said it is time to increase the number of insurance firms in the country to pave the way for a major readjustment in line with the new GATT agreement which is to become effective soon. He said: [Begin Sanit recording] The committee agreed during the meeting that the law has to be amended to limit foreign shares to 49 percent. Meanwhile, a ministerial regulation is needed to fix the annual increase rate of the foreign share limit. For example, the law will state that the limit during the first five years is fixed at not more than 40 percent, and the limit will be further expanded after that. Take this year for example, the foreign shareholding limit will remain at 40 percent until 1999 and be raised to 49 percent in 2002. The annual increase will be stipulated in the ministerial regualtion. All members agreed that Thailand can no longer close its insurance market, and therefore, it must allow more insurance companies to operate in Thailand. The secretary of the committee has been assigned to consult with the private sector, mass media, and the 20 representatives of consumers we invited to attend this meeting to figure out the exact number of companies to be allowed to do business.
