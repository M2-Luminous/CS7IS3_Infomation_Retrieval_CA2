[Momcilovic] I am relatively optimistic. According to General Rose himself, the situation is developing favorably on the ground and calm continues to reign around Sarajevo. In any case, as General Briquemont has already said, it is not possible to resolve the Bosnian crisis by military means. Mr. Karadzic has moreover made it known that he is ready to withdraw his heavy weapons on condition that the Bosnian Muslim Army does the same. That is what is required by the NATO decision in points six and seven. The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] admits that the Muslims are trying to profit from the situation and their army's chief of staff refused to take part in the three-sided meeting with his Serbian counterpart and General Cot. [Van Velthem] Is the FRY putting pressure on the Bosnian Serbs? [Momcilovic] Mr. Karadzic, who regularly visits Belgrade, of course remains in contact with the federal authorities. We are doing what we can to favor a peaceful outcome to the crisis. [Van Velthem] What if the air strikes go ahead? [Momcilovic] It is difficult to make predictions on the subject. Of course, in the FRY, there is a normal and legitimate interest in the fate of the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs. If Benazir Bhutto can come 10,000 kilometers to discuss the fate of the Bosnian Muslims, why can't the Serbs, their immediate neighbors, also take an interest in their own brothers. [Van Velthem] The FRY supports the European peace plan for Bosnia. Does that include the respect of administrative borders that are internationally recognized? [Momcilovic] NATO's recent decision refers explicitly to the European plan. It is therefore a solid basis for the United States as well as for the Twelve. But what do we see in reality? The Serbs accepted this plan two whole months ago, respecting the territorial concessions requested in favor of the Muslims --one third of the country. Only the authorities in Sarajevo have refused this document. Will Washington's intervention in the peace process persuade the Muslims to accept this plan? That is the main question being asked today. It is true that there are a few points that have yet to be answered, such as Muslim access to the Adriatic coast and to the Save. The important thing, however, is to put an end to the war, and then we can negotiate in detail the issues that remain unresolved. [Van Velthem] But Mr. Karadzic has said that his aim is annexation to Serbia. [Momcilovic] It is too early to envisage such a hypothesis before a lasting peace is imposed on Bosnia. Firstly, we should settle all the questions raised by the hasty recognition of the former Yugoslav republics. The international community -- and President Mitterrand has admitted this -- committed a serious mistake when it based its decision on the internal borders born out of communism, without taking into account the status of minority groups and the distribution of rights between the three communities. [Van Velthem] If NATO's requirements are satisfied, will the FRY try to take advantage of this to obtain the lifting of the embargo? [Momcilovic] The peace negotiations do not concern just Sarajevo but are related to the whole process, including the UN sanctions. It is clear that if the first step is accomplished with a peaceful solution being found for Sarajevo, then naturally the issue of lifting the sanctions will have to be considered. All the more so, since after 24 months of sanctions the shortage of goods is becoming very trying for the civilian population of the FRY. In addition, they have to support half a million refugees. [Van Velthem] Precisely, is Yugoslav public opinion still caught up in the events in Bosnia, or has economic survival now become the priority? [Momcilovic] The Serbs are always interested in everything that affects them directly. In total, in both world wars, we lost more than four million of our people standing up to fascism. We want just one thing: To be able to live together, in peace, without being considered minorities. You should not forget the demography of the Balkans: More than 10 million Serbs as opposed to five million Croats, and two million Muslims. Why should we accept being split up into three states? We are a single people vital to stability in this region. [Van Velthem] Zagreb and Belgrade have reopened their dialogue with mutual diplomatic representation. However, nothing has been settled in Krajina. [Momcilovic] It is up to the authorities in Zagreb and Krajina to define among themselves what their future relations will be. For us, in the current situation, the first steps are all-important. The normalizing of relations between the FRY and Croatia is a step in this direction: Restoring communications, rebuilding the economic fabric, and reestablishing bilateral trade are major initiatives since they illustrate how we used to complement each other before the war. This is the path we must take in the future. All of our destinies, the fate of the former Yugoslav peoples, lies with cooperation and coexistence, not in permanent confrontation.
