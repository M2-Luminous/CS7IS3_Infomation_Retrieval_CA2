[passage omitted] In a statement to the press this morning, Foreign Minister Essy Amara said that our country supported France's initiative. [Begin Amara recording] What is certain is that, at least, this initiative has the merit of existing. I think Cote d'Ivoire, after all the explanations, fully supports this exercise, especially as it does not contravene the resolutions adopted in Tunis. The Tunis resolutions underscored the urgent need to bring an immediate end to the systematic massacres and killings and also called for an immediate end to these heinous crimes, which constitute a crime against humanity. I also think that another conclusion from Tunis is the urgency in finding a solution to these massacres, and it is from this perspective that we must consider the French initiative, which consists above all in stopping the killings and protecting the people assembled in the various camps. As you know, the UN resolution -- the UN Observer Mission for Uganda and Rwanda II -- calls for the sending of 5,200 troops, but from what we have learned, so far, there are only 2,900, which shows the difficulty in establishing this force. This is why I believe that in view of the urgency of the situation, it is necessary to initiate an ad hoc operation. [end recording]
