Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of our country, delivered a speech. He said: Laos and Mongolia are situated in the same region. The peoples of the two countries have maintained similar specific characteristics in terms of customs, culture, and languages. The similarity in these specific points has served as the basis for the establishment of the long-standing, profound relations between the two countries. Through the process of the said relations, the two peoples have all along been friendly to each other. Noteworthy is that leaders at various levels of our two countries have regularly exchanged visits that have thus brought about mutual understanding and firm friendship with each other. This official friendship visit to Laos by your excellency is considered a significant event in the relations between our two countries in the new stage. It has created a new step of the strengthening of friendship between the peoples of the two countries. It has also resulted in further broadening the cooperation between our two countries. I maintain that all these have served the interest and aspirations of the Lao and Mongolian peoples. They have also significantly contributed to the common trend of the establishment and promotion of peace, stability, friendship, and cooperation among the countries in the region. As a friendly country, we have closely followed up the steps of development of Mongolia. We are glad to see that with the patriotic tradition, together with their industriousness and persistence in engaging in labor, the Mongolian people have successfully overcome the economic (?and social) difficulties step by step. As a result, the material and cultural life of the Mongolian people have been improved and the situation in the country has now been stabilized. We believe that with your excellency's efficient execution of the state affairs, the potential in various fields will be exploited and vigorously promoted and expanded, and Mongolia will then be further developed and will prosper. H.E. President Nouhak Phoumsavan continued: [Begin Nouhak Phoumsavan recording] After the establishment of the LPDR, our entire Lao people have positively implemented the tasks of defending and building the country. We have now carried out the renovation work in many fields. We have built the new, market-oriented economy along with the broadening of the relations and cooperation with foreign countries to draw foreign investments. Simultaneously, we have paid attention to gradually perfecting the political system to make it conform to the renovation in other fields. Through this process, we see that our country has basically achieved stability and tranquillity while the people have maintained solidarity and harmony. The people's rights of being owners of the country have also been promoted and expanded as their living conditions have been evidently improved. [words indistinct] our entire Lao people have always wished to live in (?peace) and to be friends with (?peoples of other countries). For this reason, the LPDR Government has pursued and will consistently continue to pursue the policy of building the country to achieve peace, independence, friendship, and cooperation with various countries, regardless of the differences in the political and social systems on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. We support the creative activities of Mongolia in the international arena. We particularly support the announcement on the turning of Mongolia into a nuclear-free country, an act that has contributed to promoting and establishing stability and security in the region and the rest of the world. I would like to take this occasion to express gratitude to the Mongolian people for the precious support and assistance that they have rendered to our Lao people in the recent past. Ladies, gentlemen, and distinguished guests: Laos and Mongolia have maintained a similar starting point in the socioeconomic field. (?Presently), the two countries are carrying out the restructuring [words indistinct] in accordance with their respective specific points and conditions. Both countries have wanted [words indistinct] through the implementation of similar economic mechanism and policy of broadening the relations with various countries. I am of the view that Laos and Mongolia have maintained the potential to increase cooperation in many fields in accordance with the interest and [words indistinct] (?of the peoples of the two countries). I am convinced that this visit to our country by H.E. President Ochirbat (?will create a positive step for our two countries) to promote, expand, and strengthen the friendly relations. It will also bring about the broadening of the cooperation between the two countries in accordance with the aspirations and interests of the two peoples of Laos and Mongolia. [end recording] Later, H.E. President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat of Mongolia delivered a reply speech. He said: [Begin Ochirbat recording, in Mongol fading into Lao translation] I am very pleased to note that our two countries and two peoples of Mongolia and Laos have together promoted and expanded the friendly relations since ancient times. The two sides have always made efforts and cooperated in overcoming various trials to enhance the said relations. I would like to reiterate here that increasing development and strengthening of the relations and cooperation between our two countries have resulted from the spirit of mutual respect and support. In recent years, [passage indistinct] though there was no development in the relations between our two countries due to (?the difficulties in switching to the market economy, which is our common objective), following the trend of friendship and cooperation that has covered the relations among various countries in the region and other favorable factors, our two countries have now maintained new conditions, and there is a potential to enhance the cooperation along a new path and under a new form. Besides, our two countries are situated in the same continent and have shared many common specific points, such as the states of being landlocked countries, having small populations, and maintaining almost the same level of development. With the efforts to fulfill similar objectives and with the spirit of respecting each other, our two peoples are marching forward along the same road on the friendly spirit of helping each other and cooperating with each other. I also reiterate here that Mongolia has respected and attached importance to the traditional relations with the LPDR. I pledge to strengthen, promote, and expand the said relations to make them ever more prosperous on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and with new contents and forms. [passage indistinct] The Mongolian government has always supported and will continue to support the foreign policy of cherishing peace and the efforts of the LPDR, which are aimed at turning Southeast Asia into a region of peace, stability, and cooperation. The Mongolian people are sincerely pleased to see the Lao people, who have maintained a long history [words indistinct], patriotic tradition, and heroic spirit of struggle, have achieved success in implementing the policy of broadening the economy in advance to the marketing system.
