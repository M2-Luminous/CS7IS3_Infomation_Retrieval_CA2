Apart from discussing the North Korean nuclear issue, the two presidents also examined some aspects of Boris Yeltsin's likely official visit to America in autumn. "Judging by the prospective time-frame, the trip will turn out well. Besides, it is planned that I will deliver a programmatic address at the U.N. General Assembly", Yeltsin remarked. In this connection, Yeltsin said that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher are to meet in Brussels on June 15-16 to specify details of the forthcoming visit. As far as the tour of Blagoveshchensk and the Republic of Tuva is concerned, Yeltsin voiced hope that foreign investments would be drawn to those areas, primarily from China, Japan, North and South Korea. "This may help those regions in earnest," he emphasised.
