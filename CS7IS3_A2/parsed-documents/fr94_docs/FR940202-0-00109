FR940202-0-00109 FR940202-0-00013 Least Bell's vireos nest primarily in willows ( Salix spp.) but also use a variety of other shrub and tree species for nest placement (Gray and Greaves 1984, Salata 1987). Least Bell's vireos forage in riparian and adjoining upland habitats (Salata 1983, Kus and Miner 1987). Preliminary studies of vireo foraging behavior along the Santa Ynez River and within the Mono Creek Basin (Santa Barbara County) indicated that a large percentage of their foraging may occur in the adjacent chaparral community up to 300 or more yards from the nest (Tom Keeney, biologist, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, July 31, 1985). The reduction of least Bell's vireo numbers and distribution is associated with widespread loss of riparian habitats and brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird ( Molothrus ater ). Destruction or significant alteration of riparian woodlands may have rendered the least Bell's vireo population incapable of withstanding the increase in brown-headed cowbird numbers that began in the 1920's (Grinnell and Miller 1944, Gaines 1974). The population decline of the vireo has been well documented. In 1973, no least Bell's vireos were found during an intensive search in nearly all remaining riparian habitat between Red Bluff, Tehama County, and Stockton, San Joaquin County (Gaines 1974). In 1977, the Service reviewed the literature, examined museum material, and contacted numerous National Audubon Society chapters and knowledgeable field observers for information on the status of the least Bell's vireo (Wilbur 1980). Since then, several intensive surveys of virtually all potential breeding habitat in California have been conducted (Gaines 1977, Goldwasser 1978, Goldwasser et al. 1980, RECON 1989, unpublished data on file with the Fish and Wildlife Service). Least Bell's vireos remain at only about 40 of over 150 historically occupied sites (some localities cover many miles of a water course) surveyed in the United States from 1977 through 1991. Most of these locations contain fewer than five pairs of vireos. About 76 percent of the U.S. population is found at just five localities. The current breeding population of the least Bell's vireo in California consists of approximately 500 pairs. Fewer than several hundred pairs are estimated to occur in Mexico. Consideration of New Information The final rule is based on new biological and economic data, and material received during the comment period for the proposed rule and revised proposed rule. Total Acres Included in Critical Habitat The Service is designating critical habitat for the least Bell's vireo at 10 areas encompassing approximately 38,000 acres (15,200 ha) in Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and San Diego Counties, California. About 49 percent of the vireo population in the United States occurs within these 10 areas. Critical habitat for the vireo occurs on the Santa Ynez River (Santa Barbara County), Santa Clara River (Ventura and Los Angeles Counties), Santa Ana River (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties), and Santa Margarita River, San Luis Rey River, Sweetwater River, San Diego River, Tijuana River, Coyote Creek, and Jamul-Dulzura Creeks (San Diego County). Federal land within the critical habitat consists of approximately 10,979 acres (4,392 ha) including approximately 7,600 acres (3,040 ha) in Santa Barbara County under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service, 3,338 acres (1,335 ha) in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties under the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers, and 53 acres (21 ha) in San Diego County under the jurisdiction of the International Boundary and Water Commission. The remainder of the critical habitat is in State, county, city, Indian Tribe, or private ownership.
