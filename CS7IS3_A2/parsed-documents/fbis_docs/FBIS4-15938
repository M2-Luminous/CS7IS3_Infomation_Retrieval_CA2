During this stage interplanetary stations are to study the sun and reach Pluto, the outermost known major planet of the solar system. Scientific delegations on space exploration of the United States and Russia discussed this bold idea and a number of other projects for cooperation in the exploration of the universe. Their meeting ended on Saturday. Under the programme a U.S. probe will carry a Russian optical module to the sun. A complicated trajectory of the flight has been charted. With the use of a highly-reliable Russian carrier "Proton" the probe will be put on a trajectory of a flight to Jupiter. When the probe is near Jupiter, the gravitation field of the huge planet will turn it, and it will be directed to the sun. Close to the sun, the Russian module will be separated and will collect information about the solar atmosphere and surface. Another joint flight is planned for the beginning of the 21st century. It will be the flight to Pluto and its satellite Charon. The main planets of the solar system, except for Pluto and Charon, have already been studied by Russian and American interplanetary stations. So the planned flight is of vast scientific interest. During the flight the Russian probe will be separated from the apparatus and will reach either Pluto or its satellite. Experts believe much promise is offered by the idea of using a U.S.-made small-size apparatus with new instruments and a large-capacity Russian booster-rocket and a Russian-made descendable probe meant for measurements in the atmosphere and surface photography. Aside from other advantages, this cooperation will make it possible to reach the remotest planet of the solar system in less than ten years. Exploration of Mars is planned to be continued. Two spacecraft carrying Russian and American scientific equipment are planned to be launched to Mars in 1998 and 2001. Plans for cooperation in astronomy and astrophysics were also considered. Experts believe that spectro-roentgen-gamma project will make it possible to create an orbital observatory to try unravel space mysteries such as black holes, neutron stars, pulsars, novas and supernovas and to study the universe. There is also an interesting project for an orbital radio observatory, Radioastron. The final document of the meeting was signed by Wesley Huntress, a chief of NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Yuriy Milov, deputy general director of the Russian Space Agency.
