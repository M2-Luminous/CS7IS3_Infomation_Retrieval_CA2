It is obvious that this blockade, which has been continuing for several years, is not aimed only at inflicting losses on the national economy and increasing the difficulties arising from the Gulf war, but also undermining national dignity and inflicting political harm on a country that has always been an element of stability and moderation in the region. Had the naval siege of the port of al-'Aqabah been the result of the Gulf war, not only Jordan-bound ships would have been searched to the exclusion of other countries in the region. No such arbitrary inspection is carried out in any of the ports of other states which have not attached great importance to the Iraq-related sanctions resolutions. Moreover, inspecting more than 1,700 ships bound for al-'Aqabah during the last few years without detecting any violation of the blockade or its causes should have caused an end to such a naval farce if the blockade of al-'Aqabah was really linked to the issue of the embargo imposed on Iraq. Accordingly, it has long been clear to us that those besieging the Port of al-'Aqabah are aiming at something else. They are trying to dictate to us policies and positions that neither agree with our national and pan-Arab considerations nor conform with our priorities and concepts of the developments of the current peace process in the Middle East. Hence, the position His Majesty King Husayn expressed to the ambassadors of the permanent member states of the Security Council was starkly clear in projecting the fact that this blockade and these harassments undermine the historic role Jordan has always played in its capacity as a principal element of moderation in a region that suffered and continues to suffer from successive waves of extremism. Given such a situation, Jordan, which counted much on quiet diplomacy to end the siege imposed on its only port, cannot and will not play its vital role in making peace before this totally unacceptable situation has been promptly addressed in a manner that respects the Jordanian will and refrains from doing anything that harms it.
