This, naturally, left surplus workers in Japan. Hitachi has transferred 750 workers from its Tokai plant (Ibaragi Prefecture) and its Haramachi plant (Fukushima Prefecture) to heavy electric machinery plants and other affiliates, and has cut its workforce by 1,000, including 250 by natural wastage. Hitachi plans to cut the remaining 3,000-strong workforce to 2,000. However, transferring staff is not easy. Heavy electric machinery plants have no surplus power to accept extra workers, and in each sector Hitachi has reached the limit of its ability to juggle its workers between the various sectors concerned. Moreover, even though it has cut 1,000 workers as planned, it is still overmanned. This month the Tokai Plant will enforce a compulsory temporary leave of two days. Despite plans by Hitachi to start producing personal fax machines and portable telephones, the prospects are not bright. And the strong yen is not helping. There are various kinds of goods which are not economical to produce even at the level of 110 yen to the dollar. A further shifting of the production base overseas will be necessary in the future. Meanwhile, heavy electric machinery plants and other affiliates can no longer afford to absorb surplus workers. Hitachi is suffering from this dilemma. Furthermore, overseas production forces consideration of measures to prevent deindustrialization within Japan as well as the problem of finding new places for overseas production. The greatest problem of all is the local procurement of parts, to say nothing of the problem of infrastructure and the education of workers. Shuzo Kawashima, director in charge of the promotion of overseas production at Fujitsu Ltd., said: "Overseas production does not pay unless the local procurement rate of parts reaches more than 50 percent." The local procurement rate for Hitachi's Malaysian plant has reached 70 percent, but the cylinders (rotating heads), which are the principal parts of video tape records, are imported from Japan. Managing Director Yoshiki Yagi said: "We are having a very hard time in Malaysia because the parts makers there want to raise prices. They are desperate because of the appreciation of the yen. Both the sellers and buyers of parts are cutting each other up with swords clashing. Shifting the production base overseas does not necessarily lead to an immediate reduction in costs." There is Nothing To Make in Japan Any More In the case of automobiles, which need about 30,000 parts, moving the production base overseas becomes even more difficult. Since the just-in-time system has taken root and replaced parts inventories, a shortage of even one part can stop the production lines. It means, therefore, that the transfer of plants is accompanied by a great shift involving parts makers. In order to establish a single production line, an investment of tens of billions of yen is necessary. In addition, the overseas transfer of the automobile industry, which very effectively absorbs employment, immediately leads to the problem of unemployment. Auto industry executives share the common feeling that "it is unwise for the automobile industry to trigger employment insecurity." However, the realities are harsh. President Yuichi Nakamura of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation says: "Appreciation against the dollar by just one yen wipes out a profit of 50 billion yen among the 11 automakers in Japan. We have already suffered a loss of one trillion yen since the beginning of this year due to the appreciation amounting to 20 yen." At least 110 yen to the dollar is needed to make the export of automobiles profitable. Dropping below the break-even point, it becomes difficult to continue production in Japan, but moving production overseas is not easy either. Japanese enterprises cannot follow the speed of the yen's appreciation, and every attempt they make has been forestalled. This is the dilemma Japanese enterprises are in when it comes to moving their production overseas. There is a divergence of seven yen between the current exchange rate and the break-even rate, the details of which will be stated later. In order to make up the difference, an immediate cut in costs must be made through the procurement of parts abroad or moving production overseas. Managing Director Hiroshni Kuwabara of Hitachi, Ltd. said positively: "So long as exporting enterprises procure or produce parts in Japan, they can cope with the appreciation of the yen only to the level of 120 yen to the dollar. If the exchange rate rises to 100 yen to the dollar, no amount of automation can compensate." According to a questionnaire conducted by the Economic Planning Agency in January 1993 among 620 companies "on the behavior of enterprises," the break-even rate for Japan's manufacturing industries is 124 yen to the dollar. Because of the sharp rise in the value of the yen, therefore, enterprises have been making frantic efforts through such measures as adding the appreciation of the yen to prices, risk hedging through forward exchange contracts, and rationalization. As a result, the general view is that the current break-even rate is about 115 yen to the dollar. Surveys conducted by the Kogyo Bank Ltd. and the Asahi Bank Ltd. [as published] show almost the same result. However, the actual exchange rate has already dropped below the 110 yen level; the current rate is about 108 yen. There is a difference of as much as seven yen, therefore, between the current exchange rate and the break-even rate. In the case of Toshiba, for example, if the currency rises in value against the dollar by just one yen it causes a loss of 4 billion yen. A rise of seven yen results in a loss of 28 billion yen. In short, a little over half of the expected recurring profit for 1993 has been lost. An executive of Alps Electric Co., Ltd., a medium-sized maker of audio-visual related parts, ventured: "Our company may no longer be able to produce in Japan parts which have a competitive edge." The situation is such that shifting the base of production overseas has become a matter of great urgency. "An Experiment" Begun by Toshiba in Dairen, China In July this year, Toshiba's Dairen plant began operations in Dairen, China. The plant has adopted some unique practices. Its production items, themselves, are a matter of interest. They are small motors, printing units for televisions, deflection corks for picture tubes, delay lines and others, which are, at a glance, an odd combination. That is not surprising, for the four items have been transferred from separate plants. Production at each plant was worth about several billion yen. However, profit margins began declining and the scale of each plant's production was such that it was too small to be shifted overseas. The answer, for the production technology promotion department of Toshiba's general staff, was the establishment of Toshiba's Dairen plant. Toshiba adopted a system under which applications for production at the production line of the Dairen plant are accepted from each of its business departments. Viewed as a whole, the idea in Toshiba is that if unprofitable items held by each business department are put together, that will produce enough profit to finance the capital investment necessary for shifting the base of production overseas. However, under the vertical system of organization, it does not pay to shift production of a small quantity of goods overseas. When that happens, measures against the appreciation of the yen are delayed, worsening the profitability of business. Director Tetsuya Yamamoto explains: "The Dairen plant is an experiment to speed up measures to protect ourselves against the appreciation of the yen." The plant site is nearly 120,000 square meters. There is enough space for two more buildings, and the Dairen plant is ready to accept applications for future use of the production line from each business department. The current work force of 6,000 local employees is expected to increase further. Meanwhile, for the past few years, Ricoh Co., Ltd. has been making an effort to develop digital copying machines (used not only as copying machines and faxes, but also as printers for personal computers) and color copying machines. Demand for these items has grown. At present 6,000 digital copying machines and 600 color copying machines are produced monthly. The number of color copying machines sold has reached about 20 percent of the sales figure for digital copying machines. In particular, demand for color copying machines has been greater than expected, and the Atsugi plant has had such a rush of demands it has increased production of the machines. Employees will have to work even on Sundays in December. Managing Director Haruo Kamiki of Ricoh Co., Ltd. says: "Over the next year production of digital and color copying machines will be further increased. Production of low speed, analog machines will be shifted to Shenzhen, China, and in proportion to that, the domestic production of digital and color copying machines will be increased. We are not worried about the deindustrialization of Ricoh itself." The development of original technology, which can keep itself out of a price competition, and the shifting of production to high value-added products based on that technology holds the key to avoiding deindustrialization. Aiwa Has Fully Pursued Shift To Overseas Production If a production shift to high value-added products is impossible, there is no other choice but to thoroughly shift the base of production to overseas. Aiwa is typical in that, despite the prolonged sluggish demand for audio-visuals and the strengthening of the yen, it has earned a recurring profit of 2.3 billion yen (the interim settlement for September 1993), twice the amount earned over the same period last year. Aiwa's overseas production volume is expected to reach 75 percent by March next year. This shows how advanced Aiwa has been in shifting its production base overseas, compared with Sony Corporation whose overseas production volume is 35 percent. At Aiwa's main plants in Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere, local procurement rates have reached more than 70 percent. Aiwa has established a research and development center in Singapore and has employed local designers. It has established a consistent system -- local designing, local procurement, and local production. It has been thorough in its approach. What prompted Aiwa's decision to shift production overseas was the previous recession caused by the strong yen. Aiwa suffered a business loss of 4.27 billion yen in December 1986 and became a nondividend-paying company for the first time in 14 years. It continued not to pay dividends until 1989. Aiwa, therefore, invited applications for voluntary retirement from 1,000 employees. Its 3,000 employees were reduced to 2,000, and its domestic plants were closed. The shifting of the production base overseas is always accompanied by such a sacrifice and pain. An executive of a certain precision machine maker spoke about the difficulty of making the decision to move production overseas. He said: "No manager thinks the current strong yen reflects the real strength of the economy. They think to themselves that a change in the political situation will immediately bring about a depreciation of the yen. They do not have the nerve, therefore, to shift their production overseas because it means dealing with the problem of employment." The Japanese enterprises are at a standstill, caught in a dilemma as to whether to shift their production overseas or not. How long will the tug-of-war between "employment" and "profit" last? Can they find a way out of the difficulty? The crucial moment has yet to come. Small and Medium Subcontractors Perplexed and Troubled by the Shift to Overseas Production "We want you to reduce the unit price of parts by 4-5 percent." Honda Motor Co., Ltd. conducts price negotiations with subcontracting parts makers twice a year. At the beginning of September this year, negotiations were conducted for the purchase of parts for the latter half of the year. At the negotiation table, the Honda side asked for a price cut of 4-5 percent. The parts makers who were sounded out on the matter immediately realized the seriousness of the situation. They had been expecting a request for a 1.5 percent price cut had it not been for the appreciation of the yen since the spring. They suffered a further blow. They was a hint that a request for a similar cut would be made at the next round unless the current economic environment changed. Such developments are not confined to the automobile industry. A maker of office automation products says: "From now on, we are going to ask Japanese parts makers to lower the cost of their parts to the cost of parts made in Southeast Asian countries." As can be seen, the requests from parts buyers are becoming tougher and tougher. Unit prices have been lowered and sales volume has been cut. Sub-contractors and parts makers are being hit from both sides. Research Section Chief Takenori Takagi of the Shoko Chukin Bank says: "To small and medium enterprises, the ratio of break-even point to sales is about 92 percent on average. A cut of just several percentage points in sales is a great blow. The small and medium enterprises are in a very serious situation." Parts Buyers Clamor for Price Cuts An overseas director of a electronic materials maker said resignedly: "Although the exchange rate has moved by only 15 percent, sales prices have dropped by 20 percent. Furthermore, the clients are asking for further price reductions. We have really reached the limit of our resources." An electronic parts maker for household electric appliances said: "I think that the parts buyers now look for low-priced parts to the exclusion of quality. It seems that they intend to patiently train local makers. But what are we going to do, Japanese makers who have staked our lives and fortunes on the quality of our parts?" The fortunes of Japanese parts makers will dwindle to nothing if they do not act. Small and medium subcontractors will face the decision of whether to stay within Japan or shift their production base overseas. Managing Director Haruo Kamimoto of Ricoh said: "When the decision to shift production overseas is made, some parts suppliers come forward, saying, `We will go with you.' When we shifted production to Britain, four to five parts makers asked to come with us; when we shifted production to Shenzhen, China, about 10 makers applied to us." For example, several big businesses, such as Ricoh, Toshiba, Sharp and Seiko Epson have shifted production to Shenzhen, China. They seem to welcome the fact that Japanese subcontractors which supply high quality parts want to follow them to China. However, one of the subcontractors, a chemical materials maker said: " Household electrical appliance makers and office automation product makers can easily shift production overseas, but it is not so easy for the equipment industry like ours to make the move. We are unable to make any overseas investment now." An electronic parts maker said: "If a big firm moves production abroad, we, a smaller business, would like to follow it, but we are uncertain whether we can produce parts overseas which are comparable in quality to those made in Japan. If we produce inferior goods, our trustworthiness will be questioned and our transactions within Japan will be canceled." Other smaller businesses also hesitate to shift their production base overseas. We can see another dilemma here. Local Plants Often Attract Unexpected Problems Even when Japanese enterprises have successfully shifted production overseas, they encounter unexpected troubles. In the case of one rubber goods maker, local workers falsely reported the number of inferior goods found in a day. According to the report, there were five pieces of inferior goods in every 1,000 produced. Actually, the figure was closer to 100, and furthermore, it was found they had been discarded in a rubbish bin. It is said that unless Japanese resident representatives keep a sharp watch on local workers, there is no knowing what may happen. A chemical materials plant which shifted production to Indonesia suffered a big operating loss for similar reasons. It seems "the idea of the yield rate is not acceptable to local workers." At the start of production, local workers used the wrong kind of raw material or mixed the material incorrectly. This mistake has happened since, causing the loss of a whole day's production on one occasion. This is a tragedy caused by the absence of know-how among local producers. Japan's Subcontracting Structure Shaken by the Shift to Overseas Production Alps Electric Co., Ltd., an audiovisual goods part maker which had enthusiastically promoted shifting production overseas, decided, in January, to take in only half of the orders placed with its subcontractors, because its production volume had dropped. It is estimated that as a result, the 20,000 workers at the subcontractors' factories will be reduced by half. Furthermore, in August this year Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd. discontinued the consignment production of CD (compact disc) radio-cassettes entrusted to Sanritsu Electric Co., Ltd., an affiliate in which Sanyo had invested 20 percent. Since the greater part of Sanritsu's sales come from Sanyo, the closure of Sanritsu is inevitable. A Sanyo spokesman said peevishly: "The closure of the Sanritsu plant is due to internal strife. We did not discontinue the consignment production arbitrarily." However, you can be certain that "the staged reduction of consignment production" through the shift in production of CD radio-cassettes to Singapore or Malaysia was the direct and indirect cause of the closure of Sanritsu. As industries develop more and more, it is inevitable that mature industries will shift their production overseas. This is the economic mechanism. Naturally, subcontractors and parts makers which lack competitiveness will be forced to restructure. More and more small and medium firms will be forced to move to areas where wages are cheaper. Research Director Teruyasu Murakami of Nomura Research Institute said: "As far as Greater China (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan) is concerned, we may think that a mechanism is almost complete by which it will absorb every industry." The situation is such that some things have become inevitable. The chairman of an electronic equipment maker (whose stocks are partially listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange) which, since last year, has begun shifting its operation to China said: "In truth, we are thinking of reducing the number of outside orders to about two thirds. We do not want to part with highly motivated enterprises or enterprises with technical know-how. But we want to leave behind companies which lack initiative." As we have seen in the cases of Alps Electric Co., Ltd. and Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., smaller businesses and subcontractors with a weak management foundation will be hit hard, and their numbers are sure to grow. The ominous increase in bankruptcies among small and medium firms may be the prelude to that.
