That is the barest possible summary of the consequences of the commercialization program of state enterprises that has been adopted by the government. The most important thing in this is, however, the fact that there has been sketched out therein an intended model for the shape of the Polish economy. [Kaczmarek] The commercialization program is not, certainly, a conservation of the present arrangement. It is to be a program that will change the Polish economy. The commercialization program is, really, to consist of a number of drafts, of successive programs. The first will be based upon us wishing to transform the best, good, and large enterprises into the modern formula of companies with capital. Commercialization will reduce to the fact they will function upon the basis of the principles of the Commercial Code. Later they will be subject, successively, to privatization. The second program will allow us to separate out from the group of 5,300 state enterprises still extant, the enterprises that are the weakest. This is served by a new formula proposed in the Law on State Enterprise, which will allow for a very, to put it rather unpleasantly, aggressive repair of these enterprises through the application of bank reconciliation procedures, agreed procedures, well, unfortunately bankruptcy procedures also, or else special programs prepared at the ministry, such as the stabilization-privatization-restructuring program. Everything that will serve to repair the enterprises. The third program associated with commercialization will be a program--for we then have the small- and medium-sized enterprises still left over, and we intend to quickly and efficiently sell those enterprises [as heard]. The fourth component, this is a program that I will call the improvement in the condition of the state public finances and so the exploitation of state enterprises, thus earlier formed for the purposes of the creation of pension funds, a health insurance fund. Then this--when one looks at commercialization in such a context--can be seen that quite simply this is a quite considerable operation that is to run its course until the end of next year, and is later then still to fulfill one fundamental function. [Announcer] The point at hand is that the commercialization program of state enterprises will be fulfilled through the, by many long expected, Law on the State Treasury. [Kaczmarek] That which we have proposed and which we passed to the prime minister on Tuesday is the law on the management of the state treasury assets. For this purpose we will create special capital agencies. This will constitute a kind of identification of the owner, which will allow us to depart from the sectoral model of economy management, and for the ministry to fulfill regulative and administrative functions, but not ownership functions. The commercialization program is, in a word, I would say, this clearing of the ground for realistic, further ownership transformations, among which I would include privatization, restructuring, and the various paths to privatization, because we wish to maintain these different privatization paths. Quite simply, we must make up for a certain amount of lost time. [Announcer] The transformation of state enterprises into single entity state treasury companies functioning on the basis of the Commercial Code must undoubtedly place into question the model of management of these enterprises hitherto. [Kaczmarek] There are two factors here. Well, by the very nature of things the law that speaks of the principles of management of the finances of state enterprises falls by the wayside. We are moving away from the philosophy of the popiwek [the law on taxation of over the norm increases in remuneration], we are moving away from the philosophy of the compulsory dividend that was calculated upon the basis of book balance sheets, in favor of the solutions that are in force in the Commercial Code. We are changing the method of management of enterprises in favor of a stronger position for the manager, through the company board, and also through the body supervising the functioning of this company in the name of the State Treasury--this is the Supervisory Board. Well, we will as I say through the Law on the State Treasury seek to identify the owner in the form of the capital agencies. We are moving away from this sectoral model of the economy, and so I affirm that from the viewpoint of the enterprise, this will be an entity that will have precisely the opportunity to act on commercial principles, on the basis of the Commercial Code principles. This is very important from the viewpoint of the identification of such an enterprise by a possible investor from outside. For, please believe me, he comes to Poland, and I have met him several times [laughs], and says that he cannot understand institutions such as the state enterprise on the basis of the laws of 1981. If there are such people who say that somewhere in the West there are state firms--then they have precisely the form of capital-based companies, and so they are based upon the principles of the Commercial Code [as heard]. We should be moving in that direction. [Announcer] The adoption of the commercialization program of state enterprises will cause the minister for ownership transformations to gain in significance. Is this the end of the recently continuing dispute between the heads of the economic ministries over the form of privatization? [Kaczmarek] Conflicts do not in fact exist. They are disputes of a certain kind. On the other hand, but, I think that they are disputes that are capable of being overcome. I would not wish to argue at all over the so-called rights of the owner, but rather over the concept for restructuring, over the programs for these firms. On the other hand, this program has one more characteristic that is worth mentioning here. It is precisely moving away from what the present coalition is often accused of at the moment, that it has a tendency toward the centralization of power. This program assumes in its philosophy precisely a decentralization of power, the lowering of these agencies to the level of the Polish macro-regions. Thus, the non-engagement of the central administrative offices in the administration of enterprises. Above all, they will be regional structures.
