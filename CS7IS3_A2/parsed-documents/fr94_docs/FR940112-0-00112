Comment Suggestions Beyond Commission's Authority Under FPLA Two comments suggested that the Commission amend the regulations issued under the FPLA in ways that are beyond the Commission's authority and that would conflict with the 1992 metric amendments to the FPLA. Specifically, NCWM suggested that packages that are ``rational'' metric sizes, e.g., 250 mL, 500 mL, 1,2,3, and 4 liter, not be required to have inch/pound content declarations; 8 and Mr. Berke questioned the value of having metric equivalents on consumer packages and objected to the mandatory use of metric labeling. 9 8 NCWM, 19, 5. 9 Berk, 1, 1&hyph;2. As discussed above, 10 the 1992 amendments to section 4(a)(2) of the FPLA provide that the net quantity of contents shall be stated ``using the most appropriate units of both the customary inch/pound system *␣*␣*␣ and, *␣*␣*␣ the SI metric system'' ( emphasis supplied ). Thus, Congress has required by statute that both customary inch/pound and SI metric units are to be used for content disclosure. The Commission cannot issue regulations that contravene the statutory requirement. 10 Section II 3 C, supra . III.
