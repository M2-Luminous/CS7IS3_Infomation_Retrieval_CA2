Chief of the Far East Civil Aviation Department Technical Service Gennadiy Kobets told INTERFAX that the flight personnel of the Khabarovsk Single Aviation Unit would not participate in the strike on May 18. He suggested that their decision was due to the telegram received from the Russian Air Transport Department which considered the strike illegal. Moreover, the telegram stated that the demands put forward by the strike committee would be discussed by the Russian Labor Ministry on May 19. The participation of flight personnel of Kamchatka in the general strike is still under question. Kamchatavia Enterprise General Director Nikolay Nedviga told INTERFAX that they were following closely the response from Moscow and were maintaining contacts with the aviation department. A telegram was received stating that an agreement had been achieved on practically all aviators' demands. However, the issue on pensions, it pointed out, must be decided by the legislative bodies. Strikers have insisted on implementation of all their demands. This means that the strike is likely to take place and Kamchatka air crews will participate in it.
