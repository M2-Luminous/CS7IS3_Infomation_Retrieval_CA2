To some lawmakers on capitol hill, this is still true. The treaty is the final pact of the Uruguay Round talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Signed on April 15, it will create the World Trade Organization (WTO), a global trading system supposedly based on sound principles. Within the WTO, Washington will not enjoy veto power. With only one of 117 votes, some lawmakers are worried that the country will be out-voted by third world countries, its sovereignty reduced, and its laws undermined. This is the key argument of wto opponents in congress, who have stepped up their opposition, saying that the Uruguay Round agreement should not be allowed to sail through congress like a ship passing in the night. "I'm not worried about sovereignty. I'm worried about losing it," said Jesse Helms (D-NC), member of the senate foreign relations committee. "The United States gets one vote, but it will pay 20 percent of the budget for it." The Clinton administration, which stresses that Washington will be the prime beneficiary of a better world trade system under WTO, says people like helms should listen carefully to thoughtful trade experts. "Our sovereignty is enhanced because a substantially improved dispute-settlement system will permit us to enforce rights more effectively while at the same time preserving our own trade laws," Rufus Yerxa, deputy U.S. trade representative, told a senate hearing today. Lawmakers who oppose the WTO often compares it with the United Nations, where Washington enjoys the right of veto. They are worried that if the U.S. loses a case in the WTO, it will either change its laws to pay compensation or face trade retaliation from abroad. "We are transferring substantial power to an international body that can coerce the United States to change our behavior," argued House Representative Newt Gingrich (R-GA). The U.S. has won many GATT cases on important issues such as Japan's barriers to imports of agricultural goods, South Korea's beef quotas, the European Community's oil fee subsidies and Norway's procurement practices. According to officials here, a WTO dispute-settlement panel recommendation does not automatically change U.S. law. If the U.S. loses a case, it is the sovereign right of the U.S. Congress to decide what to do with the prevailing decision. Some congressmen don't believe this. "This is a plethora of red tape that means nothing," Senator Helms said. "It's not going to happen." "We are still going to have problems with countries under this agreement; I don't think there should be any illusions about that," Rufus Yerxa admitted at today's hearing. "This is the best we can do."
