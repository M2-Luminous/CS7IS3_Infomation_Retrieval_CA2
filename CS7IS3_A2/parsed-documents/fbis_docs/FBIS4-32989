The PND came about after the Supreme Electoral Council issued a ruling in favor of the National Council of Political Parties' decision to recognize Adolfo Jarquin as the leader of the Social Democratic Party [PSD], thereby ratifying the ousting of Cesar and Potoy. Now there are 25 political parties in the nation. Cesar said that he, as well as a group of politicians who had belonged to other parties, were forced to create one more party given the political circumstances. "We had no other choice," he said. The PND defined itself as center-right although its leaders did not rule out that persons of social-democratic ideologies could join. Former PSD president Guillermo Potoy described this party's past role during its 15 years of existence while he recalled that it never surrendered to Sandinist plans in the past decade. He added that for some years now an interest was perceived for the PSD to change its strategy of struggle and to assume an attitude of support and favor toward the current government. "This decision was strengthened with the help of government officials -- PSD members -- who for personal gain have dragged us to the current circumstances," Potoy noted. Meanwhile, Sanchez Sancho said he was participating in the PND to contribute to the finding of political stability in the country. He said that after having actively participated in the left, he is convinced that this is not the ideological alternative for solving Nicaragua's problems. Sanchez Sancho said: "The left talks about progress and it generates backwardness. It talks about rivers of milk and honey that are of blood."
