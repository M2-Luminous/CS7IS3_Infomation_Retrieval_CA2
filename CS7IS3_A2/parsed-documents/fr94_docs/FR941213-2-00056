FR941213-2-00056 FR941213-2-00039 Appendix Course 204A, Machinery and Machine Guarding Standards 1. Course description. The course provides the student with an overview of various types of common machinery and related safety standards. The course provides guidance in recognizing hazards such as those created by points of operation, ingoing nip points, rotating parts, and flying chips or sparks, and provides some options to achieve abatement. A field trip is provided to enhance students' knowledge of machine guarding standards. The OSHA Training Institute awards 2.5 CEU's for this course. 2. Course objectives. Students completing this course should be able to: a. Identify various machines and their functions; b. Identify common machinery hazards; c. Recommend selected abatement methods; and d. Select the appropriate OSHA standard that applies to a hazard. 3. Course topics: a. Introduction, pretest and pretest review, posttest and posttest review_2 hours. b. Hazards and standards workshop and review_2 hours. In this workshop, written hazard conditions are researched, and standards are reviewed and referenced. Oral review also incorporates policy relating to specific conditions. c. Inspection field trip to machine shop operations and inspection writeup_6 hours. The class is taken to facilities with extensive and varied metalworking and woodworking operations following the discussions of machinery, terminology, and 29 CFR 1910.211&hyph;1910.219. It exposes the students to operations including lathes, mills, boring machines, screw machines, woodworking machines, mechanical power presses, and power transmission apparatus. Students are given an opportunity to apply hazard recognition concepts on a site inspection at an operating facility with a variety of machine operations. They evaluate and document any machinery and machine guarding hazards, then return to the classroom to research the standards for citation references. They present an oral report on their findings. d. Review of 29 CFR part 1910, subpart O, machinery and machine guarding concepts_1 hour. e. Review of 29 CFR 1910.211 and 29 CFR 1910.312, definitions, guarding and devices, general requirements_2 hours. f. 29 CFR subpart J, 1910.147, control of hazardous energy sources (lockout/tagout), and 29 CFR subpart S, 1910.332&hyph;1910.335, electrical safety-related work practices_2 hours. g. 29 CFR subpart P, 1910.242&hyph;1910.244, portable powered tools_1 hour. h. 29 CFR 1910.212 and section 5(a)(1) of the OSH Act, robotic safeguarding_1 hour. i. 29 CFR 1910.213, woodworking machinery requirements_2 hours. j. 29 CFR 1910.215, abrasive wheel machinery_1 hour. k. 29 CFR 1910.216, mills and calenders_1 hour. l. 29 CFR 1910.217, mechanical power presses_2 hours. m. 29 CFR 1910.218, forging machines_1 hour. n. 29 CFR 1910.219, power transmission apparatus_1 hour. Course 500, Basic Instructor Course in Occupational Safety and Health Standards for the Construction Industry 1. Course description. The course is designed for students in the private sector who are interested in teaching the 10- and 30-hour construction safety and health outreach program to their employees and other interested groups. Special emphasis is placed upon those topics that are required in the 10- and 30-hour programs as well as on those that are the most hazardous, using OSHA standards as a guide. Course participants are briefed on effective instructional approaches and the effective use of visual aids and handouts. This course allows the student to conduct both a 10-hour and a 30-hour construction safety and health course and to issue OSHA cards to participants certifying course completion. The OSHA Training Institute awards 2.5 CEU's for this course. 2. Course objectives. Students completing this course should be able to: a. Define construction terms found in OSHA standards; b. Present effective safety and health training programs in accordance with OSHA construction standards, regulations, and guidelines; c. Identify hazards and determine appropriate standards; d. Prepare reports citing the conditions found; and e. Identify methods to abate hazards. 3. Course topics: a. Introduction, pretest and pretest review, overview of the OSH Act and OSHA, introduction to OSHA standards, posttest and posttest review_4 hours. b. Safety programs, inspections, targeting and penalties_1 hour. c. Training techniques_2 hours. d. 29 CFR part 1904, recordkeeping_1 hour. e. 29 CFR part 1926, subpart D, hazard communication_1 hour. f. 29 CFR part 1926, subpart E, health hazards in construction and personal protective equipment_3 hours.
