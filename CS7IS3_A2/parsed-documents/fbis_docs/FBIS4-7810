That accusation seems to be childish, to say the least, considering that Major General Gheorghe Diaconescu worked in the field of counterespionage for decades and he was one of the fundamental members of the famous anti-KGB unit titled UM 0110. Owing to the lack of openness of the SRI, we have to rely on other information to complete the picture of Major General Gheorghe Diaconescu's dismissal from his office as head of the SRI Counterespionage Division. According to such information, while investigating a number of cases in which foreign citizens were involved -- a task that was among his duties -- Major General Gheorghe Diaconescu stumbled across certain firms in which persons belonging to the SRI leadership, such as Major General Virgil Magureanu, the SRI director, and Major General Victor Marcu, the deputy SRI director, were also involved. The famous filing box that was sealed [following Diaconescu's dismissal] by Major General Popa Ulpiu Cherecheanu, deputy general prosecutor, contains -- or contained -- files containing operative information, photographs, and audio and video cassettes proving the involvement of others, apart from the aforementioned persons in arms trafficking and other, not too clean deals. It is worth mentioning that the profit obtained from such deals is not to be found on SRI bank accounts, but rather on those of certain persons holding important state offices. Details later.
