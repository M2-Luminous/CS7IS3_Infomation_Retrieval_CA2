Tengiz Kitovani Has Returned To Georgia."] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Kitovani's Return From His Travels During the closed session [of Parliament on 26 April], the recent return from Moscow of former Defense Minister Tengiz Kitovani was the focus of journalists' attention. Kitovani looked extremely self-confident and enthusiastically answered journalists' questions. The former minister views the new [defense] minister [General Vardiko Nadibaidze] with extreme skepticism. Kitovani believes that Vardiko Nadibaidze will be unable to live up to people's hopes. In addition to this, many problems are arising in the Army that is unaccustomed to Nadibaidze's style of work. Tengiz Kitovani gave a similarly negative assessment of the personality of [former minister] Murman Omanidze. "How can I have a good opinion of Omanidze who has stolen so many millions of dollars," said Kitovani. Kitovani pointed out that Omanidze's rapprochement with the Union of Traditionalists was highly doubtful given that he [Kitovani] was the founder of the union along with [former Supreme Council Chairman] Akaki Asatiani. Regarding Omanidze's intention to become a parliamentary deputy for Rustavi [major industrial town southeast of Tbilisi], Kitovani stated: "This will be possible only if he buys up the whole of Rustavi." It is interesting to note that [former Deputy Interior Minister] Davit Zeikidze, who incurred the wrath of parliament, is also planning to take part in the elections in Rustavi. Kitovani characterized the terrorist acts that have been taking place in Georgia as state terror. He touched upon his trip to Russia and pointed out that he had visited certain circles there. "We should view the situation in Georgia from there," stated the former minister. According to him, people in Russia have a very bad view of Georgia and so long as Shevardnadze remains in power, the situation will not change. Kitovani explained this by saying that Shevardnadze had nothing to be proud of when he left Russia and, in general, according to Kitovani, if Shevardnadze resigns in time, the situation will be saved. Kitovani explained Shevardnadze's return to Georgia in the following way: "We brought him here so that people could really see the situation that would take shape. Otherwise, they would have constantly been pinning their hopes on Shevardnadze alone." Tengiz Kitovani cannot see any difference between democratic and reactionary Russia as everyone wants to rule and conduct his own policies. In his opinion, we will be unable to move out of the sphere of Russian influence. This was already decided in Malta. "We had a chance to leave then. If we had been more clever, we would have used it," said Kitovani. "However, now it is necessary to establish mutual understanding with those who are interested in the Caucasus." Kitovani mentioned the bad actions of our neighbors [Russia] and reminded journalists of what battalions had fought in Abkhazia. Regarding his meeting with Zhirinovskiy, Kitovani explained Volfovich's real intentions. He views Abkhazia as an integral part of Russia. As for Abkhazia, Tengiz Kitovani stated that it was lost and that there was little chance of getting it back. "Shevardnadze was the principal reason for our losing Abkhazia," said Kitovani and added that he was guilty of many crimes. He mentioned Shevardnadze's visit to Kazakhstan and China as being one of the reasons for the loss of Abkhazia. In response to REZONANSI's question as to what he thought about the current inspection of the Ministry of Defense, he said that he had nothing to fear and, if there had been something, the whole world would have known about it by now. Finally, Kitovani pointed out that Georgia should be a parliamentary republic and that one-man management should be abolished as this, in Kitovani's view, will lead us to dictatorship.
