They also control a strategic point on Mount Straza near Kriva Palanka, including 50 additional meters of territory, and therefore there is all together 300 meters of territory under their control. Macedonian Army patrols are being turned away from this area with the following words: "Do not approach -- this is Serbia." Members of the U.S. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] also took up their positions yesterday. However, it is evident that the Serbian Army does not have any intention of withdrawing. For the chief of the Yugoslav Army General Staff, Momcilo Perisic, the events on the Macedonian-Serbian border are nothing but a media lie. Moreover, Perisic stated that Macedonia accepted the UN forces, within which the Americans are the most numerous, not for the sake of protecting the Macedonian people, but for the sake of forming their own base.
