In an unusually frank interview, Merkel admitted that in the four years since reunification, her party, the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], had made a number of mistakes, particularly in the east, which threatened to damage its chances seriously in the l9 elections it faces this year. "A headwind is blowing hard into our faces," she said, in a reference to the political climate in eastern Germany. "My biggest fear is that voters may find the experience of democracy so repugnant that they will stay away from the polls." Merkel, an east German MP who is also minister for women and youth affairs in the Federal Government in Bonn, was speaking in the run-up to the CDU conference in Hamburg, at which strategy for Germany's election marathon will be decided. There is disillusionment with all parties in eastern Germany, but opinion polls have shown that Kohl's party could not expect to win more than 30 percent of votes in the region if a general election were held now. Merkel blamed the drop in the CDU's popularity in the east on the initial "very high" expectations over German reunification. But the east Germans were not necessarily justified, she said, in thinking that they had been given a false promise by Kohl when he assured them in a pre-l990 election speech that their region would soon be a "blossoming landscape." Merkel said: "We have made the landscape blossom as much as possible in the amount of time available. But the process is taking longer than anyone expected. There is disappointment in many areas. It is going to be a much more difficult election than before." She admitted that the government had made a mistake by failing to stress that reunification would also bring widespread unemployment to eastern Germany, together with a western system of bureaucracy which failed fully to recognise east German qualifications. Unemployment and insecurity about the future are considered to be among the main reasons for the decline in the CDU's popularity. Last week unemployment in Germany as a whole reached a postwar record of more than four million, and 17 percent of eastern Germany's workforce are without jobs. Most analysts maintain that if the CDU loses large numbers of eastern votes in Germany's October general election it will be ousted from power in Bonn or forced into a coalition with the opposition Social Democrats. Merkel also conceded that her party had failed to stress the sacrifices of reunification early enough in western Germany, which obliged voters to cut back their high living standards. "One of the main problems is that neither the Chancellor nor any economic institute realised how bad a state the east German economy was in at the time of reunification," she said. "But what was the alternative: should we have said no to reunification?" Merkel insisted that the CDU would not waver from its pro-Maastricht course and a commitment to widening EU membership eastwards -- despite opinion poll showing that around 72 percent of the German electorate was opposed to the Maastricht Treaty's provisions. However, she conceded that part of the blame for the lack of enthusiasm for Europe lay in Bonn's failure to conduct an open debate, Danish style, on the issue. She indicated that her party had been hit badly by the public controversy last year over Steffen Heitmann, the Saxon justice minister and the CDU's initial choice of candidate for the German presidency. Heitmann was forced out of the running because of criticism about his views on women, the Holocaust, and Europe. But there is to be no let-up, she hinted, in the CDU's efforts to discredit Johannes Rau, the opposition SPD's presidential candidate, by insinuating that he had been supported by East Germany's communist regime. Rau is the most popular choice among many Germans to replace Richard von Weizsacker as president in elections this May. He has been accused by the CDU of wanting to shut down a west German centre monitoring human rights abuses in the former East Germany, in return for communist support. Merkel underlined that the CDU had no special recipe designed to win votes: "We can only say what we have done and how we intend to carry on. I remain optimistic. If people don't accept that they can vote for someone else."
