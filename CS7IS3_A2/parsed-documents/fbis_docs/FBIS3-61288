And then it turned out that this interview with the mayor of the capital came about just in time probably for our happy holiday, to a holiday of hopes and expectations of better days.... [Pankov] As we sum up the results of the passing year in this pre-New Year interview, we cannot help but touch upon one of the most influential events of recent days--the elections. How do you assess the results of the elections to the State Duma: as a defeat of democratic forces, as a recoil from the reforms that are being conducted, or is everything proceeding normally? [Luzhkov] There is no simple answer. Indeed, a number of parties with a centrist and democratic orientation did not receive that number of votes that they were counting on. Especially Russia's Choice. And it is necessary to talk about the defeat of deputies of a democratic bent. But Zhirinovskiy and his party unexpectedly received very heavy support. Can this be called a victory? Yes, this is a victory in the elections. What does it indicate? First of all, the fact that the people are dissatisfied with shock methods of reform, inflation, impoverishment, Gaydar's antisocial policy, and the weak policy in this direction of Chernomyrdin's government. But the conclusions should be businesslike, and not like Yaroslavna's complaining lament. I think that Chernomyrdin's government can still be trusted, but it is necessary fundamentally to change the team. To make not a shock policy, but to move toward stabilization. To abandon the course toward bad privatization, which will lead to a squandering of the national wealth. And then the people will vote for democracy. [Pankov] As the mayor, what are you troubled by most of all, and with what kind of package of urgent questions do you intend to submit to the city duma? [Luzhkov] I would like to find out the opinion of the duma and develop joint actions on questions of property in Moscow, and its redistribution between the capital and Russia. We are conducting a difficult and exhausting campaign for the right to own and dispose of city property. In the course of the last two years, numerous efforts were undertaken to take property away from the city. The Government of the Russian Federation proceeded on the basis of one of its incorrect and insufficiently considered ideas that everything located on the territory of the Russian Federation is the property of Russia. Policy in the sphere of privatization is still one of the most important questions for the duma. I have already repeatedly expressed my point of view: That which is being done in Russia today in the privatization of property is a violation of an owner's rights. There is no possibility here for compromise, and for some kind of polishing corrections. We do not agree with the basic principles in the evaluation of property, for the reason that the capital is being put in a position without rights. The year 1917 is being repeated, only the other way around. At that time, property was taken away from the private owner and made general state property, but now a real property owner has appeared--this is the city residents and those organs that represent the population, but Goskomimushchestvo [the State Committee for the Administration of State Property] says: You have no right to determine whether to privatize or not, it is incumbent upon you--and that is all. This is not only my point of view, but that of the whole government of Moscow as well. And if the city duma supports us, then I will be satisfied. It is necessary for the duma to determine its own privatization policy in Moscow. The normative base associated with the residence permit must also be changed. We resolutely rejected the law that canceled the residence permit in Moscow. And Muscovites supported us in this. Although it would seem that now it is better for everyone to look like a democrat, but we understand that nothing good will come of it if we do not start to coordinate principles with the realities of life. [Pankov] Do you want to use the city duma in opposition to the current staff of the Russian Government? [Luzhkov] The city duma is 35 specialists of a rather high potential (it is just that maybe not everyone understands the city economy well, but there are those who do). And it must independently determine its attitude toward one or another problem of interaction of the state structures of Moscow and Russia. I do not intend to impose my own point of view or, what is more, to use the city duma to resolve these questions. I am convinced that it will have its own position. Now, your question already implies a certain confrontation between the governments of Moscow and Russia. This is not so. I repeat: The Government of Russia, especially after the arrival of Chernomyrdin, is doing quite a lot to resolve Moscow's problems. But every period requires its own resolutions. [Pankov] In his postelection speech, Boris Yeltsin declared that Gaydar would remain in the government, and this means that the adopted policy on reform remains. Indeed, Chubays, "the father of Russian privatization," is also one of the leaders of Russia's Choice, and this bloc has a majority in the city duma. Will it not happen that.... [Luzhkov] That does not bother me. Yes, Russia's Choice can conduct its own political line in the duma. But I am convinced that the deputies who are elected from various blocs must conduct a policy to improve the life of Muscovites, and they must make correct administrative, public, and social decisions. And then it will make sense. But if we transform the duma into a political discussion club, then we will repeat the principal error of the Mossovet [Moscow Soviet of People's Deputies], which occupied itself with Karabakh, the Dniester region, Abkhazia, Sevastopol, and the Black Sea Fleet, but almost did not work on questions of the life of the city. [Pankov] It turns out that the mayor's office prepared the statute on the duma elections, that the mayor's office financed the elections, and that it organized and conducted them. Now the executive authority is readying a building and arranging maintenance; it has established salaries, assigned motor vehicles, and developed regulations. And the reception was also at the expense of the mayor's office. Well, will this kind of an initial emergence of the city duma, seemingly from the recesses of executive power, not have the effect that the deputies will consider themselves beholden to you during a review of your documents? [Luzhkov] I am confident that it will not. You say that we conducted the elections, but I would put it this way: We were guaranteeing an administrative basis for the conduct of the elections. But who else was supposed to do this? And note: The mayor's office and the government of Moscow did not take part in one or another candidacy for the city duma. We made an announcement about our depoliticized position in this area, and we conducted ourselves cleanly, without interfering in the process of the elections. Now the duma is starting to work, and it will make decisions by itself. As for the questions that we proposed that the duma consider--it does not have to accept them. Everything depends on the objectives that the deputy corps sets for itself. But we are not imposing them--let the deputies decide for themselves. We are not at all striving to have a weak duma. The creation has begun of an organ of authority that is absolutely independent, with its own budget and with its own procedure for putting its policy into effect. [Pankov] How do you intend to build your relations with the duma organizationally? [Luzhkov] I want there to be regular meetings (once in two or three months) of the deputies with the government of Moscow to consider the general situation in the city, or individual problems. So that members of the government and the mayor should participate in the work of the duma as competent representatives of the executive authority. So that each member of the government should set aside a day to meet with deputies. So that workers of the executive authority should provide any information, reference, analytical materials requested by deputies.... [Pankov] One more year is coming to an end. Was it easier or more difficult for you as the mayor than last year? [Luzhkov] There are no easy years now. Each is difficult in its own way. The tension is colossal.... [Pankov] But are you satisfied with the results of the year? [Luzhkov] This is what I am not satisfied with. It was expected that 1993 would become the year of stabilization. But stabilization did not come about in industry (especially defense industry), science, the VUZ (higher educational institution) system, health services, and public education. We hope that we will achieve this in 1994. I am generally satisfied with respect to the city administration. The promises that we made to Muscovites have been fulfilled. We promised to introduce 3 million square meters of housing, and we did. One million square meters of housing is for those on the waiting list, and 700,000 is being sold at auctions. The rest will go at normal prices to enterprises. The construction complex has been maintained and even strengthened, and it is planned next year to expand work on the development of the municipal system. Everything will depend on financing. The tension with foodstuffs remains, but nonetheless, it is not that acute. There are no more tobacco and other riots. But the calm here is deceiving. The Russian Government planned to take dangerous measures. For example, to increase customs duties for imported foodstuffs by 30 percent. This is being done supposedly to support domestic producers. But our agrarians reacted instantly: They raised their prices by the same 30 percent. There was a favorable extension of credit to Moscow for purchases of foodstuffs. It, incidentally, did not resolve the task of maintaining moderate prices in the city (Moscow is in fifth place in the level of prices and yields only to several northern cities). However, Moscow was deprived of favorable credits in September, and this will make the situation worse. Given all of the expenses and failures (in the work of yardmen, for example), the city is provided with electric power and heat, especially after the introduction of the Northern TETs [thermal electric power station], work on the repair of roads has improved (in three years the volume increased by a factor of more than four!).... As never before, a lot was done to strengthen the material-technical base of the law enforcement organs. Now it is only necessary to require the appropriate efficiency from them. One of the most dangerous questions for us is rent. It is necessary to resolve it to support a balance of financial resources. It is an unpleasant question. But it is necessary to act more quickly.... [Pankov] The year was also difficult for you personally: You were ill, it seems seriously.... Do you not regret that you are in the post of mayor as before? [Luzhkov] I do not regret it. However, I have already said that I am not clinging to this position, but I value the work. [Pankov] But would you not like to transfer to the Government of Russia? [Luzhkov] Categorically not! I will work here as long as the Muscovites put up with me. It is better to do something useful in Moscow than to fail in Russia. [Pankov] But if you are not elected mayor the next time, where will you go? [Luzhkov] I will become a normal Muscovite, but I will work in the same sphere that I have worked in all of my life. I will continue to work on the introduction of new equipment. [Pankov] The supposition has already been heard that you might become a candidate for president of Russia. How do you react to this idea? [Luzhkov] Absolutely indifferently. And I emphasize: When I talk about the need to renew the Government of Russia, I do not have my own candidacy in mind. I do not want to go anywhere for a promotion. I feel that I am needed in Moscow. Something positive has begun to develop here. And I absolutely do not have elements of unhealthy ambition. Well, everyone should have a sense of personal dignity: A desire to work in such a way that you are spoken of well. Therefore, I did not run for the State Duma or the Federation Council. I am absolutely not interested in this; I have my own addiction--Moscow. [Pankov] But if Zhirinovskiy becomes president in the next election? This will have an immediate effect on Moscow affairs. Who will stop Zhirinovskiy? [Luzhkov] If things will happen normally in each city, in each oblast, and in each republic, then Zhirinovskiy will burst like a soap bubble. And so it is necessary to work, to make people richer, and to make Russians more worthy from the standpoint of their position in the world. Then there will be no place for any kind of Zhirinovskiys here. And there will be no need for a superman to defeat the dragon. [Pankov] What are your wishes for Muscovites for the New Year? It will be the Year of the Dog. What, in your opinion, does this mean--a dog's loyalty or.... a dog's life? [Luzhkov] The Year of the Snake, the Year of the Monkey, the Year of the Dog.... Why can we not live according to Orthodox, and not Indochinese, principles? I am not going to associate my desires with themes of a dog's plan. I want Muscovites to be happy. I want it to be easier for Muscovites to live and for them not to be burdened at least by those troubles that our still unsettled city administration presents them. Happy New Year! [Pankov] And to you and to your family, good health and prosperity and a good New Year's celebration! [Luzhkov] Thank you.
