FBIS3-43176 "cr00000000894001" 5 January 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-002--CHINA CHINA: CORRUPTION AIDS PUBLICATION OF VULGAR, POLITICALLY SENSITIVE MATERIALS Recent articles from PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan media have reported on corrupt practices in China's flourishing publishing industry that have facilitated a proliferation of vulgar and pornographic publications as well as the publication of politically sensitive materials. Some entrepreneurs have legitimized their publishing activities by purchasing "book numbers" from publishing houses, while others simply publish illegally. Industry spokesmen warn that the phenomenon threatens the continued publication of high-quality literature. An article in the 6 November issue of the Chinese Writers' Association weekly WENYI BAO reported that the number of new books and periodicals published in China is growing at an annual rate of 20 percent but that an increasing number of them are "vulgar" and "garbage" materials. Moreover, the article notes, over 95 percent of the "questionable" items have been published through the sale of "book numbers," or publishing permits. Xu Weicheng, executive deputy chief of the CPC Propaganda Department, says in the same article that a "small number of unlawful persons" have through buying book numbers published books that "are seriously wrong politically, leak state secrets, damage nationality unity, violate foreign policy, and promote feudalistic superstition or pornography." Dissident writers have also used this channel to reach readers. Ma Shaohua's "Eastern Europe: 1989-93" was published through "buying a book number," according to an article in the 29 November Hong Kong MING PAO. A 1 November Hong Kong LIEN-HO PAO article reports that Ma's book, which analyzes the failure of communist rule in Eastern Europe, was banned in September for "creating chaos among the masses." According to an article in the 20 October issue of the Beijing daily GUANGMING RIBAO, the State Press and Publication Administration's Books Administrative Department director, Yang Muzhi, says that purchasing book numbers is "tantamount to purchasing publishing rights" granted by the state. By selling a unit or individual outside the publishing industry a book number, he notes, publishing houses are enabling the unit or individual to print a book for profit. This is an example of "exchanging power for money," Yang continues. An article in the 2 November Taipei LIEN-HO PAO reports that PRC publishing houses receive 2,000 to 20,000 yuan for a book number. In addition to purchasing book numbers from legitimate publishing houses, many entrepreneurs have simply printed books under fake publishing house names, according to an article in the 5 November issue of the Hong Kong monthly TZU-CHING (BAUHINIA MAGAZINE). China's annual publication volume now accounts for one-ninth of the total world book production, but "crude and obscene" materials have flooded the market. According to the article, the government confiscated 10 million illegal books in 1992, of which 160,000 were pornographic. Two major publishers have recently issued warnings on the harmful effects of this corruption. People's Publishing House Director Xue Dezhen notes in the 4 November JINRONG SHIBAO that buying and selling book numbers enables poor-quality books to be published, disturbs publication management, facilitates large-scale tax evasion by book sellers, and hinders the publication of good books and academic works. In the same article, Beijing Publishing House Director Zhu Shuxin called buying and selling book numbers "suicide behavior"; large quantities of low-grade, low-priced books are being dumped on the market, he said, while the production of high-quality books and books "with vitality" is being "strangled."
