Chaiyot Sasomsap met yesterday with his Vietnamese counterpart. Vietnam is faced with decreases in orders from African countries which have devaluated their currencies, Chaiyot said. The Vietnamese mission, comprised of senior officials and representatives of the private sector, is led by Nguyen Xuan Quang, the deputy trade minister. The talks, to be held for three days to Wednesday, focus on the sharing of information, marketing and the control of production. Chaiyot said if the two parties agree to exchange more information it would benefit both sides. He complained that Vietnam does not disclose much information about its rice production and marketing, while Thailand discloses a lot of information to them. "We don't exactly know when Vietnam's rice is to come on the market. If it is not on the same month (as ours) it is great," Chaiyot said. Chaiyot wants the two sides to reach an agreement to cooperate in marketing, sharing the world market. "Thailand could sacrifice on its part, letting Vietnam be the biggest exporter of 15 per cent rice," he said. The two sides might also cooperate to limit rice production in order to avoid an oversupply on the world market, which would lead to lower prices. The results of technical discussions will be submitted to Chaiyot and his counterpart Quang on Wednesday for approval. If any further progress has been made the two sides will use the results as principles for cooperation but if not the two sides will follow a memorandum of understanding signed last year. Chaiyot said the Vietnam will export this year about 1.7 million tonnes, down from the previous estimate of 2.2 million tonnes. Thailand will export about 4.8 million tonnes, same as last year. Rice exports from the two countries of about 6.5 million tonnes represent 40 per cent of world rice exports. Each country produces 20 million tonnes per annum.
