He said that although North Korea began to replace the fuel rods of the 5mw reactor in Yongbyon, it will seal the spent fuel and keep it under the IAEA's strict surveillance. "We will then allow accurate measurement of the spent fuel when we and the United States comprehensively settle the nuclear problem in a package deal," he said. The official reiterated the statement by a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman that Pyongyang had to begin replacing the fuel rods for reasons of technical safety. He also noted that the statement emphasized that the nuclear problem can still be solved through dialogue. Thomas McLarty, chief of staff for U.S. President Bill Clinton, told a TV news program last weekend that Washington needs more information about North Korea's refueling and is waiting for reports from the IAEA team, which began its inspections on Tuesday. The United States, however, may not have any alternative but to study ways at the U.N. Security Council to impose sanctions on North Korea if the IAEA inspection fails to come up with satisfactory results, diplomatic sources said.
