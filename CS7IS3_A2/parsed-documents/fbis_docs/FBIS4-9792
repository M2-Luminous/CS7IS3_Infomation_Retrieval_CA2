Athletes like Sotomayor, Ana Fidelia, and many others can attract 100,000 people to a stadium. These athletes can tackle the most diverse issues. None of our diplomats, not the most acclaimed or trained, can in such a short period achieve what one of our modest athletes can -- transmit Cuba's image abroad. I just spoke with our trainer in Thailand. During the first official meeting in Bangkok with that country's foreign minister, the number one issue of the talks was Cuba's trainer there. They wanted to know if we had more and how we do it. I believe this reflects not only what has already been accomplished, but what we are willing to do and are capable of doing. [end recording]
