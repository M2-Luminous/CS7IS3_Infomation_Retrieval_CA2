This is the first visit a Swedish foreign minister is paying to this country since 1985. Ms. Ugglas and her Bulgarian counterpart later today are expected to sign an agreement on reciprocal protection and promotion of investments. "We want to strengthen and intensify the relations between our two countries," Ms. Ugglas said upon her arrival at Sofia Airport. "I am very pleased that I am the second Swedish minister who comes to Bulgaria this year and I think this is a good sign of increasing relations," she also said, referring to a January 1994 visit by the Swedish defence minister. Immediately after her arrival here Ms. Margaretha af Ugglas met Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. European integration was high on the agenda of the meeting, the Swedish Foreign Minister said after having met Foreign Minister Daskalov. "Sweden sees Bulgaria as an important partner in building the new Europe. I congratulated Bulgaria for the agreement with the IMF. It means that Swedish balance of payments support will now be freed and within the framework of the G-24 there will be 20 million dollars in credits for Bulgaria from Sweden and there will probably come another 6 million U.S. dollars also in credits. I also thanked the Bulgarian foreign minister for the fact that Bulgaria, in spite of the heavy burden, is respecting the UN sanctions against former Yugoslavia. I told my colleague that Sweden is going the contribute 2.5 million Swedish kronor to help improve the checkpoints of the border crossings between Bulgaria and Romania. That is a new Swedish contribution in the effort to help the countries that are respecting the UN sanctions," Ms. Ugglas said. Asked to comment on the failure of the international community's efforts in Bosnia, Ms. Ugglas said it was very tragic. "Now there has to be a very determined joined effort on the part of the United States, the European Union and Russia. There has been too many conflicting signals and now it is very important to move together," the Swedish foreign minister said on this matter. "I am very pleased with the talks because Sweden's support is essential for the reforms in Bulgaria. There are no open issues in bilateral aspect, on the contrary: Sweden is a country which supports Bulgaria in different spheres, including the settlement of our foreign debt, which it does through sharing in the financing within the framework of the G-24. Sweden is ready to help this country cope with the difficulties arising from the Yugocrisis through contributing to funds aimed to improve the infrastructure along the Bulgarian-Romanian border. Sweden is also ready to open export credit lines and to train Bulgarian blue helmets, as it has longstanding traditions in this sphere. It is ready to help Bulgaria get integrated into the European Union," Foreign Minister Daskalov said for his part. He also said he was invited to pay an official visit to Sweden. The Swedish guest this afternoon is expected to meet President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. The Bulgarian and Swedish foreign ministers will call a news conference this evening.
