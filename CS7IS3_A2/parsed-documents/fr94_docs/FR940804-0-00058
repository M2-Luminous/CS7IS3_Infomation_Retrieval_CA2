FR940804-0-00058 FR940804-0-00022 The rationale for the deferring and staying of sanctions in these cases is that the proposed full or conditional approval or proposed finding that the State is implementing its SIP would be the basis for EPA's interim final determination that the State has corrected the deficiency. 18 When EPA issues this proposal, the Agency indicates that it believes it is more likely than not that the State is complying with the relevant requirements of the Act. The EPA believes it would be inequitable for sanctions to apply in situations where EPA has made such an affirmative finding, even though it is only preliminary. Moreover, EPA believes it would be unfair to apply sanctions merely because the clock had expired before EPA is able to take final action on the submittal in these situations given the length of the rulemaking process. 18 The EPA's final conditional approval would merely continue any stay or deferral initiated by EPA's proposed conditional approval and EPA's simultaneous interim final determination the deficiency has been corrected. (2) Overview of Change Two. The second change to the rule concerns the guidance discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule at page 51273, footnote 9, where EPA indicated that if the sanction clock started by a finding of failure to submit or incompleteness expires during a completeness review for a subsequent SIP submittal, the sanction would not apply unless and until EPA found the submittal incomplete. In this instance, EPA intended that the sanction clock would not temporarily stop, but instead would continue to run. During that time, EPA would simply defer the application of the sanction while it reviewed the SIP submittal to determine whether or not the State had corrected the deficiency prompting the finding. Thus, if and when EPA found the SIP incomplete after expiration of the 18-month clock, the sanction would apply on the date EPA found the plan incomplete. 19 19 Note that this specific aspect of the proposed sanction clock policy was not actually reflected in the regulatory language of the proposed rule but was discussed in the preamble only. After further analysis of this aspect of the sanction clock policy in the context of addressing comments, EPA has determined that it is inappropriate to defer and/or stay sanctions when sanction clocks elapse during review for completeness of plans submitted by States following findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness. Therefore, EPA's rule provides that the temporary deferral and staying of the application of sanctions occurs only when EPA takes an affirmative action in which it indicates the Agency's belief that the State has corrected the deficiency prompting the finding (e.g., that the State has corrected the finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness). The EPA believes this change is necessary since, upon further reflection, EPA realizes that in such a situation there has been no prior affirmative action by EPA preliminarily or finally determining that the State has, in fact, corrected the deficiency. A proposed approval of a revised SIP following a disapproval constitutes such an action as does a proposed finding that a State is implementing its SIP following a finding of nonimplementation. However, mere EPA receipt of a SIP submittal from a State following a nonsubmittal or incompleteness finding does not constitute such an action, since EPA takes no affirmative action preliminarily indicating that the State has submitted a complete SIP, and there is nothing to give rise to an interim final determination that the State has corrected the deficiency. Under this change, sanctions will apply if a sanction clock expires during a completeness review of a SIP submitted following a nonsubmittal or incompleteness finding. An example illustrates the implications of this change. Suppose EPA finds that a State failed to submit a SIP and then at month 17 the State submits a SIP which the Agency then starts reviewing for completeness. Month 18 arrives and EPA is still reviewing the submittal. Under the approach in the proposal, application of the offset sanction at month 18 would be deferred unless and until EPA found the plan incomplete. Under the final rule, the sanction will apply at month 18 and only be lifted once EPA takes affirmative action finding the plan complete. For EPA to continue with the proposed policy of deferring sanctions following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings, EPA would have to view mere receipt of a submittal from the State as a preliminary correction of the deficiency. However, EPA's view is that receipt of a State plan does not constitute an affirmative EPA determination that the revised SIP is complete. 20 Therefore, it is inappropriate to defer and/or stay sanctions following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings. Furthermore, once EPA has affirmatively determined the plan is complete, any sanctions clock or any applied sanctions would be permanently stopped. Therefore, it is inappropriate to defer or stay sanctions following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings until EPA has affirmatively determined the plan is complete. 21 The EPA believes this change, as well as change one, makes the Agency's approach in deferring and staying the application of sanctions more consistent with the requirements of the Act. 20 Arguably, EPA could make an interim final determination that the State's submittal is complete. However, such an interim determination is impractical and inappropriate for at least two reasons. One, the short time period provided under the Act for EPA to make completeness determinations (i.e., 60 days) indicate that Congress did not intend for EPA (nor contemplate for EPA) to make preliminary completeness determinations. Two, the nature of the completeness review does not lend itself to EPA making preliminary and final determinations. The completeness review is intended as a straightforward exercise to determine if the SIP revision includes the basic elements to warrant further review for overall adequacy. Therefore, there is no room for a preliminary determination; any review sufficient to make such a preliminary determination would be sufficient for EPA's final completeness determination. 21 A clarification is being made in the final rule which was not specifically addressed in the proposed rule. Following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings, the final rule effectively provides that sanction clocks can be stopped (and sanctions lifted) only when EPA makes an affirmative completeness finding, and not when SIP's become complete by operation of law pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(B) of the Act. This change is further discussed in section II.C.4. below.
