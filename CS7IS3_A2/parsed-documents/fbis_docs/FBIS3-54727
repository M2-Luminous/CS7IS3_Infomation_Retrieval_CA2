Although there were many mistakes and miscalculations, he admitted, "Ukraine has not slid into the abyss, as some would have us believe." The fall in national income was 5 percent less than last year, and the decline in manufacturing slowed down. The country's industry produced a greater quantity of electric locomotives, special-purpose cisterns, power equipment, generators, wood working machines, and other goods. Farmers also had a good year, gathering 45.6 million quintals per hectare, considerably more than in 1992. The milk yield also increased. Leonid Kravchuk described an agreement on prices and volumes of fuel deliveries to Ukraine signed with Russia and Turkmenistan as a positive step in the right direction. In the interview he paid a considerable attention to the upcoming elections of people's deputies. The president expressed confidence that people would be able to come grips with the situation and, bearing in mind the pre-election campaign in Russia, would elect truly worthy and experienced politicians. Taking about the most pressing tasks for the upcoming year, Leonid Kravchuk expressed confidence that Ukraine would be able to meet its targets for nuclear disarmament and to resolve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet in a civilized manner with Russia. The main thing for us, the president stressed, is "that there should be peace, tranquility, and confidence in the future in this common home of ours which we call Earth."
