Felix Santos, top leader of the Sole Peasant Workers Confederation of Bolivia (CSUTCB), condemned Gore's visit, because he believes the vice president is coming to press for the forced elimination of coca plantations and the complete privatization of the country's economy. There is reason to fear he is coming to promote violence against peasants who grow coca, a leaf with natural benefits which is also used to produce cocaine, Santos added, referring to the growing tension between narcotics police and peasants over the last few weeks. The peasants are afraid the soldiers will come to flatten their crops. Washington has conditioned its aid program of the Bolivian balance of payment, which totals $40 million per year, to the fulfillment of coca plantation reduction goals. Toribio Hinojosa, secretary general of the Bolivian Workers Federation (COB) [Central Obrera Boliviana], has said the organization has decided to declare Al Gore's visit as non grata, adding the visit demonstrates U.S. concern over the peasants' determination to resist the elimination of the coca leaf. The government and the coca leaf growers are on the verge of an agreement that conditions coca plantation reduction plans to the development of alternate activities to provide farmers with new means of survival, thus reducing tension. During his stay in Bolivia, Gore will meet with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and other national authorities, under strict security measures.
