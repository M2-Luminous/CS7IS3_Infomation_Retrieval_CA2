Soskovets described the government' activities in this field as "obviously insufficient." A package of documents on the reform of state-run enterprises, strengthening taxation policies, streamlining payments and abolishing export quotas and licenses was prepared by the Russian Government and signed by the president on May 23. "Despite an avalanche of comments on the latest presidential decrees, the Russian ministers's voice is almost inaudible," Soskovets said. "It is the cabinet which should be the first to analyse laws which the ministers will have to comply with, bring them home to the people and make their forecasts," Soskovets said. On his initiative the government adopted a resolution to establish control over the implementation of the president's decrees on stepping up the economic reform. Under the resolution, heads of federal and regional executive bodies were instructed to hold conferences and seminars to discuss recent presidential decrees, inviting managers of enterprises to attend.
