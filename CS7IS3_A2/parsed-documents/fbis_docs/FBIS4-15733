Yuriy Solton comments on the situation there, and this is what he writes: Heavy fighting has lasted for about two weeks around Gorazde, declared by the United Nations as one of the securiy areas in Bosnia. The lives of 60,000 civilians and United Nations personnel there are in danger. At the request of the United Nations Protection Force commander General Rose, who referred to previous United Nations Security Council resolutions, NATO aircraft have bombed Serb positions for the first time in two years. United Nations Secretary General Butrus-Ghali was notifed of the measure. A bombing of the Bosnian Serb positions has seriously worsened the situation in Bosnia. President Boris Yeltsin has voiced serious concern. At six o'clock on Monday morning Moscow time he discussed the situation with President Bill Clinton. And this is what President Yeltsin said before leaving for Spain: There are several fundamental principles one must always bear in mind. Firstly, all measures must be taken in strict compliance to the United Nations resolutions. We are for discussing that question in the United Nations Security Council. I told Mr. Clinton more than once that such measures can't be taken without prior consultation between United States and Russia. And we insist on this. On the eve of the attack the warring Serb and Muslim factions in the area of Gorazde signed a 24-hour cease-fire agreement. The Serb community leader, Radavan Karadzic, has suggested making the agreement universal, spreading it to the whole Serb-Muslim frontline in Bosnia. The Muslims dismissed the proposal. And this was followed by NATO's air raid. The developments in Bosnia are at a crossroads. At this very moment it's being decided whether the Bosnian Republic will choose the road of peace or the road of war. That hasty military action without prior discussions in the United Nations Security Council is pushing the country into a war. The leaders of the Serb community have described the air strike as aggression. All contacts with the United Nations Protection Force have been broken. The peace talks between the warring factions have been suspended. In the meantime NATO's headquarters has warned there may be more air strikes. Armed intervention from outside will fail to bring either party to the negotiating table. And it's only negotiations that can produce a political solution. The special Russian presidential envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, is holding negotiations in former Yugoslavia. His meetings with political leaders there are expected to clear up the situation and find a peaceful way out, as it was the case with the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo and opening Tuzla airport to United Nations forces.
