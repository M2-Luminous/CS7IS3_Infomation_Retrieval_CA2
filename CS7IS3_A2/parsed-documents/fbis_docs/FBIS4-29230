The analyst says: The United States, far from accepting the DPRK's just proposal for ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula, is crying over "the violation of the armistice agreement", taking issue with it. This is intended to cover up its crimes in having deliberately and systematically destroyed the Korean armistice agreement and armistice machine and shift the blame on to the other. It is the United States that destroyed and scrapped the Korean Armistice Agreement. After it was signed in July 1953, the United States, a signatory to it, began violating it even before the ink on the agreement was dry. The U.S. side had shipped new types of weapons including nuclear weapons into South Korea in secrecy by camouflaged method, afraid of the Korean Armistic Agreement in the past days. But now it is introducing and deploying them openly in broad daylight. In March 1991 it was the United States that appointed a "general" of the South Korean army without legal authority or qualification in view of the Korean Armistice Agreement "senior member" of the U.S. side, thus incapacitating the armistice machine from fulfilling its function. The U.S side's attempt to revive the armistice machine is intended to persist in war provocation moves and keep tensions on the Korean peninsula. The United States will be well advised to act with discretion, mindful that its perfidious act is not favourable to it.
