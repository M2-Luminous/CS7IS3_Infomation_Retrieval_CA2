Unless there is strong growth, the labor market will not recover. However, an increase in growth alone will not be enough. In addition, we partly rebuff the view -- widespread in employers' circles -- that only a radical reduction in wage costs might result in an increase of jobs. On 1 July, incidental labor costs will be reduced by 2 billion Luxembourg francs [LFr] a year. Reductions in taxes and incidental costs will mean a saving of LFr30 billion over the next five years, and taxes are not expected to rise. However, managing costs alone will not be enough either. Strong economic growth and low incidental wage costs are the preconditions for preventing any further deterioration of the labor market. Consequently, only those parties with proven economic and financial competence may be allowed to come to power and form a government. Small parties with half-baked platforms and unrealistic concepts may enable irritated voters to vent their dissatisfaction, but if they come to power, our country will be worse off. Economic growth and a healthy cost-related situation cannot stem the tide of unemployment by themselves. What is required in addition are complementary policies of the kind called for not only by the government, but by all the partners. In the first instance, we must help existing labor market policy instruments to make speedy progress. There is no use in repeatedly adopting new laws and offering fresh forms of support for the labor market. We must make greater efforts to bring the broad-ranging series of instruments at our disposal into effect. We must be more efficient in informing employers about the forms of aid available to them when they hire unemployed individuals. In recent years -- and I say this quite self-critically -- the efforts made by the Ministry of Labor to provide such information were insufficient. Many employers still do not know that they can apply for the reimbursement of their ancillary labor costs if they take on older, jobless individuals or the long-term unemployed. Many employers still do not know about state contributions to wages when they sign up young, unemployed people. We shall make every conceivable effort to bring unemployed people in out of the cold. We will provide better information, but employers must also react more positively. Our unemployed should first be given a chance, before the labor markets in the border region have been emptied of their potential. In order to give our unemployed greater opportunities, we will extend the offer of retraining and specialized training courses. At present 400 unemployed individuals are undergoing retraining. This figure must be increased. We shall see that it does. We will not tolerate seeing unemployed people turning a deaf ear to this extended offer. However, we must also go down new avenues. Part-time work needs a considerable shot in the arm. When full-time jobs are shared new employment opportunities are created. We must be open to all kinds of part-time work: half-time work, the four-day workweek, the six-hour day, the eight-month working year, etc. Many people here in our country are waiting for offers of part-time work. Employers must create them, and the trade unions must include them in their lists of demands. The state must help part-time work -- and not just half-time work -- to make a breakthrough in all sectors of public service. Remote working [Tele-Arbeit] and distance working [Fernarbeit] -- i.e. working at home -- must gain a foothold in our economic system, for it gives employees, especially parents bringing up their children, the chance to go about their work within their own four walls. It also enables employees in rural areas to overcome the mobility barrier. We will award distance work fiscally and protect it under labor law against abuse. Moving into new territory also means that we have to provide the labor market with the satisfaction of modern requirements. Jobs, new jobs are everywhere: Employment opportunities in the socially relevant fields of care for the elderly, neighbor support, child care, and recreational activity have been unnoticed for years Moving into new territory also means securing work for those who gain no professional qualifications, in spite of all the school reforms. For decades we have been replacing people by robots. In so doing, we have pulled the carpet from underneath the feet of the nonqualified worker. We must gradually start replacing robots with people who need work, thereby putting them back on their feet again. We will certainly not manage to restore full employment by the end of the decade. As desirable as this objective of work for all may be, it will remain an unfulfilled dream. However, our concern for people and respect for their dignity obliges us all to work untiringly toward this goal. All our concerns are important, but none is as important as this one.
