The Council welcomed the considerable efforts which the two parties from Mostar had made and which showed their willingness to make further progress towards mutual reconciliation. This Memorandum of Understanding, when signed by all parties, will be the decisive step towards the early establishment of the EU administration. The Council calls on the parties from Bosnia-Hercegovina to approve the Memorandum of Understanding on their side as soon as possible, thus opening the way for signature. It hopes that this will take place very soon. In making this major contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in an important town which has been the centre of much fighting and misery, the European Union recalls that success will only be assured if all concerned in Mostar and the region cooperate fully. It hopes that the restoration of cooperation between the communities in Mostar will be a model for other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
