Not Only for Army -- for Country's Security"] [Text] Today, according to the agenda approved Wednesday [25 May], the State Duma will continue its work on the draft law "On the Federal Budget for 1994." Discussion of defense items will take place behind closed doors. I do not think there is any need to explain why "closed doors" were necessary. "We will try to convince the deputies," I was told by Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, "that 55 trillion rubles [R] is the minimum defense expenditure below which we cannot go." The discussion will proceed with specific figures to hand and with Defense Ministry computations -- where particular sums are going and what they are for. Yushenkov believes it is largely the detailed argument which could sway those who voted 11 May against increasing military expenditure. But let us stipulate immediately that the "anti-Army" motives are by no means homogeneous here. There are, of course, those deputies who by virtue of their professional detachment from defense problems are more inclined to believe the expert authorities. If the government says R37 trillion is enough to cover defense expenditure, is it not best to believe it? Especially as, instead of a well reasoned project, during the first reading the deputies were offered, as they say, just "the bare figures." It is for the sake of this category of doubters that it it is possible and necessary to try to interpret where and how the military intend to spend the people's money. But I fear that for a certain number of deputies nothing can be proved -- some, having sworn loyalty to their own departmenbt, will not give up a single kopek, others will be inflexible because the proposal arises from "politically alien elements," still others will be guided by subtle and political considerations calculated many moves in advance. Any reasoning is poweless here. Yes, our deputies come in many varieties. But let us recall that a majority -- 166 people -- nonetheless voted for the allocation of the R18 trillion sought. Let us also bear in mind that it was in the Duma that this amendment to the government's draft law arose. And it was the Defenmse Committee and the Defense Ministry which initiated the meeting with the Russian Federation president's assistant for security, which ultimately led to the president's intervention, who recognized the correctness of increasing the defense budget to R55 trillion. Today, when battle will again be joined for a realistic amount of military expenditure, I know there will be many defenders of the Army to be found in the State Duma hall. But the discussion will not be about defending the Army on a grand scale but about the state's security. It is not at all obligatory that somebody should attack us from outside -- the collapse of the Army and defense industry will shake the country worse than aggression would. What is actually going on? Everyone realizes -- even the Finance Ministry and Central Bank -- that the military is not asking for anything excessive. And this is stated by the person who bears chief responsibility for the state's defense capability -- Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin. But the question of the additional R18 trillion remains up in the air. It is the easiest thing in the world to look for plotters, especially across the ocean. But here it is better to agree with Yushenkov's deputy -- Deputy Aleksandr Piskunov: The root of evil lies in our negligence, in the inability to see further than our own noses. Economizing on the Army and the defense industry today means to lose those same trillions tomorrow, only multiplied 10-fold. Piskunov off the cuff offered a scenario for the development of the situation if there were just the paltry R37 trillion. I issue a defense order, but the state is not giving enterprises the money. So directors take out bank loans (naturally at commercial banks -- there are no others) at extortionate interest rates. The order is fulfilled but, in order to pay the banks back they accordingly increase the price of their output. Thus, domestically-produced combat equipment and weapons will turn out so expensive that it will be more advantageous to buy weapons and equipment abroad. "Specialists" in the field of foreign trade will be found who will readily substantiate the need for the final collapse of the Russian defense industry, citing as substantiation none other than the state's interests. It is easy to miss all this in one's calculations today -- like the losses from the impossibility of advantageously trading arms on the world market. But for some, as Piskunov said, there is an insurmountable temptation to pay "for the financial system's inefficiency with the collapse of effective defense." The budget deficit must not be increased. The consequences of this step are also easy to miss when calculating. Meanwhile, the inflationary noose, which will inevitably be pulled tighter after a new batch of money backed by nothing is printed (the same R18 trillion), and it will take a mortal grip on the throat of the military man, above all. Whereas other people, even those working in the budget-financed sector but civilians nonetheless, have the opportunity to do a bit of extra work somewhere to supplement their family budget, the military man is completely deprived of this opportunity. This is why, Yushenkov tried to convince me, when "Russia's Choice" categorically comes out against increasing the budget deficit, it is not least defending the interests of military personnel themselves. What is the solution? Yushenkov (let me remind you that he is a "Russia's Choice" activist) belives that it is possible to scrape together the required sum by reassessing sources of the income element of the budget. Incidentally, the State Duma Economic Policy Committee has specific proposals on this. Specifically, committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev is proposing refusing a number of privileges to structures trading abroad (the estimated saving is between R5 trillion and R10 trillion), and to make privatization more "lucrative." Sergey Yushenkov is counting on income from foreign economic activity and reducing the state apparatus, and is not ruling out the possibility of efficiently raising a domestic targeted loan from both citizens and commercial structures. Aleksandr Piskunov sees some unexploited poitential in tax policy but chiefly in the taxation practice. (The state just cannot learn how to collect taxes). There are also other proposals. The main thing, Piskunov said, is that during the second reading there should be no clash between conceptual economic schools. Putting it simply, our learned economists should not lapse into arrogance. There is one further hope that government representatives too will come along to today's session with specific options for resolving this difficult situation. Only not with those which will cause the military to clash head-on with, for instance, the farmers, the scientists, the medical personnel, or the whole world in general. So that some time later you would have to explain to the people: You will have to wait this year for an increase in wages and pensions -- you yourselves are aware that the Army's demands have had to be met. Nonetheless, let us hope that the state will provide a subsistence minimum for its Armed Forces, however hard it is to do so. But it is woth bearing in mind for the future that Russians are also giving us money today for real reforms in the Army. They, our reforms, do not come cheap. But the route which they are now to take is dependent on what kind of defense budget for 1995 the State Duma deputies will vote tomorrow, and with what kind of enthusiasm they vote.
