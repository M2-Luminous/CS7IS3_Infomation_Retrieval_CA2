What is your reaction to the presidential edict granting you command of the Ciscarpatian Military District? [Shulyak] I did not even dream about such a post in my years as a lieutenant. However, frankly speaking, I have been pleased with all of my service advancements. I think it quite natural, because every soldier wants to make a career, to become a general. However, I have never attempted to get a promotion at any price; I have just worked honestly. Posts and ranks followed as recognition of my work. Therefore, I see my nomination for the commander of district troops as such a recognition as well. The president's edict in this regard is a legal document affirming my authority in the post of PVO commander. [Tarchynets] How do you evaluate the current situation of the Ukrainian Army -- the combat training of its personnel, particularly, the preparedness of the conscripts, as well as technical supplies and morale among the ranks? [Shulyak] I can say that the combat training of district units is at a level that guarantees the reliable protection of western state borders. This, by the way, was affirmed by the recent regiment exercises which were attended by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. However, the training and level of combat readiness are subject to change; they can be improved without limits. This refers also to the preparation of conscripts. Therefore, we, the servicemen, jointly with military registration and enlistment offices, the Association for Assisting the Defense of Ukraine, and other institutions, will take pains to get good specialists in our Army. There is every possibility to accomplish this. Understandably, the quality of training of any army specialist also depends on the prevailing morale, in which he masters his combat craft. Unfortunately, it is too early to affirm that every problem has already been resolved here. Let us say quite openly: We have not yet eliminated violations of discipline, bullying of conscripts, or just bad manners in the Army. However, the morale in the Army is going to improve. [Tarchynets] Why have PVO commanders been changed so frequently? [Shulyak] It should be noted that personnel changes are being made not only in our district, but also in all the other structures of the Armed Forces. It is conditioned by the process of building our Army, by bringing its quality and size in line with Ukraine's military doctrine. There is reduction as well as creation of new structures in our troops. Personnel changes follow this process of building. I think that this is quite a natural phenomenon. [Tarchynets] What is your opinion about Kostyantyn Morozov's retirement from the post of defense minister? What do you think about his book "Flight Under President's Wing"? Was General Morozov the right man for the post of defense minister? [Shulyak] I will begin with the last question. Yes, Colonel General Kostyantyn Morozov undoubtedly was the right man for his post at the stage of the creation of Ukraine's Armed Forces. He did a lot to provide our state with its own Army. With regard to subsequent activities of the former defense minister and his book "Flight Under President's Wing," I think that this can be evaluated only by those who worked with General Morozov and possess appropriate information. [Tarchynets] What is General Stepanov's -- the former PVO commander's -- lot? What is he doing? [Shulyak] Lieutenant General Stepanov has been appointed deputy commander of the Odessa Military District for issues of reform. He still occupies this post. [Tarchynets] Are you satisfied with your subordinates? Do you intend to make personnel changes in the district staff, combined units, formations, and units? [Shulyak] There are experienced and competent officers and generals in the district staff; therefore I think that any urgent personnel changes are inexpedient. The same refers to the commands of combined units, formations, and units. However, as is known, the district command recently underwent some changes. There were new deputy commanders and chiefs of certain departments and services nominated, while their predecessors were promoted to higher posts. For instance, Major Generals Oleh Shustenko and Ivan Kolesnikov became deputy commanders of the PVO troops, Major General Volodymyr Chernykh headed the PVO rear units, and Colonel Leonid Polishchuk became chief of the PVO personnel department. Colonel Vasyl Kazmirchuk was nominated chief of the troops of radioactive, chemical, and biological protection. Following the creation of a new Armed Forces unit -- the Land Forces -- which are headed by Colonel General Vasyl Sobkov, deputy defense minister, a group of PVO officers and generals will be transferred to work in the Staff of the Land Forces. Thus, there are more personnel changes to come. [passage omitted]
