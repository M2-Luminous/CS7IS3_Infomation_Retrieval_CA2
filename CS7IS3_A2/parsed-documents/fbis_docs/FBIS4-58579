She told AL-HAYAH that she has apologized to the Egyptian Government for being unable to accept the invitation, "despite her appreciation of the tireless efforts and assistance it offered to achieve progress in connection with the agreement." She attributed her failure to go to Cairo to "reasons related to her refusal to participate in any ceremonies or occasions of this kind while a large number of Palestinian women are still in Israeli jails." Mrs. 'Arafat expressed her unwillingness to shake hands with or stand beside Mrs. Rabin, who will accompany her husband to the signing ceremony in Cairo today, before all Palestinian women are released from prison. She said: "I support the president's decisions and stance. But I realize that the normalization process will need time. I do not believe that we will be able to normalize relations quickly amid this large number of psychological barriers which we should surmount." She added: "A week ago the Israelis sentenced 'Abir Lahidi, a 20-year-old woman, to 20 years in prison. They also demolished her house, ignoring all talk about peace and the agreement. So how can I ignore or forget the suffering or feelings of Palestinian women held in prison, and appear in ceremonies before my people and the world?" At another level, Mrs. 'Arafat said that she is going to accompany the Palestinian president to South Africa to congratulate President Nelson Mandela on his victory in the elections and to attend his inauguration ceremony.
