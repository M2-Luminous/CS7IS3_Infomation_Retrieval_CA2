Addressing a press conference in Pretoria, Mr Meyer said the government was prepared to negotiate with the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] and the Transitional Executive Council to extend the time for submitting candidate lists. This was, however, subject to a "clear indication" from the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Freedom Front within the next 24 hours that they intended to do so. This was stretching the technical requirements because Wednesday's deadline had passed without these parties submitting candidates lists to complete their "provisional" registration. Logistically, Mr Meyer said: "We have until tomorrow (Friday) afternoon". Mr Meyer rejected Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leader Constand Viljoen's suggestion that the election be postponed for two months as "not making sense". Gen Viljoen had proposed that one month should be used for mediation and the next to prepare for the elections. Also, there was no need for a seperate referendum or plebiscite to determine support for a "volkstaat" [homeland] because through the elections' two-ballot system they could determine their support and where it was located, Mr Meyer said. The right-wing had no grounds to take "undemocratic steps" to realise their ideal and the government would see that the necessary steps would be taken to protect the process and the elections, Mr Meyer warned. Mr Meyer urged the Freedom Alliance's parties to participate in the elections, saying their objections had been dealt with in the amendments to the interim constitution. Gen Viljoen had acknowledged this, he claimed. Referring to Gen Viljoen's proposal to postpone the elections for at least two months, Mr Meyer said: "It cannot work. With six to seven weeks before the polls there are already complaints from Freedom Alliance parties about time contraints to prepare for the elections, it would be even more so with only one month." He added that the government was not in principle against international mediation, but it was not clear over what issues further mediation was needed.
