FR940203-0-00095 FR940203-0-00021 The only known population of the Pacific pocket mouse is found in conjunction with a population of coastal California gnatcatchers on the Dana Point Headlands (Brylski 1993; EDAW 1993a,b). The coastal California gnatcatcher's status as a threatened species gives it protection under the Act. However, the legal authority to protect the gnatcatcher does not extend to candidate species. Under provisions under section 10(a) of the Act, the Service may permit the incidental ``take'' of the gnatcatcher during the course of an otherwise legal activity as long as the likelihood of that species' survival and recovery in the wild is not precluded. If the Service authorized take of the gnatcatcher at the Dana Point Headlands pursuant to section 10(a), the permitted activities could result in the extinction of the Pacific pocket mouse. In 1991, the State of California established the Natural Communities Conservation Planning Program to address the conservation needs of natural ecosystems throughout the State. The initial focus of that program is the coastal sage scrub community occupied, in part, by the Pacific pocket mouse. At the present time, no plans have been completed or implemented, and no protection is currently proposed to prevent or reduce impacts to 3.65 of the 3.75 acres of occupied habitat on the Dana Point Headlands that are proposed for development. In many cases, land-use planning decisions are made on the basis of environmental review documents prepared in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) or the National Environmental Policy Act. These Acts have not adequately protected Pacific pocket mouse habitat. A relocation program proposed to mitigate impacts to the Pacific pocket mouse on the Dana Point Headlands (EDAW 1993b) has not been fully defined or developed and must be considered highly experimental. As part of this proposed mitigation program, ``the Pacific pocket mouse will be relocated to suitable on-site or off-site locations that are or will be preserved as suitable habitat'' (EDAW 1993b). EDAW (1993b) has concluded that the ``implementation of this mitigation will not reduce impacts to this species to a level of insignificance.'' The program proposed in the Dana Point Headlands to control domestic cat predation is also inadequate. E. Other natural or man-made factors affecting its continued existence. This species is highly susceptible to extinction as a result of stochastic environmental or demographic causes because the remaining animals are found in one location. The Service has determined that listing as endangered is appropriate because the remaining location is imminently threatened by urban development.
