FR940208-0-00113 FR940208-0-00031 Service Response: Although more roads have been closed since 1980, between 1980 and 1988, there were more open areas and limited access areas and fewer closed areas (Biosystems Analysis 1991). In addition, the impact of OHVs on tortoises has increased over the last decade due to changes in BLM zoning, increases in OHV use, and the proliferation of illegal roads, a factor that results in serious environmental impacts and a difficult management issue for the BLM. Issue 26: One letter stated that organized OHV activities in the West Mojave are regulated by section 7 permits issued by the Service through consultation with the BLM. Because OHVs have abided by these stipulations, expansive designation of critical habitat is not necessary in light of the protection available through the permitting/stipulation process. Service Response: Through section 7 of the Act, the Service consults with Federal agencies that authorize, fund, or carry out actions that may affect a listed species. With the listing of a species, the Service determines through these consultations whether an action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a species. The adverse modification standard may be applied when an action would likely preclude recovery of a listed species. Thus critical habitat provides additional protection to a species and its habitat through section 7 of the Act. After designation of critical habitat, the Service will also determine if an action is likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. Following designation of critical habitat, all current activities for which a Federal agency maintains discretionary action must undergo reinitiation of consultation to analyze whether or not they are likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. OHV activities within the designated critical habitat are not the only activities that may adversely affect the desert tortoise and its habitat. Issue 27: Some letters objected to the general statements that OHV activity results in negative impacts on desert tortoise habitat without quantifying such effects. Service Response: The negative impacts of OHV activity on desert tortoise habitat have been quantified extensively since the early 1970s. Tortoises are adversely affected by OHVs through loss of forage and vegetative cover; increased mortality from crushing, collection, and vandalism; and soil compaction and loss of burrow sites. Because the use of OHVs in desert areas is a highly charged issue, much attention has been placed on the review of studies and the appropriate use of statistical tests in the quantifying the resultant data. Issue 28: Some respondents said that the BLM has already addressed protection of the desert tortoise in the Western Mojave Coordinated Management Plan and other management plans previously approved and implemented under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Further protection is not necessary. Service Response: The Western Mojave Coordinated Management Plan is still in the planning stages and, therefore, does not yet afford the desert tortoise any protection. Upon its finalization and implementation, the Service may reevaluate the critical habitat designation. Issue 29: One respondent said that the Service, as a government agency, has an obligation to the general public it serves to consider its actions that, in conjunction with the proposed rule, will affect all of the public, including those that engage in OHV recreation. There are no areas to which these activities can be relocated or restricted. Service Response: Protection measures were implemented by the BLM in 1988 through its Rangewide Plan to reduce OHV use throughout the range of the desert tortoise in category I and II habitats. As stated in the Draft Economic Impact Analysis, in its off-highway users guide, California listed 24 OHV recreational areas managed by Federal, State, and other agencies in Imperial, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. Four sites in the guide lie just outside proposed CHUs. Critical habitat designation as proposed will not affect OHV use at these four sites. The other three States also offer areas for use by OHV enthusiasts. Issue 30: One letter stated that hiking, camping, and birdwatching are listed in the proposed rule as examples of non-consumptive uses. All of these activities necessitate a vehicle, in most instances off of a paved road, therefore, acting as OHVs. Also, OHV activities are not ``commercial,'' but rather ``recreational.'' The Service should reevaluate this classification. Service Response: Any use of vehicles off of designated roads and trails, for whatever the reason, can negatively impact the desert ecosystem. The Service is not singling out organized OHV user groups in this assessment. However, the actions of hiking, camping, and birdwatching, provided they do not involve use of vehicles off of designated roads and trails, are not likely to adversely modify critical habitat. The Service recognizes that most recreational activity is not commercial. However, most OHV races involve profits for the promoters, which is considered a commercial enterprise. Issue 31: Many respondents were concerned that designation of critical habitat would restrict all motorized access into these areas. Some stated that OHV recreation and desert tortoise protection are not mutually exclusive.
