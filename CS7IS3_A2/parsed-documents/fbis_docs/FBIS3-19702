The moderate satisfaction with the expansion, however, covered up a distrust between the 12, which has now erupted in several instances. It may be that, with another attempt this Tuesday [22 March], the foreign ministers will be able to settle the controversy with Great Britain and Spain regarding the blocking minority for votes in the Council. This would not change the fact that, above all, the British position was aimed at paralyzing the decisionmaking procedures in the expanded European Union and is thus once again an expression of continuing hostility toward integration. It may also be that the acting Council president, Greek European Affairs Minister Pangalos, primarily thought of his country's own interests when he called the planned expansion precipitate. In any case, the quarrel over the voting procedures has proved those right -- including the Brussels Commission in the past -- who wanted to link this necessary step with a further reform of the EU institutions. The relationship between the size of the European Union and its politically, urgently necessary ability to act remains unclear with a view to the future. Because of unclear motives, London wants expansion at all cost, while, at the same time, weakening the European Union. Paris is still looking for composure in view of German unification and the shifting of the European balance toward the northeast, which goes hand in hand with expansion and subsequent accessions. In Bonn, the next expansion of the European Union to Central and East Europe is being pursued, at least verbally, with every ounce of strength. At the same time, however, there are more or less open demands on the partners to ease the burden on Germany as a net payer, but without any idea who is supposed to pay for the costs of a speedy expansion toward the east, which are threatening in the long run. In this difficult situation and in view of understandable sensitivity on the French side, German foreign policy headed by Klaus Kinkel does not have any better idea than to play it tough at the European level. No matter which statements were really made in detail and led to the diplomatic conflict in Bonn last week: Observers of the negotiations in Brussels have long felt this tone, which expresses self-confidence not through calmness, mastery, and sensitivity but through obvious loudness. The expansion of the European Union makes the considerations about its ability to function, which have been postponed until 1996 by the Maastricht Treaty, all the more urgent. In particular, because political coincidence has shifted the weights in the European Union, intensive cooperation between Germany and France is playing an even greater role. One should not carelessly gamble away the existing capital.
