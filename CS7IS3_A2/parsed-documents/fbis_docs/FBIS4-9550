Manoel de Almeida, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the convoys had been suspended on security grounds. Serb forces face a 0001 GMT deadline to pull their heavy weapons away from Gorazde or face NATO air strikes. All active convoys in the war-torn former Yugoslav republic returned to their bases by mid-afternoon Tuesday in line with the directive, which the spokesman described as a "completely normal procedure." De Almeida said an aid convoy which left Belgrade Tuesday morning for the battered eastern Bosnian enclave of Goradze -- the third to set out for the town -- returned to the Serbian capital later in the day after being blocked by Serbian forces at the border. An earlier convoy from Belgrade which had been blocked by Serb forces arrived Tuesday morning in Gorazde, said the UNHCR's spokesman in Serbia, Lyndall Sachs. The first convoy to reach Gorazde after Bosnian Serb forces eased a three-week siege of the town arrived there Sunday.
