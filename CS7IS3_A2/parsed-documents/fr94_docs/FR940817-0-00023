FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jennifer M. Abramson, (215) 597&hyph;2923. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Implementation of the provisions the CAA will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program, and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. On October 22, 1993, the District of Columbia submitted a formal revision to its SIP. The SIP revision consists of a plan for establishing a PROGRAM. In order to gain full approval, the District's submittal must provide for each of the following program elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a District Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The plan must include the duties, funding, and schedule of implementation for the three program components. The plan must also determine the eligibility of small business stationary sources for assistance in the program. The District's plan for the establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) and Ombudsman was adopted and will be implemented pursuant to the authority vested in the Mayor by section 422(6) of the District of Columbia Self Government and Governmental Reorganization Act of 1973, as amended (1992), D.C. Code sections 1&hyph;242 (6), (11) and (12), 6&hyph;901, 6&hyph;902 and 6&hyph;903. The creation and administration of the Compliance Advisory Panel will be accomplished by Mayoral order. Milestones for implementing the essential elements of the District's PROGRAM are included as part of the SIP revision submittal. The District has committed to establishing a SBAP, administered by the Air Resources Management Division of the Environmental Regulation Administration, by September 1, 1993. In January, 1994 the District appointed a small business representative to coordinate SBAP activities. Eligibility for assistance under the SBAP will be determined by the criteria outlined in the PROGRAM submittal. Full SBAP implementation will begin no later than November 15, 1994. The District has committed to establishing an Ombudsman's office, to be located in the Office of the Administrator of the Environmental Regulation Administration, by September 1, 1993. The Ombudsman will complete the first annual review of the SBAP by November 15, 1994. A Mayoral Order establishing the creation and administration of the Compliance Advisory Panel was issued on November 3, 1992. The District has committed to convening its CAP by June 1, 1993. The CAP will submit its first annual report to EPA by November 15, 1994. II. Analysis of SIP Revision Section 507(a) of the CAA sets forth seven requirements that the District must meet to have an approvable SBAP. Six of the requirements will be discussed in this section of this document, while the seventh requirement, establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman, will be discussed in the next section. 1. Small Business Assistance Program The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the CAA. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The District has met these requirements by establishing a SBAP, administered by the District of Columbia Air Resources Management Division (ARMD). The ARMD SBAP has the responsibility of collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and acceptable control technologies for small business stationary sources. The ARMD will also work closely with the Office of Emergency Preparedness and other District organizations in coordinating information exchange regarding alternative technologies, process changes, products and other methods of pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection. The dissemination of SBAP information shall take two forms. Technical and compliance information will be disseminated to small businesses in a proactive manner via press releases, brochures and other media as necessary. Additionally, ``outreach'' programs such as conferences or meetings with Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, small businesses, and/or trade associations, etc. may be utilized. The SBAP will also disseminate information in a reactive manner via an established telephone hotline and information clearinghouse which will be capable of handling inquires from the small business community. The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the CAA in a timely and efficient manner. The SBAP will work closely with the staff of the ARMD Engineering and Planning Branch and Compliance and Enforcement Branch to help sources identify applicable requirements and obtain permits. Specifically, the SBAP will be responsible for providing advice and assistance to small businesses in the interpretation of regulatory requirements, explaining permitting procedures and providing information regarding fees, when and where to apply, the length of time necessary to receive a permit, etc. Additional responsibilities include helping small businesses determine if they qualify for reduced fees under the waiver provisions of the title V Operating Permit Program. The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the CAA in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the CAA. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option of the state, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the CAA. The SBAP is responsible for notifying eligible sources of their statutory and regulatory rights and obligations under the Clean Air Act in a timely fashion. Such communication will include explaining fine and permit policies, the consequences of operating in violation of regulations, and appeal procedures. In addition, the District's SBAP will administer an audit program which provides technical assistance on pollution prevention or control options. Environmental professionals from the Compliance and Enforcement Branch and the Engineering and Planning Branch of the ARMD are to serve as auditors for the program. The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practices or compliance methods preceding any applicable compliance date. The SBAP will meet this requirement by developing procedures, in accordance with section 507(a)(7) of the CAA, for handling requests from small businesses for modifications of work practices or alternative air pollution control methods. The District has committed to establishing such procedures by November 15, 1994. An ARMD program analyst, authorized to report directly to the Program Manager of the Air Resources Management Division, is responsible for the development and initiation of SBAP programs. As SBAP programs are developed, additional staff will be hired as required. The SBAP will be funded by District of Columbia and/or Federal air pollution control grant funds until the effective date of implementation of the District's title V Operating Permits Program. After the effective date, the District's SBAP will be funded by District of Columbia funds appropriated from the revenues generated by fees required by the title V Operating Permits Program. 2. Ombudsman Office The seventh requirement of section 507(a)(3) is the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources in connection with the implementation of the CAA. The District's Ombudsman will work in the Office of the Administrator of the Environmental Regulation Administration as a member of the Administrator's staff. Consequently, the Ombudsman will be in an effective position to represent the views and interests of the small business community on issues concerning the implementation of the CAA. The Ombudsman will have direct access to the Program Manager of the ARMD and his/her superior, the Administrator. In this position, the Ombudsman can easily evaluate the District's SBAP, investigate and resolve disputes between businesses and air pollution control authorities, develop and propose legislation, and actively promote the small business point-of-view. The Ombudsman will also have access to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, the Office of the Corporation Counsel, and the Office of the Mayor. A listing of the Ombudsman's duties indicate that it will be readily accessible to small businesses and, on their behalf, be authorized to provide reports to and to communicate with appropriate personnel. The Ombudsman will also distribute the District's CAP reports and advisory opinions and provide administrative support to the CAP. The District has committed to hiring a program analyst to serve as the Small Business Ombudsman. Additional staff for the Office of the Ombudsman will be recruited as necessary. The Ombudsman will be funded with District of Columbia appropriated funds. After the effective date of the District's title V Operating Permits Program, the Ombudsman and his or her staff may be funded by appropriations from revenues of the District's title V Operating Permits Program. 3. Compliance Advisory Panel Section 507(e) of the CAA requires each state to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel that includes two members selected by the Governor (or equivalent) who are not owners or representatives of owners of small business stationary sources; four members selected by the state legislature (or equivalent) who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the air pollution permit program. The District has committed to creating a compliance advisory panel. The composition of the District's CAP is in accordance with the method of selection required by section 507(e)(2) of the CAA for a unicameral legislature. All CAP members, with the exception of the representative of the Air Resources Management Division, a District of Columbia employee, will be unpaid appointees. In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates certain responsibilities of the panel. A description of the duties and authorities delegated to the District's Compliance Advisory Panel indicates that it will be responsible for all activities required by section 507(e). These activities include rendering advisory opinions on the effectiveness of the small business ombudsman and SBAP and preparing periodic reports to EPA concerning the effectiveness of the PROGRAM following the intent of the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the Equal Access to Justice Act. The CAP will also be responsible for reviewing information disseminated to small business stationary sources to assure such information is understandable to laypersons. 4. Source Eligibility Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that: (A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; (B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; (C) Is not a major stationary source; (D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and (E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. The District's program definition of the term ``small business stationary source'' is identical to the statutory definition found in section 507(c). All small business stationary sources located in the District shall be eligible to receive assistance from the SBAP. Any source which does not meet the criteria in (C), (D), and (E) above but does not emit more than 100 tons per year of all regulated pollutants may petition the District of Columbia to be included in the SBAP. The District may, after public notice and opportunity for public comment, permit such a source to participate in the SBAP even though the source does not meet the criteria given above. III. Summary of SIP Revision The District has submitted a SIP revision which fully implements each of the program elements required by CAA section 507. As previously stated, the District has committed to fully implementing its SBAP, administered by the Air Resources Management Division of the Environmental Regulation Administration, by November 15, 1994. The District's Ombudsman, located in the Office of the Administrator of the Environmental Regulation Administration, shall complete its first annual review of the SBAP, by November 15, 1994. The District's CAP, authorized by Mayoral Order, shall complete its first annual review of the SBAP and Ombudsman and submit it to EPA by November 15, 1994. In this action, EPA is approving the SIP revision submittal by the District of Columbia. Accordingly, §52.510 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart J&hyph;District of Columbia to reflect EPA's approval action and the fact that it is considered part of the District of Columbia SIP. EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will become effective October 17, 1994 unless, within 30 days of publication, adverse or critical comments are received. If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on October 17, 1994. Final Action EPA is approving the District of Columbia's plan for the establishment of a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. Accordingly, §52.510 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart J&hyph;District of Columbia to reflect EPA's approval action. EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved state implementation plan for conformance with the CAA including section 507 and section 110(a)(2)(E). Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. By this action, EPA is approving a state program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the state. Therefore, because EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
