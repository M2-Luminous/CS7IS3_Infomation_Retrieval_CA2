The armed forces are least prepared for these tasks at present, Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said today after the cabinet approved the Bundeswehr 1994 White Paper in Bonn. Germany needs a minimum contigent "of available, quickly deployable and transferable crisis reaction forces with a high degree of professionalism," which were capable of multinational cooperation. At the same time the armed forces for national defense should be "scaled down both in numbers and in their readiness for deployment and be made more responsive to mobilization." According to Ruehe, nothing will be changed with regard to conscription. It remains a constituent element of the Bundeswehr.
