De Leon's arrival, initially scheduled to be at 17:30 local time, was delayed for two hours, causing the suspension of a pre-announced news conference. Presidency spokesman Felix Loarca indicated the president's delay was due to a last-minute meeting he had before leaving El Salvador. Nothing bad happened, he was delayed because of the meeting and that is why we canceled the news conference, Loarca stressed. According to Loarca, during de Leon's visit to El Salvador, the Central American presidents held meetings in which they discussed topics related to the upcoming Ibero-American Summit to be held in Cartagena, Colombia. We have confirmed that President de Leon will attend the Ibero-American Summit. At the summit, the initiative for the Alliance for Sustained Development will be discussed. The Central American presidents are expected to present this initiative jointly, he added. Meanwhile, Loarca noted that de Leon Carpio will host today a dinner in honor of Taiwan's Prime Minister Lien Chan. Chan has been visiting the country since yesterday afternoon.
