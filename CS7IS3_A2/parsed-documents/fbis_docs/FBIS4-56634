Kraiselburd, who is an Argentine citizen, and with other members of the IAPA executive board. The IAPA representatives reiterated to Frei their rejection of the requirement that every journalist have a university degree to be able to practice journalism in Chile. The requirement is included in the new press law proposal the executive branch has submitted to Congress. IAPA, which represents owners of 1,300 print media organizations in the continent, has repeatedly criticized the above requirement through resolutions issued during its assemblies. Kraiselburd handed Frei a copy of the Chapultepec Declaration, which outlines the IAPA position on freedom of expression adopted in a continental meeting held recently in Mexico. Attending the meeting with Frei were IAPA directors Andres Garcia Lavin of Mexico, Roberto Pulido of Chile, Danilo Arbilla of Uruguay, Oliver Clark of Jamaica, and IAPA executive director Julio E. Munoz. The IAPA directors are attending an international seminar on "Development of Mass Media and Democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean." It opened in Santiago on 2 May and is scheduled to conclude on 6 May.
