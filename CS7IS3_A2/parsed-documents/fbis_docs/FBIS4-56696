FBIS4-56696 "drlat089_r_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-089 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 Peru Legal Institute Director Believes Army `Massacred' Peasants Legal Institute Director Believes Army `Massacred' Peasants PY0705025794 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 22 Apr 94 p A4 PY0705025794 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Text] The Human Rights Coordinating Board has requested that the Red Cross Organization verify reports of alleged murders in the area where the Army is attacking the so-called "Popular Guerrilla Army," the armed branch of the Shining Path [SL], which is comprised of some 250 men armed with North Korean AKM rifles. The Human Rights Coordinating Board, however, disclosed information according to which Army troops had allegedly murdered innocent people with no clash having taken place, but Rosa Mujica, board president, admitted that they lack information on the exact number of victims. The Coordinating Board nevertheless demanded that the military offensive be suspended. EXPRESO yesterday interviewed Ernesto de La Jara, president of the Institute for Legal Defense, who went to the zone where the alleged massacre took place. [EXPRESO] What did you see? [De La Jara] I spoke to many locals. Even we were surprised. An incredible number of civilians have been massacred in a zone where there are no Shining Path members. We received the direct testimony of terrified people, who had managed to get away after many days. I have no political interest. We couldn't believe what they told us, we couldn't understand why this had happened. [EXPRESO] Do you mean to say that the SL is not in that area? [De La Jara] The SL is not in the zone where these people were massacred, that is, on the left margin of the Huallaga River, in front of Anda and Aucayacu, in the villages of Moena and Moyuna. The SL is further inland. The people are terrified of the SL. They want them to be completely wiped out. They say: "Go in and kill the SL members, but not us." Many people do not even belong to the zone; they come for the harvest season and leave. [EXPRESO] Why would the Army attack a zone where there are no SL members? [De La Jara] The head of the political-military front believes that all the people of that zone belong to the SL, because the SL has been through there many times. It is as if businessmen who have paid protection fees were members of the SL. We are talking about humble people with no resources... [EXPRESO] Where have you been? [De La Jara] We tried to enter the zone, but were not allowed to do so. But a priest, Father Gilberto Hume, did... [EXPRESO] But who warned you? [De La Jara] The people of the zone who managed to get away and come to Lima, people from the church. The bishop of Artales, Huanuco, has agreed to go now... [EXPRESO] Don't you think the SL itself got you to go to the zone? [De La Jara] The SL has been defeated; it is not capable of that. It is a matter of going to the zone to see and hear what the people have to say. Several witnesses have talked about 40 or 50 people. Others say more... [EXPRESO] But there might be SL members, there might have been a battle. [De La Jara] But there have been no clashes... [EXPRESO] How do you know? [De La Jara] The witnesses, the peasants said so. They say that first they appeared with helicopters and machine guns. Later on, Army troops destroyed and burned the huts. Those who managed to get away by hiding were the ones who told us what had happened. [EXPRESO] But it might have been SL members or people handled by the SL. [De La Jara] It is a question of seeing and listening to them. They are humble people, in tears, terrified. They would have to have been very good actors. [EXPRESO] The nucleus of the Popular Guerrilla Army is supposed to be there. [De La Jara] Further inland, at a great distance. In a completely different zone... [EXPRESO] They might have gone through that zone. What makes no sense is that the Army should have gone in to kill just for fun. [De La Jara] I repeat, there have been no clashes. They were machine-gunned from helicopters. The plan was to kill everyone in the zone. We have the testimony of a great number of witnesses... Moreover, the way they kill people is atrocious, and this was said by several people: They rip babies out of pregnant women, they let people bleed to death, autopsies have been practiced. We do not even want an investigation. We want the operation to end. We have a copy of the testimony before the Huanuco prosecutor's office of a woman explaining how they killed her husband and eight peasants in front of her, and how eight members of the patrol raped her and 10 raped a 13-year-old girl. It is terrifying, unexplainable.
