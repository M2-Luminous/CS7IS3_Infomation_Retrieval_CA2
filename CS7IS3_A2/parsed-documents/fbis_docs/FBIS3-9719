[Oleksy] This is a statement by one of the SLD activists, which is neither the stand of the club nor the stand taken by the party. This is a complex statement in the background of recent events. Now these events are very bad. The fact that the president refused to sign the candidacy of Professor Rosati, even though the coalition was fully convinced about the values of this candidacy, must be politically significant. [Rybus] In the commentary of the Saturday [26 March] issue of TRYBUNA appeared such expressions as "political vengeance" and "panic" of a president that is losing power. Are these acute expressions the foretaste of a confrontation with the Belweder? [Oleksy] I do not know. You are asking me about a confrontation of the left with the president. However, it was the president who made this decision. [Rybus] Commentators who evaluate the issue of Rosati's nomination point at the possibility of Prime Minister Pawlak's participation in this game. [Oleksy] I do not suspect the prime minister of making any secret moves like that, because, as I understand, this is what you mean. The prime minister did delay forwarding the motion, which surprised the SLD; however, a serious decision was being made, and it is difficult to quarrel over days and hours. The fact is that the prime minister submitted the motion, which the president refused to sign. He took advantage of his constitutional powers. Now the analysis of the case can only be political. One has to ask the following question: What purpose does such a decision by the president serve? I am afraid that it does not serve the purpose of putting our economic life in order. Nor does it serve the signals that go from us abroad, where Prof. Rosati is a well-known individual. [Rybus] The points in the Rosati game will probably not be scored by the SLD. Now the question remains who will gain more: the Belweder or Prime Minister Pawlak? [Oleksy] These are speculations that the Sejm speaker should not really make.... [Rybus] How about the deputy chairman of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic? [Oleksy] The issue is not about who has gained and who has lost. If such a count were to be kept, this would have to mean another phase in the lack of agreement between the activities of the state's highest organs in issues important to the state. And I deplore this. [Rybus] Can the events of the recent days begin the process of disintegration of the coalition? [Oleksy] I do not think so, and I would oppose it. [Rybus] How will this dispute end, now that the president has declared, through his spokesman, that a change in this decision is out of the question? [Oleksy] The end is unclear. I am not able to imagine it at the moment because I am afraid that there may appear elements of emotion and prestige that will obscure the heart of the matter. I would not like this to happen. I believe that appropriate coalition bodies, as well as organs of the individual coalition members, will convene and make a political evaluation of the situation.
