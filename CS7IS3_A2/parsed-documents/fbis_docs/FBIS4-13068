Informed sources believe the military escalation by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad has increased the popularity of Palestinian opposition to the Oslo accord in general. The sources told AL-HAYAH the increase in the popularity of any faction is not in the interest of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces (the 10 factions) as an alliance. Rather, it is in the interest of some factions, especially the factions that took practical steps and did not confine their opposition to slogans and rhetoric. The sources point out that the 'Afula, Ashdod, and Hadera operations carried out by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, which are part of the alliance, have revitalized the two factions only and not the entire alliance. The alliance as a whole has so far failed to come up with any concrete plans. In fact, ideological differences relating to views and objectives have been apparent in practice and bolstered each faction's separate view of the Palestine question and its endeavor to achieve its factional objectives. At any rate, the sources continue, the recent military actions have somewhat enhanced the image of the opposition and improved its situation, having reached a different stage in the recent months when Palestinian negotiators were conducting negotiations in Cairo about the stages of the administrative self-rule and making steps in this direction, regardless of the nature of these steps and agreement or disagreement with them. The sources say the autonomy negotiations on the one hand and the opposition's inaction on the other have given rise to a third current in the recent four months that followed the signing of the Oslo accord. This third current rejects both attitudes. Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement, told AL-HAYAH "those who were misled and thought we could do nothing are mistaken. We can strike hard. This is our practical choice in the current stage. When the movement carried out the Ashdod operation, the people regained confidence in us and in our ability to stage confrontation. We proved that we are not helpless. Therefore, the battle with the occupation will continue." He added that after six months of the Oslo accord, the Palestinian man in the street has become bored of rhetoric that does not do anything. However, the situation is now different.
