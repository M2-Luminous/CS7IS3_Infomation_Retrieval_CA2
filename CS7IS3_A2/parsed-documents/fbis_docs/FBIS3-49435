"Without a prompt resolution of the Kosova problem and without an end to the abrogation of all human, civil, and national rights of the Albanians in Kosova, the Balkans will ultimately face the serious possibility of a devastating conflict which would not only obstruct the new NATO Partnership for Peace initiative, but would also affect the present structure of NATO itself," says the letter, asking NATO use its influence to: redeploy international human rights monitors to Kosova; send peacekeeping forces to the region; keep international pressure on Serbia; and bring the perpetrators of crimes against humanity to justice. This letter together with a statement of the Kosova prime minister elaborating the need for action on Kosova were sent to all NATO-member heads of governments in Brussels. Dr. Bujar Bukoshi said in the statement that "without a just solution to the Kosova problem, there can be no comprehensive settlement of the brutally aggressive Balkan conflict," adding that unless it is addressed as an international problem, it will "lead inevitably to an international conflict which will demand international action." Prime minister Bukoshi offers a comprehensive account of the deteriorating situation in Kosova following the expulsion of Serbia of the CSCE mission to Kosova. In face of the alarming situation in Kosova, prime minister Bukoshi urges NATO summit to consider four specific actions to address the problem "realistically and effectively." One is the redeployment of the international human rights monitors to Kosova, in compliance with the UN Security Council's resolution adopted last August. Second, Kosova prime minister asks for UN or NATO peacekeeping forces to be deployed in Kosova in order to avoid a massive bloodshed in face of the heavy Serbian military, paramilitary, and police build-up. Third, Dr. Bukoshi maintains that the "economic sanctions against Serbia must be kept in place," although as he says, "the people of Kosova suffer on two counts" from sanctions imposed on Kosova by Serbia itself and the international sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.

"Prompt and decisive action by the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal will do much to teach the criminal aggressors that such gross crimes against humanity will not go unpunished," says Dr. Bukoshi in his today's statement, adding that "failed policies of the past are no excuse for the failure to act in the present. The means to avert a Kosova calamity are clear. All that remains in the will of NATO and the international community to act."
