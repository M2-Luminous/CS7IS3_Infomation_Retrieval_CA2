Plumes of smoke billowed into the air after warplanes swooped over the Iqlim al-Tuffah ridge east of the port of Sidon, firing missiles and dropping several delayed action and cluster bombs, the sources said. One Hizballah guerrilla was killed and two others were wounded in the raids, they said. A spokesman for Hizballah in Beirut said earlier there were no casualties in the attacks, which coincided with the resumption in Washington of Arab-Israeli peace talks. In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman confirmed the raid saying all aircraft returned safely to base. "All the targets, which were in a zone entirely controlled by the Hizballah, were destroyed," he said. The Hizballah positions were used for training and launching attacks on Israeli targets, he added. The raids came three days after Hizballah's secretary general Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah warned his group would step up attacks against Israel in south Lebanon. The Iranian-backed movement killed four Israeli soldiers and wounded five others on February 7 in the bloodiest attack since August, triggering Israeli air strikes and artillery attacks and threats of further reprisals. Israel has lost 30 soldiers in Lebanon since January 1993. In Tuesday's raids two warplanes fired missiles on al-Luwayzah, a Hizballah stronghold in the Iqlim al-Tuffah, and minutes later, warplanes struck again at Hizballah hideouts in nearby Jarju'. A Hizballah source in the port of Tyre said guerrillas fired four shoulder-launched SAM-7 missiles at the planes. A security source said up to seven missiles were fired at the aircraft.
