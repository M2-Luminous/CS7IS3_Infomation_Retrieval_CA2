FR940207-2-00070 FR940207-2-00028 Comment: Western should reduce the projected expenditures for the period May 1993 through September 1993 to correspond to the average of previous years. Response: Western has changed the PRS to show the most current purchased power expense for FY 1993, which reflects the flow restrictions last year. This purchased power expense has been reduced to $5 million in FY 1993 as compared to the $6.5 million previously shown in the addendum to the May 1992 customer brochure dated June 1993. Comment: Please extend the schedule for repayment of capitalized purchased power costs and use this tactic, along with other adjustments to FY 1994 and FY 1995, to reduce step one for P-DP purchased power costs. Response: Western has determined through analyzing the PRS that the repayment schedule of the capitalized purchased power cost, which is a loan to meet annual expenses, is not setting the step-one rate. The step-one rate is being set by interest expense in FY 1995. If repayment is deferred, the interest expense actually increases. The PRS is designed to pay interest expense before it repays any loans. Western believes the Ratesetting PRS solves for the lowest rate possible in both steps and is in accordance with sound business principles. Comment: Western should reexamine the projections for purchased power made during the period of January through March and in September. Many of Western's customers that serve primarily agricultural loads will have reduced loads during these periods. Western has previously facilitated exchanges in such situations to reduce the need for purchased power. Response: Western is willing to work with the customers in resource planning initiatives and realizes the importance to mitigate purchased power. Western has attempted to use resource integration by exchanging energy efficiently to support customer loads. However, this would only reduce purchased power expense if a majority of the P-DP customers could derive load profiles that matched river regulation restrictions. Comment: Western should project some level of nonfirm sales in the upcoming years based on historic water demand and projected water supply figures from Reclamation. A prudent projection of those revenues, including revenues that will be available from mothballing the Yuma desalter, should be projected. Response: In the Ratesetting PRS, nonfirm sales are projected based on a historical average of revenue earned from nonfirm sales. Currently, Western is unsure how the mothballing of the Yuma desalter will impact revenues, energy, and transmission. Future decisions will be reflected in future rate actions. Comment: Customers would be better served if the P-DP contracts were amended to provide an option to the contractors for Western to purchase firming energy on the contractor's behalf, or for Western to provide only the energy generated by the P-DP project itself. Response: The Phoenix Area is receptive to meeting with the customers to discuss possible options. Western believes, however, that any course of action chosen should be in the best interest of all parties and should be as easy to implement as possible in order to minimize the costs of administration. Working Committee Comment: Western should cooperate in the formation of a process to allow customer review and input to Western's work plans projected 5 to 10 years in the future for O&M, replacements, and additions at an early enough stage of the planning cycle to have an impact. The creation of an Engineering and Oversight Committee would provide for a safeguard against overcollection, inflated estimates of projected expenditures, an organized dialogue with its customers, and prevent the reoccurrence of past overspending in the future. Comment: Western should support a customer and agency working committee. Included in the working committee should be objectives and criteria that relate to balancing the goal of safe and reliable operations with the goal of cost containment and other economic efficiencies. A year ago, the Arizona Power Authority endorsed a proposal to create and empower a P-DP Engineering and Oversight Committee as the structure and process for working toward price stability. Since then, with customer involvement, Western has started two programs that provide promise for working toward the price stability goal_the Engineering Ten-Year Plan and the transmission planning system.
