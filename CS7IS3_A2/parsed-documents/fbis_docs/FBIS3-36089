The proposal on holding the referendum March 27 was earlier advanced by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Speaking in parliament on Wednesday morning, Plyushch said that the constitutional law on power should be adopted by parliament. According to the draft law that is to be debated in parliament Thursday, the local executive power should be in the hands of the heads of locals councils who are to be elected. The institute of the president's representatives, Plyushch proposed, is to be annulled after the constitutional law comes into force.
