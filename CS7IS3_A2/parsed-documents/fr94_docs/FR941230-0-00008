FR941230-0-00008 FR941230-0-00002 Most enrollees who stop paying their premiums do so because they no longer need the coverage. In these cases, the current regulations allow the agency to terminate the enrollment as early as 15 days after the enrollee received the nonreceipt notice, but there is no real benefit to the enrollee, who no longer wants the coverage. For other enrollees, a missed payment does not reflect an intent to stop paying the premiums. They may have overlooked making the payment or their payment may have been lost in the mail. In these cases, the nonpayment notice serves as a reminder or lets them know that their check was lost. If they do not receive the nonpayment notice, their intent to continue their coverage will be shown when they make the following month's payment. In addition, there has been a high incidence of late receipt of payment, with the result that nonreceipt notices cross in the mail with the incoming check. In these cases, the return receipt notices serve neither as a benefit to the enrollee nor as a means of allowing prompt termination of an enrollment. Another group of enrollees stop making their payments because of the cost or out of neglect. Such enrollees generally continue to miss payments until their enrollment terminates retroactively. Some of them then find they need medical services, but they have no health coverage. Some continued to obtain medical services even though they were not paying their premiums and their carriers are now asking for repayment of claims paid or payment for services rendered. When this happens, the enrollee may ask to have their coverage reinstated. They may have their coverage reinstated if they can show that they were prevented from paying their premiums on time due to a cause beyond their control. Under current regulations, if the agency does not receive the signed return receipt, it must wait 60 to 90 days before terminating the enrollment. Under the interim regulations, agencies must, in all cases, wait 60 to 90 days before terminating the enrollment. This means that the enrollee must miss two or three more payments before the agency can act to terminate. While it is possible that a single instance of nonreceipt of the payment represents a check lost in the mail, it is unlikely that three or four consecutive payments would be similarly lost. Therefore, instead of allowing termination based on a single instance of nonpayment, the interim regulations allow termination only if there is a sequence of missing payments. A former enrollee who wants to have an enrollment reinstated after it has been terminated for nonpayment must show that the nonpayment was due to a cause beyond his or her control. If the former enrollee did not receive the notice and can show that the sequence of missing payments was due to a cause beyond his or her control, the employing agency can allow the reinstatement upon payment of all premiums due. Causes beyond an enrollee's control include physical or mental incapacity; disasters such as floods, hurricanes or fires; or circumstances causing the enrollee to be out of contact with his or her home for an extended period. Each request for reinstatement must be considered on its own merits. If the agency's initial decision is to deny the request, the agency must offer the enrollee the right to reconsideration of the initial decision at a higher level or by a different office than the one making the initial decision. The Department of Agriculture's National Finance Center (NFC) administers the TCC accounts and accounts of former spouses with qualifying court orders for most Federal agencies. NFC issues 2,500 to 3,000 nonpayment notices each month. Therefore, these interim regulations will result in annual savings of $60,000 to $70,000 for the NFC accounts alone. The interim regulations eliminate the requirement for sending the nonpayment notice by certified mail, return receipt requested. In addition, they clarify that there must be a delay of 60 days (90 days for overseas enrollees) before employing offices take action to terminate enrollments for nonpayment of premiums. These interim regulations do not address similar requirements in ยง890.502 related to employees on leave without pay and annuitants because that section is being revised and published separately. The revision will include the elimination of the requirement for certified mail, return receipt requested.
