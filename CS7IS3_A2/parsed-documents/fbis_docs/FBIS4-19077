Denktas assessed the statement Joe Clark, UN special envoy to Cyprus, made to reporters in New York. Denktas said that the benefits and rights promised to the Turkish Cypriot side in the first package have not yet been fulfilled, adding that the Turkish Cypriot side has been told that if it hands over Maras [Varosha] some of these promises will be kept. He said: This is most unreliable. Pointing out that the promises made to the Turkish Cypriot side should be kept, Denktas added that the changes made against the Turkish Cypriot side are not just details but substantial issues. He further pointed out that the promises made have been rescinded. Noting that the southern entrance to Maras should be kept under Turkish Cypriot control, Denktas said that this is an issue of vital importance for the Turkish Cypriots. He added that the UN secretary general's promise concerning this issue is not remembered by anyone but the Turkish Cypriot side. Pointing out that promises made on the Lefkosa [Nicosia] airport have also not been kept, Denktas said that this disrupts the equality but that no one seems to care. Denktas reiterated that the Turkish Cypriot side is in favor of continuing the proximity talks, adding that the talks have been ended because of Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis. He said: We are continuing our contacts with the UN officials. We will see what will happen in four weeks.
