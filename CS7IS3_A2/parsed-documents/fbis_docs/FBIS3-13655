In a statement to DPA broadcast yesterday, President Abu-'Ammar urged the Security Council to quickly adopt a resolution condemning the massacre, which claimed the lives of a number of Palestinian worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron. Brother Abu-'Ammar said providing security for the frightened and infuriated sons of the homeland in the occupied territories is more important than other issues. Brother President Abu-'Ammar described Israel's refusal to renegotiate the already signed agreements as an attempt to gain time. He added that the Israelis are playing tactical games and are not willing to provide anything tangible.
