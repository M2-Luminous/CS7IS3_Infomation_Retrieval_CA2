FR940930-0-00262 FR940930-0-00031 For proposed pre-foreclosure sales that ``fall through,'' or are sought without positive result, the mortgagee should file its claim under existing procedures for conveyance claims, and in compliance with any additional provisions which may be applicable to conveyance claims that follow a mortgagor's unsuccessful participation in the PFS procedure. Section 203.355 has been amended to include definitions of the ``end of participation'' in the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure, so mortgagees can calculate the appropriate timeframe within which they must initiate foreclosure or accept a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure where no actual pre-foreclosure sale has resulted. Other Changes A conforming amendment is also being made to ยง200.155(a). That section provides for the various methods by which a mortgagee may perfect a claim for the payment of mortgage insurance benefits. The case of a pre-foreclosure sale is being added to this list. Section 203.501 is being added to set forth the Department's policy that mortgagees must consider the financial consequences of their elective servicing action and that HUD expects mortgagees to take those appropriate actions which will generate the smallest financial loss to the Department. Other Matters Justification for Interim Rule and for the 45-day Comment Period The Department has determined that it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to have notice and public procedure before making the provisions of this interim rule effective, and that expeditious promulgation of this interim rule provides a benefit to all the parties involved. A successfully completed pre-foreclosure sale benefits the mortgagor, who avoids the stigma of foreclosure on his or her credit record, and also benefits HUD, which can expect to save by not paying foreclosure-related costs. HUD also saves on maintenance costs and marketing expenses for properties which would otherwise be conveyed to the Department following foreclosure. Mortgagees also benefit through incorporating this loss-mitigation technique into their overall loan servicing, by earning an additional administrative fee and by frequently being able to file claims for insurance benefits sooner, following a successful pre-foreclosure sale, than they would following a post-foreclosure conveyance claim. Because the requirements and procedures contained in this interim rule are based on the Pre-Foreclosure Sale Demonstration Program established by a notice published in the Federal Register on May 29, 1991, at 56 FR 24324, and because this interim rule takes into consideration the public comments received on that notice, the Department believes there is adequate justification for shortening the public comment period to 45 days. Sunset Provision The Department has adopted a policy of setting a date for expiration of an interim rule unless a final rule is published before that date. Therefore, this interim rule will expire on a date 18 months from the date of publication. Environmental Finding A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
