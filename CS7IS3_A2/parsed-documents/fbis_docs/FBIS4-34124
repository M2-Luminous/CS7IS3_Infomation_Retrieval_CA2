Now they are called "aliens," as if they are attempting to equate immigrants to the repulsive film monster, the lethal threat to humans, through evil semantic manipulation. It is not the fault of Hollywood director Riddley Scott, who intended to make money and provide fun to moviegoers when in 1979 he launched his film "Alien." He never insinuated a similarity between the immigrants and that repulsive gelatin-like creature that was willing to annihilate the human species. Anyway, what is certain is that starting some years ago the word "immigrant" has been used less and less in the United States when referring to a foreigner who arrives in that nation possibly attracted by the cliche words of Emma Lazarus written at the base of the Statue of Liberty: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free." Now, instead of being called "immigrants," they are called "aliens," with all the disdain contained in the semantic value of the word, which means "strange," "unrelated".... According to Victor Inzunza, director of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF, from its name in English) there is a "vicious evil" directed against immigrants in the United States. He added that "what I find more disquieting is the almost absolute lack of compassion and reasoning in the national debate on immigration." What has happened in this country where, according to what many experience, over 60 million immigrants of 120 ethnical backgrounds have molded the United States' national identity from the 1500's all the way to the present? A CBS Television Network poll, which was conducted in January of this year and whose results were disclosed 22 May, shows that 53 percent of those interviewed say immigrants cause problems, while 22 percent believe they should be deported back to their country of origin, especially those who arrived in the United States during the last five years. The rejection of these immigrants seem to have a racial tone because a majority of the 1,210 people interviewed associate immigrants with Latin America or Asia. This, perhaps, could be the reason why 43 percent agree with U.S. officials' introducing selective criterion into their immigration policy. This issue of "selectiveness" is not a new suggestion in dealing with immigration-related problems. Following the Los Angeles earthquake in January of this year, the controversial issue of whether or not illegal immigrants were entitled to public assistance was raised, as if to say the immigration status of an individual were enough to exclude him or her from receiving subsidies in the aftermath of such a tragedy. There are even those who have proposed worse solutions. One such individual is California Governor Peter Wilson, who supports denying medical and educational services in order to compensate the lack of federal subsidies to cover the public expenses that illegal immigrants create. Furthermore, he supports the idea of not granting U.S. citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. To prevent the "aliens" from doing away with the "noble" human race in the United States, Janet Reno, the enthusiastic U.S. attorney general, announced in February a $540 million program directed at virtually sealing off the Mexican border. Democratic Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming proposed a plan to cut back the number of legal immigrants allowed in the United States, estimated at over 675,000 per year. There are several very ill-intended proposals, such as that of Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, who presented a reform bill that would oblige education authorities to identify high school students who are unable to prove their legal status in the country and thus expose them to deportation. Rohrabacher's bill also included the suspension of federal funding for high schools that serve the illegal alien community, but a group of U.S. congressmen and women of Hispanic origin, led by Democrat Jose Serrano, was able to avert this anti-immigrant attempt for now. They were also successful in defeating a draft bill sponsored by Toby Roth, Republican representative for Wisconsin, which would have eliminated the $215 million budget earmarked this year for the bilingual education system, which mostly benefits the children of Latin American immigrants. "As a teacher and a Latin American, I believe it is an insult for people to propose ending bilingual education," according to Edwin Espaillant, vice president of the United Federation of New York Teachers, where 36 percent of the million students are Hispanic and where there are 67 bilingual education programs. Other measures include greater sanctions against people who employ undocumented individuals, more restrictions for work permits, and a charge of up to $170 to political asylum seekers, the number of whom according to federal statistics, surpassed 150,000 last year. "This policy is nothing more than part of the current move against immigrants that, in addition, has a deeply racist component, considering that most of them are from the so-called Third Word," according to Franklin Velazquez, policy director for New York's Immigrant Rights Center. The anti-immigrant offensive against "aliens" is mainly seen in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, where the greatest number of people from Latin America have arrived either legally or illegally. A Federal Census Bureau report issued in April forecasts that by the year 2020 the Latin population in the United States will surpass 51.2 million to become the country's largest minority group. Perhaps this could be one of the reasons for the anti-immigrant campaign, which in its offensive, includes a study by the Carrying Capacity Network [preceding name published in English] organization, which is led by Dr. Donald Huddle, an expert of the Economics Department of Rice University in Texas. The study blames "aliens" for the 914,000 people who were unemployed in California in 1992, with losses exceeding $42 billion. This is simply another flank attack by this trend. The extended use of words such as "aliens" or "illegal" not only serves to perversely deform the meaning of the word immigrant until it makes it sound as if it were a criminal, but it also to presents them as people from another world and greatly to blame for U.S. economic problems. Jesus Hernandez Cuellar, editor of the Metropolitan Section of LA OPINION newspaper in Los Angeles, believes that the hidden purpose of this cloaked xenophobia seems to be aimed at trying to "use foreigners as scapegoats for a problem that has its roots in administrative inefficiency and in the weight of the unsupportable government bureaucracy." Hernandez recalls that a study published in July 1992 by BUSINESS WEEK showed that immigrants in the United States comprise a labor force that surpasses 11 million people who pay more that $90 billion in taxes every year, much more than the $5 billion the government spends on social assistance to these same people. With more than 3 million undocumented foreigners in the United States, the authorities face a problem with considerable social and economic implications. "The authorities have every right to regulate and protect borders, as well as to try and restrict immigration, but they should act humanely and with compassion," Victor Inzunza of MALDEF [expansion unknown] said. "We, in the United States, speak of human rights violations, but is it not a violation to deny immigrants their human dignity?" asks Jose Serrano, leader of a group of U.S. congressmen of Hispanic origin. According to Izunza, U.S. authorities must understand that the most effective method against illegal immigration is to support the countries from which they come. "The government should concentrate on aiding these countries to enable their citizens to keep their families and not have to look for a new way of life in the United States." There should not be any arbitrary actions either, such as the so-called Cuban Adjustment Law, which because of ideological differences between Washington and Havana, legal and illegal Cuban immigrants receive preferential treatment over other foreigners such as Haitians and Central Americans. That law states that any Cuban immigrant who remains in the United States for more than one year may request and receive the work permit known as the "Green Card," a privilege that for Democrat Representative Alan Simpson is "absurd." The struggle against "aliens" also has its share of political opportunism.
