Swedlund is of the opinion that defense costs can be reduced and points out that the Russian threat is overestimated. Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck: [Bjoerck] I have not been engaged on anything else other than ensuring that the problems that the navy has with its finances is fixed. It is a good thing if you look after your own [word indistinct] before you start talking about savings elsewhere. [Soederberg] What do you mean? [Bjoerck] I mean that the Navy has been carrying a budget deficit year after year. It has cost a lot of money to fix this, and it is a good thing if one manages to keep to one's budget before one starts to talk about cuts, as Swedlund does, even though he says that they should be in the long term. [Soederberg] Sten Swedlund recently headed a naval visit to Russia. He was struck by the impression that the Russian Baltic Navy was way behind Swedish standards. Swedlund judges that a Russian invasion across the sea could not be carried out. In THE ECHO this morning, Swedlund said that the defense costs can be cut. [Swedlund] I think that it is quite natural in a society like the Swedish one, where we now clearly experience that there are significant economic problems, that the defense economy should also be discussed. [Soederberg] Sten Swedlund is chief of the coastal navy. Don't you think that his views should be taken seriously? [Bjoerck] Of course, but he has not voiced any such views to me and I have had many talks with him. They have rather been about the opposite, more resources, more money for submarine hunts, and other things. It is only since the commander in chief recently told Swedlund that the time had come to change jobs and began to negotiate with him about another post that Swedlund, now that he is apparently leaving, is voicing views like this. [Soederberg] But if highly placed military officials are not averse to cuts in the defense budget, how come that you are? [Bjoerck] Swedlund is not at all representative of what Swedish military officials think in this respect. Now that the time has come for him to leave, he suddenly goes out to express his views on the operations he led in the past.
