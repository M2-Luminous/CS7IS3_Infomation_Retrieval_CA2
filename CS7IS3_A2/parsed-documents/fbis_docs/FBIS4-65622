This gigantic mountain of debts is, however, classified as "acceptable" in various comments, because it is a sum that amounts to "only" about 67 percent of the annual GNP -- "no fear of debts," because there exists a high amount of monetary and fixed assets of private persons (about DM9.5 trillion) and of companies and the state (about DM6 trillion). However, the state debts are, by far, not the total debts of the FRG. How much are they? For decades, the FRG has engaged in an enormous policy of incurring debts, above all on the part of the governments. By 1993, a gigantic mountain of debts of about DM6.5 trillion (after deducting potential double counting) had accumulated. How did it come about? The mountain includes the above-mentioned debts of the state,in particular of the federal government of about DM700 billion, the western German laender of about DM380 billion, and the communities of about DM150 billion. The supplementary budgets also had high debts, e.g. the railroads of about DM53 billion and the post of about DM98 billion. The "successful work" of the Trust Agency has so far added a deficit of about DM150 billion. Debts of about DM180 billion have been incurred for the Unity Fund and the Loan Payment Fund. European Recovery Program loans amount to DM28 billion. For the eastern laender and the eastern communities, about DM45 billion in debts developed just over the three years of anschluss policy. This already adds up to about DM1.8 trillion in state debts for 1993. In addition, there are debts of companies, self-employed people, farmers, etc. These debts are considered to be "normal" in the market economy and are, therefore, mostly excluded from the overall picture. Quite contrary are the statements on the former GDR, where all "debts" (including those of the companies) are always mentioned. By the third quarter of 1993, the western German banks had issued leans of about DM4.9 trillion -- DM3.8 trillion to domestic nonbanks. Of these enormous loans about DM1.8 trillion, for instance, went to companies and DM1.1 trillion to housing construction. Savings and loan associations issued loans of DM160 billion and insurance companies about DM450 billion. This was not enough, however. In the FRG there are also the so-called commercial loans (debts of companies among each other without a bank) and acceptance credits, which add up to about DM700 to DM800 billion. This adds up to the total debts, which set off the assets. Even though comparisons with the GDR are currently officially taboo -- unless one runs this country down -- it is permissible to mention the GDR debts. In this, one has to take into account that in the GDR there were only direct bank loans (no commercial loans, securities, capital markets). Calculated in German marks, the loans in the GDR amounted to about DM220 billion in 1989. These were about 70 percent of the GDR GNP -- calculated in German marks and assessed at relatively low values -- in this year. In the FRG the proportion of overall domestic debts compared with the GNP in 1989 was 217 percent. A harsh verdict in terms of monetary policy! Regarding the debts of the state (budget including bezirks and communities), in 1989 the GDR had about DM7 billion in investment loans for institutions in the cultural-social area, but basically no current loans. In contrast, the balance sheet even showed positive sums -- e.g. about DM90 billion from foreign trade direction coefficients. When, in 1990, loans of about DM28 billion were raised on the eve of unification, this was due to the political situation in this year. In contrast to the FRG, the GDR had about DM20 billion debts abroad, which were relatively low by international standards but are mentioned as particularly negative nowadays. What does this all mean for the citizen? Statistically, in 1989, the overall debts per capita of the inhabitants in the FRG was about DM75,000 and in the GDR DM13,700. This includes debts for housing in the FRG of about DM15,000 and in the GDR of about DM2,800. Particularly important for everyone, however, are the debts of the state, because they are to be carried by all citizens: In 1989, they were about DM16,000 per person in the FRG and about DM3,000 (mid-1990) in the GDR (including foreign debts, without housing). What was thus contributed to unification by each side is obvious. If, in 1994, the state debts are skyrocketing to a total of DM2 trillion, each FRG citizen will have a share of DM24,700 in it (for a four-person family: DM99,000). For the sake of justice, at least the FRG debts incurred until unification should not burden the eastern citizens (DM16,000). Beyond the state debts, loans to companies and private persons in the FRG, for instance, have risen by DM1 trillion to about DM3 trillion since 1989. One can see that the development of debts is not primarily due to the anschluss of the GDR, as politicians like to claim.
