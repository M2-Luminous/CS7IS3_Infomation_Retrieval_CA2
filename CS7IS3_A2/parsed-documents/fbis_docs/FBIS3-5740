"North Korea has placed stress on its military. Looking at the facts that it has developed the Nodong-1 through upgrading Scud missiles and has improved its technologies, we cannot totally deny that it may produce a further upgraded one," he said. Hatakeyama, speaking at a news conference, discussed a report by the authoritative JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY that North Korea is developing two new ballistic missiles, one of which is capable of landing anywhere in Japan. Pyongyang last year test-fired the Nodong-1 ballistic missile with an estimated range of 1,000 kilometers -- capable of striking Seoul and western parts of Japan. Hatakeyama, however, said the Defense Agency has not independently confirmed the JANE's report. According to JANE's, U.S. intelligence satellites have detected a new "missile simulator," a hardware mock-up of a missile, at the Sanum Dong research facility in North Korea. The weekly said the new two-stage missile has been given the provisional designation Taepo Dong-2 (TD-2) by U.S. intelligence. The mock-up was 32 meters long, comprising an 18 by 2.4 meter diameter first stage and a 14 by 1.3 meter second stage rocket. The TD-2's dimensions indicate the missile would have a range far greater than the 2,000 kilometers of the Taepo Dong-1 (TD-1), also under development by North Korea, the magazine said. Jane's said U.S. officials also believe the missile has a much improved targeting capability and is possibly able to achieve a range of 3,500 kilometers, putting it in striking distance of Guam.
