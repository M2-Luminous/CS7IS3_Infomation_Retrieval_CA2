Sha'th told reporters before leaving he would talk to British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd about ways to "protect the Palestinian people and disarm Israeli settlers" after the Hebron massacre. He said he would travel on to Washington to meet US Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Friday and discuss "measures which must be applied to guarantee security for Palestinians before negotiations resume" with Israel. Sha'th, an advisor to PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat, said he will also ask the US administration to "adopt a serious position on Jewish American groups which collect funds for extremist settlers" to attack Palestinians. Nabil Qassis, another PLO member involved in peace talks with Israel, will join Sha'th in his discussions with US officials. A US official speaking on condition of anonymity said on Wednesday that the United States hope the autonomy negotiations will resume after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin visits Washington from March 14-17. The negotiations to launch self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho have been suspended since a Jewish settler on Friday shot dead 52 Palestinian worshippers at a mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron.
