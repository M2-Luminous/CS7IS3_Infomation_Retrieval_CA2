Attending the symposium were factory directors and managers from nearly 40 medium-sized, large-, and extra large enterprises around the country and economics scholars in the capital. Proceeding from reality, the entrepreneurs summed up the experiences and lessons obtained in recent years in conducting enterprise reform and exchanged their views on how to build a modern enterprise system in our country. The economists expounded the essence and the prime importance of building such a system from both the theoretical and practical viewpoints. They also discussed such questions as theoretical and practical difficulties in building China's modern enterprise system as well as ways, methods, and strategies to be adopted to transform existing enterprises. One salient feature of this symposium was that economists and entrepreneurs got together to discuss an important issue on economic reform. Highlights of the symposium follow: I. Contents and Essence of Modern Enterprise System The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided unequivocally that the reform of our state-owned enterprises should be oriented toward the modern enterprise system. What is the modern enterprise system? What are covered by this system? But what is its essence? These were priority and principal questions studied and discussed by the participants in the symposium. As can be seen from their discussions, the modern enterprise system is very comprehensive in nature, and divergent views existed on the tasks of building such a system in our country. 1. The modern enterprise system has come into being to suit the needs of meeting the needs of the market economy. It basic components are: a) a legal-entity system whereby enterprises themselves are responsible for their profits and losses; b) an enterprise leadership system characterized by vertical delegation of power; c) a standardized financial and accounting system; d) an enterprise income distribution system which benefits all concerned, and e) an enterprise personnel and labor system whereby employment is based on two-way choice between the employer and employee. To build such a modern enterprise system, China must conduct thoroughgoing reforms in the above-mentioned five areas. 2. Tasks for building a modern enterprise system in China should include: a) Institution of a scientific property rights system. This requires the entrepreneurial management of the departments that deal with enterprise property rights. These departments should be able to reflect and adjust the property rights structure based on the given ownership. b) Rationalization of the enterprise organization. China's enterprise reform has developed from the implementation of the policy of granting power to enterprises to the stage of instituting a new enterprise system. Companies are the most typical, advanced and effective form of enterprise organization under the condition of the market economy. c) Improvement of enterprises' internal systems, aimed at switching their function from pure production management to all-round operational management. d) Transformation of enterprises' internal management systems, including the legal system, leadership system, unemployment insurance system, income distribution system, cadre and personnel system, and labor employment system. 3. The following objectives should be achieved in building the modern enterprise system: Enterprises should be relieved from the status of affiliation with government departments so as to truly separate enterprise management from government administration. They should become legal entities responsible for their own profits and losses and acting as the mainstay on the market. Their organizational and managerial systems should be scientific and standardized. And there should be a real change in the government functions in relation to enterprises. To this end, the modern enterprise system should contain the following: a) a criterion for regulating the relationship between the government's administrative department and enterprises; b) a criterion for regulating the relationship between enterprises and the departments controlling and managing state assets; c) a criterion for regulating the relationship among owners, managers, and employees; and d) a criterion for regulating the relationship between investors' ownership and the property rights of legal entities. 4. The core of the modern enterprise system is the legal-entity system, that is, the system widely practiced in the world that treats companies as legal entities. It consists of many elements, including the systems for property rights, accounting, organization (types of enterprises), and management (organizations and departments). In essence, it has the following characteristics: On the one hand, the state holds the ultimate ownership of the property of state-owned enterprises, thus ensuring their public ownership. On the other hand, the enterprises, based on the property rights of the legal entities, are truly independent commodity producers and managers responsible for their own profits and losses, and they function as the mainstay on the market. The system of companies as legal entities serves as a link between public ownership and the market economy. 5. The key to instituting the modern enterprise system is to recognize the legal entities' property rights and the investors' rights of investment. The characteristics of the system in this respect are: clearly defined property rights, explicitly specified authority and responsibility, separation of government administration from enterprise management, scientific management methods, and suitability to the needs of the market economy. 6. The modern enterprise system has been created to meet the needs of the market economy. Therefore, it has the following characteristics: a) All enterprise activities are centered around the market. Enterprises base their production on supply and demand in the market and are the mainstay in market activities. b) Enterprises really operate on their own; they are no longer belongings of the government. c) All enterprise activities are based on profit-making. Enterprises themselves are responsible for their profits and losses and exercise self-restraint. d) Through the market mechanism, enterprises compete with each other on an equal basis and achieve self-improvement. Successful enterprises prosper, while those which fail in the competition are eliminated. II. Questions To Be Resolved and Measures To Be Taken in Transforming State-Owned Enterprises Into Companies and Building the Modern Enterprise System 1. Question of understanding. Although the decision of the 14th CPC National Congress unequivocally points out that building a modern enterprise system represents the direction that all enterprises should keep to, and most people understand in varying degrees the need for transforming state-owned enterprises into companies, some still take a negative or skeptical attitude toward this question. They equate the implementation of the shareholding system and the reform of the enterprise system and the property rights system to a change of the ownership system. According to these people, implementing the shareholding system and reforming the property rights system are acts of privatization. This is incorrect. It should be noted that the ownership system embodies the essence of the relations of production. It deals with property relations in the perspective of property ownership. The shareholding system, on the other hand, deals with property relations from the producers' standpoint. The new enterprise system is aimed at creating an effective form of the state-owned sector of the economy. The focal point is to change the ineffective state asset management under the old system and design an enterprise system compatible with the market economy. There is no such question as using the new enterprise system to change the socialist ownership system. 2. Rationalization of property rights relations and establishment of a new property rights system for state-owned enterprises. The state may, through entrusted management, enable enterprises to hold legal-entity property rights to state assets. This clarifies the state-enterprise relationship with respect to property rights. At the same time, the state should undertake limited responsibilities on the state assets used by enterprises. 3. Definition of property rights. While transforming enterprises into companies, how to scientifically classify and define property rights is a central question in building the modern enterprise system. In principle, the ownership of state assets belongs to the state, while enterprises possess all the legal-entity property rights resulting from the investments made by investors, including the state. However, the concept of ownership by the state is too generic and is apt to create a situation of no specific representative of the owner. For this reason, some participants in the symposium made the following suggestion: State property rights should be divided into different levels; that is, the owners should be diversified and the property rights held by different levels of government. According to our present government financial system, four levels of government can hold property rights, i.e., the central, provincial, prefectural, and county levels. Defining the property rights according to the principle that whoever made the investment has the property rights and receives the returns will help solve the problem of no definite state asset owner. As to more specific and complicated questions, such as how to define the property rights to new fixed assets resulting from technological-upgrading investment using enterprises' own funds or loans, some clear-cut provisions should be worked out. In this regard, some participants suggested that a concrete analysis be made of the technological-upgrading funds. If the principal and interest on the loan have been repaid, they said, the related assets may be treated as shares held by the legal entity. If the enterprise cannot pay back the loan, the related assets should become investment by the state or the bank concerned. 4. Appraisal of assets. In transforming state-owned enterprises into companies, a key task is the appraisal of their assets. State assets should be appraised by independent intermediary service organizations. In doing this, it is imperative to minimize administrative intervention, seek truth from facts, keep to the "Provisions Governing State Asset Appraisal," and take into account both tangible and intangible assets. Appraisal of tangible assets should be based on their replacement value. The original inventory should be treated as shares held by the state, while additional assets should be turned into shares held by the legal entities. Land may be appraised in accordance with the State Land Management Regulations and the current land market price. Intangible assets should be transferred according to law with attention to protecting the creditors' due interests. As for patents and proprietary technologies, consideration should be given to such factors as the scope of application and approved duration of technical secrecy so that the appraisal will fully reflect their effective value. 5. Management of state assets. In addition to defining property rights and appraising assets, how to manage state assets is also a very important question in transforming state-owned enterprises into the shareholding system. A suggested solution is to establish a sound three-tier organizational structure for the control and management of state assets: a) Establishment of a state asset administrative department to ensure the effective utilization and appreciation of state assets. b) Establishment of intermediary organizations for managing state assets, such as investment companies, holding companies, and enterprise groups. This way enterprises engaged in production and other operations will not be linked directly to the government's administrative departments, thus ensuring the separation of enterprise management from government administration. c) Management of state assets in the same way as financial management with attention to preserving their value and ensuring their mobility. 6. Need to choose the right forms of stockholding in transforming state-owned enterprises. In line with China's actual conditions, the following forms may be adopted according to the types of investments: a) Companies wholly owned by the state. In general, this form is suitable for enterprises making special-category products or producing armaments. b) Stock companies with control shares held by the state. In most cases, this is suitable for backbone enterprises in the fields of pillar and basic industries. c) Stock companies with shares held by both the state and the enterprises as legal entities. Generally speaking, this is suitable for enterprise groups and enterprises with diversified investments. d) Stock companies with shares held by their employees. e) Stock companies which are Sino-foreign joint ventures. 7. Appropriate solution to problems left by enterprises. a) Debts. Although state-owned enterprises have undergone reform, in general their economic returns remain at a low level, and most of them are debt-ridden because the fundamental question of property rights has not been well resolved. According to estimates by the department concerned, industrial enterprises contained in the state budget are laden with working-fund loans and special-purpose loans, totaling 800 billion yuan. If all their profits were used to repay these loans, it would take 18 years to clear up the debts, calculated at the 1990 interest rate. The interest alone amounts to tens of billions of yuan a year. In view of this, some participants suggested that, in the transformation of the enterprises into companies, debts between legal entities be treated as shares given by the debtors to the creditors. b) Social welfare burdens. First, most state-owned enterprises have the problems of being overstaffed and a growing number of retired personnel of whom to take care. Statistics show that about 20 percent of their personnel are superfluous, and another 20 percent are retirees. In addition to establishing as soon as possible a social insurance system and an old-age insurance system to solve these problems, some participants suggested that, when appraising the enterprises' total assets, a proper amount of money be set aside as a settlement assistance fee to guarantee the livelihood of the laid-off and retired employees. At the same time, the laid-off and retired employees are encouraged to engage in the tertiary trade to support themselves. Second, enterprises are now providing social welfare benefits to their employees. This entails great difficulties, numerous problems, and remarkable contradictions. The work involved is extremely comprehensive and complicated. To provide such benefits to the employees not only brings numerous problems to enterprise management, but also creates contradictions between the enterprises and the government. It was suggested that, after the enterprises have been reorganized, their non-business facilities, such as dependent schools, clinics, mess halls, and housing agents, be operated by the new companies under a special program, and that a fee be charged for the use of these facilities. This will not hurt the shareholders' interests and, at the same time, satisfy the needs of the employees. Third, enterprises are burdened with unreasonably exacted fees. It is expected that this problem will be radically removed after the enterprises have been transformed into companies, their legal-entity status has been gradually clarified, and the reforms in the government's functional and other departments have developed in depth. At this time, it is imperative to strictly enforce the state regulations on banning unwarranted exaction of fees so as to lessen the enterprises' burden and facilitate their transformation into companies. 8. Establishment of a new management system within enterprises. After transformation into companies, state-owned enterprises should deepen the reform of their labor, personnel, income distribution, management, and leadership systems, optimize their structure, and quicken the change of their operational mechanism so that they will have a higher labor productivity, better product quality, and lower production costs, all of which are prerequisite to success in market competition. First, with regard to the reform of the labor employment system, there are two major tasks: Enterprises should gain the power--namely, the power to hire employees. The government should build the market--that is, cultivate and transform the labor market. In this regard, some participants suggested a labor employment system based on two-way free choice between enterprises and employees and a combination of regular, contract, and temporary workers. In most cases, the contract worker system should be used, while, in a few special cases, the temporary worker system may be adopted. The above-mentioned three kinds of workers have different pay scales, but their status is not unchangeable. In addition, efforts should be made to improve the employees' performance evaluation system and the social security system. Second, it is necessary to modernize our enterprise management -- from the management mentality to the ways and means of management -- and to build a high-efficiency and quickly reactive enterprise organizational structure. In reforming enterprise management organization, the difficulty lies in how to separate supplementary units from main units, how to settle the surplus employees, and how to avoid double taxation after the separation of supplementary units and the formation of new enterprises. Third, a modern enterprise financial and accounting system should be established in compliance with the requirements set forth in the "General Financial Guidelines for Enterprises" and the "Guiding Principles for Enterprise Accounting." Fourth, it is necessary to standardize the activities of enterprises and accelerate the transformation of their internal operational mechanism. Fifth, the leadership system in enterprises should be reformed. Under the modern enterprise system, enterprises should have the power to manage their financial affairs, make operational decisions, and direct and supervise their production and other operations. Because of this, there should be a multilayered leadership system based on vertical delegation of power, consisting of the shareholders' meeting, board of directors, board of supervisors, and managerial group. These organizations should exercise power of major policy making, power of supervision, and power for the formulation and implementation of policies on day-to-day business. Meanwhile, the modern enterprise leadership system should adhere to the principle that the party plays a core role in the ideological and political work within enterprises. Also, it should carry forward the role of the workers' congress in democratic management of enterprises. Party committees, trade unions, and staff and worker representatives should get involved in the work of the boards of supervisors and directors so as to enlarge the scope and enhance the substance of democratic management of enterprises. 9. Acceleration of all supplementary reforms and improvement of enterprises' external environment. a) We should change the government's economic management function and, instead, set up a macro-regulatory and control system relying mainly on indirect means: To this end, we should, first of all, deepen the price reform and form a pattern whereby the price is determined by supply and demand. Second, we should have a unified tax system so that enterprises can compete on the market on equal terms. Third, we should make all-out efforts to cultivate the market and form an integrated, open, and orderly market system so as to provide enterprises with a sound market environment. b) We should set up and develop various kinds of intermediary organizations and institute a system which requires these organizations to undertake certain responsibilities. c) We should create an environment for implementing the legal system so that there are laws for enterprises to follow in conducting their economic activities. This work includes the perfection of the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law. Meanwhile, we should form a property rights market and optimize the allocation of resources in society. c) We should build a multilayered social security system and improve the old-age and unemployment insurance systems. The social security system should start as a rudimentary welfare program, and its scope should be gradually expanded to include medical, housing, and education benefits. As to the financial sources for the insurance systems, the state, enterprises, and employees are required to share the burden in a reasonable way. III. Ways and Means for Transforming State-Owned Enterprises Into Companies 1. Different views exist on the possibility of turning state-owned enterprises into companies: a) The transformation of state-owned enterprises into companies is due to the following reason: The organizational form and operational mechanism of wholly-state-owned enterprises cannot meet the needs of development of the market economy, and a general expansion of enterprise power is not a radical solution to the longstanding problems. Transformation of enterprises into companies will enable them to build sound mechanisms for promoting production and sales and for motivating, developing, and restraining themselves. Such transformation will also be an effective way to form a correct relationship between the state and enterprises. Now, in our country, the development of the multiple-ownership system, diversification of principal investors and beneficiaries, and expansion of lateral cooperation among enterprises have provided favorable conditions for developing stockholding enterprises. For this reason, we should turn state-owned enterprises into companies and speed up their transformation toward the shareholding system. ) It is rather difficult to transform large and medium-sized state-own enterprises into the stockholding system. Without proper solutions to the questions concerning asset appraisal, property rights, and employees' social welfare benefits, the shareholding system is only an exploratory, trial system, and most state-owned enterprises cannot be changed into companies. However, we may "copy the system to change our mechanism." That is, we may copy the company's system, including its legal-entity status and internal management organization, to achieve the objective of transforming our enterprises' operational mechanism. To do this, we should continue to base the work on the "Law Concerning Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" and "Regulations on Transformation of Operational Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People." We should give state-owned enterprises decision-making power with regard to management, grant them the status as legal entities, and establish as soon as possible an enterprise organizational system modeled on the management structure of companies. 2. Scope of transformation to companies (shareholding system): (1) Shareholding is a good system for developing the market economy and optimizing the ownership structure. Stock companies can sever the link between the government and enterprises and achieve the goal of separating ownership from the power of management. They are the most suitable form of enterprise organization for the development of the market economy. Therefore, all-out efforts should be made to popularize stock companies and make them the principal type of enterprises in China. Nonetheless, not all enterprises can be switched to the shareholding system. For this reason, state-owned enterprises should be transformed into the following different organizational forms: Enterprises of unitary ownership by the public with their capital owned by the central government or a local government at a certain level. Enterprises of multiple ownership by the public (which have been transformed into stock companies) with their capital owned jointly by the central and local governments or by different local governments. Enterprises with the government holding control shares--in these enterprises the government shares play a leading role. And enterprises with the government holding regular shares--in these enterprises the government acts merely as a regular shareholder, not as a controlling shareholder. (2) Relatively speaking, the shareholding system is suited to those large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises which have to face competition in doing their business and which should reorganize their production elements. Therefore, we should define a proper scope for the implementation of the shareholding system. 3. How to transform enterprises into companies. Most participants said that the majority of China's enterprises should be transformed into limited-liability companies. Specific comments were as follows: a) Transformation of state-owned enterprises into companies is to change the "factory-type" enterprises owned solely by the state and managed directly by the government into "company-type" enterprises with multiple investors and managed by the enterprises themselves. For most enterprises, the type of company to be adopted is the limited-liability company. This type of company has many advantages: Its capital can be pooled quickly, and its operation is relatively simple. The transformation is easy and not costly. Its activities can be easily standardized. A small number of enterprises with heavy renovation or expansion tasks or requiring large amounts of funds for production and construction may be turned into limited-liability stock companies. In general, however, state-owned enterprises should not be transformed into wholly-state-owned limited-liability companies so as to avert the appearance of flipped-plate companies [fan pai gong si 5064 3654 0361 0674; referring to government institutions that have been turned into companies but illegally use previous government connections for profiteering], which will be a new obstacle to the in-depth development of the reform. Methods to avoid this are letting legal entities buy each other's shares, converting debts into shares, soliciting foreign investors, and absorbing capital from society as investment. b) The purpose of transforming our state-owned enterprises into companies is to correct a drawback of these enterprises, namely, the unitariness and abstractness of their property rights, and to separate government administration from enterprise management through the diversification of property rights and the clarification of relations of property rights. Therefore, in the transformation of enterprises into companies, only a few of them should be turned into companies of sole proprietorship, while most should become limited-liability companies or limited-liability stock companies with diverse investors. The choice depends on the enterprises' internal and external conditions. In foreign countries, big enterprises are generally limited-liability stock companies, while most small and medium-sized enterprises are limited-liability companies. In China, we should try to limit the number of companies of sole proprietorship when transforming our state-owned enterprises into companies. To do this, we should let legal entities become shareholders and encourage them to buy each other's shares. c) Judging from China's actual conditions, it will be impossible to turn all state-owned enterprises into listed stock companies. Most enterprises should be transformed into either limited-liability companies (including Sino-foreign joint ventures) or wholly-state-owned companies. d) One of the significant reasons for proposing a modern enterprise system is to treat wholly-state-owned companies as a company category and, in a certain sense, distinguish them from stock companies. Under the present circumstances, however, wholly-state-owned companies are viewed as a kind of limited-liability company rather than a separate category. Compared with state-owned enterprises, whole-state-owned limited-liability companies represent a leap from unlimited-liability enterprises which are not legal entities to limited-liability enterprises which act as legal entities. The transformation of big and medium-sized state-owned enterprises into limited-liability companies may be carried out as an intermediate step. In the future, however, most of them should be turned into stock companies or openly listed stock companies. 4. The question of legal entities as shareholders and legal entities holding each other's shares. Following views were expressed at the symposium: a) In transforming state-owned enterprises into companies, we should let legal entities hold shares and especially hold each other's shares. Participants holding this view deemed it necessary to stress the need for companies as legal entities to possess shares in order to diversify the share ownership. According to them, state-owned enterprises should possess each other's shares so as to nullify the ultimate-ownership mechanism and give prominence to the rights and interests of those who actually manage the enterprises. Over time, the pertinent government departments' authority over the enterprises will gradually become nominal, and the enterprises will be able to operate on their own. b) Reasons for promoting legal-entity shareholders in the transformation of enterprises into companies: One is to change the original meanings of the ownership systems. Since legal-entity shareholders represent thousands upon thousands of individuals, shares held by legal entities mean shares held by the masses. As a result, the original "pure private ownership" will become something close to a "social ownership." Capitalist ownership will no longer be a pure private ownership system. A similar diluting effect will be exerted on the socialist ownership system as well. The second reason is to greatly weaken the shareholders' rights and boost the managers' rights. The third reason is that with legal-entity shareholders, management will not be easily dictated by individual shareholders' shortsighted activities aimed at seeking dividends. c) Some entrepreneurs expressed a different view about letting legal entities become shareholders and hold each other's shares. Letting them hold each other's shares, they said, may be a very effective way for enterprise transformation in the future. But under the current circumstances where most enterprises are suffering losses in varying degrees and experiencing capital shortage and financial difficulty, how can they buy each other's shares? This is impractical at least at this time, they added. 5. In discussions, some theoreticians and entrepreneurs noted that, in the transformation of enterprises into companies, a not-to-be-slighted question is that the reform of Chinese enterprises' property rights must be accompanies by the establishment of an entrepreneur system. History has proven that managerial professionals constitute an inevitable social stratum whether in feudal or capitalist society. This stratum makes perfect the model of separation of management and ownership. The birth and formation of the entrepreneur system is not merely of importance to management science. Rather, its importance to economics outweighs its importance to management science. The entrepreneur system constitutes an integral part of the modern capitalist property rights system. When a consensus has been reached on reorganizing the property rights related to our state-owned enterprises, the next question to be understood by all is that our institution of the enterprise legal-entity system must be closely integrated with the formation of an entrepreneur system.
