FR941012-0-00121 FR941012-0-00011 4. An exception to the ROPS and FOPS requirement has been added for machines capable of 360-degree rotation. Two commenters pointed out that the mast assembly of these machines, usually converted excavators, protects against machine rollover (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;40, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;63). In addition, the boom structure provides crush protection during rollover or tipover (Ex. 5&hyph;16). At paragraphs (f)(3) (ii) and (iii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that ROPS and FOPS be tested, installed and maintained in accordance with the following Society of Automotive Engineers standards: ``Performance Criteria for Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) for Construction, Earthmoving, Forestry, and Mining Machines'' SAE J1040, April 1988; ``Minimum Performance Criteria for Falling Object Protective Structures (FOPS)'' SAE J231, Jan 1981; and ``Deflection Limiting Volume-ROPS/FOPS Laboratory Evaluation'' SAE J397, April 1988. This incorporation by reference of SAE J1040; April 1988, SAE J231, Jan 1981, and SAE J397; April 1988, have been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text of SAE J1040, April 1988, SAE J231, 1981, and SAE J397, April 1988. These provisions update the requirements contained in the proposed rule. OSHA received various comments on incorporating consensus standards by reference, and this issue has been discussed above in the Major Issues section. In paragraph (f)(3)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the protective structure on each machine be of a size that does not impede the operator's normal movements in the cab. This provision parallels the provision contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. In paragraphs (f)(3)(vi) through (xii) specify requirements for enclosing the operator's cab. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing these provisions in general. One commenter did recommend that OSHA replace these provisions with a reference to the Society of Automotive Engineers J1084, April 1980, standard on force requirements for tractors and skidders (Ex. 5&hyph;16). However, since the SAE standard does not cover all of the machines referenced in paragraph (f)(3), OSHA has specified in the final rule the cab force requirements which are applicable to machines used in logging operations. Paragraph (f)(3)(vi) of the final rule requires that the overhead covering of each cab be of solid material extending over the entire canopy. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule. Paragraph (f)(3)(vii) requires that the lower portion of the cab (up to the top of the instrument panel or 24 inches (60.9 cm) if there is no instrument panel) be completely enclosed, except at entrances, with solid material to prevent objects from entering the cab. The proposed rule stated generally that the lower portion of the cab be fully enclosed. One commenter said that what constitutes the ``lower portion'' of the cab should be specifically defined (Ex. 5&hyph;16). OSHA has incorporated the commenter's recommendation that the lower portion be defined as below the top of the instrument panel or at 24 inches. Paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the final rule requires that the upper portion of the cab be fully enclosed. The enclosure must be made of mesh material with openings no greater than 2 inches (5.08 cm) at its least dimension or other material that the employer demonstrates provides equivalent protection and visibility. This provision combines two requirements contained in the proposed rule: full enclosure of the upper rear portion of the cab and enclosure extending forward as far as possible from the rear corners of the cab sides. The proposed rule also required that the mesh material openings be no greater than 13/4 inches. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also required metal mesh when glass alone is not sufficient to provide operator protection. In the final rule, OSHA has combined these provisions because one commenter said that ``upper rear portion'' and ``as far as possible'' were not adequately defined (Ex. 5&hyph;16). In addition, OSHA has changed the final rule to allow mesh material with openings no greater than two inches, that one commenter pointed out is the accepted standard in the western States (See Ex. 2&hyph;22, 5&hyph;71, 38K).
