Judging by all appearances, the Serbs from the occupied territories accepted the negotiations, but only in order to procrastinate, that is, to complete the first phase aimed at separation. This in a way threatens to become a Cyprus-style problem. Are you afraid of a Cyprus-like situation in Croatia? [Nobilo] I think that such a danger is always there if this status quo continues. If it continues throughout this year, Croatia should cancel the Zagreb agreement. In other words, the Zagreb agreement is valid only if the next step toward economic and political issues is made. Failing that, Croatia will have to make completely different decisions. I belive that a political solution will be reached as a result of the efforts of the international community to find a tripartite agreement -- a bilateral one now in Bosnia. However, if Knin's position becomes tougher, Croatia will have to make completely different decisions in completely different circumstances. [Announcer] What deadline would you consider reasonable to cancel the Zagreb agreement? [Nobilo] At the moment, I am not advocating that solution. All negotiations and the stabilization of the situation follow the same dynamics. First, the forces must be separated and peace restored. However, I am speaking about a possible final scenario. If all serious solutions fail to materialize and if there is no implementation in the four months that the international community gave itself, and which coincide with the UN Protection Force mandate, Croatia should make completely different decisions than now.
