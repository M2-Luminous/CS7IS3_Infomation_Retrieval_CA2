On Circumstances of the Resignation of Armenia's State Security Chief"] [Text] Armenian political quarters continue to discuss the reasons that made President Levon Ter-Petrosyan fire Eduard Simonyants, chief of the State National Security Directorate (SNSD). His duties were, quite unexpectedly for everyone, temporarily transferred to David Shakhnazaryan, the president's ambassador at large. The need for a structural adjustment of this far from simple organization has come to a head. Interestingly enough, that has been started precisely now that the former SNSD chief seemed to have been ready to get ahead with leisurely evolutionary changes and to direct his staffers to fulfill the tasks of intelligence and counterintelligence in the interests of national security rather than to crack down on dissidents. The opposition press has put forward various versions trying to account for this reshuffle. In particular, left-wing radical publications argue that the fired SNSD chief not only was part of the elite of the virtually ruling party, the Armenian Pan-national Movement (APM), and was one of the team of the president's chief national security adviser, Ashot Manucharyan, who resigned last summer. It is this team of the "internal" intellectual opposition that the powers that be allegedly fear most of all, and the president's moves come precisely from the desire to get rid of the stranger. There is, however, yet another interpretation of the events. Last December, Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan tried unsuccessfully to get parliamentarians to amend the law "On the State Bank." He based his demand on the fact that only by including the head of the State Bank in the government was it possible to curb inflation and carry through reforms. Parliament staunchly beat back the premier's attack. A new idea then arose: to put in the state bank director's chair "their own man" -- Bagrat Asatryan, chairman of one of the parliamentary commissions and member of the APM board. That, however, was opposed by some APM functionaries and parliamentarians who argued that Mr. Asatryan, being an economist, was not still a banking expert, whereas Mr. Isaakyan, who held this office, was a professional. Judging from some signs, the negotiations were not long: The party bosses demanded, in exchange for support in parliament, that the last "stranger" head of one of the "power" agency in Armenia be removed. The recent session of the Armenian parliament all the same confirmed Bagrat Asatryan in the post of director of the State Bank of Armenia. APM deputies honored the terms of the deal, and the executive branch had no other option but to keep its part of the bargain. The opposition believes that the one to gain from this resignation is, first and foremost, the "omnipotent" Internal Affairs Minister Vano Siradegyan, whose agency at last has real chances to turn into a "superministry" and to exercise even greater control over many spheres of the republic's internal life. Local political observers nevertheless hope that David Shakhnazaryan, who has proven himself to be a serious political figure, will be able to keep his agency out of politics, and that Armenia is not threatened with "witch-hunting."
