Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, secretary of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, defended the house arrest of the Nobel Peace Prize winner and brushed aside the concept of human rights. "What are human rights as referred to by western people are targeted to limited people," Nyunt was quoted as telling the business delegation organized by the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren). July 5 will mark the fifth anniversary of Suu Kyi's house arrest. Diplomatic sources in Yangon said the military government plans to continue the arrest beyond that date. Nyunt told the Keidanren mission that his government will make efforts to promote economic development and achieve political stability before moving toward a nation under civilian rule, mission members said. Kazuo Haruna, chairman of Marubeni Corp. and head of the 45-member team, told Nyunt it is regrettable that Japan's Official Development Assistance (ODA) has been suspended since 1988 and expressed hope that it will be resumed as soon as possible, they said. The mission, the largest Japanese delegation ever to visit the country, is holding talks with Myanmar leaders on projects including Myanmar's oil industry. The delegation is due to depart the country Saturday.
