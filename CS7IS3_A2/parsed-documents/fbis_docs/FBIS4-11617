Burelli, who made the announcement on Monday when he dedicated the Department of Latin America and the Caribbean at the Central University of Venezuela (UCV), explained that the association will include all of the Caribbean states and will begin work on 4 July. As of 1969 and following the process of independence of the countries forming part of Caribbean Common Market, Venezuela designed an "unchanging policy of lending a hand" to these nations with the sole purpose of serving its neighbors, the foreign minister emphasized. Venezuela is the only country that has 12 embassies and 10 cultural centers in the Caribbean. It also signed the San Jose Pact with Mexico, which supplies petroleum to those nations under special payment conditions. In addition, the government in Caracas has signed a Caribbean Development Bank exchange program that allows the granting of recoverable lines of credit to the Caribbean countries. The Venezuelan foreign minister expressed his support for a massive Venezuelan projection into the Caribbean that, with the exception of Trinidad-Tobago and Guyana, is made up of small nations without large resources and with a small population.
