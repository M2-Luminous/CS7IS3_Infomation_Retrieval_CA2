FR940405-0-00046 FR940405-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;179&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8865; AD 94&hyph;07&hyph;07] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F airplanes, that requires modification of the fuel crossfeed low level dump system shutoff. This amendment is prompted by an FAA determination that, in the event of a failure of the number 2 bus tie relay and the subsequent loss of the number 2 electrical power source, an all-engine flameout event could occur due to fuel starvation during or shortly after a fuel dumping operation. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of the fuel dump system shutoff due to a failure of the number 2 DC bus electrical relay and the subsequent loss of the number 2 electrical power source. DATES: Effective May 5, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O. Box 1771, Long Beach, California 90801&hyph;1771, Attention: Business Unit Manager, Technical Administrative Support, Department L51, M.C. 2&hyph;98. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Raymond Vakili, Aerospace Engineer, Propulsion Branch, ANM&hyph;141L, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806&hyph;2425; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5262; fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD), that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on December 9, 1993 (58 FR 64708). That action proposed to require modification of the fuel crossfeed low level dump system shutoff. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. Several commenters support the proposed rule. One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time of 15 months to modify the fuel crossfeed low level dump system shutoff be extended to 24 months to coincide with regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. The commenter states that a compliance time of 24 months would allow operators some latitude to schedule the accomplishment of this modification. The FAA concurs with the commenter's request to extend the compliance time for the modification requirement so that the modification can be performed at a maintenance base during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available if necessary. Extending the compliance time by 9 additional months will not adversely affect safety since the interim procedures [via a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)] required by AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;8392 (57 FR 47570, October 19, 1992) will detect electrical malfunctions that may render the automatic fuel dump termination feature inoperative. Therefore, paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised to specify a compliance time of 24 months. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 98 McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 43 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $5,688 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $258,774, or $6,018 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
