Many demographers and television artists believed it to be "comprehensive, profound and vibrant, a fine political essay in television film, and a vivid text book for perception through the senses." The TV series in question is a joint production effort of the Fujian Provincial Census Office and the Fujian North-and-South Telefilm Center; it depicts the population crisis, one of the five major crises of mankind in the 20th Century, and the sternest topic in contemporary Chinese society, on the TV screen, and sounds the alarm on the population issue in the economic upsurge. The TV series is China's first attempt to make profound analyses on a series of issues the population issue involves, which are closely linked to the Chinese people, such as the environmental issue, nationals' qualities, education, housing, resources, aging, and population flow. At the ceremonies of the premiere held today, related experts stated that "the series is a piece of great work that aims at revealing social issues rarely seen in recent years, thus pushing Chinese telefilms with themes on social issues to a new level." Fei Xiaotong, the State Family Planning Commission, and the State Statistics Bureau highly appraised the TV series, believing that it was an important result in the excavation and utilization of the fourth census data, "and an educational document on the national demographic condition with artistic value which affords great delight." Chen Lin [7115 3829], the telefilm series' producer and Fujian Provincial Census Office director, gave a briefing on the making of the series on behalf of the production team at the premiere. The shooting of the film began in Fuzhou in October 1992; the production team covered a distance of some 10,000 km, with their footsteps covering 13 provinces and cities; aside from collecting much precious historical date, they also shoot many heartbreaking scenes on location. Famous scientist Fei Xiaotong, NPC Standing Committee vice chairman; and State Councillor Peng Peiyun, concurrently State Family Planning Commission minister; and State Statistics Bureau Director Zhang Sai were general advisors of the series. Fujian telefilm director Su Zhong [5685 11813] was the chief director.
