Gu Shengzu, Fang Jiade, Guo Guoqing, Li Hongchang, and Wang Chuanlun expressed opinions on ways to guide "migrant rural workers," to establish a modern enterprise system, and to bring into full play the role of supervisors. In his speech, committee member Gu Shengzu offered suggestions on how to rationally guide the current massive movement of rural labor. He said: At present, of the 0.2 billion surplus rural workers, 50-60 million are migrant workers, creating a massive movement of rural labor. Migrant workers do make contributions; however, they greatly affect transportation and social order at the same time. He made the following suggestions: We should use the market to rationally guide migrant workers. Under the premise of guiding them through multiple channels, we should make rural towns and townships the main centers for channeling surplus rural labor in a bid to slow down the flow of surplus rural labor to large cities. Meanwhile, we should reform such systems as residence registration to bring about a complete transfer of part of surplus rural labor. To prevent a blind and disorderly massive movement of rural labor and to organize migrant rural workers systematically, the government should strengthen overall regulation, guidance, and coordination in dealing with migrant rural workers who move from place to place. In his speech, committee member Fang Jiade said: To establish a modern enterprise system is the foundation for establishing the socialist market economic structure and the goal of the reform in state-owned enterprises. To carry out this important reform, we must whole-heartedly persist in the policy of relying on the working class. In the course of establishing a modern enterprise system, we must attach great importance to the workers' role. Moreover, we must set up a scientific enterprise leadership system and an organization and management system with the workers' democratic participation. He suggested: In the establishment of a modern enterprise system, the board of directors, the supervisory board, and the assembly of share-holders should consist of a certain number of workers' representatives. We must uphold and perfect the Workers' Congress and practice democratic management in enterprises. We must uphold collective negotiations and sign collective agreements to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of workers, who are the master of the state, will not be violated. At the same time, we should step up the formulation of relevant laws to incorporate the policy of whole-heartedly relying on the working class into laws, policy, and the plans and measures for establishing a modern enterprise system. Committee member Guo Guoqing said: Under the conditions of the socialist market economic structure, it is very important to bring into full play the role of special supervisors, inspectors, auditors, educational inspectors, and other discipline enforcement workers. He pointed out: These special discipline enforcement jobs are highly political and professional. We should arrange for professionally trained comrades and those who are capable of participating in political affairs to do those jobs. Meanwhile, relevant state departments should make an overall plan for those special discipline enforcement workers each year. In light of the development and needs of the situation, these departments must promptly amend and perfect the regulations governing the special discipline enforcement workers; further specify their duties, rights, and responsibilities; and institutionalize the special discipline enforcement work. The CPC Central Committee and relevant state organs should often communicate with special discipline enforcement workers, ask for their opinions, summarize their experiences, and bring into play the role of comrades participating in special discipline enforcement. Committee member Li Hongchang suggested that the development of chambers of commerce be placed high on the agenda to meet the socialist market economy's needs. He said: The economy's rapidly growing nonpublic-owned sector has become increasingly important. This sector, which is at its initial stage and is rather scattered, has kept its distance from macroeconomic regulation and control. Therefore, it is in particular need of organizations like chambers of commerce that organize their representatives, represent their legitimate interests, maintain communications with the party and government, and provide various services. At the same time, the government needs the chambers of commerce to help it administer and guide the nonpublic-owned sector's healthy development. He also suggested that party committees and governments at all levels be fully aware of the importance of chambers of commerce and give top priority to their development. The relevant state authorities should formulate a "Chamber of Commerce Law" at an early date to clearly define, in the form of law, the functions and responsibilities of chambers of commerce so that they can operate in accordance with law. Committee member Wang Weilun pointed out that the anticorruption drive is of major importance today. He said that in the ongoing anticorruption drive, it is important to rely on the masses and step up efforts in investigating major cases in accordance with law. Meanwhile, we must pay special attention to collective violations of discipline; strictly enforce rules and regulations; and root out unhealthy practices in various industries, trades, and professions. Party and government departments at all levels should also announce progress in the anticorruption drive to keep the people informed and to bolster their confidence and enthusiasm in the drive.
