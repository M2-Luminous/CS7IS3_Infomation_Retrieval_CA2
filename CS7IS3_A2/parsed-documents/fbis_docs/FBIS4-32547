Padori reports on the expanding capacity of the REK (Republic Electric Power Combine) "Bitola" in an article on page 7 in the Macedonian-language Skopje daily VECER, published on 19 May. The Bitola plant, which is the largest in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), will expand its generating capacity by 45 megawatts when the overhaul is completed toward the end of September. According to Padori, the three heat and power units that have generated 210 megawatts each will be renovated, raising the capacity of each unit to 225 megawatts, thus increasing the Bitola plant's capacity to 675 megawatts. The idea of expanding the capacity of REK "Bitola" dates from the signing of an agreement with Russian partners from Saint Petersburg in October by Mr. Podoljski. According to the assistant director of the Bitola plant, Pande Lazarevski, it is significant that the increased power capacity can be obtained with the small investment of $4.5 million, or about $100,000 per megawatt.
