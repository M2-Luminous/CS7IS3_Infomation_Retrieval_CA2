The newspaper informs its readers of a meeting held by the Interior Ministry collegium, which called on the Russian Government "not to save money on support for law enforcement bodies". The same newspaper writes about a legislative initiative by the Russia's Choice faction at the State Duma (lower house of the Russian parliament) on crime control considered by the faction as the main present-day problem. However, the newspaper notes, the Russia's Choice initiative is blocked at the Duma by the factions of Agrarians, Communists and the Liberal Democratic Party. Pointing to the fact that "a new stage starts in the development of organised crime in Russia", the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper regards this as "the beginning of political terrorism". The same newspaper states that "Russia now experiences dire hunger for an ideology of reforms". It notes in this connection that "the creation of an economic policy out of illusory contradictory ideas on restoring industry and on continued cuts of state expenditures has now more to do with public relations than with real possibilities of the government to pursue this policy". Newspapers also concentrate attention on the continuing strike by mine builders at some collieries in Vorkuta (Russia's north). Noting that Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin will meet the miners' delegation on Friday, the TRUD newspaper expresses hope that the conflict will be settled. The PRAVDA newspaper, comparing mining strikes with "a winter hurricane after a shock therapy", stresses that other strikes also started. For instance, "Thousands of lecturers from hundreds of Russian higher educational establishments" went on strike. TRUD features an interview with Chairman of the State Property Committee Anatoliy Chubays, dealing with progress in privatisation in Russia. Examining the situation with privatisation in Russia, he notes that "to all appearances, privatisation has been accomplished. It has been accomplished, despite the fierce resistance of bureaucratic structures at all levels and some political forces". Commenting on the results of a trip by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to Central Asian republics, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper stresses that "the joint statement made by the Russian and Uzbek Foreign Ministries in Tashkent on February 9 reflects the principal position on Afghanistan". "Apart from expressing deep concern over events in the neighbouring state, the statement confirms principles of strict neutrality and non-interference in Afghanistan's domestic affairs." The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper carries an article by prominent American politilogist Steven Cohen entitled "Who Lost Russia". The author writes that "seriously wounded, polarised and riled Russia direly needs reasonable, concerted and gradual reforms". He notes in this connection that a broad coalition of Russian moderate centrist politicians seeks to become a political force which could review the process of reforms. This moderate bloc is Russia's hope, possibly, its last chance to carry out democratic changes based on market relations, Cohen stresses. Commenting on international events, the press singles out the aggravated problem of the Bosnian crisis. Newspapers point to the determination of NATO, using the ultimatum put forth before Bosnian Serbs, to tackle the problem by force. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA points to different approaches of NATO and Russia to this problem. The newspaper even writes that "although it is highly improbable, but a full-scale war may break out nine days later" (eds: deadline of NATO's ultimatum to Serbs).
