This is in contravention of the emergency regulations. Peter Scott is on the line from Empangeni with further details. Peter, can you just start by giving us the present situation? Peter, are you there? Can you please tell us what is the situation at present? [Scott] At the moment thousands of IFP supporters are marching down John Ross Highway on their way to the magisterial building in the center of town. Marchers are mostly armed with sticks, some with sharpened points, knobkieries, a few spears, bullwhips, and axes. Now, earlier a senior police officer on the scene, Major Margaret Kruger of the police legal department, confirmed that permission was not granted for the marchers to carry any weapons during the procession. Later a local IFP leader, Mr. Robert Mkhize, spoke to the IFP supporters where they were gathering to start marching, and told them that they had to hand in some of the traditional weapons. However, most of the marchers flouted this order, and they started marching a short while ago. [Announcer] And, Peter, can you tell us what is the mood of the people? [Scott] I wouldn't say the mood is very tense at the moment. People are very noisy, and they're sort of clashing their sticks, but I wouldn't say they're in a very bellicose mood. It's not as if they're out to make trouble as such. [Announcer] And how strong is the army and police presence? [Scott] Well, the army and police presence is quite substantial. There are quite a few members of the Internal Stability Division. They've got Nyala riot vehicles. There are some SADF [South African Defense Force] people as well. Air force helicopters and police helicopters are circling overhead and monitoring the situation. [Announcer] And is it clear from watching the crowd that the marshals monitoring the crowd are in control of what's going on? Is their presence very obvious? [Scott] They're actually very well marked. They've got overcoats on with clearly marked IFP colors on them. Now, earlier we were told not to speak to any of the supporters. We've been told to only speak to Robert Mkhize and also to the chairperson of the Inkatha Women's Brigade, Mrs. Faith Gasa, and she had some very strong words about the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]. She said that they have basically been forced by the TEC to act in this way, bt she stressed that the marchers are not out to make trouble, that they are actually there to protest about the massacre in Johannesburg earlier this month, and also in support of the king's demands for a sovereign kingdom. [Announcer] Right. Finally, what is the mood in the town, Peter? [Scott] So far most of the shops along John Ross Highway have actually closed their doors to business, in anticipation that there might be trouble. It's understandable that people are probably scared and would rather be safe than sorry. But further on in town businesses are still open, but we're on our way there to investigate what the situation is. [Announcer] Peter Scott, thank you very much.
