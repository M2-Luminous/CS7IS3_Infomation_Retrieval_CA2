It will only aggravate it. The best thing would be to settle this conflict during talks between delegations of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments," a high-ranking Russian diplomat in charge of relations with Ukraine told INTERFAX. He believes that confrontation between Kiev and Simferopol will play into the hands of the Ukrainian politicians who seek momentary gains. He is convinced that only a democratic procedure based on the CSCE principles will lead the conflict out of the deadlock. "International relations must be based on what the peoples consider correct and reasonable," he said. President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov stated that Crimea did not doubt either Ukraine's territorial integrity, or the current borders. The Russian diplomat is convinced that the situation in Crimea and in many other places of the former Soviet Union might be eased by the introduction of dual citizenship in Ukraine. "This is a vitally important issue. The Crimean residents I have talked with assert that free choice of citizenship for reasons of family circumstances would demonstrate Kiev's sincerity and inspire hope for a better future," he said. To quote the Russian diplomat, he would not like to speak or think about "the worst variant" that might happen. "It's simply awful and inadmissible. It would be madness," he said. He also expressed hope that Kiev would not go beyond the limits of common sense and stick to political methods.
