[Klaus] Not a word was said in my interview for this newspaper about compensation for individual Sudeten Germans. The issue does not involve compensation, but resolving this issue. These are two completely different things. I proceeded from the premise that, in harmony with our concept for individual rights, we do not like to hear ideas about collective rights and solutions. If, however, this or that German--I do not say Sudeten German on purpose--shows an interest in moving to the Czech Republic, settling here, and acquiring state citizenship, then that is in order. This is exactly what we have always said; I was merely making a distinction between collective and individual solutions. [Krejci] So, you did not discuss claims? [Klaus] Not a word was said about claims. This newspaper is one of those publications that does not publish interviews on principle. A journalist records an interview with someone, then writes an article based on it and places quotations from what he said between quotation marks. The interviewee does not have the slightest opportunity, however, to influence their order or choice. I refrain from such interviews-non-interviews and I only give them to journalists that I know and trust, which applies in the case of FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG. I think that the article published in this newspaper gave a faithful account of the essence of our conversation. [Krejci] The Civic Democratic Party [ODS] Executive Council has entrusted you with holding talks with the representatives of the Jewish communities. Why? [Klaus] The Civic Democratic Party cannot countenance the accusations being made against it by certain political entities for allegedly not respecting Jewish traditions or the suffering of the Jews during World War II. We cannot condone this offensive, deliberate, and calculated tactic. [Krejci] How do you assess the behavior of your coalition partners during the parliamentary vote on the property belonging to the Jewish communities? [Klaus] In my opinion, this was trivial. If someone leaves the chamber because, by chance, his view does not prevail, his is not the practice of normal political life. Several votes have been held in the government on this draft, and I have to say that I have not always won. The government's point of view on the draft for this law was not exactly what I would have wished; despite this, I did not make the proceedings impossible, and I did not walk out. I would ask other people not act like this. [Krejci] What do you expect from the ODS Commission that has been charged with looking into the possibility of resolving the issue of Jewish property on the basis of a government decision? [Klaus] There is a strong view within the government, which I like, according to which this issue could be resolved outside the law, simply by an executive decision on returning the property in state ownership. At the same time, the communities would be asked to consider doing the same thing. The ODS Executive Committee would be pleased if this path were embarked upon. This means finding the right method, and the free transfer could take place. [Krejci] Will this solution be acceptable to the coalition partners? [Klaus] I do not envisage that the coalition partners would want to block the issue of returning Jewish property. [Krejci] Should this method also be applied in the case of church property? [Klaus] If this were to turn out to be a quick and viable method, I would not have anything against it.
