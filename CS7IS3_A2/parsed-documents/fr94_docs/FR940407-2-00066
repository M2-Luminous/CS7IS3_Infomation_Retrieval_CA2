FR940407-2-00066 FR940407-2-00036 On August 31, 1993, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe submitted an application for adequacy determination. EPA reviewed the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's application and tentatively determined that all portions of the Tribe's MSWLF permit program will ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is a Federally recognized Tribe (53 FR 52830). The Tribe has a tri-partite system of government. The Tribal Council is the governing legislative body, comprised of fifteen elected representatives. The Tribe's Chairman is its chief executive officer. The Chairman and Executive Committee oversee day-to-day operations of the Tribal government departments subject to supervision and oversight by the Tribal Council. The judicial branch consists of criminal, civil, juvenile and appeals courts and operates independently of the Tribal Council and Executive branch. The Tribe's Environmental Protection Department administers the solid waste permit program. In making today's tentative determination that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's MSWLF permit program is adequate, the Agency has tentatively determined that the Tribe has adequate authority over the activities regulated by such a program. This includes adequate authority to regulate the activities of non-Indians on fee lands within the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. The Agency believes that the Tribe has satisfactorily demonstrated that there is or may be solid waste within the meaning of Subtitle D on the Reservation and that the Tribe or Tribal members could be subject to exposure to that waste. The Tribe has also explicitly asserted that the threat to tribal health is serious and substantial. In light of the legal argument and facts presented by the Tribe and the generalized statutory and factual findings regarding the importance of solid waste discussed above, the Agency believes, after consultation with the Department of the Interior, that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has adequate authority over the activities to be regulated by the Tribe's MSWLF permit program, including the activities of non-Indians. In its application, the Tribe has also demonstrated that it has adequate resources to manage a MSWLF permit program and adequate authority to issue permits, ensure compliance monitoring and enforcement, and to provide for intervention in civil enforcement proceedings. During a 30 day period starting November, 29, 1993, EPA requested comment on the Tribe's application from certain affected parties. The State of South Dakota submitted written comments. Following review of South Dakota's comments and consultation with the Department of Interior, the Agency believes that the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has demonstrated adequate jurisdiction to justify the Agency in making its tentative determination that the Tribe's MSWLF permit program is adequate. In reaching this conclusion, the Agency has considered whether the risk of potential impacts on tribal health and welfare from existing or future MSWLFs on fee lands is sufficient to justify tribal regulation of MSWLFs at this time. However, as today's Agency determination is only tentative and as public comments are solicited and will be considered before any final Agency decision, the Agency will welcome any available information from public or private sources that pertain to the potential impacts of MSWLFs on tribal health or welfare. In its comments, the State of South Dakota presented three main arguments: (1) That the Supreme Court opinion in Brendale v. Confederated Yakima Nation precludes an assertion of tribal jurisdiction in this case, (2) That the Supreme Court opinion in South Dakota v. Bourland reaffirms and extends the ``Montana-Brendale rule,'' as interpreted by the State of South Dakota, and (3) That Congress has not ``expressly delegated'' to any Indian tribe the power to regulate non-Indians on fee lands for purposes of the RCRA. The Agency has analyzed the significance of Brendale in detail and has summarized its conclusions in the Background section above. After considering the arguments provided by the State of South Dakota and after consultation with the Department of Interior on those arguments, the Agency has concluded that its analysis of tribal jurisdiction, summarized above, is sound. Further, the Agency believes that its analysis is not changed by the Supreme Court's opinion in Bourland . Lastly, with regard to Congressional delegation of regulatory power to Indian Tribes, the Agency's does not believe that a finding of such delegation is necessary to today's tentative determination. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's MSWLF permit program, and the Agency's tentative determination of adequacy, extend to all Indian Country, defined in 18 U.S.C. section 1151, under the Tribe's control. This includes all lands within the exterior boundaries of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation and trust lands located outside the Reservation boundaries.
