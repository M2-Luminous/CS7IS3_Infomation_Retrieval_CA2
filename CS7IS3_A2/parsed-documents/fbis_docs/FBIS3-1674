That is quoted from a report in the "Notes on a Northern Journey" in the February 1994 issue of CHENG MING. Rheumatoid arthritis can be categorized as a "disease of the elderly" which is common and does not pose any threat to Deng's health. However, through diagnosis, it was concluded that Deng Xiaoping had contracted myopathy in the leg. That is an uncommon disease and more troublesome than ordinary rheumatoid arthritis. Deng will accept medical treatment in both Western and traditional Chinese medicine. This news had its origins with Wan Li and Liu Huaqing. Wan Li and Liu Huaqing Testify That Deng Has Trouble With His Legs When Wan Li met veteran comrades in Beijing at the Great Hall of the People on 5 February, he said: "Comrade Xiaoping's health is an issue of universal concern from the top tp the bottom in China and also overseas. All men have to take the last leg of the journey in life.... The Central Committee has made special arrangements for the health of Comrade Xiaoping. After a recent consultation by experts from various departments, all of Comrade Xiaoping's bodily orrgans were found to be normal as was his blood pressure and pulse. Although he is approaching 90, his train of thought remains clear, a phenomenon which experts believe to be rare at his age. The experts proposed that as Deng is getting on in age, it was advisable that he should use his brain less; otherwise, it would affect his blood pressure, especially in the evening. Recently, Comrade Xiaoping has contracted myopathy in the leg and finds it difficult to walk long distances. Presently, he is accepting medical treatment in both Western and traditional Chinese medicine." On 6 February, when Liu Huaqing feted old generals in Beijing at the Jingxi Guest House, he said: Our former Central Military Commission chairman, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is in healthy condition. The Central Committee has proposed that Comrade Xiaoping cut back walking when he goes out. He has contracted myopathy in his legs and is under medical treatment now. He still likes to stroll for an hour or so every day. The Central Committee has decided to reduce the effects on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's rest as best it can. Veteran Cadres's Minds Are Overshadowed When veteran cadres heard the briefings of Wan Li and Liu Huaqing, they started gossiping in private. Although both Wan Li and Liu Huaqing made remarks to ease their minds, some of the veteran cadres' minds were overshadowed. Many people, both in the government and the public, hoped that Deng's trouble with his legs would not develop further. Others found it uncomfortable to hear the word "myopathy." If they believed in God they would certainly pray for Deng Xiaoping. This reporter knew nothing about the word "myopathy" and when some people were terrified upon hearing it, this reporter was reminded to consult a doctor about it. A physician from a famous hospital said, myopathy is not terrible, not life-threatening, and will not necessarily shorten one's lifespan. However, there is no effective cure but some of the symptoms can be alleviated. Should the disease be found in one's lower limbs, it will affect one's ability to walk and one is liable to tumble; this being the case, the patient must have the support of others when he walks. Another physician gave a similar explanation. By inference, he believed that the reason why some people were terrified at the mere mention of "myopathy" was that they had learned from XINHUA News Agency's internal reference department: A Canadian women continuously demanded "euthanasia" because of contracting myopathy and committed "suicide" with a doctor's aid in the end. The physician said that such cases are rare. The physicians said that they had not received news of Deng Xiaoping contracting myopathy; but this reporter personally believes that, had they learned the inside story, they would not have been worried about Deng. The Central Committee Suggests Deng Xiaoping Curtail Walking It is said that Deng Xiaoping was very confident in medical treatment in both Western and Chinese traditional medicine. The Central Committee suggested that he curtail his walking; however, this stubborn elderly person has insisted on doing some exercises outdoors. In the medical treatment group comprising the experts, opinions varied. One opinion was that he should cut back walking as much as possible; and the other opinion was that he could continue walking under the condition that he did not become exhausted. Deng Xiaoping believed in the second opinion. That was because he would not easily bow before difficulties, including diseases; his character has decided that. Nevertheless, Deng Xiaoping's condition is really poorer than it was before. A CPC General Office source said that it was on the schedule that Deng Xiaoping would visit suburban Shanghai's Jinshang Petrochemical Industrial Works and Fengxian's Nanqiao on 5 February and he arrived in Fengxian that very morning. Suddenly he did not feel well and the doctor accompanying him promptly ordered the suspension of the inspection tour. That evening, his temperature rose to 39.2 degrees Centigrade and he had symptoms of acute pneumonia. On the morning of 6 February, Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Wen Jiabao, and Li Desheng took a special plane to Shanghai to visit Deng. Later, they got word that Deng must rest quietly but was not in any danger; then they took a flight back to Beijing. A source has disclosed: On 8 February, the Central Committee made the decision that Deng Xiaoping meet leading members of Shanghai Municipality and extend New Year greetings to the Shanghai people at the reception hall of the guest house in which he was being put up; however, Deng Xiaoping opposed the decision, saying: I can still walk. He insisted on meeting the municipality's leading members at the smaller auditorium of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. Ding Guangeng Indicated That Allowing Deng Xiaoping To Appear on TV in a Senile and Weak Condition Was an Inappropriate Decision On 9 February, the television newscast of Deng Xiaoping, walking with the support of his two daughters on either side was broadcast across China, instantly rousing repercussions and anxieties. That very evening, Ding Guangeng indicated to Wang Ruilin, CPC General Office Deng Xiaoping Office director, and Wu Bangguo, Shanghai Municipal Party Committee secretary, that the arrangements had been inappropriate and had resulted in bad effects. According to a CPC General Office source, on 14 February, in the wake of relaying across China the TV newscast of Deng Xiaoping's thin, pallid, and dull appearance while meeting Shanghai municipal leading members to extend New Year greetings, the Central Authorities and related departments had received some 3,500 telegrams and letters from all departments, localities, organizations, schools, army units, and foreign friends, in which their concerns were shown for Deng Xiaoping's condition, while enthusiastically wishing him good health and longevity. Jiang Zemin: The Political Bureau and I should Bear Certain Responsibility Regarding the arrangement for the senile and weak appearance of Deng Xiaoping on TV, Jiang Zemin examined himself in the written instructions on a report. He indicated that criticism had come from inside the party, the Army, and people at home, who believed that the central authorities had made an inappropriate decision in making those arrangements; at the same time, Jiang acknowledged and indicated that there were problems in the central authorities' related departments in making the arrangements and that the Political Bureau and Jiang himself should bear certain responsibility. Regarding the effects, to some extent resulting from this, it was imperative to make some assessment and have some understanding. Bo Yibo Gives Explanation of Deng Xiaoping's TV Appearance on 9 February It is learned that Deng Xiaoping arrived in Wuxi's Taihu in early December last year, heading for Shanghai later on. During this period of around two months, he was under medical treatment while meeting leading members of the party, government, and the military, conducting inspection tours at the same time. It is learned that at a gathering with veteran cadres in Shanghai, Bo Yibo made some explanation focusing on veteran cadres' opinions opposing Deng Xiaoping's 9 February appearance on TV: Comrade Deng Xiaoping was too tired; he would never stop working. He did everything for the party's cause, offered suggestions, and gave guidance to the new Central leadership tier.... Comrade Xiaoping would not rest, that was determined by his party spirit, character, and enterprising spirit. We have all persuaded him not to overtire himself, including [Jiang] Zemin, [Liu] Huaqing, Wan Li, [Yang] Shangkun, and Gu Mu. It is learned that on 19 February, Deng Xiaoping left Shanghai for Shandong's Qingdao on a special train. He talked with Wu Bangguo and others for some 20 minutes at the railway station; consequently, seven trains had to alter their departure times from Shanghai station.
