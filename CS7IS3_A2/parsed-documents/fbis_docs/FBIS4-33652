Chilean exports to Mercosur countries total about $1 billion. The Chilean business leader added that, within this context, there is an urgent need for an association with Mercosur. Venegas said that such association will mean Chilean products will not lose their competitiveness in the Mercosur market, which comprises 190 million people. Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will meet today in Buenos Aires with Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. During the meeting Figueroa will hand Di Tella a Chilean proposal for joining Mercosur -- which comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Asexma figures show that Chilean exports to Mercosur in 1993 totaled $1,089 billion, which represents 11.6 percent of all Chilean exports. Commercial trade between Chile and Mercosur countries totaled $2,850 billion. Some 74 percent of Chilean exports enter the Mercosur market under a system of preferential treatment that Chile negotiated at the bilateral level with each of the four Mercosur countries within the framework of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). In 1993, 80 percent of all Chilean exports to Argentina, the fourth most important Chilean commercial partner, were granted preferential treatment: Chilean exports to Argentina in 1993 totaled $588.9 million. The third [as received] most important Chilean commercial partner is Brazil: Some 95 percent of Chilean exports to Brazil, worth $407.1 million, were granted preferential treatment. Venegas stated that if some kind of agreement is not negotiated, many products will be seriously effected in the Mercosur market because of high tariff rates -- about 25 percent in Brazil and 20 percent in Argentina.
