Under the changes to schedule XIII of the Act, which comes into effect from February 1, a company with adequate net profits will now have full freedom to work out a suitable remuneration package for its managerial personnel within the limit of 5 per cent of its net profits if it has one, and 10 per cent of its net profits, if it has more than one managerial person, according to an official announcement here. In the event of absence or inadequacy of net profits in any financial year (where managerial remuneration exceeds 5 per cent or 10 per cent of net profits), managerial remuneration will have to be limited to amounts (varying from Rs 40,000 [rupees] a month to Rs 87,000 depending on the effective capital of the company) specified in section II of part II of the schedule. The fresh changes will make it easier for companies to attract the best available managerial talents on better terms and conditions. In July, 1993, the government had effected sweeping changes in the Companies Act raising salary and prerequisite limits from Rs 1.80 lakhs and Rs 1.35 lakhs per annum, respectively, to Rs 6 lakhs and Rs 4.50 lakhs per annum. It had also withdrawn the ceiling on commission on net profits. Mandatory 10 per cent reduction in salary in the event of absence or inadequacy of profits was stopped and loss-making companies were delegated powers to appoint managerial personnel without Central government's approval on a par with profit-making companies. Under the new changes, remuneration under section II of part II of the Act may be paid as "minimum remuneration" without the approval of the Central government. The official release said loss-making companies or companies with inadequate net profits have the freedom to work out suitable remuneration packages for their managerial personnel within the limits specified in the stipulated section. Approval of the Central government will now be required by companies in regard to managerial remuneration only if the remuneration is in excess of the limits (related to the effective capital of the company) specified in section II of part II of the schedule. The condition that a sick company should seek government clearance for appointment of managerial personnel has been withdrawn, according to the announcement. It says approval of the Centre is no longer required for a managing director or manager of a company to become managing director or manager of another company provided he opts to draw remuneration from only one of the two companies. Even in regard to such managerial personnel who are already in position on the date of the amendment in the schedule, companies may themselves raise their remuneration, from a date not earlier than February 1, 1994, without the approval of the Central government. This may be done even where the earlier appointment/remuneration had been approved by the Centre in accordance with the provisions of schedule XIII save and except in those cases where the Centre had given conditional approval in such cases.
