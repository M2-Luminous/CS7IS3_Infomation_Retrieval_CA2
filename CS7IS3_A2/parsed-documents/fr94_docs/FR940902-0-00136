FR940902-0-00136 FR940902-0-00010 (a) Regulations set forth at parts 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, and 637 of 20 CFR chapter V (1993) were amended, effective December 29, 1992, and were published as an interim final rule to provide planning guidance for States and SDA's on the changes made to the JTPA program as a result of the 1992 JTPA amendments (See 57 FR 62004 (December 29, 1992)). The transition provisions of the regulations were amended on June 3, 1992 (see 58 FR 31472, June 3, 1993). Those regulations and the statutory amendments were effective for the program year beginning July 1, 1993 (PY 1993), and succeeding program years. For PY 1992, JTPA programs and activities shall continue under the regulations set forth at 20 CFR parts 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631, and 637 (1992). (b) In order to provide for the orderly transition to and implementation of the provisions of JTPA, as amended by the 1992 amendments, this subpart I applies to the use of JTPA title II and title III funds allotted by formula to the States. Additional guidance on transition matters may be provided in administrative issuances. The provisions in this subpart are operational during the transition period for implementing the 1992 JTPA amendments. §627.901 Transition period. The transition period ended June 30, 1993 unless otherwise stated. The intent of the transition period is to complete, to the extent possible, activity begun on or before June 30, 1993 under current policy and regulations and to ensure that all requirements mandated by the 1992 JTPA amendments have been implemented. §627.902 Governor's actions. The following are actions required to be taken prior to July 1, 1993: (a) Review current policies, practices, procedures, and delivery systems to ensure that they conform to the requirements of the amendments; (b) Modify the Governor's coordination and special services plan in accordance with instructions issued by the Secretary; (c) Ensure that SDAs modify job training plans as necessary; (d) Execute a new Governor/Secretary agreement and a new grant agreement; (e) Issue procurement standards that comply with the Act and these regulations, as described in §627.420 of this part, Procurement; (f) Issue instructions necessary to implement program year 1993 cost categories pursuant to §627.440 of this part, Classification of costs; (g) Issue instructions necessary for SDAs to report program expenditures by year of appropriation pursuant to §627.455 of this part, Reports required; (h) Certify private industry councils pursuant to §628.410 of this chapter, Private Industry Council. §627.903 Actions which are at the discretion of the Governor. (a) Establish a State Human Resource Investment Council (HRIC); (b) Issue instructions to ``grandparent'' participants in JTPA programs as of June 30, 1993 for purposes of completing training; (c) Issue instructions for use of PY 1992 and prior year 6 percent performance standards incentive funds to further develop and implement data collection and management information systems to track the program experience of participants. PY 1993 and subsequent performance standards incentive funds may not to be used for this purpose; (d) Of the Title II and Title III unobligated balance of funds available as of June 30, 1993, any amount may be reprogrammed into PY 1993 activity. The Department believes these amounts will be minimal and not represent a significant proportion of the funds available. Such reprogrammed funds will be subject to requirements contained in JTPA regulations effective July 1, 1993. §627.904 Transition and implementation. (a) Review. The Governor shall conduct a comprehensive review of the current policies, procedures, and delivery systems relating to programs authorized under the Job Training Partnership Act for the purpose of ensuring the effective implementation of the amendments. Such a review shall include consideration of the appropriateness of current SDA designations, the representation on current State and local councils, the adequacy of current administrative systems, the effectiveness of current outreach, service delivery, and coordination activities, and other relevant matters. (b) Governor's Coordination and Special Services Plan (GCSSP). The GCSSP requires modification to assure conformance to the requirements of the amendments. The plan was to be modified pursuant to instructions issued by the Secretary and shall be submitted to the Secretary for review by May 15, 1993. (c) Job training plans. Service delivery area job training plans will require modification to comply with §628.420 of this chapter, Job training plan. (d) Governor/Secretary agreement and grant agreement. A new Governor/Secretary agreement is required to assure that the State shall comply with JTPA, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations; the Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations. A new grant agreement is needed to provide the basis for Federal obligation of funds for programs authorized by Titles I, II, and III, and such other funds as the Secretary may award under the grant. (e) Procurement standards. In order to ensure fiscal accountability and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in programs administered under JTPA, as amended, the Governor shall prescribe and implement procurement standards meeting the requirements of §627.420 of this part, Procurement. All procurements initiated on or after July 1, 1993 shall be governed by and follow the requirements in §627.420 of this part. Initiation of procurement means any sole source or small purchase awarded on or after July 1, 1993 and any Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal issued on or after July 1, 1993. (f) Participants. In order to have the least possible disruption to program participants, during PY 1993, Governors and SDAs have the flexibility to grandfather participants already enrolled in JTPA programs up to and including June 30, 1993 under existing rules and regulations. All participants in programs on June 30, 1993, will be eligible for transfer to programs operated under the new provisions at any time beginning on July 1, 1993. ``Hard to serve'' barriers to participation, assessment and Individual Service Strategy provisions of the amendments will not apply to participants enrolled prior to July 1, 1993 or to 1993 Title II&hyph;B participants.
