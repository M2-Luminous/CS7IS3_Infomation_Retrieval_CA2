The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and Luanda teams have not had any direct meeting yet but they are scheduled to hold one today. Meanwhile, Angola's real opposition has expressed satisfaction with UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi's call for a greater participation in the country's political life. Moreover, the UN Security Council met on 16 March and decided to extend the UN Angola Verification Mission's mandate until 31 May. Afonso van Dunem Mbinda, Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party ambassador to the United Nations, made some rather contradictory remarks on that occasion, this at a time when the two sides are working to restore peace to Angola as soon as possible. Dr. Marcos Samondo, UNITA ambassador to the United Nations, had this to say about Mbinda's remarks. [Begin recording] [Samondo] The way he spoke, Mbinda was using again the language of (?cold war), thereby giving people the wrong idea. What is happening is that the two sides really want to wind up the Lusaka peace talks as soon as possible so that we can enter a new stage of national reconciliation and unity. [Unidentified correspondent] Through Dr. Jonas Savimbi, its leader, UNITA had said last week that peace and national reconciliation would happen and that the Lusaka peace talks would be fruitful. Such a statement surely takes into account the government's position, too. However, the position conveyed by the government in New York yesterday seems to suggest that the government may be following a different path. [Samondo] On one hand, there is the hope that something is going to happen. On the other hand, what you see is that some official makes a statement, like the one made by Mbinda at the United Nations yesterday [words indistinct] and then there is the military question: at this stage, there are major movements under way by the government forces in northern Angola in general, and in Bengo Province in particular. Government forces have also been moving in Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul Provinces, in northeastern Angola, as well as in the center and south of the country. In view of that, what message are we giving the international community now? [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr. Marcos Samondo: neither side appears to be really interested in bringing peace to Angola in the near future. Each side appears to continue to believe in military victory (?even though) they affirm no military victory is possible. [Samondo] I disagree. With all respect, I would like to convey my disagreement because [words indistinct] UNITA [words indistinct] it is UNITA that is making the greater concessions. We have made concessions in the military sphere, we have made concessions concerning the police force, and now [words indistinct] discussing issues pertaining to central and provincial government [words indistinct] (? to give us two) ministries, but it did not (?accept) [words indistinct] at the hotel. When we talk about the provinces [words indistinct] the government is not even willing to give us those provinces [words indistinct]. [end recording]
