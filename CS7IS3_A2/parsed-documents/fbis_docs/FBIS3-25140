Rui Oliveira, the UNITA representative in Lisbon, has said that the government has returned to a strategy of war, and he cites Luanda's armament effort as an example. [Begin Oliveira recording] It is the MPLA that is practicing a strategy of war. It is buying war materiel from Brazil, Russia, and Spain; buying materiel in North Korea. Portugal is also involved. As we all know, as it is generally known, Portugal is giving the MPLA, the Luanda government military aid. [end recording] [Announcer] That was Rui Oliveira of UNITA in Lisbon, the spokesman for the accusations that do not even spare Portugal. The Angolan Government says it is only defending itself. [Begin David Mendes, Angolan secretary of state for the environment, recording] UNITA is not passive, it is using force. And [words indistinct] control the use of force, then we also defend ourselves with force. The government's purchase of war materiel was not part of its plan. [end recording] [Announcer] That was David Mendes, Angolan secretary of state for the environment, who is currently in Lisbon. In Angola the military conflict is being intensified. There are reports of air raids on Huambo. Both the government and UNITA claim to control 85 percent of Cuito.
