[Zemmour] Why did the PR vent its fury after the victory scored by Dominique Baudis over Jean-Francois Deniau? [Vasseur] Dominique Baudis was nominated by the French Democratic Union [UDF]. This will place him at the top of the majority's list during the upcoming European elections. We have been -- and still remain -- militant UDF members. Dominique Baudis can count on the support of the Republican Party in the upcoming European elections. However, I will not conceal the fact that the feeling dominating within the PR today is one of bitterness. Dominique Baudis is not involved in this issue; rather it is the way in which things have happened that is to blame. Of course, we are resigned to the outcome, but we feel obliged to point out that some votes would not have gone the same way a few weeks ago or even just a few days ago. [Zemmour] Could you be more specific? [Vasseur] Right up to the end, we believed that the UDF was facing a strategic choice: Which name would be best at the top of the UDF's list? Who could best reconcile the ideas and beliefs of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and the UDF, of those who voted "Yes" to Maastricht, and those who voted "No"; in other words, who would best be able to rally the electorate of the majority -- i.e., the full majority -- behind them? We believed that we are capable of that. We then found that we were the victims of people who made a choice based on the economic situation, based on a line of argument that had strictly nothing to do with the issue at hand [Zemmour] Is it Andre Santini you are talking about in this context? [Vasseur] I do not wish to name any names. I merely wish to say that after this vote some members of the PR -- and I understand their impatience and view of events -- said that they had had enough of it always being the PR which made an effort and never received anything in return. [Zemmour] In actual fact this is not your first failure to impose your views and candidates on the UDF. Should the PR not call its strategies within the confederation into question, stop outwardly playing "the tough guys" only to end up bowing to the UDF's more or less democratic procedures. [Vasseur] We are not playing the "tough guys." We are an undeniably political force, which is well organized on the ground, and has a large number of active members. Furthermore, we have long been convinced of the need for the UDF, and have merrily played the game of confederation. However, we will not sacrifice our identity. And the bad practices to which we have fallen victim are leading a certain number among our ranks to seek a new, more efficient way of affirming our identity. [Zemmour] What do you mean? [Vasseur] Some PR deputies, and by no means just a few of them, are currently lending very serious consideration to the appropriateness of establishing a Republican group in the National Assembly. [Zemmour] Would that be a terrible blow to the UDF? [Vasseur] There have been precedents. Between 1988 and 1993 the centrists formed their own autonomous group. Some CDS [Social Democratic Center] remained within the UDF, others joined the UDC [Union of the Center]. The PR deputies would do the same. So they would not be the first people to have committed a crime of "high treason" with regard to the UDF. [Zemmour] Is it a reprisal measure? [Vasseur] No. Merely, the product of our analysis of the situation. Within the UDF, most of the time the PR is smothered and cannot make itself heard. There can be no doubt that having an autonomous group would enable it to do so more. For a long time, those in favor of keeping the PR deputies within the single group of the UDF have been saying that the message and ideas of the PR would become more widespread as a result. These arguments do not stand up. We are quietly considering the establishment of such an autonomous group. This week we will be meeting to make our decision. We did not wish to raise this question until after the European elections. So the dates initially planned could now be brought forward. I repeat, this is not a reprisal measure. However, the defeat of Jean-Francois Deniau the other day was the straw that broke the camel's back. Enough is enough. In my capacity as the general secretary of the party, I am the guarantor of the party's unity, but I must admit, the arguments of those in favor of autonomy have shaken me. [Zemmour] Do you have the support of PR Chairman Gerard Longuet? [Vasseur] Until the end of last week, Gerard Longuet was in China and we could not reach him. No final decision has yet been made. Nor will any such decision be made without the backing of the party and its president. [Zemmour] An independent PR group would develop closer ties with the RPR than it had previously enjoyed. Are we heading for the open establishment of a dominant RPR-PR axis within the majority? [Vasseur] The existence of this independent Republican group will not prevent the PR from remaining a member of the UDF, just as the CDS did between 1988 and 1993. Nonetheless, it is true that we have always been in favor of a solid union within the majority. In the absence of any context, the Republican group would be an excellent link between the RPR and the UDF. [Zemmour] Nevertheless, the PR was counting on the RPR to a great extent to reject Dominique Baudis as the majority's top candidate. Are you disappointed by the choice made by the RPR? [Vasseur] Even if the RPR had rejected Dominique Baudis, Jean-Francois Deniau could not have found himself back in the saddle. However, it is true that many members of the PR had hoped that a refusal by the RPR to ratify the decision made by the political leadership of the UDF would enable a third man to emerge. The RPR made the choice that we now know. I repeat, Dominique Baudis can count on the support of the Republican Party.
