At a glance, it appears to say nothing about domestic political issues, except in passages devoted to a general assessment of the state of the nation. While other parts of the address, including those on the economy, are of course essentially linked with developments on the domestic political front, one can hardly find any specific references to them--at least as specific as those made to other topics. Nevertheless, inasmuch as North Korea has problems in each and every domain addressed in the speech--economic, military, the South and reunification, nuclear, and foreign policy--it is inconceivable that the internal political sphere alone is trouble-free. The fact is that despite its alleged stability at home, North Korea failed to achieve its economic goals and, as a result, had to allow a 3-year readjustment period. And the admission to the failure of the Third Seven-Year Plan precisely alludes to instability and chaos on the domestic political front. The 1994 Kim Il-song New Year's address contains several passages lending support to this observation. The first such passage is: "The maneuvers waged by the imperialists and reactionaries last year to isolate and suffocate our Republic and crush our socialist cause were unprecedentedly vicious, causing an extremely tense situation in our country." In fact, the so-called imperialists and reactionaries or their maneuvers from outside to isolate North Korea and crush its socialist cause, as alleged by Kim Il-song, did not exist. Therefore, what he was speaking about was internal foes, the alleged tension meaning an internal situation created by them. Next is the passage dealing with Operation Team Spirit. Under the pretext of a "severe ordeal confronting the fatherland and the revolution," North Korea declared a state of semi-war. By doing so, Kim Il-song said, it "defended honorably the dignity and safety of the socialist fatherland, demonstrating the indomitable spirit of chuche Korea to the fullest." Pending Tasks Listed in the Address Suggest Problems Since Team Spirit is an annual, defensive exercise and not a military provocation against North Korea, it can by no means be a "severe ordeal" that calls for the declaration of a state of semi-war. Nonetheless, Kim Il-song asserted that North Korea "crushed the enemies' provocations and maneuvers and honorably defended the dignity and safety of the socialist fatherland, demonstrating the indomitable spirit of chuche Korea to the fullest." What he called "provocations and aggression" here did not, in fact, exist. Then, what was it that North Korea had to defend "the dignity and safety of socialism" against? And what is the truth of "the spirit of chuche Korea demonstrated to the fullest" under such circumstances? In a nutshell, it is in effect a confession that North Korea used the training exercise, staged south of the truce line, to deal with its domestic problems, the political chaos in particular. To prove it, Kim Il-song stated that "this is a victory of the revolutionary line of our party and a victory of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses." At the same time, he explained the meaning of such victories by saying that North Korea "again forcefully proved, through severe ordeals and struggles in the recent period, that our party is a great party with an iron will and a tested leadership, that our people are a heroic people tested by revolutionary ordeals and blessed with an indomitable spirit of struggle, and that our way of socialism embodying the chuche ideology is an invincible socialism deeply rooted in the masses of people." In other words, of these two remarks, the latter explains the backgrounds of organizational issues weighed at the 21st plenum of the sixth party Central Committee held in December last year and the sixth session of the Supreme People's Assembly, while the former is gibberish aimed at justifying the results of and measures taken in those sessions. The ousting of Kim Tal-hyon and Kim Yong-sun, known as leading technocrats of the North Korean regime, could be an act of censuring them for the "severe ordeals" of the economic crisis. And the reappearance of Kim Yong-chu and his appointment as vice president; the promotion of Hwang Chang-yop, known as chuche ideology theoretician, to chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee; the rise of Yang Hyong-sop--he and Hwang Chang-yop are considered the twin masters of the chuche ideology--to No. 18 from No. 32 in the power hierarchy, and the fact that nine of the 17 new members and candidate members named to the party Central Committee are military personnel on active duty--all these measures represented moves to expand the power base of the Kim Chong-il leadership. Team Spirit Used to Deal With Political Chaos Therefore, the fact that the father-to-son succession is yet to be finalized 20 years after Kim Chong-il was officially designated the heir apparent, and that they still have work to do to pave the way for the new leadership, is the whole meaning of the political "severe ordeals"--as severe as the self-acknowledged failure of the economic plans. Such work is still needed, and the need, along with the failure of the economic plans, constitute Pyongyang's current political problems. Then, the rhetoric that North Korea "defended the dignity and safety of the socialist fatherland," and the alleged "victory of the revolutionary line of the party" and "great victory of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses" are all aimed at justifying the measures taken at those sessions. It can be said Kim Il-song meant to say that the measures primarily resolved the problems. The assertion that North Korea, as a result, "again proved that our way of socialism embodying the chuche ideology is an invincible socialism deeply rooted in the masses of people" stresses that Pyongyang will continue to implement similar measures and, through them, carry on its present system. This does not mean, however, that the domestic political confusion was brought under control completely and the basic stability regained. Needless to say, what occurred was a rehash of the perennial political disarray within the North Korean regime. This can be seen in Kim Il-song's confession that "internally and externally, our revolution remains in a complex, strained situation, and we are building socialism amid a tense confrontation with the enemies." While external enemies in the "tense confrontation" could mean the pressures on North Korea for its opening to the outside world that have continued since the collapse of the former Soviet Union and East European communist states, the "internal enemies" means political troubles or elements causing domestic tensions. Furthermore, still included among the "external enemies" is the South Korean government which North Korea views as the target of a communist revolution and as a constant threat to its system. Top Priority to Political Groundwork for Complete Succession Therefore, when Kim Il-song stated that "internally and externally, our revolution is in a complex and tense situation. We are building socialism amid a tense confrontation with the enemies," he was laying down a premise for 1994, and it was by no means an accident. He said: "...we must further strengthen the nation's political, economic and military capabilities to meet the demands of the present situation and of the developing revolution." As seen here, he was apparently saying, openly, that this year again North Korea will put greater emphasis on the political groundwork to complete the leadership succession than on the economy, and that if a military buildup should be the way to do the job, the economy shall be annexed to it. North Korea is, after all, not confronted with a threat or possible threat of "war-provocative maneuvers of the enemies." Nonetheless, Kim Il-song used such possibilities as a pretext to stress that North Korea "must pay attention to strengthening its defense capabilities." This explains his position as mentioned above. The father-to-son succession is being carried out through the military. Therefore, by the "war-provocative maneuvers of the enemies" he could mean provocations not from outside but from within the military, namely, reactions within the military against the new leadership, or at least a possible challenge to the military from within the political sphere. This cannot be ruled out. Kim Il-song emphasized that "we must be fully prepared politically, ideologically, militarily, and materially against any unforeseeable emergency, and thoroughly establish in the whole society the spirit of attaching importance to military affairs and giving positive support to the People's Army." This could be a warning of such potential forces and possibilities, issued to build the public support for the military in paving the way to consolidate the Kim Chong-il leadership. Economic Policy as Pretense To Divert Attention of Outside World Making his rhetoric more specific, Kim Il-song noted: "If we are to push ahead forcefully with the revolution and construction under the present circumstances, we must firmly grasp the guideline of ideological revolution of our party and further strengthen the wholehearted unity of the revolutionary ranks, giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance." He emphasized: "When all the people unite in one mind around the party and the leader, give full play to the spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and fight on vigorously, we can defend and preserve our way of socialism against any difficulties, enhancing it endlessly, and we can attain the chuche socialist cause victoriously." And he reiterated: "We will defend--as the apple of our eye--the wholehearted unity of our revolutionary ranks cemented rock-firm under the party leadership, and we will further consolidate and develop it." These points in the address are indicative of which way Kim Il-song will likely take North Korea this year, politically. Despite the present economic crisis, North Korea will continue to focus on political programs to prop up the Kim Chong-il leadership. It is trying to step up the mobilization of people for labor to overcome economic difficulties in the name of ideo-political unity, binding them into a united social force for a drive to consolidate the new leadership. Such intent is seen in the fact that since the beginning of this year, Pyongyang has been urging the public to step up the "learn from Kim Chong-il" movement while trumpeting the "historical inevitability of the victory of socialism," and that it lately has frequently used the expression "Kim Chong-il era." Inasmuch as the consolidation of the Kim Chong-il leadership continues to be its priority this year, North Korea will likely pursue the labor mobilization program along this line as well. The indication is in the address. Kim Il-song said that "when all the people unite in one mind around the party and the leader, give full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and fight on vigorously, we can defend and preserve our way of socialism against any difficulties, enhancing it endlessly, and we can attain the chuche socialist cause victoriously." Then, under that premise, he noted that "we will defend--as the apple of our eye--the wholehearted unity of our revolutionary ranks cemented rock-firm under the party leadership, and will further consolidate and develop it." The phrases here such as "defend and preserve our way of socialism" and "attain the chuche socialist cause victoriously" do not mean a victory as a result of economic development. So, when Kim Il-song said that "all the people unite in one mind around the party and the leader," he was stressing the need for ideo-political unity to consolidate the Kim Chong-il leadership. And when he stressed that the "unity of our revolutionary ranks cemented rock-firm under the party leadership" should be defended "as the apple of our eye," and that it should be further consolidated and developed, he was underscoring the goal of that pursuit. From this point of view, one can see that the contradictions in the Kim Il-song address--as seen its laying emphasis on a trade-first line on the one hand and urging a military buildup on the other--and the denunciations of the South unveiling Pyongyang's lack of interest in dialogue, have something to do with the above-mentioned circumstances surrounding North Korea's domestic political situation. When one sees North Korea's trade-first line as a pretense to divert the attention of the outside world to its domestic political situation, he will find how serious the situation is, that it is so serious as to require such artifice. As for the denunciations of the South, which in effect unveil the lack of interest in North-South dialogue, they represent its shopworn method fo covering up such grave realities. North Korea, while focusing on domestic political programs to promote the Kim Chong-il leadership this year, will likely continue to use foreign policy issues and North-South issues as a bulwark to facilitate its push of such programs, effectively combining them as strategic instruments.
