FR940506-0-00017 FR940506-0-00011 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 16 CFR Part 305 RIN 3084&hyph;AA26 Rule Concerning Disclosures of Energy Consumption and Water Use Information About Certain Home Appliances and Other Products Required Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act; Range of Comparability for Clothes Washers AGENCY: Federal Trade Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Trade Commission announces that the present ranges of comparability for clothes washers will remain in effect until new ranges are published. Under the Appliance Labeling Rule, each required label on a covered appliance must show a range, or scale, indicating the range of energy costs or efficiencies for all models of a size or capacity comparable to the labeled model. The Commission publishes the ranges annually in the Federal Register if the upper or lower limits of the range change by 15% or more from the previously published range. If the Commission does not publish a revised range, it must publish a notice that the prior range will be applicable until new ranges are published. The Commission is today announcing that the ranges published on April 16, 1991, will remain in effect until new ranges are published. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Mills, Attorney, 202&hyph;326&hyph;3035, Division of Enforcement, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 19, 1979, the Commission issued a final rule, 1 pursuant to section 324 of the Energy Policy an Conservation Act of 1975, 2 covering certain appliance categories, including clothes washers. The rule requires that energy costs and related information be disclosed on labels and in retail sales catalogs for all clothes washers presently manufactured. Certain point-of-sale promotional materials must disclose the availability of energy usage information. If a clothes washer is advertised in a catalog from which it may be purchased by cash, charge account or credit terms, then the range of estimated annual energy costs for the product must be included on each page of the catalog that lists the product. The required disclosures and all claims concerning energy consumption made in writing or in broadcast advertisements must be based on the results of test procedures developed by the Department of Energy, which are referenced in the rule. 1 44 FR 66466, 16 CFR Part 305. 2 Pub. L. 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 871, 42 U.S.C. 6294 et seq. Section 305.8(b) of the rule requires manufacturers to report the energy usage of their models annually by specified dates for each product type. 3 Because the costs for the various types of energy change yearly, and because manufacturers regularly add new models to their lines, improve existing models and drop others, the data base from which the ranges of comparability are calculated is constantly changing. 3 Reports for clothes washers are due by March 1. To keep the required information in line with these changes, under ยง305.10 of the rule, the Commission publishes new ranges (but not more often than annually) if an analysis of the new data indicates that the upper or lower limits of the ranges have changed by more than 15% Otherwise, the Commission publishes a statement that the prior range or ranges remain in effect for the next year. The annual reports for clothes washers have been received and analyzed and it has been determined to retain the ranges that were published on April 16, 1991. 4 In consideration of the foregoing, the present ranges for clothes washers, which were based on a national average electric rate of 8.24 cents per kilowatt hour and a national average natural gas rate of 60.54 cents per therm, will remain in effect until the Commission publishes new ranges for these products. 4 56 FR 15274.
