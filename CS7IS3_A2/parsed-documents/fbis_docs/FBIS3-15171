While it is unknown what circle of persons is involved in this process, it may prove rather wide. Your SEGODNYA correspondent has been told by Aleksandr Mikhaylov, chief of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] public relations center, that a high-ranking foreign intelligence agent was detained on 15 January. According to Mr. Mikhaylov, the detainee had been recruited by representatives of the English special service. Searches have turned up in his possession devices for cryptography and photographing of documents, instructions for dead drops in Moscow, and other things used by spies. The newspaper's office has managed to find out that the person involved is a senior official of the SMM (Spetsialnoye Mashinostroyeniye i Metallurgiya) [Special Machine-Building and Metallurgy] joint-stock company created on the basis of enterprises of the former USSR Oboronprom [defense industry] in charge of the completion of state programs in the area of armored equipment and artillery systems. The level of this position can be illustrated by the fact that he had the possibility of direct access to representatives of legal operatives of the English intelligence service under embassy "cover." The detained man is charged with passing to a foreign special service the most classified information on the newest systems of armaments and Russia's general defense potential. On 25 February, he was officially charged under Article 64, item "a" (high treason in the form of spying), and he fully admitted his guilt. The information the newspaper's office received about arrests in the FCS itself and the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information (FAGCI) have still not been officially confirmed. Mr. Mikhaylov, too, "does not confirm" (neither does he deny) the fact of a FCS officer's having been arrested. FAGCI spokesman Vyacheslav Tupitsyn told your SEGODNYA correspondent that there had been no arrests in his agency of officers suspected of the commission of crimes stipulated by articles of the "special section" of Russia's Criminal Code.
