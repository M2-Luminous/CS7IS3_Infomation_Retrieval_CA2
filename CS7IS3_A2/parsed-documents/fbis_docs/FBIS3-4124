China, he added, hoped that the issue would not go to the UN Security Council. While some difficulties had appeared in talks on this issue, all the parties concerned should show patience and adopt a constructive attitude and dialogue should be continued on a basis of equality. Neither side should pressure the other as this only aggravated the situation and would not help solve the problem. The maintenance of peace and stability in the Korean peninsula was in conformity with the interests of the Korean people and those of the other parties concerned. China would not agree to any actions including military manoevres which would harm peace and stability there. China's consistent position, he said, was to hope for a relaxation of the situation and stability in the Korean peninsula. China was for the peninsula to be a nonnuclear region and the solving of the nuclear inspection issue through dialogue. China had, he added, made every effort for the solution of this issue according to the above principles, but its role was limited.
