Sakigake has already formed a Diet group with Seiun, also made up of three JNP defectors. The "Minshu no Kaze" members will also be admitted to this group. Sakigake will register the new group shortly. In view of this, Sakigake will also allow "Minshu no Kaze" members to participate in its policy study group with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. At today's executive meeting, Sakigake Secretary General Hiroyuki Sonoda also reported on SDPJ Secretary Wataru Kubo's recent statement on his intention to participate in molding the political regime, including cooperation with the incumbent ruling coalition parties, on condition that the Hata cabinet resigns en masse. He reported that Kubo said he had merely wanted to turn the tide because people tend to think of the SDPJ as attempting to cooperate with the Liberal Democratic Party, or as favoring the dissolution of the Diet and holding lower house elections under the present medium-sized constituency system. Sonoda said Kubo explained that he was not actively thinking of returning to the coalition.
