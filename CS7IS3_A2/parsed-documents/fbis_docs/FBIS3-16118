Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin stated this at a short news conference on the results of Russian-Finnish intergovernmental talks held today. Answering journalists' questions, he stressed that the Russian leadership "is not considering imposing sanctions" against Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania. At the same time, he stated emotionally that these countries should fulfil their obligations to observe the human rights of all people, without exception, living on their territories. "We will not allow Russians in the Baltic countries who were born and who have grown up there to be treated in the future as they are being treated now. After all, we do not set any conditions for Estonians, Latvians, or Lithuanians living in Russia," he stressed. The head of the Russian Government categorically rejected the presence of a "territorial problem" in Russo-Finnish relations. He stressed that Russia would like to have "transparent" borders with Finland, and a number of intergovernmental agreements signed today are aimed toward this. "We are not thinking about how to redraw the borders, but about simplifying the mechanism for trade in border areas, and about creating free economic zones," he added. Chernomyrdin believes that the accords reached today between Russia and Finland lay the foundation for increasing trade and economic cooperation. Expressing his concern at the significant reduction in the trade balance between the two countries in the last five years, the premier said that Russia and Finland now have every opportunity not only to equal the balance figures of the mid-1980s, but also to surpass them. Answering questions from Finnish journalists, the chairman of the government stressed that Russia intends to pay off gradually its existing debts to Finland, partly with arms deliveries. Esko Aho, who also took part in the news conference, noted in this connection that this is a "reasonable" approach. "We could consider the possibilities of paying off some debts not only with deliveries of Russian military equipment, but with other goods as well."
