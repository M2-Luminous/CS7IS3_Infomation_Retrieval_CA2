Despite an official clarification by the Russian authorities, questions are being asked from many different angles. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman told a news briefing on Thursday that the value of the "antiquated submarines" amounted only to that of "hunks of iron" and that the deal was made purely on a commercial level. Similar deals are being made not only with North Korea but with other countries as well, the spokesman said. "There is absolutely no military significance in the sale," he declared. Russian Naval experts are scheduled to be present when North Korea dismantles the submarines, the spokesman said. There is also a clause in the contract that prohibits North Korea from using the submarines for military purposes. In addition, the Russian naval authorities will remove engines and other "core parts" of the submarines before they are towed to North Korea, he said. Questions persist, however, as no one can be sure the "core parts" will be removed as the spokesman said, or how thoroughly and effectively the Russian Naval experts will supervise the dismantling by the North Koreans, even if they actually are allowed to do so. Moreover, there is the ultimate question: What if North Korea wants to use them militarily? Many Western diplomats are skeptical that the Russian Naval authorities would remove core parts before the submarines' sale. According to what is so far known, the Russian Far-East fleet will sell 11 or 12 submarines and many Western observers believe there is a strong possibility that some of the submarines will be handed to the North Koreans with most of their parts intact. The Russian Far-East fleet and North Korea could work out secret deals so that three or four of the submarines could be sold without their parts removed, the observers say. There is no way of verifying this. North Korea at present possesses 26 "Romeo" and "Whisky" class submarines but it cannot operate nearly half of them as Pyongyang cannot supply parts. Under the circumstances, suspicion arises that North Korea may be trying to use parts of newly purchased submarines for its existing fleet, they say. Shibata Ariyoshi, an executive of the Japanese trading firm, Toen, which has served as middleman for the deal, contradicted the Russian claim and said all the parts were in the submarines. So far, only one submarine has been delivered to North Korea and it is being dismantled at a shipyard in Najin, northwestern North Korea, just south of Vladivostok. But it is not known whether Russian Naval experts are currently supervising the dismantling job. All that the Far-East fleet headquarters said was that its experts will be present at the dismantling work, but no details were disclosed. South Korea, as well as Japan, is consequently particularly worried over this point, sources say. The submarines that are being sold to North Korea are "Foxtrot" and "Golf II" class that are later models than the submarines North Korea currently possesses. Especially in the case of the "Golf II," the submarines carried SS-5 missiles until the late 1980s. North Korea, which has deployed submarines for a long period of time, is said to have accumulated considerable submarine know-how. It could further acquire submarine technology in the process of dismantling the submarines, if it is indeed dismantling them. Other than what the Foreign Ministry spokesman said, both North Korea and Russia, especially its naval authorities, are not saying anything at all about the sale of submarines to North Korea. The Russian Far-East fleet headquarters had first contact with the Japanese trading firm Toen for the submarine sale in September 1993 and signed a formal contract in November with the Defense Ministry's approval. One senior naval official said that the contract was signed by Russia and the Japanese firm. On paper, in other words, it is the Japanese company that is selling the submarines to North Korea. But sources said Russia took this route to sell its submarines because it did not expose the deal and it wanted a guarantee of payment for them by the Japanese company. North Korea, indeed, could be buying the submarines for scrap iron. Nevertheless, the purchase is causing international concern because it comes at a time when the world community is tense over the North Korean nuclear issue. Commenting on the latest development involving North Korea, the Russia daily IZVESTYA said there is ample reason for South Korea and Japan to worry about the submarine sale.
