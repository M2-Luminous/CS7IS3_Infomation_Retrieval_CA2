FBIS4-25268 "drchi110_w_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong `Pro-Beijing' Journalist Appointed ATV News Controller `Pro-Beijing' Journalist Appointed ATV News Controller HK0806062594 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 8 Jun 94 p 3 HK0806062594 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [Text] A senior journalist known for his pro-Beijing stance has been appointed ATV's news controller, prompting concerns over the station's future editorial policies. Leung Yu-shing's appointment follows a week of controversy at the station, during which the acting news controller, Poon Fu-yim, and five other senior staff resigned. The six were angry over the ATV management's interference in the screening of footage from a Spanish documentary on the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. The programme was eventually aired as originally scheduled last Saturday [4 June]. ATV announced Leung's appointment after the station's chief executive officer, Mark Lee, and the deputy chief executive, Clarence Chang, appeared with the six resigning staff at a Legislative Council hearing into the controversy on Monday evening. Leung has served in senior positions in a number of news organisations, including the former RTV [Rediffusion Television], RTHK [Radio Television Hong Kong), and the Chinese-language newspapers Sing Tao [SING TAO JIH PAO], Wah Kiu [HUA CHIAO JIH PAO], and Express [KUAI PAO]. Leung's most recent position was as publisher of the Chinese- language magazine Pai Shing [PAI HSING], which has folded. Leung joined the magazine when it was bought by a pro-China businessman, Tsui Tsin-tong, and turned from a fortnightly to a weekly publication. Under Leung's leadership, the magazine was criticised by readers and journalists for publishing "Beijing-friendly" articles in contrast to its previous critical stance. Tsui announced late last year that he would not continue supporting the magazine. It became a monthly publication and Leung resigned at the same time. The magazine ceased publication last month. ATV did not mention Leung's record with Pai Shing in the press release on his appointment as the news controller. Leung's service on the executive committee of the News Executive Association has also contributed little to the confidence of journalists in his commitment to press freedom. "Management won't need to interfere in the news department any more," one journalist said. "Leung will do their work for them." An ATV source said the management only decided on Leung's appointment on Sunday. The source said the management was in a rush to replace Poon and the others, because they felt they could no longer trust them, and Leung, unemployed since leaving Pai Shing, was immediately available. The chairwoman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Daisy Li, said she hoped the ATV news department would have genuine editorial autonomy in future, and not just superficial autonomy over its output. The union will meet with the six resigning ATV staff on Saturday to consider ways to avoid similar controversies. The spokesman for the Press Freedom Action Group, Chung Cho-hong, said he was troubled by Leung's appointment. "Handling of the news depends on a lot of human factors," Chung said. "So we are troubled that they hire someone with this kind of background." The group has called for Lee to make a public apology over the Spanish documentary incident, and has collected more than 2,000 signatures on a petition calling for Chang to resign. Chung said his group will not go ahead with a threatened hunger strike outside ATV's Broadcast Drive studio, and will reconsider its next step. Legislative Councillors on Monday called for new television licensing conditions to safeguard the editorial independence of television news departments.
