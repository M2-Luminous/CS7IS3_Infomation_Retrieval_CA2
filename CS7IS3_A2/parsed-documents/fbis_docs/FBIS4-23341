FBIS4-23341 "drafr107_c_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA CP Leader Says Omar Broke Agreement CP Leader Says Omar Broke Agreement MB0306112794 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0941 GMT 3 Jun 94 MB0306112794 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Pretoria June 3 SAPA -- Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg, angered by Justice Minister Dullah Omar's apparent rejection of the CP's petition for new amnesty provisions, on Friday [3 June] accused Mr Omar of breaking an agreement with the CP. Dr Hartzenberg led a delegation to Mr Omar in Pretoria on Thursday to plead for an extension of the December 6 amnesty cut-off date. He also asked the minister to consider South African Communist Party [Secretary General] Chris Hani's killers, Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus, as ordinary political criminals. Although Dr Hartzenberg said in a statement on Friday the minister had broken his word by releasing a press statement which categorically turned down the CP's proposals, Mr Omar's spokesman David Pirogo said the minister's statement was not related to his meeting with the CP. The statement said the deadline would not be extended and that the definition of political offenders may not be so broad as to include Derby-Lewis and Walus. "Our statement had nothing to do with the meeting. But Dr Hartzenberg is free to draw his own conclusions," Mr Pirogo said. He said he issued the minister's statement before the meeting "to clarify certain issues regarding amnesty". Dr Hartzenberg said he was surprised by Mr Omar's statement which had come immediately after their meeting. He said he had reached agreement with the minister that no final decisions on amnesty would be made now. The minister had undertaken to consider all the CP's proposals and to hold further discussions with the party. He said the minister had agreed to discuss final amnesty legislation with the CP. He said the minister had also agreed that the media would be told only that discussions had taken place on the CP's proposals and that follow-up discussions would be held. "While the CP kept to this agreement and simply made its proposals known to the media, Mr Omar broke the agreement. Without the promised consultation and discussions with the CP he unilaterally announced that the final cut-off date would be fixed at December 5. "During the discussions the CP asked Mr Omar to not refer in public to the matter of Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Walus, and not to present it as an exception. This request was simply ignored and in his statement he indicates that the case of Derby-Lewis and Walus will be handled differently to other cases. The CP finds this out of place," Dr Hartzenberg said. CP justice spokesman Jurg Prinsloo said that if Mr Omar issued his statement before the meeting as Mr Pirogo had claimed, this in itself implied that the CP had been negotiating about matters that had already been decided.
