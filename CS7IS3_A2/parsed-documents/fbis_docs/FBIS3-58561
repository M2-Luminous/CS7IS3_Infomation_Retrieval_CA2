The statement added that the nation has reacted to the program as it is directed against the Turkish Armed Forces, which comes from the heart of the nation. The statement issued by Hursit Tolon, secretary general of the chief of staff's office, recalls that various soldiers and noncommissioned officers participated in the program in question, which carried a report on the government decision to defer discharges from the military. Pointing out that the armed forces are continuing the necessary administrative and legal action against the personnel who participated in the program, the statement adds: According to the investigation and information obtained from the soldiers and noncommissioned officers who participated in the program, some soldiers on furlough were intercepted and interviewed so they would express views against the government decision, thereby alienating the people against military service and creating discontent within the ranks under the guise of fulfilling a lofty mission. An atmosphere that will induce the Turkish soldier -- whose love of the country, sacrifice and discipline is written down in history -- to act in violation of the hierarchic structure and tradition of the Turkish Armed Forces has been created under the guise of informing the public. The statement notes that the program sends the message that a group of soldiers and noncommissioned officers are against the government decision. What is more grave, it encourages these people to disobey the laws, the regulations, and their superior. The statement goes on to stress that despite this negative propaganda, the Turkish Armed Forces will continue their training and their war preparation activities that will enable them to succeed their duties in both peace and war, and adds: The announcement of this statement was necessary because of the reaction of our lofty people, who could not tolerate such a program that targeted the Turkish Armed Forces, which emerged from its bosom, and the army personnel.
