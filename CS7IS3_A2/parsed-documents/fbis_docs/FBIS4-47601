Six strains of Rickettsia sibirica isolated at various times from patients and D. nuttalli, D. silvarum, H. concinna ticks in Siberia and Far East by the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA fingerprinting methods are examined, and the genotypes of the R. sibirica strains are characterized. All strains under study have an identical DNA restriction fragment distribution pattern when used with an endonuclease set and the same hybridization zones with the DNA probe. The findings attest to the absence of distinctions in the genome of six R. sibirica strains isolated from various sources in the native tick-borne rickettsiosis etiological agent foci in Siberia and the Far East. Isolation of similar strains during a prolonged period serves as an evidence of their constant circulation which is probably responsible for the observed stability of its epidemiologic manifestation in the central zone of its areal. The study shows that R. sibirica is closer to R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, and R. slovaka, and the differences among them are at a strain level. The study is partially financed by a grant from Russia's National Scientific Technical Program for Priority Genetics Trends. Figures 3; tables 2; references 18: 7 Russian, 11 Western.
