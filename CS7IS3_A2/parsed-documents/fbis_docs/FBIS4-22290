A preliminary agreement concerning the consortium was signed on 9 June 1993. Kazakhstan is represented in this consortium by the state company Kazakhstankaspiyshelf, which has been assigned the role of operator. By means of tender selection, a group of six foreign companies was identified as potential members of the consortium and satisfy the basic requirements of the Kazakhstan side: The British Petroleum-Statoil (Great Britain, Norway) alliance, British Gas (Great Britain), Shell (the Netherlands), Agip (Italy), Mobil (the United States), and Total (France). The main criteria for selection of members of the consortium were: Work experience under conditions comparable to the Caspian shelf, taking into account the high ecological vulnerability of the territory, thorough analysis of technical and technological proposals, and potential financial capabilities of the companies. Implementation of the first stage of the state program for developing the shelf deposits of oil and gas of the Caspian Sea includes a three-year program of geological-geophysical and ecological research. The following basic tasks are being given to the consortium: --conducting maritime geophysical exploration on the shelf of the Caspian Sea for the purpose of studying its geologic formation and evaluating the prospects of oil and gas content; --reequipping Kazakhstani geophysical enterprises with modern recording apparatuses, a processing computer complex, and other means of supporting maritime geological prospecting work; --training Kazakhstani technical personnel in modern methods of conducting maritime oil prospecting work; --technical and financial assistance for the development of a local infrastructure. The foreign members of the consortium will fully finance the execution of work of the approved program. The total sum of the investment for the production of maritime geophysical work will amount to several hundred million U.S. dollars, including expenditures on the development of infrastructure, training, ecology, and the social sphere. Members of the consortium are extended the following privileges: --conduct of the first round of licensing is guaranteed after the conclusion of the first stage of the explorations in the most promising areas of the shelf of the Caspian Sea only among the members of the consortium; --after receiving a license for prospecting and production, members of the consortium are authorized to include in the recoupment part expenditures for the stage of geological exploration. Under all circumstances, Kazakhstan is the exclusive owner of information and data obtained as a result of execution of the program.
