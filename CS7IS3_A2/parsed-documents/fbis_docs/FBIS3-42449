Kolesnichenko, candidate of military sciences and senior scientific associate, and Col G. Panyushkin, candidate of military sciences] [Text] One Must Remember! Successful crossing of a water obstacle is possible if: 1. Crossing of the first echelon on a wide front at the required times is ensured. 2. Bridge crossings are prepared by no later than H-hour+2.* 3. Crossings are prepared in a timely manner on routes of movement and maneuver of troops with crossing capacities corresponding to crossing capacities of troop routes. 4. Repeated duplication of crossings is accomplished. 5. Reserve of crossing forces and assets is allocated. 6. Measures for camouflage and concealment of crossings are conducted. 7. Maneuver by crossing forces and assets is prepared. The first two points pertain only to a forced crossing of a water obstacle during the course of a counteroffensive (offensive) engagement. *On wide and large water obstacles, ferry (assault-ferry) crossings with traffic capacities ensuring crossing within the prescribed times may be set up instead of bridge crossings. The methods are intended for consolidated calculation of crossing several water obstacles in fighting and in dislocation of troops. The make it possible to determine the time for crossing troops over a water obstacle, the time for constructing low-level bridges and piling lines, and calculate the maneuver of crossing forces and assets along the front (at one water obstacle) and from one water obstacle to another. A particular feature of these methods is the fact that they make it possible to conduct the calculation without using formulas, graphs, or nomographs based on pre-developed tables contained in the attachment. The chief of the engineer service may require the following data to conduct the calculations: - what the battle formation of the large unit (unit) will be before each water obstacle; - the average rate of advance or required times for crossing of the large unit (unit); - the characteristics of water obstacles on forced crossing sectors and at spots where routes intersect a water obstacle; - the distance of crossings from line of contact of the sides at the staging area; - the types, number, characteristics, and locations of existing crossings; - the types, number, characteristics, and locations of crossings provided by the senior commander and also the times for crossing them; - the supply of bridge structures by the start of executing the mission and the possible pace of their preparation or the available amount of lumber; - the forces and assets allocated for preparing and maintaining the crossings. Before the chief of the engineer service begins the calculation, he must take into account the recommendations which if carried out will make it possible to ensure crossing of the water obstacles by the troops. 5.1. Methods of Consolidated Calculation of Crossing Water Obstacles in an Counteroffensive (Offensive) Engagement The calculation should be made in the following sequence. 5.1.1. Make the calculation of crossing the first water obstacle from the forward edge of the defense. To do this, determine: - the time required for crossing first- and second-echelon subunits (Table 5.1); - the forces and assets that can be used on a water obstacle, including taking into account a maneuver from other areas (from other water obstacles): - the forces and assets that must be distributed to prepare and maintain crossings at the water obstacle and in reserve; - the time for constructing low-level bridges and piling lines (tables 5.2 and 5.3). In fact, after accomplishing this point, complexes of crossings will be formed at forced crossing sectors and at places where the routes intersect water obstacles. (A complex of crossings includes the primary and several alternate crossing.) The must be plotted on a work map. Next, based on the availability of forces and assets, the situation at hand, and the time of completing construction of low-level bridges, determine the method of crossing troops (assault-ferry-bridge or assault-ferry). To do this, one must know the estimated time for crossing first- and second-echelon units (tables 5.4 and 5.5). The same tables can also be used to calculate the crossing of first- and second-echelon large units having a battle formation depth of 15-18 km. In this case, the crossing time obtained using the table must be increased 2-2.5-fold. If the time obtained is greater than the required time and the coefficient of mission performance is less than 0.8 (coefficient of mission performance is defined as the ratio of the required crossing time to the estimated time) or concentration of efforts is necessary on the axis of the main thrust, redistribute forces and assets (taking into account the possible maneuver of them along the front) (Table 5.6). Again, determine the estimated time for crossing first-echelon large units (units). The recalculation is accomplished until the coefficient of mission performance reaches 0.8-1.0. After this condition has been fulfilled and the bridge crossings have been prepared in a timely manner (at least two or three for an army or corps; at least one for a division, brigade, or regiment), further calculation of crossing a water obstacle may not have to be done--a formation, large unit, or unit may execute the crossing at the required times. 5.1.2. Determine the time of free the crossing forces and assets at the first obstacle. If the time obtained is greater than the required time and the coefficient of mission performance is less than 0.6 (coefficient of mission performance is defined as the ratio of the time required for crossing to the estimated time) or it is necessary to concentrate efforts on the axis of the main thrust, redistribute the forces and assets taking into account the possible maneuver of them along the front (Table 5.6). 5.1.3. Determine the time of freeing the crossing forces and assets, making it possible to execute a maneuver to the next water obstacle (Table 5.7). 5.1.4. Make a calculation of crossing subsequent water obstacles (done similarly to the estimate of crossing the first water obstacle) taking into account the maneuver of crossing forces and assets from the previous water obstacle. 5.1.5. Allocate forces and assets for preparing and maintaining crossings on routes lateral to the front. The effect of crossing conditions differing from normal (summer, daylight, lack of causes complicating the crossing) is taken into account by the coefficients of conditions, the values of which are given in Table 5.8. 5.2. Methods of Consolidated Calculation of Crossing Water Obstacles in a Defensive Engagement It is recommended to perform the calculation in the following sequence. 5.2.1. Determine the necessary system of crossings with reference to the hydrographic network in the defensive area and the planned network of routes. Determine the necessary degree of duplication of each crossing in the defensive area. In doing so, it is recommended to accomplish the following: On the main movement and maneuver routes, at least a two-fold duplication; on routes of advance to the line for executing a counterattack, duplication is at the rate of one alternate crossing for two primary crossings. Duplication may not have to be done on withdrawal routes from the defensive area. 5.2.2. Make a calculation of crossing each water obstacle. To do this, determine: - the required capacities of crossings in accordance with the capacities of the routes (roughly 200-250 units/hr for a large unit and 100-200 units/hr for a unit); - the crossing forces and assets, and distribute them for preparing and maintaining complexes at the intersection of routes with the water obstacle and to the reserve; - the time for constructing low-level bridges and piling lines (tables 5.2 and 5.3); - the traffic capacities of crossings being prepared (Table 5.9), compare them with the required capacities, and if necessary redistribute forces and assets taking into account the possibility of a maneuver from other areas (Table 5.6). 5.2.3. If necessary, make a calculation of the maneuver of crossing forces and assets to another water obstacle (Table 5.7). 5.2.4. Make a calculation of crossing the next water obstacles (done similarly to the estimate of crossing the first water obstacle). 5.3. Methods of Consolidated Calculation of Crossing Water Obstacles During Displacement of Troops The calculation should be performed in the following sequence. 5.3.1. Make the calculation of crossing the first of the planned water obstacles. To do this, determine: - the required traffic capacities of the crossings in accordance with the traffic capacities of the routes (roughly 200-250 units/hr for a large unit and 100-200 units/hr for a unit); - the crossing forces, and distribute them for preparing and maintaining crossing complexes at the intersection of routes with the water obstacle in question and to the reserve (the crossing complex includes a primary and several alternate crossings); - the time for constructing low-level bridges and piling lines (tables 5.2 and 5.3); - the traffic capacities of the crossings being prepared (Table 5.9), compare them with the required capacities, and (if necessary) redistribute the forces and assets taking into account the possibility of a maneuver from other areas (Table 5.6). 5.3.2. If necessary, make a calculation of the maneuver of crossing forces and assets to the next water obstacle (Table 5.7) and use the column "Time Executing Maneuver"). 5.3.3. Make a calculation of the crossing of subsequent water obstacles (done similarly to the calculation of the crossing of the first water obstacle, taking into account the possible maneuver of crossing forces and assets from one water obstacle to another). 5.3.4. Allocate forces and assets for preparing and maintaining crossings on routes lateral to the front. Attachment: Table for Calculating Crossing of Water Obstacles Table 5.1.
