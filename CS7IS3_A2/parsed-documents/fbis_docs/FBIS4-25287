Until 1992, China exported virtually no metallic magnesium to the United States, researchers from Antaike Information Company said. In the past two years, exports of magnesium ingot to the US have grown quickly, but still only account for a small percentage of the US market, said the researchers, who work under the China National Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corporation. US manufacturers last month accused seven Chinese companies of dumping metallic magnesium at a much lower price than the market standard. Product dumping is usually intended to garner a bigger slice of that nation's market. The mainland exported 1,090 tons of magnesium ingot to American 1992, according to the General Administration of Customs. Exports rose to 1,148 tons last year, about 5 percent of total US imports of metallic magnesium. But imports from China only account for 2 percent of the total consumption in the United States, the information company said. The lawsuit is based on US manufacturers' little knowledge of the magnesium industry in China, company experts said. China is rich in magnesium resources, with 62 smelting factories across the country, but only 5 State-owned. Since the 1980s, the industry has expanded rapidly. Annual production capacity has now reached 20,000 tons, far outstripping domestic demand. Excessive imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States through barter trade also swelled supply on the domestic market. The State is urging domestic producers to face this outlook head- on and turn their eyes to the world market. Exports amounted to 7,456 tons last year, up 118 percent over 1992 and prices are higher than their production costs. The Minhe Magnesium Factory, in Qinghai Province, is China's largest producer with an annual output of 4,000 tons.
