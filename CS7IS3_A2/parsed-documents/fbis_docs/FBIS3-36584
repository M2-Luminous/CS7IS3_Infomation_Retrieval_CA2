These include a mechanism of account-settling, budgetary problems, the rate of exchange of the Russian and Belarussian currencies and a single price system. Unlike Moscow which insists on a single budget, Belarus wants to hold back to its own budget because of fearing to forfeit its sovereignty. It was agreed that the Russian and Belarusian currencies would be exchanged at a one-to-three rate for non-cash operations and a one-to-one rate in cash settlements. (In a formal letter to the Belarusian government, the IMF recommended a 1:2.5-3 rate of exchange. IF). The agreed rate of exchange is not final being subject to substantial change, the negotiator said. Nor was there any final agreement reached on uniform price policies. But preliminary counts indicate Minsk will inevitably have to sustain part of the cost for the maintenance of Russian army bases deploying long-range nuclear weapons there if a monetary union deal is signed. Contrary to local expectations, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was due to arrive in Minsk next week to sign a package of agreements on the monetary union, was unlikely to arrive there until February 18, the official said.
