Under the circumstances, Japan will have to continue to take a two-pronged stand for some time by "closely watching future developments while studying various necessary measures to prepare for a contingency" (according to a top Foreign Ministry official). In the past few days, senior Foreign Ministry officials have been emphasizing the "dominant trend of dialogue" to leaders of the ruling and opposition parties, saying: "Things are moving toward a solution right now. There should be no misunderstanding concerning this." The ministry is concerned that if "frightening discussions" on questions such as sanctions or legislation to deal with an emergency come to the fore, this may provoke not only the DPRK but also the ROK and the United States. The working-level meeting between Japan, the United States, and South Korea in New York on 24 May which agreed on continuing the policy of dialogue and coordination between the three nations if sanctions are imposed on the DPRK was a cooperative gesture in line with the U.S. policy of continuing the dialogue. However, after the North Korea-IAEA talks broke down, a pessimistic view is again gaining ground inside the government. Some say: "We have been betrayed by North Korea so many times. This time, although we have not been optimistic, we were hoping for at least some progress" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). Some government officials now take the view that the high-level talks between the United States and North Korea will inevitably have to be postponed. Even in the United States, the prevailing view is now in favor of sanctions, claiming, "If U.S.-North Korean talks are held without verifying the existence of nuclear arms in the DPRK, this will just be falling into the North Korean trap." If no improvement is seen in this situation, UN economic sanctions will inevitably become the focal issue. The Japanese Government may also be forced to make a major decision. Even if the third round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks are held as scheduled, it is entirely possible that North Korea will continue to play the nuclear card in the future. It is believed that "sooner or later, there will have to be a solution to the basic issue of whether inspections will be permitted at two facilities, which were not opened to IAEA and are highly suspected of holding nuclear devices," according to a Foreign Ministry source. Days of anxiety are expected to continue for the Japanese Government.
