Revisions to Committee Regulations; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 220␣/␣Wednesday, November 16, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR SEVERELY DISABLED 41 CFR Parts 51&hyph;2, 51&hyph;3, 51&hyph;4, 51&hyph;5, 51&hyph;6, 51&hyph;8, and 51&hyph;9 Revisions to Committee Regulations AGENCY: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule updates the regulations of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled to reflect developments and changes in Committee procedures which have occurred since the regulations were last substantively revised in 1991, and to include wording changes that were overlooked in that revision. The new revisions were made necessary by changes in the Government procurement process, of which the Committee's program is a part, and by the Committee's experiences since 1991, including litigation, which have demonstrated that the regulations do not always clearly reflect the authorities given the Committee by the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act and other laws as implemented in its procedures. The rule will enable the JWOD Program to operate more efficiently to fulfill the Committee's mission of increasing employment opportunities for people with severe disabilities through the Government procurement process. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 16, 1994.
