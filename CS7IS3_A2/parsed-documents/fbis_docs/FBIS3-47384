Speaking to newsmen in Denpasar, the regional commander clarified that de Mello will be free to talk to anyone or visit any place he wishes in East Timor. Therefore, no restrictions will be placed against Galvao de Mello compared to (Manuel Tillman), a Macau (?programmer) who was originally from East Timor and has been visiting Dili for the past week. The regional commander hopes Galvao de Mello, who has been given the freedom to visit East Timor, will personally observe the existing situation there. He also hopes de Mello will then clarify to the Portuguese community what he observed without distorting any facts. Meanwhile, after a meeting with the regional commander, de Mello said his current visit to East Timor has no specific bearing and that it was only aimed at further fostering ties between Indonesia and Portugal.
