FR940617-1-00049 FR940617-1-00012 While safety data (Refs. 1, 2, 6, and 7) are sufficient to establish safety for short-term use such as for a patient preoperative skin preparation drug product, these data do not resolve concerns about long-term chronic toxicity. Conclusions on these data, which were also reviewed by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products (Antimicrobial II Panel) in conjunction with its review of OTC topical antifungal drug products, were published in the Federal Register of March 23, 1982 (47 FR 12480). That Panel, which evaluated the safety of the ingredient for use in OTC topical antifungal drug products, categorized chloroxylenol (0.5 to 3.75 percent) as safe (Category I) for short-term use (up to 13 weeks) and advised, ``*␣*␣*␣relatively low doses of chloroxylenol can be systemically tolerated, at least over a 13-week period. The Panel is concerned about the effect of chronic administration on the liver, but does not consider that topical application of chloroxylenol to small areas of the skin over short periods of time would result in liver damage.'' (47 FR 12480 at 12534). The agency subsequently agreed with the Panel's conclusions concerning the safety of using the ingredient in OTC topical antifungal drug products for the treatment of athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm (maximum treatment duration 4 weeks) in its tentative final monograph for these OTC drug products, published in the Federal Register of December 12, 1989 (54 FR 51136 at 51139). The agency subsequently finalized these conclusions in the final rule for OTC topical antifungal drug products published in the Federal Register of September 23, 1993 (58 FR 49890). Regarding long-term chronic toxicity, data and information provided by one manufacturer included final reports of completed studies and interim reports of incomplete studies (Ref. 2). The information also contained a protocol of a planned preclinical study (projected starting and completion dates for experiments) which identified a 2-year rat feeding study. Because this study might resolve concerns about long-term chronic toxicity, the agency requested the raw data (Ref. 31); however, the manufacturer declined to submit the data, explaining that it is no longer interested in marketing chloroxylenol, that its study had not been completed, and that the study was conducted prior to establishment of the Good Laboratory Practices regulations (Ref. 32). In response to the agency's determination that data from a 2-year rat feeding study were essential (Ref. 33), another manufacturer submitted additional information along with copies of already available safety data (Ref. 34). The manufacturer explained that it believes that long-term safety data, i.e., 2-year oral feeding study, while not currently available, may not be a necessity. Citing statements made by the Panel, that its recommended guidelines for the safety testing of these drug products were developed primarily for antimicrobial agents applied to the entire body surface and that appropriate tests should be chosen to reflect the intended use of the antimicrobial drug product (39 FR 33103 at 33135), the manufacturer contended that the guidelines were developed to address the most extreme exposure to an antimicrobial ingredient rather than to describe the minimal requirements for safety data that the Panel would find acceptable. Noting the contrast between the use of surgical hand scrub drug products (products used by adults in a limited area of the body for a specified time span) with lifetime application to the entire body in bar soaps, the manufacturer contended that while the use of a surgical hand scrub is considered chronic use, the exposure to the antimicrobial ingredient during such use is limited to the hand and half the distance to the elbow. The manufacturer further suggested that one might simply regard the use of health-care antiseptic ingredients in handwashes and surgical scrubs as repeated daily use in a limited area of the body. The manufacturer contended that data from a 2-year feeding study would not contribute any information on the long-term safety of chloroxylenol that is not already available from subchronic studies (Ref. 35). In support of its contention, the manufacturer submitted data from subchronic animal toxicity and human bathing studies (Ref. 18) previously submitted in response to the tentative final monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products and to the Antimicrobial II Panel. The data also included computer simulation models (Ref. 36) of plasma levels of chloroxylenol that might occur after dermal applications of varying concentrations of the ingredient. The simulations, based on urinary excretion data from human bathing studies, predict a lack of potential for accumulation of the ingredient in humans. Subsequent submissions from the same manufacturer included a review article on the toxicity of chloroxylenol (Ref. 19), a retrospective analysis of the value of chronic animal toxicology studies of pharmaceutical compounds (Ref. 20), and copies of all available toxicity data for chloroxylenol (Ref. 21). Included in the toxicity data was a kinetic analysis (Ref. 37) of data from human and animal studies of the ingredient previously submitted to the agency that also predicts that accumulation in humans is not likely to occur at reasonable exposure levels. Based on the above data and information, the manufacturer requested that the agency reconsider the necessity of a long-term animal study. In response to the manufacturer's request, a public meeting was held to discuss the available toxicity data for chloroxylenol. At that meeting, the agency noted that many of the subchronic studies of the ingredient are of limited usefulness because they were conducted using a formulated product that contained isopropyl alcohol, turpineols, and castor oil soap in addition to chloroxylenol. The kinetic model used in the studies was considered inappropriate. A one-compartment model, as used in the analysis, is not relevant to chloroxylenol due to its lipophilic nature. The agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 38 and 39).
