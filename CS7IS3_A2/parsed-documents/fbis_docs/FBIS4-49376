The meeting of the U.S., Russian, French, British and German foreign ministers is expected to take place in Geneva on May 13, U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said in a statement after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Cairo where they attended the signing ceremony of Israel-PLO peace agreement on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. Christopher and Kozyrev "expressed serious concern over the continuing instability of the situation in Bosnia which could spark another dangerous point of conflict," McCurry said aboard Christopher's aircraft from Cairo to Washington, which stopped in Ireland to refuel. The two ministers urged Bosnian Muslims and Serbs to cease hostilities and rEsume negotiations without preconditions on an overall peaceful settlement. They also called for immediate steps to prevent offensive military action in the Serb-held Brcko area of northern Bosnia. Christopher, aboard his aircraft, said he supported deployment of UN troops to Brcko to head off an impend)ng major battle between Muslim and Serb armies for a vital Serb supply corridor on which the town lies. The contact group was established last month to put together diplomatic efforts of the U.S., Russia, the European Union and the United Nations to end the two-year-old Bosnian conflict.
