Starting from scratch, with 17 kindred spirits, he established a mining company in Dalnegorsk--in a city in the northern Maritime area. For a certain time the enthusiasts worked at their business, specifically "their own," without losing courage, literally "working for nothing." They did not divide the first profit of 25,000 among themselves and, with patient agreement, the wives invested in the production. After a certain number of such turnovers this was a unique enterprise in which everything became beautiful a la Chekhov: the work, the life of the worker, and the amazing harmony with work-giving nature. In May 1993 Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko was entrusted to manage Maritime Kray. And in December 80 percent of Maritimers voted for him as a deputy of the Federation Council. [Nazdratenko] I could have improved things more in my mining business. But concern for the future, at least for my children, did not permit me to continue to live in an oasis, when there is devastation all around. This is what led me to today's post--anguish over how my countrymen are forced to live. And I am confident that my team shares it completely. [Vstovskaya] The inheritance that fell to your lot, Yevgeniy Ivanovich, is not enviable. The time has come to shovel aside the obstructions of the Maritime economy... [Nazdratenko] Not even local obstructions, but the consequences of the breakdown--the financial system of the country and nonpayments. On one hand the kray has very rich resource capabilities and very valuable experience in interbranch cooperation, and on the other, there is a euphoria of permissiveness and absence of control, pilfering of state property, and a transfer of raw materials abroad. Many know how at one time I fought for the idea of joint-stock companies. I was one of the first to establish an enterprise with a nonstate form of ownership, which the communists did not like: At that time there was no talk yet about conversion to joint-stock companies and privatization. But now the democrats are accusing me of conservatism, calling me a partocrat and an opponent of progress. But I am not against the processes themselves, I am against the methodology of conducting conversion to joint-stock companies. Who in the country needs this conversion to joint-stock companies, when all of our industry has "died." Who becomes the owner, and the owner of what? The owner of the graveyard of industry, perhaps? Or is the situation similar to that of the Bor association. If the subscription for stocks brings with it a 30-40 percent reduction in the number of workers, and the people under the conditions of a single-industry village or a single-industry city cannot find work anywhere, then, tell me, who needs such conversion to joint-stock companies? Directors should not blindly carry out directives from the top, but, with a sense responsibility for the people in the creation of state programs, should proceed from local conditions. If you cannot find an optimal solution with the record and progress of production and the interests of the people, then it is better that you leave and not taint yourself with sin! Therefore, it is all the same to me what I will be called--a democrat, a communist, or a Bolshevik--the main thing is that I am confident that I am acting in the interests of the people. Now the question has been raised: to give complete authority to convert to joint-stock companies on the territory, taking local conditions into account. It was necessary to have three years of such savage and snarling privatization to understand just what we have piled up. But now they are letting the localities unravel it. Did I not say turn to conversion to joint-stock companies, but in the direction of the people?! [Vstovskaya] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, at the same time, industry has used up the energy requisitions. Nonetheless, it was possible to live through the winter and not freeze, and not to be in debt to the Federation. [Nazdratenko] My team and I are frequently accused of going to Moscow to scrounge for money. But we demand only that which is our due. In what way, for example, is the single-industry city Bolshoy Kamen, with its Zvezda plant that repairs submarines, guilty? What--is it asking for subsidies? No--it has a positive balance sheet. In what way is the aircraft-building city of Arsenyev to blame? Is it asking for subsidies? It has a positive balance sheet. How is the group of plants, including Dalzavod, guilty? They fulfilled their duties to the government. I am not asking for subsidies. I am asking them to pay for produced products. Pay them! They will then receive their wages, they will pay taxes, they will pay for electric power, we will pay for fuel--to the krays and regions of Russia--and everything will take its normal course. Therefore, when the state law on bankruptcy is being prepared, it is not entirely understandable to me in this situation. After all, the bankrupt is now the state, which does not pay the plants, and they become bankrupt. How can such a law be implemented? First pay, and then it will be clear who is a bankrupt and who is not. It is necessary first to become familiar with the credit-financial system in the country. Now, as for energy requisitions. If we use the terminology of Gaydar's doctrine--everyone under market conditions should have equal conditions for getting started... Excuse me, what kind of starting positions does the Maritime area have? When, for example, the energy surplus in the chain of the Siberian GES [Hydroelectric Power Station] puts the cost of a kilowatt-hour at 9 rubles [R]. On Kamchatka it is R230, Sakhalin--R170, Khabarovsk--R87, and Magadan--R90. In Maritime Kray it is R40, the lowest of the Far East cities, but this is owing to the fact that in August it was possible, together with the government, to work out the wonderful Decree No. 1001 on stabilization of the economy of the kray, which guaranteed Maritime Kray special help from Russia, which is being implemented in the part of the subsidy to the fuel-energy complex. After all, Maritime Kray is the main eastern gateway and the transport back of Russia, and carries a huge load. The energy crisis of budget enterprises practically does not affect defense industries. What difference does it make to a defense enterprise how much a kilowatt-hour costs, it makes no difference, it is paid for out of the state budget. But for the rest of the enterprises--commercial, fish processing, mining, lumber, and building branches--after all, these same figures stifle every kind of production. I think that average tariffs should be adopted for the entire territory of the Russian Federation. Whether for the Kola Peninsula, where there is a surplus of nuclear electric power stations, or Siberia, where there is a chain of Siberian electric power stations, or for the Maritime area, which has very little energy of its own production. We did not live this winter--we survived. I am so grateful to all the people for their patience! There truly was a frontline situation. It was even necessary to evacuate whole villages in some regions of Russia. Thank God it did not reach this point here. The absolutely helpless people were covered in this terrifying situation. Pensioners and invalids. In a word, it was easy to control the money that was released for these purposes. To resolve the question of energy supply for the Maritime area, the Ussuriysk TETs [thermal electric power station] has to be completed. But the question arises: How is it to be fed? It will be necessary to develop new open-pit coal mines. And to have our own coal, and not depend on the central part of the country. For the reason that after tariffs on electrical energy, the second hitch is railroad tariffs, which cut off the oxygen for the railroaders themselves: 37 percent of the freight was not shipped, and they remained out of work. But if we have our own coal, which will not have to be conveyed from far off, the cost of electric power will become cheaper, and the enterprises will be able to take a deep breath of air. And we will solve the problem for a minimum of 10 years. But this will require the assistance of the Government of the Russian Federation. The present railroad tariffs do not permit the kray to either import or export anything. When you pay R120 million for one rail car from Vladivostok to Moscow, what can be carried in it? It is unprofitable. Therefore, we are correct in already buying grain abroad this year, and bringing it in by sea. And meat, and macaroni products... An edict of the president on support for Russian grain producers was being prepared. This edict established huge duties so that we would not import grain from abroad. In principle and in logic--yes, all rural residents should welcome this. But in the Maritime area, which is oriented on the defense industry, and where the terrain is mountainous and not much grain is grown, this is unacceptable. We talked about this in the government. We had numerous proposals and were able to convince the president and the government, and they passed a decree according to which there is no duty on imported grain, and there is a differentiated approach to other products. Consider--an ocean liner takes 12 days from Canada and carries 10,000 tonnes of wheat at one time, at an acceptable price. A tonne of Canadian wheat costs us R100,000, while a tonne of Altay wheat costs R270,000. Which is better? Incidentally, the government treated us with complete understanding, and exempted us from customs duties with respect to grain. And we will without fail find how to support our own grain producers and other agricultural products. [Vstovskaya] The government also heard the appeals of the administration regarding fair export quotas and duties for enterprises that were glutted! [Nazdratenko] I also consider this to be a victory of common sense. Six enterprises of the mining industry of Maritime Kray for whom duties were removed will be able to sell part of their concentrate and its production abroad. The enterprises have once again begun to work at full capacity, and people have gone back to their jobs. Previously some of the most profitable enterprises--Dalnepolymetall, Bor, and the well-known Spassktsement, although it was idle all winter, are beginning to work at full speed. And now orders have come in for cement. Only Khrustalnenskiy GOK [mine processing combine] is not part of such enterprises. Its position is more complicated, inasmuch as the central mine there ran out, and it is being closed down. But this combine makes up the town: It is the only large employer in the village of Kavalerovo. Therefore we are concerned for it and the whole village. We are now working on an agreement with Kamchatka where there are a number of gold, nickel, and sulfur deposits. Part of the resources will be moved there, and work will be conducted on the watch method. This, probably, is right. [Vstovskaya] All this is extremely necessary and appreciable, but it is unskilled labor. Is it already possible to construct a building on a level platform? [Nazdratenko] We have already started to draft an important decree, and we are coming to an agreement with the government on a concept of the status of Maritime Kray and its development. I think that this will be a working document, if the government accepts it. It has gotten an "OK" from Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Government-Council of Ministers. Only scientists of the Far Eastern Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences are involved. No one from abroad will be brought in--only with our own mentality! Whatever we come up with is what we will live with. There will be nobody to accuse of leading us down the wrong path. Of course, the prologue was Decree No. 1001. A lot of good things are outlined there. Our latest document that is being prepared on the status of the kray in light of the new constitution, according to which we all became components of the Federation (that is, everyone worries about his own territory) with a unified constitution and a unified political system, will make it possible to take into account the economic interests of the Maritime area as a part of Russia and the Far Eastern Region. To determine in what directions and how its economy will exist independently. Part of this big concept for the development of the Maritime area is the outlook of the kray under conditions of a transfer to the market in light of the geostrategic and economic interests of Russia is being developed on resources from the budget of Russia. [Vstovskaya] How do you see Maritime area relations with other territories of the Far East? [Nazdratenko] The problems of the Maritime area, Kamchatka, Magadan, Sakhalin, and Khabarovsk could be resolved in one idea. Apparently, the tsar who did not divide these krays and oblasts, but simply named a governor-general, was not stupid. I think that the time will come when we will have to unite. I, at least, am taking big steps toward this. We must integrate; otherwise, each will be selling its resources abroad for a song. I would see such cooperation here. Although there are a lot of differences internally as well. In a word, I am an industrialist, and I treat our Maritime area as one big economy. We lived through the winter. And although it was very difficult (but, in addition, endless audits and dirty tricks were distracting), I am not disappointed in the work. And concern for the next winter is already pushing people into action. Because we did not succeed in developing open-pit mines, we did not succeed in developing coal supplies. We did not succeed in completing the construction of the Ussuriysk TETs. We need state money--there is none. There are many problems. One thing is left: For us, Maritimers, to continue to work, rolling up our sleeves, together with other Far Easterners. To work in a good way with the government and to resolve tasks that life presents us logically and not simply to put forth slogans.
