This comes as part of his tour of the region to discuss current contacts and the resumption of negotiations. Musa said in statements today that after the negotiations resume, the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles should be implemented quickly and autonomy should begin in Gaza and Jericho. He added that there is no reason for the continuous stalling and postponement of the Israeli withdrawal and implementation of the agenda agreed on in the Declaration of Principles. We are waiting for this agenda to be finalized, he said, as long as all the parties agree to negotiate. As for postponing negotiations on the settlements until the final stages of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, Musa said in his statements that the final stage of the negotiations must not be delayed beyond the end of the second year after implementing the current agreement on Gaza and Jericho. The foreign minister clarified that if the Israeli withdrawal and Palestinian repatriation were to begin a month from now, in April, for example, arrangements should begin then. 'Amr Musa affirmed that the important issue is to immediately stop building new settlements in the occupied Arab territories. No new settlements should be built. 'Amr Musa affirmed that the presence of settlements in the occupied Arab territories causes security violations. Besides, the territories on which these settlements are built do not belong to them. They have absolutely no right to build. Most settlers are criminals, which is not acceptable. We understand that there can be coexistence but we do not understand why a group of crazy criminals or crazy people should be in control, such as Gush Emunim, Kahana Hay, and their ilk, because this is terrorism in its purest form; it is the dangerous and blind kind of terrorism based on fanaticism that is recognized by no law. This is a very important issue. The foreign minister again demanded that the Palestinians be provided with security. He said this is the lesson we have learned from the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Musa also asked the Israeli occupation forces to provide the Palestinian people under occupation with protection. This is stipulated by international resolutions. On the Addis Ababa meeting to convene on 23 March, Musa said that one of the most important topics proposed to the meeting is the mechanism for resolving conflicts in Africa. It will be chaired by Egypt, the current chairman of the OAU. He said the mechanism will address the issue of the OAU's intervention in current conflicts and in the prevention of disputes that might erupt. He added that they will discuss the Somalia issue and developments in this connection following the dialogue that took place in Egypt among the 13 Somali factions. Burundi, the conflict between Cameroon and Nigeria, and the situation in Rwanda will also be addressed.
