Smirnyagin, a permanent expert on regional policies, told ITAR-TASS that under the Russian Constitution subjects of the federation have no right to alter a region's status unilaterally. Moreover, such acts by republics' politicians destroy the federation. If such a step were taken, this would mean violation of the principles of state structure of Russian Federaion, Smirnyagin said. He said he is amazed at Ilyumzhinov's intention to implement his idea without discussing it with Kalmykia's population and without holding a referendum. Commenting on possible political motives of the Kalmykian leader, the member of the Presidential Council recalled Ilyumzhinov's unsavoury role in the autumn in last year when he virtually backed those who unleashed bloody events in Moscow. "Probably the Kalmykian leader by his awkward initiative now tries to please Moscow and get absolved of his sin," Smirnyagin notes.
