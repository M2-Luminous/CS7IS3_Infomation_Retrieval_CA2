FR940902-0-00046 FR940902-0-00010 One of the §627.420(e)(2) requirements for cost analysis comes into play when the offeror is required to submit the elements of the estimated cost. This is clarified by indicating that this requirement applies in the case of subrecipient relationships. Subrecipients are required to allocate costs to the various JTPA cost categories; therefore, they are to submit the separate elements of their costs. Section 627.420(e)(3) reiterates the requirement of section 164(a)(3)(D) of the Act that ``procurements shall not provide excess program income *␣*␣* or excess profit.'' The Act lists some of the factors that shall be taken into consideration in determining whether program income or profit is excessive. Through the regulations, additional factors from OMB Circular A&hyph;102 have been added. Further, based on this Circular, the instances when profit or program income is negotiated are defined. A few commenters on this section, as well as §627.440, Classification of Costs, raised questions concerning fixed unit price, performance-based contracts (FUPC's), including whether FUPC's could continue to be used and, if so, whether costs could be allocated to the JTPA cost categories based on budgeted amounts or whether they must be charged based on actual costs incurred. Concern also was expressed both over the requirement that offerors certify their costs and the prohibition of excess program income or profit, in relation to fixed-price agreements. The Department continues to believe that the use of performance based awards may be of significant benefit in serving JTPA customers. In addition, the use of a total fixed price or ceiling price in making awards may also be an effective mechanism. The regulation does not prohibit reasonable profits in the context of a fixed-price agreement. Fixed-price agreements are instruments that place more risk on the awardee than do cost reimbursement agreements. The reason for this is that the awardee, under a fixed-price agreement must perform the work, regardless of the costs to the awardee. In the case of an awardee under a cost reimbursement type of agreement, the awarding agency will reimburse the awardee for its allowable costs. If the awardee under a fixed-price agreement is able to do the work at a lower cost, due to efficiencies in operations, and this increases the level of profit, the awardee is due that additional profit. If successful awardees who have increased profit due to efficient performance are required to reduce their earned profits to the budgeted levels, this would result in a disincentive for organizations to perform their work more efficiently, quickly, etc. If the additional profit results from cost data that was not accurate, complete or current, as certified, then the awarding agency may be able to recoup that excess from the awardee. Thus, the requirement that costs be certified provides a needed protection to awarding agencies. There has been skepticism that fixed price contracts, as utilized in JTPA, did not contain risks for the awardee or operate as performance/outcome based agreements. The system can expect continued high levels of scrutiny by the OIG in the case of fixed price agreements. In the case of awards to subrecipients, when: (1) The awarding agency has done a cost and price analysis; (2) this analysis has been documented; (3) the conclusions arrived at are reasonable; and (4) the offeror has certified in writing that to the best of its knowledge and belief, the cost and pricing data submitted are accurate, complete and current at the time of agreement on price, the awarding agency may find it appropriate to use a fixed-price type of agreement. The costs of such an agreement may be allocated among the benefitting cost categories based upon the ratios established in the cost analysis. One commenter did not believe that it was the Department's intent to require SDA's/SSG's to track profit earned by commercial organizations. In point of fact, section 165(g)(1) of the Act requires each State, SDA, and SSG to maintain records with respect to subrecipients, including commercial organizations, that identify any program income or profit earned.
