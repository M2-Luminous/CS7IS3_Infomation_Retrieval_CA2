Gromak: "Admiral Kravchenko's Five Proposals"] [Text] The Baltic Institute of Strategic and International Research has held in Tallinn a conference on cooperation and security in the Baltic Sea region. You must admit that the subject is very important to all the countries located on the Baltic Sea. The conference was attended by delegations from 16 countries. Also a delegation of seven NATO representatives headed by Brigade General Tom Lennon, deputy chief of the program for military relations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe, arrived to Tallinn, including German, Finnish, and Norwegian ambassadors to Estonia. Since the organizers "had forgotten" to invite the Russian envoy, Russia was represented by Vice Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, first deputy commander of the Baltic Sea Fleet. Among the participants were also Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, and Estonian President Lennart Meri. The latter delivered the opening speech at the conference, the merit of which was boiled down to an analysis of the results of the elections in Russia. Only Zhirinovskiy's victory was discussed at the conference, summarized one of the participants. According to the Estonian president's speech, the electoral victory of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is a factor threatening the security of the Baltic states. Therefore, NATO should become a guarantor for their security. I have repeatedly emphasized in my statements and in numerous conversations, said Vice Admiral Kravchenko, that neither electoral victory of a separate party nor even a change of the government would mean a significant change in the political course. The more so, since democratic parties and movements will have a majority in the new legislature. Personally, I believe that our elections have come in very handy for the Baltics... The first deputy commander of the Baltic Sea Fleet is not alone in his opinion on this issue. One does not have to be a great politician to understand that the representatives of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania replaced a serious discussion on solving real security problems of the Baltic Sea region, with their ambitions to obtain international support for imposing on Russia ultimate terms for troop withdrawal, as well as to receive the moral right to introduce openly discriminative measures against the Russian- speaking population of the Baltic states. Moreover, this was done in a rather rough and primitive manner, which generated negative reaction even among the NATO representatives. One should seek Russia's advice. No matter what difficulties it is currently experiencing, Russia is a large state, and one should talk with respect with a large country, they stated in their official speeches and private conversations. In response, Lennart Meri commented that the United States sacrificed the interests of the Baltics to the global peace problems and the continued reforms in Russia. This way, a conference on very important issue was converted by its organizers into a strictly propagandist meeting. Only the speech by Vice Admiral Kravchenko and concrete proposals of Baltic Sea Fleet navy men brought some fresh air into it. What did Vice Admiral Kravchenko exactly propose? First. To draft an agreement on the free traffic of navy vessels, in accordance with the international law on navigation and the existing system of marine traffic control in the Gulf of Finland. Second. To legalize and establish a permanent connection between the command of the Baltic Sea Fleet and the commands of the Baltic states' navies; to coordinate plans for naval training; and to establish regulations on emergency procedures. Third. To provide security within economic zones of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia during naval maneuvers, the Russian side is willing to take into account reasonable economic interests of ship owners and fishermen of these countries. Fourth. To establish cooperation between the hydrographic services of the Russian Federation and the Baltics, including the establishment of a system of mutual exchange of navigational and meteorological data. Fifth. The issue of cooperation in emergency situations remains unsolved, since Russia does not have an appropriate agreement with the Baltic states. This problem must also be solved. Unfortunately, the vice admiral took the floor at the end of the conference, and these concrete proposals were not officially approved. Estonia's Defense Minister Juri Luik advocated development of a joint defense policy of the Baltic states, considering Russia the only enemy. He appealed to establish a military-political union of the Baltic states, although without Russia's participation, but with the possibility of Ukraine's participation. Judging from the Estonian defense minister's speech, the leaders of this country prefer cooperation with the West and the Baltics in the field of establishing a security system, and they intentionally attempt to create a suspicious atmosphere around Russia, which would resemble the "cold war" spirit. Although no concrete discussion on security of the Baltic Sea region was held in Tallinn, the Baltic Sea Fleet did not waste time. The fleet's command one more time demonstrated its good will to enhance cooperation with the Baltic states. Although certain circles in the Baltics did not get the message, Brigade General Tom Lennon did. He came with a proposal to establish a direct connection between the Baltic Sea Fleet and units of the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe. This year, such a connection was established with a division of the Privolzhskiy Military District. Life has already testified to the fact that such cooperation, including visits, joint solving of various issues, and collective work on certain undertakings, has very good prospects.
