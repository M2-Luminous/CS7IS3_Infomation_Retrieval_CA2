FBIS4-10371 "drlat070_o_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-070 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Colombia Business Leaders Reject Charges Business Leaders Reject Charges PA1004190494 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 15A PA1004190494 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Spanish BFN [Text] On 7 April, key national union leaders categorically rejected remarks by the U.S. State Department and, in particular, an article by U.S. Senator John Kerry in THE WASHINGTON POST, in which Kerry says Colombia is a "narcodemocracy" and its economy is pervaded by mafia activities. Spokesmen for the banking, industrial, and coffee sectors issued statements yesterday from Cartagena, site of a banking convention. One of the first statements was issued by Carlos Arturo Angel, president of the National Association of Industrialists, who pointed out that economies throughout the world are pervaded by drug trafficking and that Colombia is not a special case. Angel stated: "We are a small part of a huge business which, among other things, conducts a substantial share of its operations in industrialized countries, and especially in the United States." Angel also asserted that U.S. laws have benefited drug traffickers. Cesar Gonzalez, president of the Association of Financial Institutions, expressed his confusion about these charges, and he conveyed his confidence that these comments do not represent a widespread view or the view of the U.S. Government or Congress. He noted: "The United States has viewed the countries that are south of the Rio Grande as one huge hacienda, and it believes it can submit these nations to its will." Gonzalez Munoz pointed to the efforts Colombia has made to fight drug trafficking and the price it has paid in its fight against organized crime, and he added that this is why he believes remarks by some U.S. officials are less than appropriate. Gonzalez added: "The existence of drug money in the economy cannot be denied, but this also happens in the United States." Gabriel Rosas Vega, president of the Association of Coffee Exporters, also rejected Senator Kerry's remarks. Rosas indicated that the United States has no moral authority to call us into question because U.S. banks, both large and small, handle drug money. More Reactions Rosas Vega said "we cannot bite our tongues" and avoid saying the United States is not morally qualified to speak on the subject. Carlos Caballero Argaez, president of the Bank of Foreign Trade, noted that the problem "must be examined from its true perspective, which is that Colombia's situation cannot be viewed only in the light of drug trafficking activities when its economy depends on and is rooted in traditional exports of oil, coffee, ferronickel, and so on." Last, Labor Minister Jose Elias Melo said that Senator Kerry's opinion shows total ignorance of the recent progress of the Colombian economy. He stated: "The fact that he has finally noticed Colombia's recent strength and development does not mean that this progress stems from drug activities; on the contrary, it comes from the hard work of Colombian businessmen and workers." Melo added that efforts are being made to prevent money laundering, and these efforts must be perceived in a better light when viewed from abroad.
