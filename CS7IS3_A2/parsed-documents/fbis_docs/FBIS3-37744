Azerbaijan President To Consult British "Physicians"] [Text] Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev arrived in London on 19 February. The very fact of the visit is not being made much of, but the president is known to have spent some two days in the British capital. The reason bringing the Azeri leader to the shores of misty Albion, the entire press in the republic says in one voice, is the desire to "restore his health" and "consult English physicians." But even if a visit to physicians takes place after all, the real purpose of the visit is obviously not that. The Azerbaijan president, one may suppose, is to agree on terms of the contract with the international oil concern led by British Petroleum (KOMMERSANT-DAILY wrote last on its terms on 17 Feb). The republic's press, controlled by the authorities, also spill the true aims of Aliyev's trip: Shortly before the visit, the newspaper AZARLYK mulled over how successfully Aliyev would be able "to play the oil card." Besides, the Great Britain visit is a logical continuation of the Turkey voyage 10 days earlier. Discussed in Ankara were the terms of the Turkish side's participation in the international consortium and the route for the projected pipeline along which oil will flow to Turkish terminals bypassing Novorossiysk (Russia plans to export oil across its own territory). The other problem Aliyev intends to discuss in London is a Karabakh settlement. Great Britain has lately been increasingly active in this process (given the fact it is not a member of the CSCE "Minsk Group" on Nagorno-Karabakh). This is welcomed by Baku, which seeks independence from Moscow in this process. Among the delicate questions Aliyev has to solve today is foreign assistance for his army, in whose ranks are now fighting 1,000 Afghan mujahidin and an unknown number of mercenaries from neighboring countries. Turkey has provided 300 military advisers, some 100 of whom are with the units in the field). True, Ankara denies this fact. The advisers are supposed to train Azeris in the use of Western military hardware which is being supplied through the two main channels -- from Afghanistan (via Iran) and from Turkey. Baku has recently bought 50 tanks from Kiev. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned from Azeri diplomatic sources that the question of sending British military advisers to Azerbaijan may also be discussed in London. Those providing this information specify, however, that advisers from Great Britain would take no part in combat operations and would only be doing "teaching work." By internationalizing the situation around the war against the Armenians, Aliyev is also solving the problems of consolidating his own power. He is balancing between a big number of international partners (including Russia) while trying to firm up his shaken positions. Today, a whole series of regions in the republic (not counting 20 percent of the territory occupied by Armenians) are not controlled by the president. For example, the sole master of Azerbaijan's west is not Aliyev but his "premier rival," Suret Guseynov, who has armed formations, outside the national defense forces, including armored vehicles. Thus, the Azeri press is quite right: Aliyev is off to London to really "restore his health." Political health, that is.
