FBIS4-22399 "jpusr036___94022" FBIS-USR-94-036 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 1 April 1994 CAUCASUS ARMENIA Parliamentary Debate on Taxes, Legislative Process Scored Parliamentary Debate on Taxes, Legislative Process Scored 944K1012A Yerevan RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA in Russian 1 Apr 94 p 1 944K1012A Yerevan RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA Russian CSO [Article by I.M. under the rubric "Parliament": "`Not So Hot' Fact and `Pushbutton Hooligans'"] [Text] With a brisk step, the prime minister almost boyishly ran up to the rostrum and, once there, as if restraining his drive, with deliberate calmness, clearly enunciating every figure, began to explain to the audience why the government chose the 30-percent tax on profit over the 20-percent proposed by the deputies. He described in detail the mechanics of the so-called zero-sum situation, into which we may slide otherwise. He gave examples from the practice of other states, including civilized ones. I will not bore the reader with details, because I saw that the deputies, too--many either found it unnecessary to get into the fine print or were incapable of doing so, or perhaps already had made up their mind. In any case, they did not heed the prime minister's words and did not accommodate the president's requests enunciated in his "comments" to the draft laws under discussion: "On Tax on Land" and "On Tax on Profit." The situation in the "kitchen" did not require great analytical abilities to understand the underlying motive that guided both parties. As usual: The government protects the interests of the state, and the deputies--the interests of the people. In this particular case--the business segment. And why not--strangling business with such a tax--30 percent--means strangling it to death. The "threat" that the danger lies in something else--that under the 20-percent tax a jump in inflation is inevitable, that every taxpayer thinks that the tax is too high, and that we should be guided by the interests of the entire state and not just one population stratum--did not bring the desired effect. The speaker--who, by the way, spoke before the prime minister and seemed to have barely restrained himself from spoonfeeding his "flock" regarding what is what and what is not in the business at hand--namely, in the "president's amendment": nothing is outside the law; it is in the interests of each and every person; on Tuesday evening, after a meeting, members of the cabinet and the presidium, worn out and tired, still found enough willpower to stay up and work, arriving at the nonsense [as published] of the "30 percent" necessity; and so on, and so on--did not produce any effect either. As well as the deputy's attempt to explain to the "listeners" that the point is not the figures but the substance. Neither did the government correction help: that it is not simply the "numbers"--it is precisely the substance, because the question under discussion does not stand alone but is part of the general development program. In short, despite the concentrated firepower, "the enemy was stopped" and "we won." Please forgive the seeming frivolity of this phrase. I permitted it because during a smoking break a high-ranking government official confessed to me with the smile of one who had made a discovery: "You see, the Supreme Soviet assumes everything that comes out of the cabinet to be evil. If they manage to `nix' a proposal, they celebrate victory. For them, the important part is to beat us. They just cannot comprehend that besides the notorious `counterbalance,' we should all be guided by common interests." During the next smoking break, with the smile of one who had made a startling discovery, a commission head confessed to me that the best the government can do is liquidate itself. That everything it proposes "at best does not result in the direct and final demise of the state. That even seemingly sensible proposals are not thought through in detail, are not well argumented, are not accompanied by a mechanism for implementation, which leads to even greater chaos." On our way home, one deputy of my acquaintance comforted me philosophically: "Everything is normal. Do you really think that in civilized countries relations are better between parliament and government?" I really do not know, never having had a chance to observe closely, but... But it is still different over there: There is an adopted constitution, working laws; there is no murderous time pressure, which allows them, while heatedly debating each amendment, to calmly relish it before permitting it to be put to use; the procedure for budget and program approval is fine-tuned; and anyway, how can it be that the budget is approved and the program is not?! In short, the impression I was left with after these three days is depressing. As if all the charge had been spent during the battle for the budget and they are now performing, so to say, a filler. Since it was announced in the promotion, it has to be played. No more than that. Although taxation laws cannot be considered insignificant no matter how inwardly relaxed one may be. Perhaps the reason for this painful impression was the expectation that--well, they must finally get to the most important; we have reached the limit; so many laws are waiting their turn, and they... I do not know, perhaps, another proverb fits here: Do not judge and you will not be judged, and they, the deputies, know better what and when, within what timeframe, and why secondary--to the uninitiated eye--issues should be brought into finer shape, and... The question of the minister of light industry, which at least for us--reporters and readers--could become a "burning" issue, was also left hanging in midair. By the way, this situation is particularly depressing. If the "suspect" official is indeed a villain, such procrastination around the matter only gives him the opportunity to continue his villainy with greater enthusiasm for whatever time he has left. If the opposite, and he has simply been slandered, most likely he will be paralyzed by the knowledge of the stupidity of the whole thing. In any case, delay in resolving this matter only aggravates the situation. In the end, everything was completely jumbled. It suddenly turned out that the quorum had been provided by apparently "dead souls." That is, deputies push buttons for their colleagues who are absent. Two "pushbutton hooligans" were even identified by name. They took the floor. Started a lively argument with a pretense to sarcasm. Everybody's spirits rose. The implacable time kept ticking. Deputies suddenly jumped from their seats and rushed to the exit, disregarding the chairman's attempt to call them to order. Somebody said that this kind of behavior enables them to avoid putting something to a vote, but... I have no doubt that later some will argue heatedly that behind all this are the games of the "top echelons," that the destabilized situation of the last few minutes, and not only that, was aimed at derailing, or rather, not putting to a vote the most interesting issues, and so on, and so on. But, hell! One would think that the rules of the game had been learned by now--why go through the same hoops every time?! Still, there was one cheerful point in all this--7 April was made a holiday by law. Congratulations!
