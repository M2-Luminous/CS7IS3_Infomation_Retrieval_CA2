According to an amendment to the citizenship law, adopted by the parliament last year, persons who served in Soviet armed forces and other repressive structures may be granted Lithuanian citizenship, provided they ceased service before March 1, 1992 and received Lithuanian citizen certificates before Nov. 4, 1991. The court said dual citizenship is possible only in exceptional cases, while former Soviet servicemen were Soviet citizens and received Lithuanian citizenship certificates unlawfully. According to unofficial reports, the amendment to the citizenship law may have affected around 800 former servicemen.
