Visitors from the CEC now descend on Moscow increasingly often. The newspapers are trying to digest the new Russian approach to NATO's Partnership For Peace concept. The press is attempting to analyze the possible consequences of Russia's entry into the European Union... In short, one may say that in this respect our country is at the center of attention. Russian initiatives of late put Western politicians in a state of slight shock. To be precise, the confusion stems not from their contents but their inconsistency and contradictory nature. "We will not sign the NATO Partnership For Peace document..." "Actually, we will." "We will not demand special status for Russia within the framework of this concept..." "Actually, we will..." So Western politicians are not in a hurry to comment on this. You say something in a hurry, call someone an unflattering name, and tomorrow this someone makes a U-turn... For Western journalists, however, it is a free-for-all. They are outdoing themselves in sarcasm on the subject of Russia's less-than-successful attempts to regain its former greatness. "This is not terribly smart," says one, and launches into pontification on the subject of chaos, and sometimes sheer incompetence, in the top echelons of Russian authority. "This is not by choice," another joins the discussion, hinting at a complex domestic political situation in Russia and increasing attempts by politicians of all colorations to play the card of Russian greatness. "It is neither," says a third. In his opinion, Russia has not rid itself of an imperial mentality, and all these swings from one extreme to another are nothing other than a desire to retain control over its former allies. Here is a conversation, however, not with a journalist but an official representative of an official organization. [Question] What do you think of Russia's intention to join the European Union? [Answer] So far I only heard of such an intention from the press. [Question] What if it were to be confirmed officially? [Answer] I can say only one thing. Such an idea would be strange, to say the least. [Question] What is your own view of it? [Answer] Take, for instance, the 29 articles of the agreement on Austria's membership. How many years will be needed to reach an agreement with Russia, for instance, on social articles alone, if we have problems in this respect even with Austria?
