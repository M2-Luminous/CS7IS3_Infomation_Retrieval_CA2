They exchanged views on Japan-U.S. relations following the breakdown of the economic framework talks. At the meeting, Ambassador Kuriyama pointed out that the economic talks were broken off because both Japan and the United States distrusted each other. With regard to the large tax reductions with which President Clinton professed dissatisfaction during the recent Japan-U.S. summit, the ambassador stated in an effort to dispel U.S. misunderstandings: "The tax cuts are not limited to one year." Moreover, Ambassador Kuriyama briefed them about Japan's voluntary market-opening measures centering on deregulation--which the Hosokawa cabinet is currently promoting--and sought U.S. understanding. On the other hand, U.S. Congressmen who attended the meeting professed dissatisfaction with the closed nature of the Japanese market and stated their opinions regarding the lack of mutual trust between the two countries as well as other issues. They expressed concern that if the Japanese and U.S. Governments do not mend the current rift between them at an early date, the atmosphere in Congress against Japan will grow worse.
