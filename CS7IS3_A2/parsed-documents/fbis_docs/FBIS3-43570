Addressing an international press conference in his office, the minister for tourism and wildlife, Mr. Noah Katana Ngala, however said the government was taking the allegations of mismanagement at kws very seriously and investigations on the reported malpractices have already commenced. Mr. Ngala said there was indication that the parastatal had violated the law in its operations, including its own act, and warned stern action will be taken against those involved in irregular activities. He said the ministry, in conjuction with the auditor-general cooperations [as heard], was looking into allegations of improper employment and payment of irregular salaries to some of the staff at the organization. He said it was irresponsible for some people to claim that unqualified personnel were being employed and their tax-free salaries pegged to the dollar without the authority of both the organization's board of trustees and the minister for finance. The minister said he had documentary evidence some recruitment by the organization was being done of favoritism and not on qualifications and that salaries are being fixed arbitrarily by the management without any reference to the board of trustees. He said it had also come to the ministry's notice that certain major policy matters had been implemented by the management without approval of the board and the organization was involved in illegal collection of funds from the members of the public. Other issues being investigated include the translocation of the animals from the national parks to private sanctuaries, where owners were charging fees and while the organization was operating on huge unauthorized bank overdrafts. He assured the residents of Narok that the government has no intention of handing over Masai Mara Game Reserve to KWS. He appealed to the public to give the ministry ample time to complete its investigations, adding that appropriate measures will be taken to correct the situation.
