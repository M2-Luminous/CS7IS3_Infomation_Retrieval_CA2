"We have summoned a summit of continental leaders from Canada to South America. And we will continue to exert pressure to restore democracy in Haiti," Clinton plainly said in his State of the Union address on the evening of 25 January before Congress. Nevertheless, as certain Chilean and Mexican diplomats noted, Clinton's constant references to efforts already made to liberalize international trade also pertain to Latin American nations. An Andean diplomat said, "If we fail to do our homework -- adjust and modernize structures -- it will be very difficult to heighten the interest of the United States and its corporations." His opinion was shared by a Brazilian diplomat and a third person from Central America, who discussed Clinton's message in private. Meanwhile, Isaac Cohen, director of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLA), told EFE: "It is up to us, the Latin Americans, to turn those three lines into a large door." Cohen described the meeting confirmed by Clinton as a "very important" opportunity for the heads of state of the entire continent and the Caribbean. The effort, to which Cohen and the diplomats who were consulted referred, pertains to negotiations between Latin American and Caribbean nations and the United States on the basis of the results and progress made in structural adjustment and modernization plans to achieve an adequate level of competitiveness abroad. Several of the presidents who visited President Clinton in the past year, such as Argentina's Carlos Menem, and the heads of state of Central America and the Caribbean pointed out the need to change the terms of relations with the United States. In this regard, they agreed on the need to expand trade opportunities in the U.S. market, to offer facilities for the investment of capital, and to support technological cooperation. According to certain State Department diplomats, the hemispheric summit, whose date and site have not yet been determined, could take place during the second half of 1994. Diplomatic sources predict the meeting will take place in Miami (Florida) prior to the election of certain governors and the partial renewal of the U.S. Congress in November. The heads of state of the nations of the inter-American system have not met since 1967. The last "summit" was held at the Punta del Este (Uruguay) beach resort. Diplomats consulted by EFE, who were somewhat disappointed, said they were not surprised by the content of Clinton's speech, which focused on domestic matters and left foreign policy on a secondary level. The hemispheric "summit" could focus on trade, democracy, poverty, and social politics, according to sources close to the initial preparations. In a message read on 25 January before a solemn session of Congress, Clinton made constant references to U.S. interest in expanding free trade borders to improve the people's living standards. The drug trafficking issue was not singled out, but Clinton included it in a new battle front opened by his government to combat a wave of violence, which is among the major concerns of this country.
