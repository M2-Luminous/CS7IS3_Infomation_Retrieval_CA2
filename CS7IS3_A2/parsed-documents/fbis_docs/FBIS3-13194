Some weeks ago, Pakistan called for the issuance of a resolution on the violation of human rights by India in Kashmir. Our correspondent Hajiparvaneh, who is in Paris, interviewed our country's representative at the UN Human Rights Commission on this step by the Islamic Republic of Iran. Sirus Naseri said in relation to this: [Begin recording] [Naseri] Many countries--Islamic and Western countries and, as far as we know, Britain, Australia, and others--tried to bring about an understanding between India and Pakistan in some way or another. But three or four days ago all of them gave up, concluding that there was no way out and that these two countries would move toward a confrontation, and decided to issue a resolution on Kashmir. However, our diplomatic machinery not only did not give up but it increased its efforts. I should say that with the multifaceted efforts of our Foreign Ministry, directives issued by the president himself, the direct participation of our foreign minister, and the activities that we carried out in Islamabad and New Delhi, at the last moment we achieved something that all the members of the commission thought to be impossible--Iran was able to pave the way for reconciliation between the two countries on this issue within an extremely logical framework. The result was, I think, also a victory for Pakistan and India because contrary to the tension that they were moving toward, tranquility has been suddenly established, which we hope can pave the way for the resumption of talks between the two countries on the resolution of their problems. This was a success for the Kashmiri Muslims because within this framework India allowed representatives of some Islamic countries to inspect the area to see the actual situation; if they observe that Muslims are in need of something or that human rights are being violated, they will discuss this with the Indian Government so that the situation will improve. I think that this was an extremely significant issue for Iran because of the credibility it was able to gain by being able to complete an extremely difficult political task that all the others who are so boastful about their abilities were unable to do anything about and gave up. Probably an extremely outstanding outcome of this development is that everything worked contrary to the opinion of the Westerners, especially the United States, which very flagrantly announced a couple of days ago that the commission's attention should be focused on Iraq and especially Iran, and whose hostile policies toward Iran have been extremely obvious, especially during the past few years. And exactly on the same day that they exerted all their efforts to issue a resolution against us, Iran emerged as probably the most popular and most outstanding member of the commission. [Hajiparvaneh] Our country's permanent ambassador at the European headquarters of the United Nations talked about the resolution on human rights in Iran, which the Commission issued under pressure by Western countries: The approval of such resolutions is customary and has assumed such a political nature that it is no longer attractive to anyone and is only a pretext for the West's propaganda against Iran. He added: More realistic countries are well aware of the depth of such actions and are aware of how hostility and spite by the West, especially the United States, are involved in such actions; out of the 52 members of the UN Human Rights Commission, 30 of them either abstained or voted against this resolution.
