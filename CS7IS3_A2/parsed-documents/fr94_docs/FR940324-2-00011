ACTION: Notice of initiation of changed circumstances antidumping duty administrative review, consideration of revocation of order, preliminary results of changed circumstances antidumping duty administrative review, and intent to revoke order. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas O. Barlow or Wendy J. Frankel, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5256 and 482&hyph;0367, respectively. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 28, 1991, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (56 FR 42593) an antidumping duty order on personal word processors (PWPs) from Japan (the order). On August 20, 1992 (57 FR 37770), the Department published an amended order. On February 15, 1994, Smith Corona Corporation (Smith Corona), the petitioner in the underlying less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, submitted a request for a changed circumstances administrative review and revocation of the order based on the represented fact that the order no longer is of interest to the domestic interested parties. For the same reasons, in its February 15, 1994 request, Smith Corona withdrew its petition requesting an investigation to determine whether the order was being circumvented pursuant to section 781(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Smith Corona made the withdrawal of that petition and the revocation contingent upon termination of the suspended antidumping investigation on portable electric typewriters from Singapore (A&hyph;559&hyph;806). Scope of Review The scope of the order covers PWPs from Japan as defined in the Department's antidumping duty order on personal word processors from Japan (56 FR 42593, August 28, 1991), as amended (57 FR 37770, August 20, 1992). PWPs are currently classifiable under item number 8469.10.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the United States. HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. Initiation of Changed Circumstances Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Consideration of Revocation of Order, Preliminary Results of Changed Circumstances Administrative Review, and Intent To Revoke Order Pursuant to section 751(c) of the Act, the Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Department determines, based on a review under section 751(b)(1) of the Act, that changed circumstances exist sufficient to warrant revocation. Section 751(b)(1) of the Act requires a changed circumstances review to be conducted upon receipt of a request containing sufficient information concerning changed circumstances. Section 353.25(d)(2) of the Department's regulations permits the Department to conduct an administrative review under ยง353.22(f) based upon an affirmative statement of no interest from the petitioner in the proceeding. Section 353.25(d)(1)(i) further provides that if the Department determines that the order under review is no longer of interest to domestic interested parties, the Department may revoke the antidumping duty order. In addition, in the event the Department concludes that expedited action is warranted, ยง353.22(f)(4) of the regulations permits the Department to combine the notices of initiation and preliminary results.
