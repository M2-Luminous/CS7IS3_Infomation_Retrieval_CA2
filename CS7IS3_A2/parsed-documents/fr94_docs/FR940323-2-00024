FR940323-2-00024 FR940323-2-00014 Scope of the Review Imports covered by this review are shipments of fresh and frozen red raspberries packed in bulk containers and suitable for further processing. These products are classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 0810.20.90, 0810.20.10, and 0811.20.20. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. Final Results of the Review As a result of our comparison of United States price to foreign market value (FMV), as discussed in the preliminary results of our review, we determine that the following margins exist for the review period: ‚ê£ 1Processor/Exporters 1Margin (percent) 6/1/91&hyph; 5/31/92 Clearbrook 0 Valley Berries 0 Based on information submitted by Clearbrook during this and two previous reviews (see, Final Results of Administrative Reviews at 57 FR 49686; November 3, 1992, and 56 FR 37527; August 7, 1991), we further determine that Clearbrook has met the requirements for revocation set forth in sections 353.25(a)(2) and 353.25(b) of the Department regulations. Clearbrook has demonstrated three consecutive years of sales at not less than foreign market value and has submitted the certifications required under 19 CFR 353.25(b)(1). The Department conducted a verification of Clearbrook as required under 19 CFR 353.25(c)(2)(ii). On the basis of no sales at less than foreign market value for a period of three consecutive years, and the lack of any indication that such sales are likely, the Department concludes that Clearbrook is not likely to sell subject merchandise at less than foreign market value in the future. Therefore, the Department is revoking the order with respect to Clearbrook. The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. With respect to Clearbrook's entries, the Department will instruct Customs to terminate suspension of liquidation, to liquidate the entries without regard to antidumping duties, and to cease collecting cash deposits. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results of administrative review for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company other than Clearbrook, will be as outlined above; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 2.41 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (50 FR 26019; June 24, 1985), in accordance with the decisions of the Court of International Trade in Floral Trade Council v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and Federal-Mogul Corporation v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;83 ( see Prelim , 58 FR at 65578). These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)(B) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)(B)) and 19 CFR 353.22 and 353.25. Dated: March 4, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6840 Filed 3&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
