He was speaking in the discussion of the Commonwealth's peace-keeping missions. Kazimirov spoke after chairman of Kyrgyzstan's parliament Medetkan Sherimkulov reported on the work done by the CIS interparliamentary group led by him to promote the peaceful settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh. Sherimkulov said in his report that since a cease-fire protocol was signed in Bishkek, the warring parties have observed its provisions in the zone of the Armenian-Azeri conflict in the past four weeks.
