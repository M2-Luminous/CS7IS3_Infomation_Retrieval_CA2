Zyuganov was addressing the party's national conference in the city of Zvenigorod near Moscow, on Saturday. He said that owing to social degradation and the impoverishment of the population, mounting tensions could erupt in a spontaneous rebellion of marginalized elements and in an all-out war for the division of what remained of public property. If this kind of a rebellion did take place, the party would aim to channel the masses' energy into the mainstream of class struggle for the labor masses' vital interests. The Zyuganov party rejected even the fairest of civil wars. Zyuganov assigned strategic priority to civic peace as the main condition for coping with the crisis and transition to socialism. Also, the Communist party of the Russian Federation intended to build a broad coalition of left-wing, centrist-oriented, patriotic and democratic forces which would be able to neutralize the party of civil war and hold it in political, economic and moral isolation. Thirdly, the Zyuganov party aimed to lead the left-wing coalition to power by either carrying a general election or with the help of some other non-violent means. The party's chief objective, according to Zyuganov, was the creation of an updated union of republics and the declaration of the Minsk decision on the abrogation of the treaty of union as null and void. In Zyuganov's view, the executive branch of national power felt irresponsible because it reported to no one and the legislative branch - because it enjoyed no rights. He suggested redistribution of powers between the two branches and more work on the national checks and balances system. He called, among other things, for: - moves to build bridges between the two houses of the Russian parliament and outline their joint authority over, primarily, relations with the executive branch; - full operational subordination of the Ministries and government agencies to the prime-minister and more clarity on the authority and functions of the president and his men; - holding the government accountable to the legislative branch and for the endowment of the Federal Assembly with the right to make decisions on the government's staff and structure, confirm or reject choices for prime-minister and government programs, as well as initiate, in case the government deviated from a confirmed course, moves to unseat the government; - the exclusion of TV and radio authorities from the system of the executive branch; - the restoration of all the echelons of the legislative branch and for holding all echelons of the executive branch accountable to the corresponding echelons of the legislative branch, as well as the reincorporation of the municipal governments into the system of state power.
