Pacific-based fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes, vertical takeoff and landing assault planes, tanker planes, and an early- warning plan, and flying groups of the U.S. Air Force present in South Korean and the puppet Air Force, were massively mobilized in this war exercise, which lasted for two successive days. The exercise was frenziedly staged under the command of an E-3 early warning plane, which is called the air-flying command post, with KC-135 tanker plane supplying fuel in the air. The purpose of this war exercise was to ensure the unified command of various attack airplane wings and to enhance combat-ready capabilities for cooperative surprise attack between the U.S. Air Force and the puppet Air Force. On the other hand, the South Korean puppets frantically ran amok with artillery firing and helicopter operational exercises in areas close to the demilitarized zone [DMZ] in the military demarcation line. The armed helicopter groups, which were mobilized in the sky above Paengnyon, Paju County, on 27 April, frenziedly staged a missile strike exercise, and armed helicopters and transport helicopters, which flew in the skies above Paju and Yonchon, and areas in Chorwon, South Korean Kangwon Province, ran wild with ground support exercises while making a low-altitude ultra low-altitude flights. On 26 and 27 April, large-caliber artillery groups of the puppet Army in Chongda-ri and Yongsan-ri, Paju County, and Oksan-ri, Yonchon-up, Yonchon County, and Yulli-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County in South Korean Kangwon Province, fired more than 100 shells into spots near the DMZ in front of our eyes, thus running amok with war frenzy. These successive dangerous war gambles of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets timing to coincide with the "Hwarang" war exercises involving 1 million and hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians are further straining the situation on the Korean peninsula.
