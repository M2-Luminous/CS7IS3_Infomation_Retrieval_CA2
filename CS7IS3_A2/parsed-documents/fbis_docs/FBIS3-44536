Speaking at a four-day national conference on rural work, the minister said that with the resumption of China's status as a GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) founding member country, some Chinese farm produce will have a broader international market. "After China unifies its foreign exchange rates, prices of some farm produce will be more competitive, such as corn, soybeans, fruit, aquatic products and meat products," said the minister. China unified its exchange rates on January 1 this year and is preparing to resume its GATT status. However, production of some other agricultural products, such as wool, rubber, milk and milk products, and prawns, will inevitably be affected, since China will abolish some non-tariff protection measures, including the system of import and export licensing for and quotas on farm produce. He said that China should actively readjust its agricultural product mix, make greater efforts to develop an export-oriented farm economy and improve the quality of its farm produce. According to the minister, the export of farm produce and their finished products accounts for 40 percent of China's foreign exchange earnings. Liu described exports as important in balancing the country's foreign exchange income and expenditure and in promoting agricultural development. He admitted that the export of farm produce in recent years has not been "as good as it should be," attributing the problem mainly to low quality and lack of competitiveness. "Rice is a traditional export product for China. Although its domestic prices have been lower than those on the international market in recent years, the total quantity of exported rice has be shrinking," said the minister. He urged agricultural departments at all levels to help agro- businesses to set up group firms and improve the quality of farm produce, so as to rapidly increase international trade of China's agricultural products.
