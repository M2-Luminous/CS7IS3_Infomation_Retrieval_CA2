We all regret demonstrations that deteriorate into destruction. The uncontrolled demonstrations would have become more serious if the security authorities had not acted swiftly to control them. As reported in several newspapers, the workers in Medan and the surrounding areas had endured difficulties since March. The climax was reached last Friday when tens of thousands of workers from several factories in the city held illegal demonstrations because they thought they had been improperly treated by their employers. Dozens of shophouses in the North Sumatra provincial capital were destroyed by rampaging mobs throwing stones and looting property. One businessman was even reported to have met a tragic death. The stampede spread to other places and was only stopped when security authorities interfered. The question now is who should be held responsible for the events that degenerated into crime. The answer will certainly emerge after authorities complete their thorough investigation. Another question is whether there will be a repeat of these ugly events in the future. We must also think of those who will eventually suffer from the destruction in Medan and the stoppage of economic activities, which will certainly have a nationwide impact. The conclusion is that the Medan incident is highly regretted and we do not want to see a recurrence of the incident. As Asians who have undergone both pleasant and unpleasant times since the colonial era, we are good at learning a lesson from any unpleasant experience. In this connection, the government, businessmen, and workers should work together through existing channels and mechanisms. The rule of the game, as stipulated in existing labor laws, government regulations, ministerial decrees, and other labor regulations, is clear and adequate. It now depends on how all sides understand, implement, and put them into practice. All sides must admit that the ugly incidents in Medan and other towns originated from simple demands for an increase in workers' wages, a guarantee of welfare services, and proper treatment by employers according to existing regulations. What is most important is how the government and businessmen respond to such demands. As for workers, they should be vigilant against possible interference by a third party wanting to fish in troubled waters. A lack of response and delay in seeking a solution will only make things more difficult. We do not want to see a repeat of the case of Marsinah [woman labor activist who was murdered in East Java] or the murder of another businessman in Medan. This is especially important at a time when we are still under the watchful eyes of foreign countries which have placed our labor conditions under spotlight. Meanwhile, the swift action by security authorities in coping with any emergency anywhere within the country at any time deserves our praise.
