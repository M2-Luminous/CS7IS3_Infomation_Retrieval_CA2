The blood of the faithful will not sink in the sands of oblivion. The bullets of our strugglers are the imminent response to the Zionists. Violent confrontations with the occupiers are the road that our people have willingly pursued. Our people will not abandon their sincere option until the entire sacred Palestinian homeland is liberated and until we avenge every Palestinian soul killed by the filthy Zionist hands.
