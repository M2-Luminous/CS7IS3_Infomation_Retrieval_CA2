The greatest share was accounted for by the construction industry, where the overall share of private businesses in production amounted to virtually 25 percent. The results of the Slovak economy are thus sharply in contrast with the results achieved by the Czech Republic last year, where the share of private businesses in overall production is running at a level of 40 percent. The report by the Slovak Statistical Office contained this information. The share of enterprises employing more than 25 workers in overall production is virtually 100 percent in certain branches of the Slovak economy. This trend is most pronounced in industrial production, where the share of enterprises employing more than 25 workers is greater than 92 percent. In the construction industry, the share amounts to 64.4 percent, in trade 21 percent, and in services 45 percent. On the profit side of the balance sheet, the greatest share was accounted for by enterprises owned by the state, something that was expressly influenced primarily by the energy sector and the Transgaz Enterprise. The energy sector, together with the transmission of natural gas, accounts for a decisive share in the formation of revenues flowing to the Slovak Republic. The profit recorded last year by the private sector amounted to 6.2 percent. Enterprises of the cooperative sector were included in the overall evaluation. Results of the public sector were largely the result of the highly efficient activities of the energy branch and the Transgaz Enterprise. As far as evaluating the productivity of labor from the standpoint of output, production of goods, basic construction activity, and the physical volume of retail sales (excluding the energy branch and the Transgaz Enterprise), the highest levels were achieved by workers in the so-called other private enterprises (foreign as well as international), where the final results were valued at 1.187 billion Slovak korunas [Sk]. The situation was similar in the case of average monthly wages, where the remaining private sector achieved a level of Sk6,521 and the domestic private sector achieved average monthly wages of Sk5,532. Meanwhile, in all privatized enterprises, wages amounted to Sk5,420, and in the public sector to Sk5,306. In enterprises that were privatized within the framework of the first round of coupon privatization, gross wages amounted to Sk5,397. As for indicators of profitability, not taking into account the results of the energy sector and the Transgaz Enterprise, the most efficient results were scored by domestic private enterprises. Their share in the profit and outputs amounted to 1.7 percent, and profitability of costs as a share of profit and loss amounted to a value of 1.8 percent. Enterprises privatized through coupon privatization were more efficient (1.4 percent) than those in the private sector (0.9 percent). Indicators of profitability and wage costs thus indicate that the activities of private enterprises are more efficient than the activities of enterprises in the public sector. The relationship between labor productivity and average wages in this set of enterprises showed a more favorable trend in 1993, when compared with the previous period. Given the growth in productivity of labor of 35.5 percent, average monthly wages increased 19.6 percent. In the domestic private sector, labor productivity rose by 6.9 percent (again excluding the energy sector), and average monthly wages rose by 18.6 percent. In 1993, wage development did not worsen in comparison with 1992, and wages expressed in nominal figures did not expressly increase inflationary pressures. The development of real values was also favorable. With the decline in labor productivity recorded in the gross domestic product in constant prices by 0.1 percent, average monthly wages declined by 3.7 percent. A comparison of profit and loss figures for enterprises indicates that the volume of profits increased in agriculture, the production and transmission of gas and electric energy, ground transportation, and recreational, cultural, and other commercial activities. The volume of losses increased in the construction industry, the processing industries, and the area of real estate. Generally, average monthly wages were higher in profitable enterprises, and, on average, wages grew more rapidly there. In more branches, however, the growth of average monthly wages was higher in unprofitable enterprises than was the case in profitable ones.
