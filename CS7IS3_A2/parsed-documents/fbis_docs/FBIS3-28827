FBIS3-28827 "dreas030__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-030-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 February 1994 ANNEX Japan * Rivalry Among Hosokawa, Kono, Ozawa Viewed 942B0028A Tokyo SEIKAI ORAI in Japanese Nov 93 pp 8-13--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0028A Tokyo SEIKAI ORAI Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by Hisao Imai, political commentator] [Text] It may be safely said that Nagata-cho, where the forces of strength have changed with the shocking turnover of political power, is astir today with the focus on the good rivalry of the three politicians, Hosokawa, Kono, and Ozawa. The time has finally come for the showdown with the commencement of the special Diet session as the "site for the decisive confrontations." Hosokawa Achieved Political Power by Capitalizing on the Collapse of the LDP Government Nagata-cho is revolving on the axis formed by the three persons, namely, Prime Minister Hosokawa, leading representative of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Ozawa and Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Kono. This statement is not an exaggeration. The clamor right now is "Hosokawa, Hosokawa," but the Hosokawa of a year and a half ago was only a bum from Nagata-cho. His personal history contains only the credentials of former governor of Kumamoto Prefecture and former Diet member of the upper house. When he formed the Japan New Party in May 1992 nobody, frankly speaking, paid any attention to him. Hosokawa's new party increased its strength with four people in the upper house election, 20 people in the Metropolitan Assembly election and 35 people in the general election. The increase in strength, of course, was really trifling. But conspiring with Shinseito, he drew in such established political parties as the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], Komeito, and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] to form a coalition government and he himself took over the leadership. He is not just an ordinary person. Moreover, the fact is that he had not promoted any lofty political doctrine and it was not a situation of expressing an attractive policy that would capture the imagination of the people. He seized Nagata-cho with only two key slogans, namely, political reform and LDP opposition. But the Hosokawa government is not something that dropped unexpectedly out of the clouds. Several harbingers were evident. The LDP lost its majority in the upper house election when the Uno cabinet was in power in 1989, and thereafter politics took on strange twists. Then the unforgettable 17 August 1992 when Kanemaru, the former LDP vice president who had exerted his authority as don of Nagata-cho, admitted having received illegal contributions of 500 million yen, and he resigned from the positions of LDP vice president and head of the Takeshita faction. Since then, the LDP has been shattered, with the Takeshita faction splitting into two and the Hata faction bolting from the party. These developments led to the passage of the no-confidence motion against the Miyazawa cabinet, which originally was not supposed to have passed; the dissolution of the lower house and the loss of political power by the LDP with its defeat in the general election. The fact is that the LDP's independent political power of one-party domination that lasted, before one knew what was happening, for 38 years collapsed resoundingly. I feel that in terms of speed, the collapse occurred much faster than the downfall of the former Soviet Communist Party's organization after a 75-year domination. And paralleling exactly the course of the LDP's political power collapse, Hosokawa established the Japan New Party; gradually increased his colleagues; pulled in other parties and finally took over the reins of government by replacing the LDP. It must be said that Hosokawa's intuition and behavior are those of a genius. Hosokawa was exactly like young Nobunaga Oda who, while setting out to battle as a lone warrior and picking up allies along the way, launched a surprise attack against Yoshimoto Imagawa at Okehazama and decapitated him. A review of Hosokawa's paternal ancestors revealed a feudal lord, Yusai Hosokawa, of Higo country with a fief yielding 540,000 koku of rice. Although outwardly appearing weak, Hosokawa has the blood of a lord of the age of civil strife coursing through him. That he resembles Nobunaga Oda is not a strange thought. And at the same time, his mother is descended from the Konoye family, which was the highest of the five regent families. There is no one in Nagata-cho who is not aware that Hosokawa's maternal grandfather was Prince Fumimaro Konoye. The Konoye family has continued the blood lineage of "heavenly beings" since Daishokkan [high court rank] Kamaashi Fujiwara's days, for over a thousand years. The heavenly beings, in other words the members of the court nobility, were unarmed and the Minamoto, Heike, Fujiwara, and Tachibana families, the four families of nobility during the Heian era, controlled the arms of the warriors. In other words, power politics is their family profession. This faculty is genetically transmitted into Hosokawa's body. Hosokawa's cabinet is a collection of members from the eight parties that form the ruling coalition. Troublesome members are assembled in full force to the right and to the left. On parade are the big and small taskmasters, such as the SDPJ's Yamahana, minister in charge of political reform; Shinseito's Hata, deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister; Komeito's Ishida, Director of the Management and Coordination Agency; DSP's Ouchi, minister of health and welfare; United Socialist Democratic Party's Eda, minister of science and technology, etc. But Hosokawa does not appear to be intimidated at all. He proudly occupies the seat of honor with composure. While holding the balance of power, he adroitly manipulates the bunch of crafty veterans. This is showmanship that can hardly be performed by a 55-year-old, fair-complexioned prime minister. This is probably attributable, after all, to his family lineage and blueblood background. The weakness of the coalition government lies in the contradictions of the basic policies of the respective parties of the ruling coalition. Should the eight parties express their individual views arbitrarily to the Hosokawa cabinet, the government would not last even a day. That is why the Hosokawa cabinet, before its inauguration, agreed to have the various parties shelve all of their inherent policies and for the time being to succeed the policies of the LDP government. This is where one can see the wonders of the art of rule by division, which is Hosokawa's ancestral inheritance. Kono Seized Presidency With Party in Prostration From Loss of Political Power With the loss of political power, the LDP's Kono is experiencing difficulties. Kono stood at the forefront during interpellations at the recent special Diet session and staged a man-to-man debate with Hosokawa. The arguments were crisp and articulate, and the orations were excellent, but the content lacked appeal. This is because the idea of censuring Hosokawa in effect is tantamount to criticizing the LDP. This is the merit of Hosokawa following up with the LDP policies intact--borrowing a little of the techniques formulated by the LDP with hard work, neutralizing quarrels among fellow members of the ruling coalition, and with suppressing attacks made by the LDP. One must marvel at Hosokawa indeed, killing two birds with one stone in the manner of the court nobility. But Kono, who is burning with determination to overthrow the Hosokawa cabinet even for a day sooner and to recapture the reins of government, cannot falter with these occurrences. As soon as feasible, he is ready to shoot his second arrow and his third arrow. One of his arrows is the tactic of exposing scandals. Resorting to money and women as weapons in political warfare is somewhat low-grade. Crudely waged, they could turn into mudslinging. The opponents can be wounded, but likewise the attacker can be wounded. But if effectiveness is expected even so, then resorting to dirty tactics is the practice of this political world. As a matter of fact, the Uno cabinet fell because of a woman, and boss Kanemaru's downfall was caused by money. Kono has openly declared that, "Even if it is wrong, the LDP will not resort to delaying tactics." But rumors on the suppression of a project team to expose scandals, which was reported to have been secretly formed in the LDP, have not been heard. Even from now, Hosokawa and Kono will mutually muster all their resources and they are fated to engage in mortal combat with all their might. If Hosokawa is not an ordinary person, then Kono too is not an ordinary person. The rivalry between these two people will probably be the big battle that will highlight the political history of the Heisei era. Properly speaking, Kono was in a position to commit harakiri along with Miyazawa. This is the role of the chief cabinet secretary who is considered to be the guardian of the cabinet. But instead of following Miyazawa and resigning, Kono overpassed him to seize the presidency. This does not mean that the LDP lacked a successor. Previously battling Miyazawa for the presidency and emerging as second and third choices are former Foreign Minister Watanabe and former Policy Research Council Chairman Mitsuzuka, respectively. Especially Watanabe, although in poor health, was extremely enthusiastic and chose to run in the recent presidential election. While fully aware of such transactions within the party, Kono hurled a written challenge. Then he gathered the votes of the young leaders of the various factions to defeat Watanabe and rose to assume the top position. During this time, the LDP was defeated in the general election, lost its political power, and found itself in a form of prostration. It was almost like the Japanese people right after the end of World War II. The young leaders were knocked into a state of shock and they became a nearly hysterical group. In such an atmosphere, the extreme theory of old is bad and new is good prevails. Kono took advantage of this theory. But it must be said once again that Kono is a tremendous soldier of fortune. If Hosokawa is Nobunaga, then Kono is, for the present, Tenichibo. Even Tenichibo, who sought to usurp the throne by pretending to be the illegitimate child of Yoshimune, the eighth Tokugawa shogun, alas, failed when his disguise was revealed by the penetrating eyes of the famous judge, Echizen no Kami Ooka. This then means that there is no Echizen Ooka of the Heisei era. Although Hosokawa and Kono are on opposite camps right now, they were like-minded friends in the past. Besides that, they are dove politicians of the same mind. In that sense, for them to be glaring at each other is said to be rather unnatural. Some day, around the second act of the reorganization of the political world, it might come about that these two will unexpectedly join hands. In 1976, along with six of his "foolishly honest" colleagues, Kono bolted from the LDP and they were entrenched as the Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club. Actually Hosokawa was supposed to join this foolishly honest group. Hosokawa was an upper house member of the Tanaka faction and held the position of parliamentary vice minister of finance. Although members of different factions, with Hosokawa in the Tanaka faction and Kono in the Nakasone faction, their minds were the same. Kono never doubted and believed that Hosokawa would cooperate with each other to the end. But just before taking the resolute step, Hosokawa had a change of heart. This meant that Kono was betrayed. This sort of event occurred, but the thoughts of Hosokawa and Kono even today are running on the same track. For instance, regarding the Constitution, both of them stand on the side of protecting the Constitution. Some day in the very near future, when Japan is faced with the inevitable selection of either revising the Constitution or protecting it and when this indeed becomes the time to test for the reorganization of the political world, then surely this will be the time when these two will likely take the same action. There is no guarantee to say that this prediction will not occur. Neither Hosokawa Nor Kono Are Substantively Compatible With Ozawa The person to appear on the stage with open arms to shout "wait" is Ozawa. He is an entirely different person from Hosokawa and Kono. In short, if Hosokawa and Kono are of the dove faction, then Ozawa is certainly of the hawk faction. There is no compromise between the two factions. Ozawa presently stands beside Hosokawa and has an enemy relationship with Kono. But, naturally, Ozawa cannot get along substantively with Kono, the enemy, nor with Hosokawa, the ally. But there is a pipeline running between Ozawa and Hosokawa. If Hosokawa will manage the cabinet, then Ozawa will administer the party. There is no reason they cannot discuss matters with each other and when they do, their feelings are conveyed. It is ironic that the two of them, from the dove and hawk factions, are presently in the honeymoon stage. It is said that heroes understand the spirit of heroes, or should it be that snakes follow the way of the snakes, but these two people mutually respect the other's strength. Hosokawa has highly evaluated Ozawa ceaselessly as a man of actions, not words. The notion that there has never been any case, especially of secret talks being leaked by Ozawa's mouth, appears to have been a fresh experience for the first time for Hosokawa in his life up to now. And there is another point, that of Hosokawa having a feeling of respect for Ozawa's sense of direction. The new leaders of the LDP, which Hosokawa had previously associated with, were all nothing but competent managers of the factions. From among them, Ozawa alone stood out as being different. Not only did he possess farsighted intelligence, he has a kind of clear sense of direction about the era. Although this sense of direction is not necessarily the same as that for Hosokawa, at any rate Hosokawa respects Ozawa for having this sense of direction. Ozawa too has not forgotten to praise Hosokawa. Ozawa has applauded Hosokawa's trait of resoluteness. Ozawa had previously served under former Prime Minister Kaifu and had cooperated with former Prime Minister Miyazawa. During those periods, the biggest ordeals were the lack of resoluteness at a time when these two people should have been resolute. And because of this indecisiveness, there is no way of knowing to what extent Ozawa moved about busily with pressure of work. In comparison with these two men, Hosokawa makes quick decisions that are unbecoming of his countenance. Moreover, he follows through with his decisions. These are traits that should definitely become primary qualifications for anyone who becomes a leader. Ozawa has spoken so in praise of Hosokawa. The fact is that both of them flatter each other. But no matter how many cheers are exchanged on the surface, parts of the heterogeneity of the two people have clashed at the root of the relationship between them, with sparks flying. The first instance was the battle waged by the two people in the selection of personnel for the cabinet Secretariat during the formation of the cabinet, but it ended in total defeat for Ozawa. Candidates proposed by Ozawa were rejected totally by Hosokawa and the Secretariat was packed with pro-Hosokawa members, such as Takemura as chief cabinet secretary, Hatoyama as the deputy, and Tanaka as a special assistant. Ozawa's nominees were completely shut out. Furthermore, regarding the combined small constituency and proportional representation electoral system and the political party furtherance legislation, the plan compiled at the party under Ozawa's supervision has been either rejected or revised by Takemura of the Prime Minister's Residence. Needless to say, Takemura has Hosokawa's support. But at this point, Ozawa did not assume a defiant attitude to retaliate. But this does not mean that Ozawa's position was weakened from the standpoint of power relationship. Should Ozawa turn defiant, the Hosokawa cabinet will fall. Then everything will be lost. If Ozawa has done some calculating, that is all there is to it. Ozawa's Strength and Talent To Lead Ruling Coalition's Representatives Council Are Excellent There are more serious problems than those described above. They are the differences in the thinking of the two people on the concept of government leadership. Hosokawa has in mind a coalition government based on a moderate multiparty organization, frankly, for a fixed, long-term Hosokawa government. Against this way of thinking, Ozawa's ideal is for a confrontation of a two-party system that would suffice in sustaining political power and that can field alternate governments. But it appears that the two of them are only engaged in words. Deep examination and rich experience on the realities of the situation are lacking. In the past, Japan had multiparty coalition governments. In prewar days, there was the three-party cabinet to protect the constitution, consisting of the Kensei, Seiyu, and Kakushin parties; and in the postwar days, the Katayama and Ashida cabinets which consisted of three parties, namely, Socialist, Democratic, and Kokkyo parties. All of them were short-lived and died by the wayside. Also the period from the Taisho era to the beginning of the Showa era was called the "Taisho democracy," which was the golden era of party politics. There was the confrontation of the two big parties, the Seiyu and Minsei parties, which alternately took over the reins of government. But in order to rise in power, they resorted to any means, hook or crook; used national policies on diplomacy and national defense as subjects for political warfare and mutually exposed scandals of the opponents to wage mudslinging battles. The people became disgusted and the military gained power. These developments were connected to lead to the tragedy of the Pacific war. Apart from Europe, the multiparty organization or the confrontation of two large parties in Japan have facets which are not suited to the character of the people. Therefore in that respect, the actual performance of the LDP's independent government under the medium constituency district system must be reviewed all over. No matter how good the government, it is bound to deteriorate from the bottom because of a prolonged stay in power. There are numerous examples that have occurred throughout the world. The LDP government was not an exception. The series of corruption cases under the LDP government were not lies. But it is not fair to discredit the LDP government itself. Were it not for the LDP independent cabinets, such events as the Japan- Soviet negotiations during the Hatoyama cabinet; the Okinawa reversion during the Sato cabinet; the Sino-Japanese negotiations during the Tanaka cabinet, and the introduction of the consumption tax that was carried through the four cabinets of Ohira, Suzuki, Nakasone, and Takeshita, would probably not have been realized. Also, the national budget was 1 trillion yen during the Hatoyama cabinet, but it exceeded 70 trillion yen during the Miyazawa cabinet. This means that the country's strength increased 70 times in a 38-year span. Even after subtracting inflation increases, having a stable government and continued policies under an independent cabinet are adequate merits. The fact is that here lies the foundation for recapturing the government by the LDP, which Kono is aiming for. Ozawa says "no" to this and is putting a stop to it, but on second thought, Ozawa is as shrewd and headstrong as Hosokawa and Kono. Only recently during the latter part of the Miyazawa cabinet reign, Ozawa was in the middle of being forsaken by everyone and was on the verge of surely being tortured to death. Anyhow, he was summoned as a Diet witness by the minority parties regarding the Sagawa Kyubin case and about the Kominto, and he was surrounded by the majority party's Executive Committee, centering on then Secretary General Kajiyama. Ozawa caught hell coming and going, and he was pushed to the wall. Then in the turmoil of the series of events, that is the passage of the no-confidence motion, dissolution of the lower house, and the general election, Ozawa, before he realized it, found himself in the minority party camp and in reverse was flaunting the LDP. There is no need to say that one must marvel at this quick change from one ruling party to another ruling coalition. Indeed he is deserving of the nickname of Nezumi Kozo [Robin Hood] of the Heisei era. Nezumi Kozo was not simply a robber. He was known throughout the country as a chivalrous robber and he was a friend of the common people. Thus, to this day he is popularly remembered. And for the spirit of chivalry and elusiveness in actions, to liken Ozawa as a Nezumi Kozo is not too far from hitting the mark. Except that from the standpoint of popularity, Ozawa has areas that are far short of Nezumi Kozo. This is the point Ozawa must reflect on. Setting aside popularity, Ozawa's strength and talent are excellent, more so than in the past. At any rate, because the ruling coalition is an assembly of different groups, it is without a central point. If there is such a thing, it would be the ruling coalition's Representatives Council. It would be the equivalent of the LDP's Executive Council and the SDPJ's Central Executive Committee. The person who controls the Representatives Council also controls the Hosokawa cabinet. It may be safe to say so. As a matter of fact, the person leading this Representatives Council is Ozawa. The Representatives Council is comprised of personnel at the secretary-general level of the ruling coalition. When one mentioned the secretary general of the previous minority parties, a feeling of fearfulness pervaded. When the SDPJ's Secretary General Akamatsu, Komeito's Secretary General Ichikawa, and DSP's Secretary General Yonezawa lined up, anyone would probably be overwhelmed by their imposing figures and strong appeal. But then, Ozawa is not overwhelmed one bit. On the contrary, as the associations increase, he has come to rise as the central figure in the Representatives Council. Right now, the pattern is one of Ozawa sitting pretty in the center, and Ichikawa and Yonezawa waiting on him on both sides. Akamatsu is being used as an errand boy by Ozawa. Ichikawa shows no respect for Akamatsu, and the atmosphere is one in which Yonezawa teases Akamatsu with such statements as "bring your credentials from the party." It was said of Ozawa that he was respected only because of Kanemaru. The fact that he could show a big face in the LDP was possible only because Kanemaru existed in the background. If severed from his relationship with Kanemaru, Ozawa would be easily blown away with one stroke. This sort of view was evident from around that time. So now Kanemaru is gone and Ozawa is by himself. This same Ozawa has plunged in the midst of the veterans of the former minority parties, without being overpowered and without flinching, and far from being an equal match, he has become the bully. After all, there is no reason why Ozawa's true capability cannot be recognized. In this manner, there is Hosokawa in the Japan New Party, Kono in the LDP, and Ozawa in Shinseito, with each party not lacking personnel. In comparison with this situation, what is pathetic is the SDPJ. Although it is the number-one party within the ruling coalition, it ranks the lowest from the standpoint of personnel. Yamahana resigned to take the responsibility of the party's crushing defeat in the general election, but regarding the process of his resignation and the selection of Murayama as his successor, various SDPJ personnel were reviewed, but none of them were considered to be high caliber. It appears that, since the days of Suehiro Nishio and Saburo Eda, the SDPJ has run out of outstanding personnel. In such a situation, the reference as the leading party of the ruling coalition will cry. Nay, not only will it cry. Its very name might be snuffed out.
