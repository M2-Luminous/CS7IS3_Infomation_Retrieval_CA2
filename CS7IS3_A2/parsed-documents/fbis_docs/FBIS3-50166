Are you going to do that? [Iliescu] This is what I am actually doing. I believe that today's discussions with the PDSR are the start of the second stage of the meetings with all parties. I will stay involved. [Baesu] Therefore, the negotiations with the opposition -- which, in the opinion of Mr. Nastase [PDSR executive president], are bound to last a long time -- will begin. Until then, a coalition government between the PDSR and the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] will be formed. Will this coalition not damage the country's image? [Iliescu] It might do some damage, but this is the formula that resulted from the discussion. [Baesu] But why was it absolutely necessary to form a government with the PUNR? [Iliescu] This is not necessary, but inevitable. [Baesu] Why? [Iliescu] Because it offers stability, for the time being. [Baesu] PUNR senator Viorel Salagean claims that such a government will not only damage the country's image, but it will not last too long, either. [Iliescu] I agree with Salagean, but the party should also agree with him. [Baesu] What do you have to say about the fact that several politicians, including Adrian Nastase, were accused by Corneliu Vadim Tudor [president of the Greater Romania Party-PRM] of being CIA spies? [Iliescu] This is stupid and despicable. He could be sued for that. It is proof of his irresponsibility. [Baesu] Nevertheless, the PRM is still the PDSR's ally. Is such an alliance not being perceived negatively? [Iliescu] I agree with you. It is perceived rather badly. [Baesu] Then, what should be done to ensure that the PDSR is no longer obliged to have such an ally as the PRM? [Iliescu] We must create another political climate, of understanding among the democratic forces. However, I would like to emphasize that I do not identify the parties with their figures. A man is not a party. As a matter of fact -- I do not want to name any names right now -- there are certain elements in the Democratic Convention (people -- our editorial note), that are by no means any more credible or desirable than some individuals from the current majority. [Baesu] Still, none of the Convention's leaders has ever made a statement like Corneliu Vadim Tudor's. [Iliescu] Well, let me assure you that they have made quite a few statements, and how! [Baesu] Can you give some concrete examples... [Iliescu] Is there a need for examples? By the way, what newspaper do you work for? [Baesu] ROMANIA LIBERA. [Iliescu] You see? Just the insolence of the writings of Petre Mihai Bacanu and Octavian Paler would suffice as examples of that.
