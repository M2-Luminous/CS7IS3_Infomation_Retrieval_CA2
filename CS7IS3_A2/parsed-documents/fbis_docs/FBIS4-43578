The nationalist coalition's first victory over the Catalan Socialists in elections other than autonomous community elections confirms, according to Jordi Pujol, the "upward trend" that CiU experienced in the last general election, within the line of the coalition's "systematic and gradual" growth since the beginning of the eighties. This growth, the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia chairman continued, is more significant since the turnout was not what Pujol had wanted, having turned much of his campaign into a moral appeal to the Catalan people to vote. Jordi Pujol was emphatic in asserting that unless the political circumstances in Spain change -- that is, if the PSOE stands fast and is not affected by this defeat, or the People's Party does not succeed in eroding its work -- Felipe Gonzalez is assured of CiU's support, since "our availability for the state's stability depends not on the European election results but on the government's continuing with a policy that will make it possible to tackle the country's problems with a chance of success." In this connection, Pujol reiterated that the economic policy is crucial if CiU is to continue its support for the government, although he pointed out that changes in autonomy policy are also necessary. The CiU leader said that the coalition will not use the PSOE's defeat -- of which he said that it was "a very serious warning" to the government -- in order to "introduce" elements that would hamper relations between CiU and the Socialists, since the proposals that the Catalan nationalists will continue to make will be of "general interest." Despite this, Jordi Pujol emphasized on several occasions that these results could affect Spanish politics and hence have repercussions on CiU's stance, although he pointed out that this depends not on CiU itself but on the government's continuing to retain the majority that it needs for its activity: "Felipe Gonzalez has 176 deputies after these elections; the same as he had yesterday and the same as he will have tomorrow," and so there will be no changes in Spanish politics unless "internal forces" in the Socialist Party or external to it change the current situation, since "stability depends on the PSOE and the People's Party -- not on us." Pujol also deemed a government confidence motion "neither necessary nor desirable," pointing out that the current legislative term is much more effective than the previous one with respect to the struggle against the economic crisis in Spain.
