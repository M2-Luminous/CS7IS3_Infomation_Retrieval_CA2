This is because the two countries can play an equally important role in supporting economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Aburizal Bakrie was speaking to newsmen during a break in a seminar on Trade and Investment Relations between Indonesia and China held in Jakarta on 5 April. He said that it is impossible for the Asia-pacific economy to grow without higher economic growth in Indonesia and China, the two most populous countries in the region. Therefore, if the two countries are competing with each other, let it be a healthy competition that is mutually complementary. [Passage omitted] In his written message to the seminar, Minister of Trade Satrio Budiarjo Judono, expressed the hope that traders from Indonesia and PRC would forge closer cooperation and take advantage of the vast opportunities available in the two countries.
