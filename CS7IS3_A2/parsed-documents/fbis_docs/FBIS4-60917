On 28 April, 120 members of the Ukrainian parliament urged Kravchuk to call off the June 26 elections. They felt early voting would provoke constitutional chaos and anarchy. Kravchuk said the parliament's refusal to call off the elections would aggravate the constitutional crisis. He said he would know what to do after the lawmakers had discussed the issue. According to Moroz, there were no legal grounds for the suspension of the presidential elections. If the president said he was out to protect the nation's Constitution, said Moroz, he must use constitutional means to do so. But, Moroz said, the president enjoyed the right to propose new legislation and could address the Supreme Soviet with a proposal for the postponement of the elections. The new body of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet will be expected to open session on 11 May.
