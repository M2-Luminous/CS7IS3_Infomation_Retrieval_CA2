The circular pointed out that this year's work of redressing irregularities in various trades would focus on the following aspects: conscientiously screening party and government organs and their personnel to check if they have taken advantage of their position to use enterprises' vehicles, computers, or communications equipment, and if they transfer enterprises' funds to their own units' "small banks" for private use under any excuse; screening party, government, and administrative organs to see if they set up "small banks" in their units; continuing to pay attention to unauthorized fees; and resolutely canceling unreasonable fees to alleviate the burden of enterprises and the masses. In fostering a fine workstyle in various trades, localities must continue to screen checkpoints and fee collection stations along highways and rivers, adjust the structure of electricity charges in rural areas, and consolidate achievements scored in the past. The circular urged governments at all levels to conscientiously strengthen leadership in redressing irregularities in various trades, regard this issue as an important task against corruption and promoting a clean government and place it high on the agenda, pay attention to key enterprises and units, gradually establish and perfect various regulations and laws, and strictly investigate and prosecute cases in violation of laws and discipline to create a sound social environment for reform and opening up in Anhui.
