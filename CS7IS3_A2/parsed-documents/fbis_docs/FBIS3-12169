Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: [Begin recording] [Segal] Speaking in English to delegates at the fifth conference of Jewish media, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin sharply condemned the massacre in Hebron and said that the peace process must continue. The prime minister was later interviewed by Israeli correspondents and here is Yitzhaq Rabin's first comment on the dramatic decisions made at today's cabinet session. The prime minister was first asked about his initial objection to the cabinet's ultimate decision to establish of a state commission of inquiry on the massacre in Hebron. [Rabin] I think that we could have managed without it. I think that it will occupy the attention of many military elements because it is a state commission of inquiry. I assume that everyone will want an attorney to look into how to prepare his defense. I think it will divert a great deal of attention from the main goal. However, since the issue was brought up with the support of several cabinet ministers, and since I do not fear the findings of such a commission -- especially not with regard to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] or the defense establishment in general -- I would prefer not to sidetrack the main effort of getting the peace negotiations back on track by starting arguments over whether or not a commission of inquiry should be set up. Therefore, let us appoint such a commission. [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, to how many of the radical settlers do today's cabinet decisions apply? [Rabin] The security forces, the IDF, and jurists will examine each case. Each such proceeding -- and we even decided on administrative detentions -- will be carried out by the military commander; or in other words, the right of appeal will be heard before a military appeals committee with a military judge and not by the defense minister and a civilian judge from an Israeli District Court, as was the case in the past. [Segal] Are we talking about individual cases, or dozens, hundreds, or thousands of people? [Rabin] I do not want to specify numbers. This decision does not deal with numbers or isolated steps. This is a policy which we will implement on a selective basis whenever required against certain people. I think that such people, while only a small minority among the settlers, constitute the focal point of friction, especially, but not only, in the Hebron area. The cabinet's decisions apply solely to them and not to the great majority of settlers in the territories. [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, the PLO has already rejected today's cabinet decisions as insufficient. What is your reaction to this? [Rabin] The cabinet's decisions were adopted by the Israeli Government which decides what will happen. If some people do not like them, then that is a pity. [Segal] Could this hinder the resumption of the peace talks? [Rabin] These are our decisions. I see no reason not to resume the negotiations unless the PLO and the Palestinians want to reward someone who not only murdered Palestinians but sought to murder the peace process. [Segal] Mr. Rabin, the country is on fire. There is rioting in the territories, in Yafo, and even in the Bedouin settlements in the Negev. What in your opinion can be done to stop this wave of rioting? [Rabin] The despicable murder carried out in Hebron against worshipers at a site holy to both Jews and Muslims has undoubtedly inflamed passions. Just try to imagine what would have happened had such a massacre taken place at a holy site where Jews were praying. Would we not all be up in arms? [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, do you believe that the talks with the PLO in Washington could resume this week? [Rabin] As far as Israel is concerned, the answer is yes. The ball is currently in the PLO's court. [Segal] In his speech earlier this evening, Rabin revealed that the state commission of inquiry would be chaired by Supreme Court Justice Me'ir Shamgar.
