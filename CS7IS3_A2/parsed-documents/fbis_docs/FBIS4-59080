The sources said that such statements come from persons who have lost all their legitimacy and legality. The sources said: Al-'Attas has been officially indicted by the state's legislative bodies, led by the House of Representatives, which presented a recommendation for a decision to stop the activities of the prime minister -- who says that he is being treated in the United States -- activities aimed to serve the views of the rebels in the international arena. The sources denied that the decision to dismiss al-'Attas was a reflection of disorder or was an arbitrary move, as his office claimed. The decision came within the national responsibility which obliges the political leadership to carry out its constitutional duties. The sources emphasized that the war decision was that of the adventurist Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] secessionists, who created the crisis and continued to carry out various provocations for nine months. On the same level, parliamentary sources have voiced surprise at statements by the secessionist YSP leadership on the constitution and said that it was these individuals who ignored the constitution and did not abide by it. They fabricated the crisis in order to avoid the constitution. The parliamentary sources said that the House of Representatives has the right to withdraw its confidence in the government if the head of this government abides by the constitution. However, the House has the right to issue a recommendation for dismissal if the Presidential Council does not exercise its rights in accordance with the constitution. The sources added: The political leadership is responsible for implementing the constitution in accordance with Articles 105 and 112 of the valid constitution. Therefore, the political leadership made the decision to dismiss al-'Attas and to refer him to interrogation. The sources noted that the decision does not need the acceptance of anyone because it is supported by the power of the constitution and issued by the state. It is also in harmony with the commitment to the constitution of the legitimate leadership and its care for national interests. It is worth mentioning that al-'Attas was one of the leading secessionist elements in the YSP and played a serious role in continuing the crisis and igniting the fire of war by his conduct, which was hostile to the unity state, and his following al-Bid, the leader of the rebellion, in their moves to escalate the crisis politically and militarily. Al-'Attas then fled from the battlefield with all the money he could gather, leaving the remaining rebellion leaders to face their fate alone.
