The exploration, jointly undertaken by China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOC) and Texaco, of the United States, started at the end of March, according to a spokesman from CNOC. The Sino-U.S. team completed a seismic survey 100 meters down, despite harsh weather conditions at the sea. The East China Sea Oil Exploration Project is a new frontier for the China National Offshore Oil Corporation in 750,000 square km of sea. Before this, China had independently conducted seismic surveys in 150,000 square km since 1979 and drilled five experimental wells, four of which have shown excellent oil prospects. About 1,000 oil-bearing structures have also been found. To speed up the development of oil exploration in the East China Sea, China conducted the Fourth International Invitation for bids for 20 locations in 72,800 square km of sea from June 1992 to June 1993. Some 73 companies from 19 countries competed for the projects and 15 oil exploration companies from seven countries succeeded in the bidding, with the total risk investment of 300 million U.S. dollars. The successful end of this phase of prospecting in the contracted area will provide scientific basis for the upcoming drilling of the first well this October, the spokesman said. About 21 experimental wells are expected to be drilled by the end of 1996.
