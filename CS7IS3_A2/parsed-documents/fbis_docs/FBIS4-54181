U.S. negotiators seem interested in discussing a wide range of trade sectors with Japan in line with the framework's three priority fields of government procurement, insurance services and trade in auto and auto parts, said Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, at a news conference. The five areas cited by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor as new priority fields are financial services, sheet glass, forestry products, intellectual property rights and deregulation for supporting competition policy, according to reports in Washington. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is prepared to discuss the areas with Washington while working out a timetable for talks, Kumano said. Negotiations to establish a new framework on the original three sectors were to have been concluded by last February's summit between the two countries. But the talks became deadlocked when neither Tokyo nor Washington yielded in the summit over their definitions of "objective criteria" for measuring American access to the Japanese market. Following Thursday's accord to restart the framework talks, both parties are expected to soon return to the negotiation table on the three priority fields.
