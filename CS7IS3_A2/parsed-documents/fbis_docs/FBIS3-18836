For the fourth quarter of the year, its target is a 4 to 6 percent increase in the money supply compared to the fourth quarter of 1993. In an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, Gaddum said a preliminary decision in this connection would probably be made in the coming months. For the longer term, the framework conditions speak for a slower expansion of the money supply. In this connection, Gaddum mentioned the less expansive financial policy, wage agreements that are compatible with stability, and the absence of tension on the foreign currency markets. "There is no reason to exaggerate nervousness," Gaddum said. For the Bundesbank there is no reason right now to abandon the monetary policy, which is guided by a long-term perspective, or to change its course as far as monetary policy is concerned.
