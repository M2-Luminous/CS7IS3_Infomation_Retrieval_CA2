The Serbian and Montenegrin officials were conferring in London with members of the British-Yugoslav parliamentary group which comprises representatives of all British parliamentary parties. The international community must support political talks and not war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said Tomic and explained that Yugoslavia upholds the latest European plan for [word indistinct] wracked Bosnia, as it provides for a countrywide cessation of hostilities as a precondition for a political settlement. The world must, however, exercise its influence primarily with the Moslem side which is obviously seeking ways to prolong the war, said Tomic. He informed the group that the U.N. Security Council's sanctions against Yugoslavia, imposed because of the country's alleged involvement in the Bosnian war, have cost the country $45 billion and are a threat to the region as a whole. Montenegrin Prime Minister Djukanoviv said that with the sanctions, the world is punishing only those who wished to protect their country. The sanctions are impermissible also because they are based on the policy of force and threats, which cannot be the foundation on which to build the new world order, he said. He explained that the sanctions are being implemented more strictly than the United Nations intended, and in illustration mentioned the problem of importing medicines, which are supposed to be exempt from the sanctions. Djukanovic said it is paradoxical that Yugoslavia is being ignored by the world at a time when very powerful democratic processes, deeper than ever before, are under way in the country. Tomic and Djukanovic condemned war crimes and those who have committed them. [words indistinct] vowed Tomic. The hosts agreed with the Yugoslav officials that there is still no readiness in the world to help create the conditions for lasting peace by according equal treatment to all warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
