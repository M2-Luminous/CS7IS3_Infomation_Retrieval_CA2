Any other person holding stocks of the affected products may sell, distribute, and use their stocks until exhausted. DATES: The cancellation order became effective on November 1, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Kathleen Depukat, Special Review and Reregistration Division (7508W), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460. Office location and telephone number: Accelerated Reregistration Branch, 3rd floor, 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA, (703) 308&hyph;8587. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice is issued pursuant to section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C. section 136 et seq. It announces the Agency's decision on a request for cancellation of the registrations of PIROR P-15 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;36) and PIROR P-05 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;42). I. Request for Voluntary Cancellation In a letter dated October 15, 1993, Union Carbide requested voluntary cancellation of PIROR P-15 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;36), and PIROR P-05 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;42) waived any comment period associated with the request, and waived any requirement for Federal Register publication of a notice announcing Agency receipt of this request in advance of Agency acceptance of this request. II. Existing Stocks Determination Union Carbide's October 15, 1993, request for voluntary cancellation expressly stated that, if EPA accepted the request, there would be no sale or distribution of the PIROR products after November 1, 1993, except for export in accordance with the provisions of FIFRA which address export of unregistered products. Therefore, after November 1, 1993, Union Carbide, its distributors and supplemental registrants may not sell, distribute or use these products after November 1, 1993. Other persons (people other than Union Carbide, its distributors, or its supplemental registrants) holding stocks of the affected products may sell, distribute, and use their stocks until exhausted. For the purposes of this order, existing stocks are defined as those stocks of the affected products which are in the U.S. and were not in the custody or control of Union Carbide, its distributors or supplemental registrants after November 1, 1993, the requested effective date of the cancellation. III. EPA's Decision on the Request for Voluntary Cancellation and Cancellation Order On November 1, 1993, EPA granted Union Carbide's request that the registration(s) of the following products containing Paraclox be voluntarily cancelled: PIROR P-15 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;36), and PIROR P05 Paper Slimicide and Water Treatment Microbiocide (EPA Reg. No. 10352&hyph;42). Concurrently, EPA is issuing a Cancellation Order for these products. This notice contains the terms and conditions of the Cancellation Order for these products. Under section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA, a registrant may request at any time that EPA cancel any of its pesticide registrations. EPA must publish in the Federal Register a notice of receipt of the request allowing public comment before granting the request unless either the registrant requests a waiver of the notice or the Administrator determines that the continued use of the pesticide would pose unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. Union Carbide expressly requested that the cancellation of its products be effective as of November 1, 1993. Union Carbide also waived any comment period and the requirement for publication of a notice in the Federal Register announcing the Agency's receipt of the request for voluntary cancellation prior to the Agency's acceptance of Union Carbide's request. Accordingly, this Cancellation Order became effective on November 1, 1993. Therefore, as of November 1, 1993, no person may distribute, sell, or use these product, except as described below. Union Carbide, its distributors and supplemental registrants may not sell, distribute or use these products except in accordance with provisions concerning export of unregistered pesticide products. Any other person holding stocks of the affected products may sell, distribute and use such stocks until exhausted. Any sale, distribution or other disposition of existing stocks that is not consistent with the terms of this Order will be considered a violation of FIFRA section 12(a)(2)(K) and/or section 12(a)(1)(A), as appropriate.
