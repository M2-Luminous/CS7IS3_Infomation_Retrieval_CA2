Britain formally submitted the proposals to China on Wednesday. Progress on the 20.3 billion dollar airport project is threatened by the lack of agreement--called for by a 1991 Sino-British pact--on how to pay for what is one of the world's biggest public works' undertakings. "China just received the new financial plan for airport... and is earnestly studying it," Wu told a weekly press briefing. Britain has been pressing for a prompt meeting of the group's airport committee, which last convened in April, to resolve the financing issue. The latest British proposal--approved Tuesday by Governor Chris Patten's cabinet--reportedly increases to more than 60 billion Hong Kong dollars (7.76 billion U.S.) the equity to be injected into the venture. China wants Hong Kong to dig deeper into its growing reserves to pay for the airport, due to be finished in 1997 when the colony reverts to China, while Patten's administration favours a greater degree of debt financing. Wu also reiterated that Patten's "intransigence and uncooperative attitude" in the row over his proposals to extend democracy in Hong Kong prior to 1997 "will end up harming Britain's interests." China has repeatedly warned that Sino-British trade ties will be affected unless Patten withdraws the package of reforms he submitted to the territory's Legislative Council in December, amid angry protests from Beijing.
