A few hours before boarding the plane that was to take him to the peninsula that is dominated in the north by a red dictator and the south by a strongarm capitalist regime, as well as to the lands of an uncertain but nevertheless much eulogized Chinese model, Mr. Ion Iliescu strengthened the bolts and screws of the state mechanism with one energetic key move. Prime Minister Vacaroiu tried in an expansive statement to convey the message that the reshuffle was according to his proposals. He could convince no one. The reshuffle is a move that obviously reflects the will of the president and the people who surround him, made exactly at a time when the voyage to faraway countries demanded that a tranquilizer be administered to the public that stays at home and to the others who were stimulated by the desire to govern. It was also a fortifier for the muscles of the central administration. The fact that the reshuffle was carried out in haste is also seen from the given situation that, except for the defense minister, no rotations could be found for any of the former dignitaries. The improvisation from this viewpoint is very clear. In order to assuage Petre Ninosu's indignation, they quickly turned to a formula that is typical of the old regime -- namely, "he will be assigned to the Senate," as if appointing people to the Senate would still be decided in Office Number One and Office Number Two [reference to Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu]. After so many negotiations, delays, and euphemisms, the hasty reshuffle suggests an action carried out under conditions of great irritation. One can speculate quite a bit about the reasons for this irritation. In any event, the public attacks to which many heads of the current political life were submitted was not the most upsetting thing, since the changes rather satisfy than discourage the slanderer nationalism. However, it would not be an exaggeration to assume that the journalistic performance, as well as the misdemeanor, to listen to the president's telephone and disclose the stenogram of the talks without any other obvious political reason but to simply make noise and show "who knocks out whom?" seem to somehow be connected with the only concrete and threatening declaration gathered from the new dignitaries -- namely, the statement made by the justice minister. In one of his states of strictness, which draws water to both the mill of sympathizers and the rivals, the president seems to have been insistent in his wish to demonstrate "who knocks out whom?" especially before the long journey. The way in which the reshuffle was carried out -- compared to the previous declarations of the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] leaders, with the effort to pretend holding a dialogue with various political forces and the entire current driving force of the country -- makes us assume that the government changes have been carried out not only with a formal consultation of the prime minister but also over the heads of those who made calculations and competition within the ruling party. Not to accept this interpretation means to assume that the PDSR is a much too conspiring formula and much too hypocritical for an important party in a real democracy. Still, there is a common element between the president and the party -- the continuously monocolor character of the government. In the light of the same relationship between the party and the president, one should also think of the very serious declaration made by [former Defense Minister] General Spiroiu upon leaving the cabinet: "I can tell you that the Army is under political control." As a matter of fact, we are not just talking about the Army but all the levers of state authority. That can be seen by anyone who is looking at the list of portfolios that have been rotated. The official declaration of the president to the effect that the goal of the changes was to accelerate the reform process, curb inflation, and stabilize economic life in general sound either superficial or cynical. In this context, even the transportation department appears significant under a strategic rather than economic aspect. Thus, there is no doubt that the goal of this reshuffle -- the same goal that has been pursued for a long time now -- was to strengthen authority through a new act of authority. Also in accordance with a more general style, certain appearances are also kept for those people abroad, especially when deciding on those changes that might acquire a European significance, when, in reality, all they do is satisfy internal political calculations. Here is just one example: the reference to the number of civilians who took the seat of generals is exaggerated when one thinks of the absence of any reference to the large file of incomplete legislation compared with the European legislation. And all this, when one of the four changes refers exactly to a "specialized" minister. Smiling in a diplomatic way toward other countries, the political behavior of our president also seems connected with the hidden thought "who knocks out whom?"
