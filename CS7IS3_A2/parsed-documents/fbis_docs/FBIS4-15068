Doctor of economic sciences. Author of 100 works on questions of the economic development of Russia and the USSR. Since the early nineties he has been working on problems of the structural crisis in the country's economy. Author of the monograph "Theory of the Long-Term Technical and Economic Development of Russia and the USSR." Less than a month ago, S. Glazyev organized parliamentary hearings in the State Duma on questions of the crisis in our economy and programs for emerging from it. These hearings were attended by virtually all the authors of programs for emerging from the crisis: from Academicians Shatalin and Petrakov to Urinson, first deputy minister of the economy, and Saburov, now premier of the Republic of the Crimea. [Tokareva] Sergey Yuryevich, you act like a man who knows his way in a fog. Could you formulate briefly and comprehensibly your amendments to the recent economic course which we know by the name of "shock therapy"? [Glazyev] The amendments have been generally recognized. They were in evidence at the parliamentary hearings. And in the president's message. First -- the need to pursue an active structural policy. In our conditions, where there is a technological, mixed economy in which hopelessly outdated production facilities exist alongside new ones, while the latter are oriented toward state demand, it is impossible to achieve market equilibrium quickly. Without an active state policy of conversion to a modern, high-tech industry, the modernization of obsolete production facilities, and incentives for the growth of new facilities, it will be impossible to clamber out of the spiral of recession. Market equilibrium will be achieved at the cost of the destruction of the scientific and technical complex and the loss of potential for future economic growth. Second. The imposition of order in the state sector of the economy. Today, with a view to reducing the budget deficit, items of expenditure on science, education, and health care, on which our society's future is directly dependent, are being axed. Yet nobody is worried about efficiency in the utilization of state property or the income from its privatization. Third. The imposition of order in state finances. I do not believe a single country with a market economy has experienced such a voluntarist approach to regulating the money supply. This also applies to the cavalier treatment of the state budget, where mistakes in the correlation between income and expenditure amount to several orders of magnitude, and a balance is achieved through self-interested manipulations involving the arbitrary sequestration of expenditure and the control of credit emissions for the refinancing of commercial banks. Unless these obvious gaps and shortcomings in the government's economic policy are eliminated, it will be impossible either to halt the decline in production or to get inflation down. Whether by orthodox methods of macroeconomic regulation, or by heterodox methods involving price regulation. Although either of these could prove productive in combination with an active policy in the three above-mentioned areas. Let me explain. An active economic policy is called active precisely because it makes provision for purposeful actions. In particular, it may use such instruments as the state order, targeted federal programs, and, where necessary and possible, price regulation. If such a policy is not pursued, we must reconcile ourselves to living with galloping inflation, rapidly destroying production, which cannot develop in conditions where price correlations are constantly changing. It should, however, be borne in mind that price regulation may be successfully applied by the state only when the purpose of the regulation is clear. When the period for which it applies is clearly defined. And when the consequences are reliably predicted. A temporary price freeze may be used as one component in a wide package of measures in the event that a policy of drastically reducing inflation is chosen. It is obvious today that the style of combating inflation used over the past two years is not producing the desired results. We can see that the task set at the beginning of the year, of achieving a reduction in inflation to a level of 3-5 percent a month, cannot be achieved by using only the instruments of limiting the state budget deficit and regulating credit emissions, and the inflation rate is hovering around 20 percent a month, a level we are now accustomed to. The reasons for this are also clear. The toughening of monetary and credit policy in the aforesaid two parameters provokes stubborn resistance at microeconomic level, as manifested in the nonpayments crisis and pressure from the regions and commercial banks with a view to obtaining ever more credits. A periodical and tough monetary policy is supplanted by a constant stream of credits and state expenditure. As a result, instead of the desired 3-5 percent inflation a month, we are seeing inflation hovering between 10 and 25 percent a month. There is no sign of a clear dependence between credit and monetary policy and the inflation rate. For more than two years now we have been in a rut, pursuing one and the same goal, which appears unattainable. It is time to wise up. [Tokareva] What is the alternative? [Glazyev] There are several tried and tested means of combating inflation. For instance, an agreement on rigorous discipline and self-restraint on income by the economic agents. It is necessary to seek a rationalization and clarification of the Central Bank's credit policy and to have a budget based on reliable forecasts and a properly functioning state sector, both of which should play an important stabilizing role in the economy. If, of course, we really want to suppress inflation quickly. [Tokareva] And after that? Although, to be honest, I do not believe in quick methods. Inflation has been building up for five years. It will take five years to cure it, too. [Glazyev] After that, if we succeed in reducing inflationary expectations, we can reduce the interest rate on credits from 200 percent to 15-20 percent, carry out a de-indexation of incomes, ensure compliance with contract discipline, and stabilize the macroeconomic situation. [Tokareva] Why has this path not been taken? [Glazyev] Because it requires major efforts. An enormous effort by the entire state apparatus. The policy that has been pursued requires no effort at all. That is simpler and, strange as it may seem, more profitable. Though not, of course, for the state. [Tokareva] During the discussion of the president's message in the Duma, you said that the Cabinet is rejecting all amendments to the current course. [Glazyev] Not rejecting, but not accepting. The prime minister has formally adopted the president's message for execution. And the existing government program formally accords with the president's message. The problem is that there is a huge gulf between the government program of August, the recent government statements which we have heard, and actual practice. Programs exist, you can read them and rejoice in the authors' good intentions, but reality goes on in its own sweet way. [Tokareva] Maybe the executive hierarchy feels rather weak and is therefore not embarking on great deeds? [Glazyev] Of course, executive discipline is lacking, as are qualifications and political will. Therefore we continue to insist on a clear action plan. We are glad that the president's message coincided with our recommendations on questions of economic policy. But we need a plan consisting of measures for implementation by specific persons. Accountability. A time scale. Only thus will words become deeds. [Tokareva] But nowadays we do not have a party that can use fear to call its members to account. [Glazyev] The president has sufficient levers to make the government implement the domestic policy he has proclaimed.
