FR941004-1-00120 FR941004-1-00018 (e) Allotments. Allotments to Indian tribes are computed based on section 433 of the Act and are based on a ratio of the number of children in each Indian tribe with an approved plan compared to the number of children in all Indian tribes with approved plans, based on the most current and reliable data available. (f) Waivers of requirements. ACF has waived for Indian tribes three statutory requirements: (1) The limitation on administrative costs to 10 percent of total Federal and tribal funds; (Indian tribes may use the indirect cost rate agreement in effect for the Tribe.); (2) The requirement that funds under this program may not be used to supplant other Federal and non-Federal funds; and (3) The requirement that a significant portion of funds must be used for both family support and family preservation services. (g) Matching requirement. (1) Funds used to provide services in FY 1994 and in subsequent years will be federally reimbursed at 75 percent of allowable expenditures. (This is the same Federal financial participation rate as title IV&hyph;B, subpart 1.) The Indian tribe's share must be at least 25 percent of the total or 33 percent of the Federal share. Federal funds, however, will not exceed the amount of the Indian tribe's allotment. (2) The Indian tribe's contribution may be in cash or donated funds. In addition, Indian tribes, by statute, may use the following three Federal sources of funds as matching funds: Indian Child Welfare Act funds, Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act funds, and Community Development Block Grant funds. (h) Fiscal and administrative requirements. An Indian tribe must expend all funds by September 30 of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds were awarded. Other fiscal and administrative requirements will be found in the compilation of statutory assurances to be prepared by ACF.
