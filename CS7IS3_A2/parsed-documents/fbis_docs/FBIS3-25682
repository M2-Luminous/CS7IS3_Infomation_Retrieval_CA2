In its statement, the CAR asserts that in fact, some faults were committed and that it is the present government entirely committed to the RPT which has organized the elections, provided security, and ensured the appointment and management of personnel and the equipment. Once again, the CAR reaffirms its unchanging desire for nonviolence and immediately encourages all the political parties to respect the verdict of the ballot box.
