He said that presently Turkey buys one or two million tonnes of Russian oil as spot purchases and this could be expanded to three million tonnes, therefore entering a long-term agreement. Vural said the oil deal would be discussed when Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets visits Turkey next month to consider how to increase trade and economic links. `We would like to expand our exports of consumer goods to Russia, and we have a key interest in our investments in contracting and services there,' Vural said. Turkey, which imports the bulk of its oil from Saudi Arabia and Iran, did not buy any Russian crude in the first quarter of this year, but took 129,000 tonnes in the same 1993 period.
