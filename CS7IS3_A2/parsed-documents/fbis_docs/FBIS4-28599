In your excellency's view, are there any obstacles that may cause this process to stray off course? If so, what are they? [Pham Van Dong] In the current renovation process in Vietnam, our nation is advancing on an uncharted path. In such an advance, our nation will certainly face many obstacles in various forms. With our clear-sightedness and vigilance, we are trying to exploit all our potential to prevent, overcome, and remove all obstacles in order to achieve our goals. [Correspondent] What were the reasons that led to the decision by Vietnamese leaders in 1986 to embark on such a renovation? Did your excellency take part in that decision? In your capacity as adviser to the party Central Committee, will your excellency continue to participate in the drafting of the renovation policy? [Pham Van Dong] In the years immediately after our national reunification, we thought we could advance directly to socialism. Now we realize that this was a mistake caused by our willful, subjective, and leftist thinking, one that is usually made by revolutionaries. It is imperative to find a new path, a path that can be used only as a transition in conformity with the pattern of history. This is precisely the goal our people have pursued over the past 15 years as it is suitable to our country's geographical, political, economic, and social characteristics. These developments led to the Sixth Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1986 -- a congress of renovation, clear-sightedness and revolutionary bravery, and culture. Life has attested even more clearly to the diversified potential of the renovation movement. We have done our utmost to discover and develop these potential through our actual work and our theoretical studies. A large movement of history is always inbuilt with great cultural and humanistic values that can only be fully developed with the wisdom and savvy of the entire nation. As provided for in my functions, I have been and will continue to participate in the drafting of the renovation policy and in the implementation of the renovation process. [Correspondent] While shifting to the market economy, will there be any danger of Vietnam renouncing its socialism? How do you guarantee that the transition takes place without any political and social upheaval? Does President Ho Chi Minh's thought still have value for contemporary Vietnam? [Pham Van Dong] Your very interesting question inspires my answer. First, it should be recalled that the market economy, one of the great achievements of humanity, has existed in different social regimes. Since time immemorial before the arrival of capitalism, there has been many stages in which the market economy has developed magnificently. It is not our policy to develop just any market economy, but one in accordance with the socialist orientation and the appropriate management of a state governed by law. To us, it could only be a law-governed state of the people, for the people, and by the people, and imbued with the Vietnamese identity. Such a market economy would be the future course for achieving the goal of building a prosperous people, a powerful country, and a equitable and civilized society. From there, they will develop gradually and proportionately in a ever more intensive and extensive fashion. The liberal and comprehensive development of each person is the condition for the liberal and comprehensive development of all people. Here we see one of the main aspects of the integration between culture and renovation in our country. In this domain as well as in the entire renovation process, Ho Chi Minh thought will be a source of inspiration and the orientation for action for the entire nation. It should be added that the core of Ho Chi Minh thought is to liberate the nation, society, and humanity. It is also a driving force in the evolution of history. Because of this Ho Chi Minh thought has contemporary value and will always remain so. [Correspondent] How does your excellency view Vietnam as it is about embark on the 21st century? Can Vietnam become a potential tiger [economy] of Asia? Can or should Vietnam join the ASEAN community? Does your excellency have any observations on Vietnam's current relations with France, China, and the United States? [Pham Van Dong] Our foreign friends have often talked about the possibility of Vietnam becoming a tiger in Asia. There are reasons for their saying so. For us, we are striving for an ever-faster economic growth on a firm basis in parallel with social justice, constantly improving the people's material and cultural life, thus modestly contributing to peace, national independence, democracy and social progress in the world. As for Vietnam's ties with ASEAN countries, representatives of our government have time and again clearly stated: China, France, and the United States are countries that have friendly ties with us. However, each country has its own particularities that we are fully aware of its importance. We are trying our best to develop fine relations with each of them in the interest of each side as well as for the sake of peace and development in the region and the world. [Correspondent] With your abundant experience of many years in the leadership role, what is your excellency's view about the progress Vietnam has made over the past 20 years? [Pham Van dong] As time goes by, people see their past more clearly. On the other hand, in our era which is one of constant and eventful changes, we must be equipped with a new vision so that we can see this era more clearly. As in our national situation, this vision is precisely the vision of culture. Culture, in its broadest definition, means the most profound aspiration and the finest achievements of human beings in the history of mankind. After the embryonic period and the initial stage of 20 years, the renovation has meant overall progress for the country. It is similar to a great cultural motivation with an inbuilt inexhaustible source of human potential to be discovered and developed. Here I would like to say a few words about the Vietnamese people. They are people who have been steeled through the countless ordeals of the country's history and through their millennium-old heroic struggle. This has helped the Vietnamese people find their own creative path of development. The Vietnamese people have achieved constant growth imbued with humanistic and nationalistic traits. The renovation in Vietnam at present is a great undertaking of the Vietnamese people and will constantly advance to new horizons.
