FR940928-0-00022 FR940928-0-00006 Farmers Home Administration 7 CFR Part 1944 Cost Containment and Vulnerability_Corrections Agency: Farmers Home Administration, USDA. Action: Final rule; correction. Summary: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) corrects errors on the final rule published on February 14, 1994 (59 FR 6869&hyph;6897) concerning cost containment. The intended effect of this action is to correct errors in the final rule. Effective Date: September 28, 1994. For Further Information Contact: Gail McCowan, Rural Rental Housing Branch, Multi-Family Housing Processing Division, Farmers Home Administration, USDA, room 5337, South Agriculture Building, Washington, DC 20250, telephone (202) 720&hyph;1623. Supplementary Information: FmHA published its final rule on February 14, 1994 (59 FR 6869) which encompassed numerous additions and changes intended to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the Section 515 program, as well as to reduce costs associated with construction and related amentities. (1) FmHA inadvertently included dishwashers as an acceptable feature in elderly unit design. Dishwashers are acceptable only for central kitchens in congregate and group home projects. As stated, allowing dishwashers in elderly projects when they are not even acceptable in individual congregate living units is contradictory and will lead to higher construction costs. The results of this error would significantly conflict with the Agency's current emphasis on cost containment. (2) A discrepancy exists in the language of Exhibit A&hyph;8 between the introductory page and paragraph IV Housing demand forecasts. The word ``person'' referred to in ``Persons Living in Substandard Rental Units'' and ``Persons Experiencing Rent Overburden'' outlined in paragraph IV should read ``Households'' as outlined in the introductory page. In addition, paragraph IV Housing demand forecast requires the market analyst to subtract ``Comparable Rental Units'' from the overall demand figure. These words were erroneously included in the housing demand calculation and are being removed to prevent miscalculation of housing need and demand.
