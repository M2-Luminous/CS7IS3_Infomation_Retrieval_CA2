After concluding his three-day official visit to New Zealand, Cetin arrived in Australia on Wednesday. Speaking to the press on the situation in the Balkans, Cetin said that any decision which was not based on political will and power will not be effective. He said that NATO and the U.N. Security Council should clearly give an ultimatum that further aggressions will not be tolerated. "The Bosnian tragedy showed that unless there is a power behind your decisions, no one will listen to you," he said. "Now, a new world disorder prevails in our region, instead of a new world order." Cetin stressed that Europe had failed to maintain peace in the Balkans. "The agreement reached between the Croats and Bosnians is an indication which gives us hope," he said. "A solution seems to be very near if the world applies pressure." Cetin and his Australian counterpart Gareth Evans held official talks afterward. An extradition agreement was signed at the end of the talks. Cetin was received by Australian governor Bill Hayden and Prime Minister Paul Keating. Evans hosted a dinner for Cetin in the evening. Cetin was welcomed with a ceremony befitting heads of states, in Australia. [passage omitted]
