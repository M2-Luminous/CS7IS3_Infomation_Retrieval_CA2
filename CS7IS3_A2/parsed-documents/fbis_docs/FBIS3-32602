The prosecutor handling the case thinks the two drivers' testimonies conclusively prove that Lopez shot and killed Diaz inside the car. The drivers testified behind closed doors in Sensuntepeque preliminary judge Lucila de Paz's office. Legal proceedings lasted nearly eight hours. A representative of the Prosecutor General's Office was present at all times. The key witness, Lopez's driver, refused to speak to the press after making his statements for the judge. The other driver said he did not know the motives for the crime, although he received in his Soyapango residence the U.S. Embassy vehicle with Diaz's body still inside. [Begin recording] [Second driver] Yes, they arrived at my home. [Reporter] What happened? What did the other driver tell you? [Driver] He only told me they were racing. Only that. [end recording] The drivers' statements confirm their earlier statements made to the Soyapango court. The prosecutor general's office has reported that Diaz was indeed killed by a .38 caliber bullet while taking Maj. Lopez from Cabanas to San Salvador. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] It is clear that although the witness did not say he saw who fired, the three men were in the car. The shot came from behind. The only person in the back seat was the major. There is an extremely strong presumption of guilt. Unfortunately, presumption tends to disappear from penal codes. At present, however, the presumption that the major did fire on Diaz is strong. [end recording]
