Thus, they are dealing with the outside world as if it is blind, deaf, and mute. In an interview with CNN, the Israeli prime minister said he did not directly or indirectly hear that Syria is prepared for full peace, adding that he knows, however, what Syria wants from Israel in return for peace. TISHRIN continues: Although Syria never conceals its resolve to restore the occupied Golan, it has for years stressed adherence to the establishment of a just, comprehensive Middle East peace. Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, Syria has renewed this assertion hundreds of times. The recent Geneva summit was one occasion when Syria clearly explained its concept of peace and its nature. It also voiced its readiness to honor all peace requirements. Moreover, through President al-Asad, Syria called for concluding the peace of the brave. It also urged the Israeli leaders to rise to the level of the cause of peace and to have the necessary courage to establish a just, comprehensive peace in the region and remove the Middle East from the cycle of war and conflicts. TISHRIN continues: It sounds odd that while the entire world is convinced of Syria's credibility and honest quest for peace, praises its efforts and initiative, and values its stands, the Israeli rulers find no reason to be convinced. The paper notes Rabin's recent statement in which he said: We do not know what kind of peace will be agreed on, and to where we will pull out. The paper says: It must be reasserted that Syria is looking for a just, comprehensive peace; a durable, stable peace; a genuine peace that ends occupation and restores rights to their owners; a peace that is acceptable to the current Arab generations and worthy of being maintained by future generations. Such a peace must be honorable and must uproot injustice, oppression, and occupation. TISHRIN explains that such a peace requires Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan. It says that Syria has frequently asserted that it will never bargain over an iota of the Golan soil nor will it relinquish an inch of it. Any compromise, which Israel wants, is absolutely out of question. The Golan Heights are Syrian and have been since time immemorial. They should be returned to the motherland and to their evacuated population, who are awaiting the establishment of peace to return to their homes. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace in the Middle East is no longer exclusively a Syrian or Arab issue. Rather, it is a world issue. The world will not allow that a unique peace opportunity be destroyed. Two years of Israeli intransigence have so far failed to destroy this opportunity.
