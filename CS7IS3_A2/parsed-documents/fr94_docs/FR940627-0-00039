FR940627-0-00039 FR940627-0-00009 B. Discount Information for Affiliate and Non-Affiliate Transactions The current §250.16 regulations require pipelines to disclose affiliate discounts on their EBB and to maintain non-affiliate information, which will be provided to the Commission, upon request. As discussed earlier, the Commission is deleting the requirement for pipelines to post affiliate information on their EBBs, because the pipelines contemporaneously post affiliate discount information under Standard H. A number of commenters contend the Commission should eliminate the reporting requirements entirely. Tenneco maintains that the reporting requirements are not needed to monitor or prevent abuse, because sufficient information about the processing of transportation requests and rates is maintained by the pipelines and would be available if allegations of undue discrimination are made. It states permanent data collection and posting requirements should not be imposed based on unsubstantiated suspicions that abuses will occur in the post Order No. 636 environment. Several commenters argue the Order No. 497 requirements are duplicative of the requirement in §284.7(d)(5)(iv) that pipelines file discount information with the Commission. 61 Natural argues that since the Commission found the Part 284 reporting requirements to be sufficient for firm service, these requirements similarly should be sufficient for interruptible service. Columbia argues that, like the allocation of firm capacity, the allocation of interruptible capacity on its system takes place during the nominating/bidding process conducted through and disclosed on its EBB, and therefore no separate Order No. 497 posting requirement is needed. 61 Columbia, KGPC, Natural, Tenneco. The Commission will retain the requirement for pipelines to maintain discount information for affiliates and non-affiliates and provide that information to the Commission upon request. Information on discounting is needed for the Commission to monitor affiliate transactions, and this information is not duplicated elsewhere. 62 The information required in §250.16 is more extensive than the discount information required to be filed under Part 284. For example, the discount information under §250.16 includes the quantity of gas scheduled at the discount for each delivery point, which is not included in the Part 284 reports. The Commission requires the more detailed information to adequately monitor and compare affiliate and non-affiliate transactions. 63 62 Most pipelines do not provide public access to the details of their interruptible discounts on their EBBs. If Columbia believes that its EBB currently would provide the Commission with the required information about affiliate and non-affiliate discounts required in this rule, it may seek a waiver of the reporting requirements. 63 See Order No. 497, FERC Stats. & Regs. [Regulations Preambles 1986&hyph;1990] at 31,147. For example, the actual quantity information can be used to determine revenues received from affiliate and non-affiliate transactions. Such information is needed to monitor transactions and is also needed to properly evaluate the throughput adjustments pipelines propose in rate cases to reflect transportation discounts. Accordingly, the Commission will continue to require pipelines to maintain discount information for both affiliate and non-affiliate transactions. They must provide this information to the Commission upon request, within a reasonable time, according to specifications and formats prescribed by the Commission in Form No. 592. 64 64 The information also must be made available under the Commission's discovery procedures. The Commission had proposed to eliminate the requirement for the pipelines to provide the discount information for firm capacity, stating that, under Order No. 636, much of the posting and awarding of firm service by the pipelines will take place on the pipelines' EBBs. The Commission, however, has reconsidered and will continue the current requirement that pipelines include firm discount information in the data to be made available to the Commission. First, after review of pipeline tariffs, the Commission is not sure that all pipelines will be posting the details of their sales of firm capacity on their EBBs. Second, including firm discounts in this data will enable Commission staff to process the information more easily, because all relevant discount information will be provided in one format. IX. EBB Access and Archiving Requirements Under Standard H, pipelines will be posting information related to affiliate discount offers on their EBBs and, under §250.16(c), they also will be posting the affiliate contract allocation data on their EBBs. In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to conform the Order No. 497 EBB posting requirements with the EBB requirements under Part 284, and the Commission is adopting this approach. The pipelines, therefore, must ensure that the affiliate information is displayed in a user-friendly format and that their EBB incorporates the same features as apply to the other aspects of the pipelines' EBBs. 65 The protocols and procedures for accessing the affiliate information also must be the same as those used to access each pipeline's EBB. Thus, the pipelines must permit users to obtain the affiliate information by using the same phone number and log-on procedures used to access the information about available capacity on the pipelines' EBBs. 66 65 See Order No. 636, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,415. For example, the requirements to provide information through downloadable files, to provide on-line help, search functions, and menus, and to provide for backing-up, archiving, and retrieval of this material would be the same as those for the capacity availability information posted pursuant to §284.8(b)(4). 66 For example, the Commission envisions that, in most cases, the Order No. 497 information would be a separate menu item that users could choose when they log-on to the pipeline's EBB.
