Sixto Batista Santana, national CDR coordinator, called on CDR members to contribute to achieving an understanding for and to support the measures, so as to overcome the economic difficulties that have appeared following the collapse of the socialist bloc and the worsening of Washington's blockade. The main leader of the CDR, created 33 years ago, presided over the second meeting of the CDR National Directorate in which surveillance by CDR members in every block of the country was analyzed as an important factor to prevent crime, according to a wire item reported today by the National Information Agency. At the meeting, it was agreed to recognize the work of prominent CDR members in performing their tasks and the mission of explaining to the population the new financial provisions, the source indicated. The Council of State decreed an increase in the price of some products, such as cigarettes, beer, rum, and such services as electricity and urban transportation, as well as general payment for water service. During the semester from October 1993 to March of this year, CDR members from all over the country contributed 243,068 voluntary blood donations, donated over 11 million crystal containers, 8,000 tons of paper and carton, and 2,587 tons of aluminum, in a contribution they make each year to public health and the national economy.
