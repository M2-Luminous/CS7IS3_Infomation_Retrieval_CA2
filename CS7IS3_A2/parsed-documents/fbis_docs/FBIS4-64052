This diagnosis was included in the report of Crimean Vice-Premier Yevgeniy Saburov, who addressed the first session of the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of the peninsular republic, which resumed its work on Thursday. According to Saburov, one of the major contributing factors to the economic situation consists in Ukraine's opposition towards initiatives aimed at economic stabilization, which resulted in virtual disruption of the forthcoming summer vacation season. (Crimea used to be one of the most popular places to spend one's summer vacation in the former Soviet Union; it is famous for its numerous resorts, beaches, entertainments, etc.) When explaining measures suggested by the Crimean Government and aimed to lead the republic out of the crisis, Saburov pointed out the task of attracting external investments. In his opinion, developing the transportation sphere should be the first priority - that is, developing a network of airports and sea ports, establishing a trade route along the Strait of Kerch. The second guideline is the recreation field based on Crimea's huge resort/sanatorium potential and oriented to the average consumer. Investments in development of the oil and gas-extracting industry are also important, but, however, potential damage to Crimean nature has to be taken into account. To conclude, the vice-premier pointed out reinforcing the leading industries and agriculture. He described privatization as one of the major means of raising production effectiveness. He also envisioned a substantial liberalization in the economic field, an open-door policy in respect of investors and lifting many other restrictions. In Saburov's opinion, it will take about two years for Crimea to overcome the crisis, provided that "the government acts correctly". When debating on the report, lawmakers made some pungent criticisms in regard of the report and the proposed programme for stabilizing the economy. Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov emphasized that it is absolutely inadmissible to accuse the government, which has not actually set about working, which does not exist in point of fact. Meshkov called upon the lawmakers to realize the full measure of their responsibility before the people of Crimea, to appreciate the confidence they are enjoying and take care of the interests of the Crimeans, rather than their own ambitions and self-esteem.
