FR940720-2-00015 FR940720-2-00007 With respect to the 1988 debt forgiveness, we found in Certain Steel from Italy that a portion of Finsider's liabilities was forgiven in connection with another restructuring of the state-owned steel industry undertaken from 1988&hyph;1990. We treated this forgiveness as a countervailable subsidy to ILVA, which was the respondent company in that investigation. However, in Electrical Steel, we focused our investigation on subsidies provided directly to the producer of the subject merchandise, rather than subsidies received by its parent company. Therefore, we did not treat the debt forgiveness provided to Finsider as a countervailable benefit in Electrical Steel. In this case, petitioner has not shown that any debt forgiveness was provided directly to Dalmine or that a portion of the debt forgiven to Finsider in 1988 can be attributed to Dalmine. On this basis, we are not including the 1981 or 1988 instances of debt forgiveness provided to Finsider in our investigation. 4. European Investment Bank (``EIB'') Loans Petitioner claims that Dalmine received loans from the EIB in the early 1980s. While petitioner has not alleged that the EIB loan program itself represents a countervailable subsidy, petitioner contends that Dalmine received EIB loans at interest rates below the rates that should have been applied to an uncreditworthy company. The Department has previously found EIB loans to be not countervailable (see, e.g., Certain Steel Products from Belgium, 58 FR 37273 at 37285 (July 9, 1993)). Because petitioner has not provided any new information that would cause us to change our earlier determination, we are not including the EIB loans in our investigation. 5. European Regional Development Fund (``ERDF'') Subsidies Petitioner claims that some loans obtained by Dalmine from the EIB and ECSC may have been subsidized by the ERDF, but has not presented any evidence in support of this allegation. At verification of the responses submitted by the European Community (``EC'') in Certain Steel from Italy, we found that ERDF grants are provided to regions whose development is lagging behind and to regions seriously affected by industrial decline. In addition, we found that rural regions with certain development problems are eligible for ERDF aid. In the instant case, however, petitioner has not demonstrated that Dalmine has production facilities in the regions that are eligible for ERDF assistance. Moreover, there is no evidence in the petition or in previous investigations that ERDF grants are used to subsidize ECSC or EIB loans. For these reasons, we are not including the ERDF grants in our investigation. 6. Early Retirement Under Law 193/84 Petitioner alleges that Dalmine has used the early retirement provisions under Law 193/84 and that this program provided a countervailable subsidy to Dalmine. Petitioner requests that the Department treats benefits under Law 193/84 as non-recurring grants. Dalmine's Annual Reports show that the company used early retirement pursuant to Law 193/84 in 1984 through 1987. In Certain Steel from Italy, the Department found early retirement, including the program provided under Law 193/84, to be countervailable. Because early retirement is a program we typically consider to be recurring ( see the General Issues Appendix to Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Austria, 58 FR 37217 at 37226 (July 9, 1993), we countervailed the program as a recurring grant in Certain Steel from Italy. At verification in Electrical Steel, Italian government officials explained that there were two laws providing for early retirement in 1992: Law 223/91 and Law 406/92. We found early retirement under Law 223/91 to be not countervailable in our final determination. We did not make a determination with respect to any other early retirement laws, including Law 193/84, because these laws were not used by the Electrical Steel respondent in the period of investigation. Petitioner has requested that, because the Department did not make a determination with respect to Law 193/84 in Electrical Steel, we should investigate whether Dalmine used early retirement under Law 193/84. However, information collected in Electrical Steel suggests that Law 193/84 has been superseded and petitioner has not presented any evidence to the contrary. There is no evidence in the petition that Dalmine used early retirement under Law 193/84 after 1987. Rather, petitioner apparently believe that we should change our practice and treat early retirement as a non-recurring benefit. The last year for which we have been able to establish that Dalmine used early retirement is 1991. The Annual Report for that year shows that Dalmine used the early retirement program under Law 223/91, which we found to be not countervailable in Electrical Steel. Moreover, petitioner has not presented any information that would cause us to change our earlier determination that early retirement, if found countervailable, should be treated as a recurring grant. For these reasons, we are not including early retirement in our investigation.
