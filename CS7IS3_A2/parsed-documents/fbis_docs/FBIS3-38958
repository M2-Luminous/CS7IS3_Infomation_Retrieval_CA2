In a statement to ANATOLIA Agency at the conclusion of the NATO Council meeting, Ozceri assessed the developments saying that the removal of heavy weapons from a radius of 20 kilometers within 10 days has been envisaged. He noted that the deadline is 20 February and that the heavy weapons will either be pulled back from the region or handed over to the UN peacekeeping forces. Ozceri noted that the heavy weapons belonging to the Bosnian Muslims will remain in the region under UN responsibility. He added that a very close relationship has been formed; a decisionmaking mechanism has set up between the commander of the NATO southern Europe allied forces in Naples and the commander of the UN peacekeeping forces within the framework of the principles and methods developed at the military committee since August in a bid to speedily activate the air strike system in the event the aggressor does not comply with the ultimatum. He stated that no one doubts the system will function very well, adding, however, that the command should come from the United Nations. Ozceri said that the UN secretary general will have to authorize the first raid, and the subsequent orders will come from his representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Expressing the wish that the NATO decision will have an effect on Serbia and Bosnian Serbs, Ozceri said: This is a satisfactory decision from Turkey's viewpoint. Turkey had been predicting every stage since August 1992 and had, therefore, put forward an action plan. Unfortunately, our warnings were not heeded. At this point we have passed through all the stages predicted by Turkey and we have reached that point which we envisaged to be the last. Ozceri noted that the decision is beneficial from the viewpoint of preserving NATO's credibility as well.
