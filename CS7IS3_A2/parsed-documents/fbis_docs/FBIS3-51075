Negotiation Agenda The parties will negotiate the general agenda on the set of issues for the Mexico agreement. For each point, the parties will jointly decide on the scope of their commitments, which will be subject to verification. The government and the URNG have pledged to be duly represented during the negotiations by high-level delegates in order to reach political accords that are within the constitutional framework, without limiting their ability to reach accords on institutional and constitutional reforms. II. Moderating Bilateral Negotiations The parties agreed to request that the UN secretary general appoint a representative to assume the duties of moderator in the bilateral negotiations between the government and the URNG. The parties agreed that the moderator may propose all initiatives aimed at expediting the signing of a lasting and firm peace agreement. III. Civil Society Both parties recognize the contribution of sectors that, as a result of the Oslo Agreement, attended the meetings in El Escorial, Ottawa, Quito, Metepec, and Atlixco with the URNG. Such meetings gave momentum to the negotiating process in Guatemala. Their participation and contribution helped make the beginning of direct negotiations between the government and the URNG command possible. The parties agree that Guatemalan society will continue to play an essential role in the achievement of peace and in the process of reconciliation. Without affecting other mechanisms and forums, be they temporary or permanent, aimed at favoring national reconciliation, the parties agreed to promote the creation of an assembly. Such assembly will be open to participation by all nongovernmental sectors of Guatemalan society, provided that they can prove their legitimacy, representation, and legality. This assembly will operate during the negotiating period and shall have the following functions: i) To discuss the substantive agenda of the bilateral negotiations, that is points ii to vii of the general agenda of the Mexico Agreement, in order to establish positions of consensus. ii) Convey to the UN moderator, the Government of Guatemala, and the URNG the recommendations and suggestions made as a result of their deliberations. Such recommendations and suggestions will not be binding and will be aimed at facilitating an understanding between the parties. The assembly will discuss the substantive agenda in accordance with a calendar adjusted to the established terms of bilateral negotiations, and it will not be able to delay the process of bilateral negotiation. iii) To know the bilateral accords on the substantive agenda concluded by the parties and endorse said accords to give them the character of national commitment, which will facilitate their implementation. However, if for some reason this bilateral accord is not endorsed, this accord will maintain its validity. The parties agreed to ask that the Bishops Conference of Guatemala consider Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno for the post of conciliator, when appointing the president of the assembly. The president of the assembly will have the support of an organizing committee. The organizing committee will consist of representatives from each of the sectors that participated in the Oslo process and representatives from Mayan sectors. The president of the assembly will have the following duties: i) To convene the assembly. ii) To organize its deliberations with the assistance of the organizing committee. iii) To promote the drafting of recommendations for a consensus on the points of the agenda. iv) To inform the UN moderator and the parties of the recommendations and guidance suggested as a result of the assembly deliberations and to participate in special sessions of the bilateral talks convoked for this purpose by agreement by the parties concerned. v) To receive from the UN moderator the bilateral agreements on substantive topics signed by the two parties. To inform the assembly about them and promote their approval by the assembly. IV. Role of Friendly Countries The parties ask the Governments of Colombia, Spain, the United States, Mexico, Norway, and Venezuela to constitute a group of friends to the Guatemalan peace process. The friendly countries, duly informed of the progress and content of the negotiations between the parties, will have the following duties: i) To support, with their efforts, the UN secretary general representative in speeding up the negotiation process. ii) To give greater security and firmness to the commitments made by the parties in their role as honor witnesses of the agreements reached within the negotiating process, when the parties so request it. V. Procedures i) Dissemination: The parties agreed that the bilateral negotiations will be carried out under the utmost secrecy to guarantee that they will be held in a climate of trust and seriousness. They agreed that the only public information on the status of the talks will be given by the representatives of the UN secretary general in order to coordinate them with the work of the assembly. The moderator and the president of the assembly will establish adequate agreements to permit an exchange of information that will not violate the secrecy needed for the negotiations. ii) Temporary framework: The parties expressed their commitment to reach an agreement for a firm and lasting peace within the shortest time possible in 1994. Within this context, they agreed to give proof of the necessary flexibility for the successful negotiation of the general agenda. iii) Within the framework of their efforts to speed up the negotiating process, the parties recognized the advisability of resorting to any measure that will bring about rapprochement and agreements between them and stated that they are wiling to respond to any requests made by the moderator in this regard. VI. Verification Mechanisms Verification is a key factor in guaranteeing compliance with and respect for the agreements. Consequently, the parties reiterated that all agreements must be accompanied by the appropriate national and international mechanisms for verification. The United Nations gives a high degree of reliability to international verification. Both parties agreed to ask the United Nations for verification of all the agreements in substantive as well as operational aspects.
