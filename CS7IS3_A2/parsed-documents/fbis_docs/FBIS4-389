I will also repeat it today or tomorrow and explain at length why we have taken the present important decision. At present, I would like to thank those who make up the government which has just been set up for agreeing to assist us at a time when our country needs the strength of its children. I would also like to thank and give support to our country's forces who acted swiftly after the death of president and did their utmost, as always, to preserve the peace of Rwandans, especially here in the capital. We also thank the Army for the good decision it made with the assistance of some civilian leaders and set up a Crisis Committee. We shall inform you about those who make it up. The Crisis Committee is made up of some high-ranking Army officers and other officials. The Crisis Committee's role was very crucial. Without it, so that it could take important measures to follow what was happening in Kigali after the enemies [word indistinct], we could have found ourselves in more trouble in relation to peace. I ask those present to help me to thank the members of the Crisis Committee. As I told you at the beginning of my speech, the day before yesterday, the members of the Crisis Committee, after consulting the five parties which are in the transitional government took an important and useful step that was in keeping with the Constitution before the broad-based transition started after the Arusha agreement. Basing themselves on the Constitution, especially Article 42, they asked me to implement the content of the article. I found that what they asked me to do was correct. I agreed to this because I believed that all of you, the Army, ministers and all Rwandans who love their country supported me. The deputy speaker of the National Assembly said it best: We have not violated any article. We are within the law. We consulted our legal experts on the legality of the decision. They said that we were right. Some who do not understand the Constitution enough will surely criticize our action. However, that is normal. The decision we made was to extricate the country from the constitutional vacancy. There was no longer any leadership. After the killing of the president, the prime minister and some of the ministers, there was no longer a leadership. Before the setting up of the broad-based transitional institutions, there was a need for courageous Rwandans to make a decision like the one we made. The prime minister has just summarized his government's program. He has asked some of his ministers to act fast to explain to Rwandans why we made the decision and reflect this in their work. I said that my speech would be brief. I will have enough time to explain to Rwandans and foreigners, to explain our program for the next few months so that we may lead our country up to the setting up of broad-based transitional institutions as contained in the Arusha agreement, without any obstacles in our path, while our people are in peace.
