A. Chernyavskaya, Odessa Electrotechnical Communications Institute; UDC 621.396.019.4] [Abstract] The upper boundary of the average probability of error is obtained with discrete-weight addition of an arbitrary number of diverse signals, received in statistically non-uniform channels with Nikagami fading. It is demonstrated that in the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-correlated diversity reception channels, and also when there is energy asymmetry, the discrete-weight addition is an effective method of signal processing, including a situation when majority addition is inefficient. This feature can be used as a criterion for selecting the engineering solutions when designing the addition devices. Figure 1; references 7: Russian
