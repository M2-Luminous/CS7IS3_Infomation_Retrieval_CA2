The briefing was attended by the Kunming-based National People's Congress deputies, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee members, persons in charge of the provincial branches of various democratic parties and people's organizations, well-known public figures without party affiliation, as well as prominent ethnic minority and religious personages. Lang Dazhong said in his report: Since the Second Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee concluded last August, the provincial party committee and government have attached great importance to the deep anticorruption struggle, conscientiously carried out mobilization work and made arrangements in this regard, and employed practical and feasible measures. The discipline inspection, supervision, procuratorial, judicial, and other functional departments across the province have also done a lot of work to this end. The broad masses of the people have reported and provided clues on a large number of corruption cases with the result that a batch of major and serious corruption cases have been cracked and handled, a batch of corrupt elements penalized, a batch of malpractices resented by the masses wiped out, and a batch of unreasonable charges abolished. The malpractice of going on domestic and overseas sightseeing tours at public expense in disguised form has been put to an end. With a serious and conscientious attitude, leading cadres at and above city level across the province have also held internal democratic meetings; placed themselves under the supervision of the masses; and conducted self-examination and self-rectification in accordance with the five central regulations on building a clean government and maintaining self-discipline among cadres with the result that a batch of problems have been resolved. These activities have dealt a telling blow at all types of negative and corrupt phenomena. At the moment, the provincewide anticorruption struggle is still going on in an in-depth manner in accordance with the central arrangements. Lang Dazhong stated: The whole province should make continued efforts to fulfill three major tasks during the next stage of the anticorruption struggle and heighten understanding of the anticorruption struggle; consciously adhere to the principle of firmly and simultaneously grasping two key work aspects; concentrate on attaining three goals; see to it that leading cadres remain honest and maintain self-discipline; and waste no time in investigating and handling corruption cases and rectifying malpractices. At the moment, we should also make every possible endeavor to prevent such malpractices as holding banquets and giving gifts at public expense, engaging in extravagance and waste, and so on, from recurring during the Lunar New Year Festival. The meeting was also attended by Ling Huan, provincial party committee deputy secretary; Yang Ming and Mai Xiqiu, provincial people's congress standing committee vice chairmen; Dao Shixun, Xiang Chaozong, and Liu Bangrui, provincial CPPCC committee vice chairmen; as well as persons in charge of the relevant departments.
