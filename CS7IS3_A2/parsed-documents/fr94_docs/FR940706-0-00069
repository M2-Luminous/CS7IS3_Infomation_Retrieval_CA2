ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary revises Part 74 (Administration of Grants) and amends part 77 (Definitions that Apply to Department Regulations) of the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR). These final regulations implement Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;110 establishing uniform administrative requirements for Federal grants and agreements awarded to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations will be effective October 1, 1994, and will apply to new and continuation awards made on or after October 1, 1994, with the exception of §§74.12, 74.21, 74.25, 74.34, 74.44, 74.45, 74.46, 74.47, 74.51, 74.52, 74.53, 74.71, 74.72, and 74.75. These sections will become effective after the information collection requirements contained in those sections have been submitted by the Department of Education and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. A document announcing the effective date of these sections will be published in the Federal Register .

Individuals who use a telecommu nications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 27, 1992, OMB published a proposed version of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 (57 FR 39018). OMB received over 200 comments from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, professional organizations, and others. After considering all comments, OMB published the circular in final form on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62992). The Secretary revises Parts 74 (Administration of Grants) and 77 (Definitions that Apply to Department Regulations) of EDGAR to incorporate the revised Circular. The Secretary has deviated from the text of the Circular to make certain technical changes. In addition, the Secretary has made two substantive changes to the text of the Circular. Section 412 of the Department of Education Organization Act (DEOA)(20 U.S.C. 3472) provides that the Secretary may delegate the functions of the Department only to officers and employees of the Department. Section XXX .4 of the Circular, however, has the effect of delegating one of the Secretary's functions_granting exceptions to the regulations as promulgated by the Secretary for Department programs_to employees of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In order to avoid this conflict with the DEOA, the Secretary is deviating from the text of the Circular to authorize the Secretary to grant exceptions to the regulations after consultation with appropriate officials of OMB.
