Applicant states that it will continue to operate the facilities connected with the lease. Applicant states that it will have enough capacity to satisfy its firm obligations after the abandonment of capacity proposed here. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with regard to this application should on or before October 3, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.20).
