Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang was speaking as a new body, the Chinese Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment, was founded in Beijing. Chen, who was elected chairman of the association, said it would be a great help in the government's battle to control and treat drug addiction. The association is composed of medical experts and officials from relevant State departments. It will carry out publicity campaigns warning of the dangers of drugs, treat addicts and abusers and guide medical units in the clinical use of narcotics. Narcotics are indispensable as effective painkillers, Chen said, but their random use could be harmful. A sample survey in Beijing found three in every 1,000 people are dependent on drugs. China now has 250,000 registered drug addicts, most of them young and middle-aged men, in 17 provinces across the country. But experts say the actual figure must be higher. Most of the addicts, reliant generally on heroin and opium, are concentrated in the south and northwest of the country. Drug abuse has become the major channel for the spread of HIV, which leads to AIDS. Among the 1,159 HIV carriers reported from China's mainland, about 60 percent got infected through intravenous injection of narcotics. Drug abuse, according to World Health Organization (WHO), is the excessive use of narcotics, tobacco, alcohol and medicines which may lead to addiction.
