Making up one third of the total pork output of the country, Sichuan supplied other provinces with about one million tons of pork last year. As pig raising is profitable, more and more farmers are taking to it. At present, more than 60 percent of the local farmers' cash revenue comes from sales of pigs. Meanwhile, the local government has drawn up favorable policies to encourage the farmers to raise more pigs and popularize new technology in this field. Twenty counties have been chosen to be built into lean pork export bases. The province is also paying attention to pork processing and trading in a bid to improve economic efficiency.
