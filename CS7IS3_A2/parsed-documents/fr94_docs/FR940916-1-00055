(a) The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2696 (e)), allows funds from annual appropriations to extend beyond the fiscal year in which the acquisition was funded. This authority may be used for acquisitions of supplies or services, regardless of dollar amount or contract type. Use of this authority requires that: (1) The acquisition normally would be considered severable (i.e., the services are repetitive and can be started or stopped any time; would normally be funded and performed within a fiscal year; and are not services integral to the creation of an end product. An example is janitorial services.); (2) The base performance period is twelve months, begins in the current fiscal year, and crosses into the next fiscal year; and, (3) Full funding for twelve months is available in the current year. (b) If the acquisition involves more than one source of funds, the contract shall be priced to identify the source of funds (by allotment) with the relevant portion of the total supplies or services. For current Department contracts, bilateral modifications are authorized where necessary to convert to a performance period that crosses fiscal years, as long as the requisite funding is available as described in paragraph (a), and provided that the total contract length does not increase. (c) Use of this authority shall be documented in the contract file and be included as part of the Advance Acquisition Plan and Price Negotiation Memorandum. If neither document is relevant to the acquisition, the contracting officer shall prepare a written document to the file indicating compliance with this subsection. (d) For acquisitions conducted by overseas posts that are funded by another agency, the contracting officer shall ensure that funding for the full twelve-month period is available at time of award if the authority in 22 U.S.C. 2696(e) will be used.
