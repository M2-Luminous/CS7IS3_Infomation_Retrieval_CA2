Within his one-day visit to Moscow Mate Granic, the Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, had a meeting with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev. Their talks related to all the important elements of the crisis on the territory of former Yugoslavia, particularly the Washington Agreement between the Croats and Muslims, and its results. Elizabeta Gojan reporting from Moscow. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Granic] We had talks on all important problems relating to the crisis on the territory of former Yugoslavia. We had talks on the Washington agreement, its results, the current phase of negotiations in Vienna, and the necessity to include the third party [Serbs] in the negotiations, because without the inclusion of the third party it is not possible to find a final solution for restoring peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and likewise to achieve a global solution to the crisis. We also had talks on UN Protected Areas in the Republic of Croatia and the need for their peaceful reintegration. [passage omitted] [Granic] We particularly welcome the standpoint assumed by the Russian Federation regarding the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia and the need for the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] mandate to secure in practice all that is laid down in the UN Security Council resolutions and to start serious negotiations with the local Serbs. The Washington agreement is the first important one in the restoration of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose results can already be seen on the ground. However, it does not resolve everything. There is no final solution without the inclusion of the third side. An agreement which is to be reached between the federation and the third side will determine the content of the confederation. Therefore, all negotiations on the federation should be completed, which will then be followed by negotiations with the third party and the final definition of the content of the confederation. As the United States played a very positive role in the convergence of views and in the final signing of the preliminary agreement, both in the present phase of the negotiations and... [pauses] As they have backed this agreement, the Russian Federation can likewise play an extremely positive role in influencing Serbia itself, and the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in exercising influence on the Serbs in the UN Protected Areas [in Croatia]. [Gojan] Have you been given some guarantees? [Granic] Talks will in every case be continued. The exchange of views will also be continued. We have also agreed some further steps.
