The Riigikogu session voted again on some draft laws before the president's arrival -- the new defence minister Indrek Kannik is no longer an MP, but he had nevertheless voted twice on Monday [10 January]. The president held a 14-minute speech, criticising the government coalition and specifically Prime Minister Mart Laar for the inopportune time for the replacement of the ministers. The government's secretive way of acting is alienating the people from the government, the president warned, stressing that he is attempting to protect the "Fatherland" against the results of its own acts. He regretted Laar's "lack of statesmanship" in not resigning and maintaining the existing secretive system of decisionmaking. Meri warned against an "infiltration of Russian state capital into Estonia" and rhetorically asked, "Who really owns the Republic of Estonia?" The president again stressed the efficiency of Toomas Sildmae in the Economy Ministry and expressed his doubts whether the change of ministers will increase the confidence of the national business circles. Referring to the NATO summit, Meri claimed that the reshuffle was conducted at the most unfavourable moment. However, he signed the document relieving the four ministers and appointing their successors. The president declined from answering any questions of the MP's and left immediately.
