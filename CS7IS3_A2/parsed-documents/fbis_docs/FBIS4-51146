Malaysia has Proton. Suzuki can be found in Hungary. Fiat is in Poland. China has joint ventures with Volkswagen, Peugeot, Chrysler and General Motors. It was the good old days when the world's industrial nations accounted for nearly all vehicle production and the bulk of their sales. The time has come for the developing world to cry for attention. In 1993, the emerging markets, mainly central and eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, India, China, and Latin America, produced approximately 19 percent of the world's vehicles, twice that in 1985. Next year, the World Bank said in a forecast, the emerging markets will absorb one-tenth of the world's car sales. Vehicle sales in these countries have been growing at least 30 percent annually. "Many developing countries that aim to grow through industrialization regard the automotive sector as a suitable way to achieve this objective," said Yannis Karmokolias, author of several studies on automotive industry. It is true that the automotive industry can be crucial in a nation's economy, as in the U.S., where auto accounts for five percent of gross national product and 17 percent of industrial employment. Now, nine percent of manufacturing output and 10 percent of manufacturing employment in Mexico relates to car industry, while in Brazil, six percent of manufacturing output comes from auto making. While absorbing aluminum and zinc alloys, iron and steel products, auto industry links extensively with marketing, repair and maintenance, fuel and lubricants, insurance, shipping and accessories. Still, the industrial nations constituted three-fourths of the world car market. The big three of the U.S. are gaining market share. Some developing countries are hovering around self- sufficient level. But opportunity is there: there is huge surge in car sales in leading Asian nations, sales rose by close to 50 percent in Hungary, and the registrations for cars in Mexico and Turkey have doubled in five years. In recent discussions sponsored by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), emerging auto markets were ranked by current and potential size: Latin America leads India, China, ASEAN and Eastern Europe. According to IFC estimates, in 1995, 77.5 percent of the world auto sales will go to the industrial nations, although Latin America and South Korea will account for 3.3 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. Developing countries should know, observers said, that their automotive industries do not need to start with assembly, as has been the case, but could be based on component manufacturing that might lead to assembly. While developing countries regard Western countries as major markets for their vehicles, these countries appeared less interested in developing and sustaining their domestic markets, observers said. "To encourage domestic sales yet avoid being swamped by imports requires a careful mix of policies related not only to domestic production, but also to trade, pricing and credit," the IFC said in a recent policy paper. In some developing countries, governments are withdrawing from the sphere of auto production, especially in Latin America, where not a single share of auto component firms are held by public authorities. But in Asia, the governments' role in shaping trade policies, exchange rates, regulations, price structures, access to credit, privatization and the handling of the labor force remains extensive. On policy, some governments are advised not to change gear in jerky fashion, or set auto industry policy too rigidly, which, observers said, might lead to the industry's weakening and turmoil.
