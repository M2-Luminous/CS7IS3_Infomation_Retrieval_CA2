This figure, the police emphasize, includes the indicator for the number of serious crimes, reduced by 33.9 percent, attempted homicides (27.2 percent), aggravated assault (12.5 percent) and theft of state property (17.9 percent). Side by side with this, complains the republic's MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], it has not succeeded in achieving positive results in reducing the number of crimes involving theft of personal property and possessing and selling drugs. To the chagrin of the republic's organs of internal affairs, in the period being analyzed there was a sharp increase in the number of motor vehicle accidents on the roads of Ingushetia, in which 60 people died and 75 were injured. Notwithstanding the 33.3 percent reduction in the indicators in the 1st quarter, juvenile crime is a particular worry for the staff members of the Ingushetian MVD. The conclusions of the departmental report contain proposals on improving the work of GAI [State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate] and the management of the republic's motor transport enterprises, and on educational work among young people. On the initiative of the Ingushetian MVD, the republic is discussing the problem of building correctional institutions, which, in the opinion of representatives of the organs of law and order, should contribute to more harmonious relations between the people of the republic and the law. At the same time, Ingushetia is preparing to build a new capital for the republic, an on-going building project which will be approved at the end of this June. The local press is presently carrying on an animated discussion on the name of the city, and planning-surveying work has already begun, six kilometers southwest of Nazran, on the banks of the Sunzha. The administrative-cultural and housing complex of the capital, for 50,000 inhabitants, includes the settlements of Sunzhu and Ekazhevo. Right now in Nazran, a commission of architects from the North Caucasus is considering five plans, submitted to the government of Ingushetia, for the future city. According to NG information, the government of the republic has focused its choice on the design of the Russian Scientific Research Institute of Urbanistics. Valeriy Kim, its director, feels that urban construction in Ingushetia should take into consideration the heightened seismicity of the region, as well as the special features of the foothill landscape. The dominant architectural features of the future capital, according to the design of the Scientific Research Institute of Urbanistics, will be the great mosque, the orthodox temple and the presidential palace. Open spaces around each of the objects, small streets with unique, truly Caucasian buildings, mountain slopes within view of the city -- this is how the architects envisage the new capital of Ingushetia. To NG's question to an associate on the staff of the president of the republic, as to whether a penitentiary would be included in the plan for the capital, it was said that by the time the city is built on the banks of the Sunzha (construction is slated for completion in 10 years), crime will be completely eradicated in Ingushetia, and the need for this type of service will fade away by itself.
