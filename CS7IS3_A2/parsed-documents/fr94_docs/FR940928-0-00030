FR940928-0-00030 FR940928-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;234&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9018; AD 94&hyph;18&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; Saab Model SF340A and SAAB 340B Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document corrects a typographical error that appeared in the above-captioned airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Saab Model SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes. That AD currently requires inspections to detect discrepancies of certain main landing gear (MLG) retract actuator bracket retaining bolts; replacement of discrepant parts; installation of washers, if necessary; and eventual replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain nose landing gear (NLG) trunnion pin cross bolts. This action corrects terms in the compliance time specified for the requirement to remove the NLG trunnion pin cross bolts. This action is necessary to ensure that operators are not required to perform actions at a time that does not correspond with scheduled maintenance. DATES: Effective October 11, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations was previously approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 11, 1994 (59 FR 46543, September 9, 1994). ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Saab Aircraft AB, Product Support, S581.88, Linköping, Sweden. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Quam, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2145; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 24, 1994, the FAA issued AD 94&hyph;18&hyph;05, amendment 39&hyph;9018 (59 FR 46543, September 9, 1994), to require inspections to detect discrepancies of certain main landing gear (MLG) retract actuator bracket retaining bolts; replacement of discrepant parts; installation of washers, if necessary; and eventual replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain nose landing gear (NLG) trunnion pin cross bolts. That action was prompted by reports of extension and retraction problems on the MLG, due to loose retract actuator brackets on the MLG shock struts. The actions required by that AD are intended to prevent a loose retract actuator bracket from interfering with the MLG shock strut trunnion support, which could result in the inability of the MLG to extend or retract. Recently, the FAA has become aware of a typographical error that appeared in paragraph (c) of the published final airworthiness directive, which would incorrectly require operators to replace the NLG trunnion pin cross bolts at a time that may not correspond with scheduled maintenance for the NLG. The compliance time for paragraph (c) was incorrectly published as, ``At the next MLG overhaul, or within 12,000 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs earlier *␣*␣*'' However, the correct compliance time for that requirement should have referred to ``*␣*␣* at the next NLG overhaul.'' Since it is essential that operators perform the replacement in a timely manner and at a time when the NLG is normally serviced, this document corrects the compliance terms of paragraph (c) of AD 94&hyph;18&hyph;05, amendment 39&hyph;9018, to read as follows: ``(c) At the next NLG overhaul, or within 12,000 landings after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs earlier, remove the existing nose landing gear trunnion pin cross bolt, P/N NAS 1305&hyph;54D, and replace it with a new bolt, P/N NAS 1305&hyph;50D, in accordance with Paragraphs C. through F. of the Accomplishment Instructions of Saab Service Bulletin 340&hyph;32&hyph;094, dated October 29, 1993, or Revision 1, dated March 4, 1994.'' The effective date of the rule remains October 11, 1994. Since no other portion of the regulatory information has been changed, the final rule is not being republished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on September 21, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
