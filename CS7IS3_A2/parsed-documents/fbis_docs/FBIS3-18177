She invited the president, the speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA], all the political parties except for the Prosperity Party [PP] and the Democracy Party [DEP], all the democratic establishments, and citizens to come to the rally. She said: Together, let us oppose those who are trying to destroy Ataturk's republic, the unity of our country and nation, and the democratic and secular state order. In a written statement she issued today, the prime minister pointed out that the public is deeply concerned that a party which claims will set up a just order is engaging -- in line with certain dark intentions and calculations -- in ugly and extremely dangerous activities aimed against Ataturk and the secular Turkish state he symbolizes. She added: Regretfully, it is being observed that some of the representatives of this party in the TGNA have clearly established a front against our republic and the secular order which we established with great difficulty and are trying to uphold, and that they take their daring and insolence so far as to insult our great leader Ataturk. It has also been observed that certain deputies, including a True Path Party [TPP] deputy -- who are all members of the TGNA, the existence of which we owe to Ataturk himself -- share and support this dark, fanatic, and anachronistic view. We have the honor of being loyal to Ataturk's principles and we are proud of this virtue. Ciller stressed that she will not allow anyone to insult the great leader Ataturk -- who left an important mark on the 20th century with his ideas and reforms -- his reforms, or the secular order. She added: It is impossible for the enemies of Ataturk to remain in our midst. The TPP has sent this deputy -- whose views we can never share -- to the disciplinary council to be ousted from the party. It should be known that the action of these deputies who have taken a stand against secularism, and who have slandered and thus betrayed the founder of the Turkish Republic, the great Ataturk, will not remain unanswered. Whatever is necessary will be done. Ciller pointed out that now is the time to protect Ataturk and all his principles and reforms, mainly secularism. She added: For this purpose, I call on our honorable president, the speaker of the TGNA, all the political parties except for the PP and DEP, our democratic establishments, and all our honorable citizens: Together, let us oppose those who are trying to destroy Ataturk's republic, the unity of our country and nation, and the democratic and secular state order. From the president to the simplest citizens, from deputies to civil servants and workers, and from prosecutors to students, let us all meet at the rally of respect to Ataturk we will hold at Taksim Square in Istanbul at 1200 on Monday, 28 February. We are waiting for all those who are sincerely loyal to Ataturk and to his principles and reforms which we protect to come to the Istanbul rally with Turkish flags in their hands.
