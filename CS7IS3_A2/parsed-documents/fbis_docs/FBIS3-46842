These were the words spoken by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at an informal gathering held at the Prime Minister's Official Residence on the afternoon of 28 December, the closing day of official business, as he reflected deeply on the past five months since the establishment of the coalition government. Successive Late Night Decisions Nevertheless, during that particular week in mid-December, there occurred a succession of "late night dramas" that symbolized the coalition government's suddenly facing a crisis, as the favorable winds which supported the prime minister lost the power they once had. The coalition government hoped to make a decision on partial opening of the rice market on 13 December. The prime minister remained in his office from that evening, anxiously waiting for the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to make its decision on the rice issue. He ate a mouthful of donuts his eldest daughter brought him. From the open windows, he could hear the shouting of demonstrators protesting partial opening of the rice market. It was nearly 0200 hours the next day when the SDPJ finally arrived at a decision, saying that it "is opposed to partial rice market opening, but understands the prime minister's decision." The prime minister then began his news conference at 0400 hours. Two days later, a decision to extend the current Diet session for 45 days to have political reform bills enacted during the current session was finally made at the lower house plenary session a little after 2300 hours. However, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] boycotted the session. Consequently, the outlook on the fate of the political reform bills became more uncertain. Finally, 17 December arrived. This time, it took until the very late hours of the night to decide on whether to work on drafting the budget for the next fiscal year by the year-end or carry over the work to next year. Prime Minister Hosokawa was busy in his office, calling senior officials of coalition parties to coordinate opinions. That night, the prime minister revealed his feelings through his facial expressions -- something unusual for him -- as he replied to a correspondent's question, saying: "The ruling coalition parties are ever so divided over this issue." Political reform, the rice issue, action that needs to be taken against serious and unprecedented economic deterioration, and tax reforms including consumption tax hikes -- in considering the significance of each of these tasks, it is natural that the prime minister is having difficulties. Even since the days when the LDP was in power, it has been considered that trying to solve any one of these tasks would "require determination on the part of the prime minister with a readiness to sacrifice the cabinet" (as stated by a close aide to the prime minister). Prime Minister Hosokawa himself had that kind of determination. On 20 November, leaders of various nations participating in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Seattle, Washington successively congratulated Hosokawa, saying: "Congratulations on the success of your political reform efforts." The prime minister replied: "No, no. It will be much more difficult with the upper house of the Diet." Thus, it was Hosokawa himself who actually made what seemed to be an overly cautious remark. However, it is questionable whether he could have predicted that deliberations at the upper house on the political reform bills were yet to start one month thereafter. Meanwhile, as political reform remained stalled, other pending issues began to pile up. "Endurance is the only way." Recently, the prime minister has often spoken these words at the Prime Minister's Office and at his official residence. Since he is well aware of attacks from the LDP and moves by dissident SDPJ members, the term "endurance" probably applies to the fact that his power to keep the coalition government together seems to have begun fading away. "The Prime Minister's Office has not been doing its job properly." These were words spoken by an angry Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], on the night before a decision was made on carrying over the work on drafting the fiscal year 1994 budget to next year. Seeing Ozawa in such anger, Hosokawa was unable to even bring up discussion to seek his advice on the all-important budget issue. Ozawa's complaints were primarily aimed at Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who tried to make various decisions while frequently consulting with senior LDP officials. Ever since the inauguration of the coalition government, the split between Ozawa and Takemura, rather than narrowing, has come to the verge of shaking the very foundations of the coalition government. Bureaucrats Start Shying Away From Supporting Coalition Government Seeing the coalition government wavering, it seems that bureaucrats, too, are beginning to shy away from supporting it. Recently, Prime Minister Hosokawa has taken the most pains with working out policy adjustments with the Ministry of Finance concerning tax cuts which will serve as the pillars of anticyclical measures. The following dialogue between Hosokawa and Jiro Saito, administrative vice-minister of finance, illustrates this situation. Hosokawa: "Since keeping tax cuts and consumption tax hikes as a single package has a negative effect on economic recovery, can it be arranged so that the two can be treated separately?" Saito: "Such a request is unacceptable." The Finance Ministry refuses to concede, insisting that "fiscal matters have priority." For example, it has asserted: "Previous prime ministers have all followed our plans." The leaders of various coalition parties and bureaucrats who are expected to support the prime minister in the coalition government are fighting among each other, as they all have their own opinions and stances that they must uphold. For a certain length of time following the inauguration of the coalition government, things seemed to proceed smoothly somehow with favorable winds blowing. Suddenly, however, a situation has emerged where the prime minister must exercise leadership to get things moving. Giving Up on Skiing and Hot Spring Baths Indecision on the part of the prime minister would directly lead to his being bombarded by criticism that he "lacks leadership" or is pursuing a "wait-and-see politics." At the 21 December meeting of the Expanded Policy Committee of the Sakigake [Harbinger]-Japan New Party [JNP] parliamentary group, even members of the prime minister's own party successively complained that "the Prime Minister's Office has failed to exercise leadership." Hosokawa spent New Year holidays in 1993 at his villa in Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture quietly working out his plans on the lower house general election and on removing the LDP from power. It was a bewildering year for Hosokawa. The plan to oust the LDP from power succeeded, and Hosokawa himself became prime minister. Then passed the brilliant period when the new coalition government firmly stood up, advocating "reform." As soon as the New Year holidays are over, Hosokawa will immediately face a truly crucial moment when the existence of the coalition government will be at stake. The prime minister will be spending most of his time during the end of the year and the New Year holidays at his official residence, giving up on skiing and resting at hot springs -- the way he originally hoped to spend the holidays -- because "there are so many things that must be taken care of."
