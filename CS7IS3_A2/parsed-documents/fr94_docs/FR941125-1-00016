FR941125-1-00016 FR941125-1-00007 3. Monitoring Network The maintenance plan must contain provisions for the continued operation of ozone air quality monitors in the area to be redesignated. This is needed to provide verification of the maintenance of the NAAQS attainment, and is also needed to provide triggering data for the activation of contingency measures in the event of a future violation or exceedance of the NAAQS (the State may choose to activate some contingency measures when the NAAQS is simply exceeded but not yet violated to prevent future NAAQS violations). 4. Verification of Continued Attainment The State must assure that it has the legal authority to implement and enforce all measures necessary to attain and maintain the NAAQS. In addition, the maintenance plan must indicate how the State will track the progress and success of the maintenance plan. This includes tracking air quality levels and emissions. 5. Contingency Plan Section 175A of the amended Act requires that a maintenance plan include contingency provisions, as necessary, to promptly correct any violation of the NAAQS that occurs after the redesignation of an area to attainment. For the purposes of section 175A, a State is not required to fully adopt contingency measures that will take effect without further action by the State. The contingency plan, however, is considered to be an enforceable part of the SIP and must ensure that the contingency measures will be adopted and implemented expeditiously after they are triggered. The plan must clearly identify the measures that will be considered for adoption, a schedule and procedure for their adoption and implementation, and a specific time limit for action by the State. The plan must also identify the specific indicators or triggers that will be used to determine when the contingency measures will be required. II. Summary of the Illinois Redesignation Submittal Summarized below are the contents of the Illinois redesignation request and maintenance plan. A. Monitored Attainment of the NAAQS During the period of 1990 through 1992 (the three year period covered by the redesignation request), two exceedances of the ozone standard, 0.127 ppm and 0.125 ppm, were monitored in Jersey County, with both exceedances recorded in 1990. The expected ozone standard exceedance rate for the 1990&hyph;1992 period was 0.67 exceedance per year. This is in contrast to seven ozone standard exceedances, with a peak ozone concentration of 0.128 ppm, monitored in 1988, when ozone monitoring was initiated in Jersey County. The IEPA has quality assured the 1990&hyph;1992 ozone data for Jersey County and has entered these data into AIRS. As a check on the continued attainment of the NAAQS in Jersey County, one may also consider the 1993 peak ozone concentrations (not addressed in the Illinois redesignation request, but registered in AIRS). Two exceedances of the ozone standard, 0.135 ppm and 0.127 ppm, were monitored in Jersey County in 1993. The 1991 through 1993 data continue to show attainment of the ozone NAAQS, with an annual average expected exceedance rate of 0.67. These data show that attainment of the ozone NAAQS has been monitored in Jersey County based on the most recent quality assured air quality data available. B. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D Until 1991 and prior to the 1990 amendment of the Act, Jersey County had been designated as attainment for ozone. The only ozone precursor emission control regulations covering Jersey County were statewide Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) regulations and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations covering the growth of new or existing sources. The USEPA has promulgated PSD regulations for Illinois, which have been delegated to the State for implementation. The USEPA has previously approved Illinois' RACT regulations covering Jersey County. The IEPA certifies that all RACT controls required in Jersey County have been implemented and will remain in effect after the redesignation of the County to attainment. These rules will remain in effect until the State demonstrates to the USEPA's satisfaction that the ozone standard can be maintained without one or more of the controls. Title 40 CFR part 52, subpart O, section 52.722, evidences that the Illinois SIP was approved under section 110 of the Act and that the USEPA found that the SIP satisfied all part D, title I (as amended in 1977), requirements. The 1990 Act amendments, however, modified section 110(a)(2) and under part D, revised sections 172 and 182 adding new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to satisfy the requirement that the SIP meet all applicable requirements under the Act, USEPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures and information that were due under the Act, as amended in 1990, prior to or at the same time Illinois submitted the redesignation request as considered here. The USEPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(V) of the Act to mean that, for a redesignation request to be approved, the State must have met all requirements that applied to the subject area prior to and at the same time of the submission of the complete redesignation request. B.1. Section 110 Requirements Although section 110 of the Act was amended in 1990, the Illinois SIP addressing the Jersey County area meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2). A number of the requirements in section 110(a)(2) did not change in substance and, therefore, USEPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP meets these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended (57 FR 27936 and 23939, June 23, 1993), many duplicate other requirements of the Act and are addressed below. B.2. Part D Requirements Before Jersey County can be redesignated to attainment, the area and its associated SIP must meet the applicable requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified in table 1 of section 181(a) of the Act. As described in the April 16, 1992, General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I, specific requirements of subpart 2 may override Subpart 1's general provisions (57 FR 13501). On November 6, 1991, Jersey County was classified as a marginal ozone nonattainment area (56 FR 56694). Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the State, for Jersey County, must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D as they pertain to marginal ozone nonattainment areas.
