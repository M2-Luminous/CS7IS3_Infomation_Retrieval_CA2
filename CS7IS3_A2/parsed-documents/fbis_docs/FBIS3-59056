They might achieve almost 30 percent of the votes. This is the result of a poll conducted by the Institute for Applied Social Studies (Infas). According to the poll, 6 percent of all voters are sure that they want to vote for such a group. Another 23 percent think they will "probably" vote for such a group. In December, the Bonn-based institute polled 914 representative voters for FOCUS, asking their opinion of the Instead Party. The Instead Party was founded in the summer of 1993 by Hamburg Christian Democratic Union "rebel" Markus E. Wegner. It only ran in the repetition of the land parliament elections, which Wegner had finally achieved by court order. The party won 5.6 percent of the votes and entered into a government coalition with the Social Democratic Party. Encouraged by the success in Hamburg, voters' associations in all laender are now forming Instead Parties; and an expansion throughout Germany is already agreed. Whether the Instead Party runs in the Bundestag elections next autumn will be decided during the summer. The prospects for the party are good: Every other voter thinks that the Instead Party is a necessary addition to existing parties. There might be some skeptical attitudes on the issue of consistency: 57 percent of those polled think that the Instead Party "will have disappeared before long." According to the study, the Instead Party's greatest potential lies with younger voters. A total of 72 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds consider such groups necessary, while only 38 percent of those over 50 think so, and 49 percent of them consider these groups superfluous. Among the middle-aged, 46 percent think such groups are necessary, while 33 percent do not think much of them. On the whole, men are more inclined towards the Instead Party than women. The party's potential lies with workers, self-employed people, and freelancers.
