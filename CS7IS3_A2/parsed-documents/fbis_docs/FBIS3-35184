The attack took place near the border between Rafah and Egypt, when machine-gun fire was directed at an Army jeep patrolling in the area. Army troops returned the fire, and two residents of Rafah were injured. Meanwhile, in the center of Hebron, a bomb was set off last night on one of the main streets. It exploded but caused no injuries or damage. Settlers in the territories are now blocking roads in protest over the murder of Tzipora Sason, the 30-year old woman from Ari'el who was shot by terrorists last Friday night. At the site of one of the roadblocks is reporter Mark Weiss: [Begin recording] Groups of settlers at five locations throughout the West Bank set up roadblocks at 5 o'clock this morning. Coordinated by the YESHA' [Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip] settlers council, the protesters burned tires and threatened to turn back Arab vehicles; however, nearly all Arab cars turned back before reaching the settlers' roadblocks or, as in the past, planned to wait till 7 o'clock before traveling on the roads, knowing that the demonstrations end at 7 o'clock. [passage omitted] Large numbers of soldiers and police are on hand, but so far there have been no confrontations, and the security forces have decided not to disperse the settlers and to allow the protests to continue.
