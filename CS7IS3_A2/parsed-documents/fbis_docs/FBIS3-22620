The Yugoslav Association for Combating AIDS, the IDEA PLUS Agency, and the television's Third Channel have made a poster and a radio and television spot on the basis of a study. As it has been learned that young people have been informed about the ways AIDS spreads and the methods of protection, but that they do not apply that knowledge, the objective of this courageous campaign is to influence young people's way of life in a way most suitable for them. It was said at the meeting that according to estimates, in the year 2000, 40 million people will be infected with AIDS. According to the latest data, there have been 322 AIDS cases in Yugoslavia and 251 in Belgrade alone. Therefore, one must not get discouraged about the struggle against AIDS. Campaigns aimed at adults and at people with atypical behavior are also planned. [end recording]
