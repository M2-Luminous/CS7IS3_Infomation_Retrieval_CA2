The sources revealed new details about the fighting that took place Monday morning in the al-Qall area near the village of Kanoua'. An eyewitness who smuggled his report out of the country says that before dawn on Monday a military group entered the al-Tars [as transliterated] area near al-Qall and set up a roadblock, halting the traffic. Cheikh 'Ali Kebir (60) happened to by passing by with two other people in a truck driven by him. The military group, the sources said, continued to move into the area, and at about 1030 hrs it was ambushed in an area called Mahafir al-Baghlah [as transliterated]. The ambush had been set up by gunmen belonging to the Armed Islamic Movement. The sources added that the gunmen attacked the group with their automatic weapons, and that the elements manning the roadblock knew about the incidents, so they killed Kebir and his two companions. Armed Islamist sources put the number of dead among the security forces at 500 [as published], among them three officers holding the rank of first lieutenant. Furthermore, Front sources say that 'Ayn al-Na'jah military hospital in the capital is overstreched during the month of Ramadan, noting that the focus is on liquidating those collaborating with the authorities, who are described as informers by a report on military operations.
