Especially, it seems, the Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] rebels, they finally began turning up at the camps before Christmas but apparently didn't like what they found or rather didn't find, in particular basic facilities and the lack of food, water, and clothing. Well, now, up to 600 Renamo soldiers are reported to have walked out of camps in central Sofala Province. Renamo's spokesman Almeida dos Santos called us up this afternoon and Dan Isaacs asked him if it was true that the soldiers were quitting the assembly areas. [Begin recording] [Dos Santos] Yes, this is really true. We have received reports that in Chiramba, one of the assembly points, the soldiers have been leaving. Unfortunately, when President Dhlakama recently visited one of these assembly points, he discovered that the soldiers had no food and they had no clothing. Not only that, the huts in which they were living in, they were very poor, I would say sort of tents which are just plastic [word indistinct] that have been distributed to them, instead of giving them real tents. [Isaacs] Mr. dos Santos, I find it a little bit difficult to believe when I have just spoken to the United Nations who say there are a few local problems, but on the whole, food and clothing are getting through to the assembly areas? [Dos Santos] Well, probably since that visit that President Dhlakama had made to Chiramba assembly point, we have not had a follow up to this, because the United Nations, in the name of Dr. Aldo Ajello, had promised that it would send in a helicopter that would carry the president to also visit the other assembly points. If they had improved the situation, I am quite sure that our soldiers would not have moved out of this assembly point. [Isaacs] Afonso Dhlakama, the Renamo leader, and now you, yourself, have been complaining about conditions in the camps and the Renamo soldiers themselves are voting with [words indistinct] by leaving some of these camps. What do you propose to do? What do you plan to ask the United Nations now to do? [Dos Santos] We have got to force the United Nations to make sure that they actually create these conditions and in the meantime, I think the main thing that we could do is to ask the United Nations, jointly with our members who are in the Cease-Fire Commission, to go round to make sure that they try to put back the whole situation.
