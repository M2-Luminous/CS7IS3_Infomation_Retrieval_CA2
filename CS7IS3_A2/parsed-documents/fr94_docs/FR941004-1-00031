FR941004-1-00031 FR941004-1-00007 For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The CTGs that apply to the four RACT rules follow: ‚ê£ 1Rule No. 1CTG title 1EPA No. 331 Control of volatile organic emissions from solvent metal cleaning EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;022 333 Control of volatile organic compound emissions from large petroleum dry cleaners EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;82&hyph;009 340 Control of volatile organic compounds from the use of cutback asphalt EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;037 353 lControl of volatile organic emissions from bulk gasoline plants EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;035 Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 1. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. The Division's submitted rules include the following significant changes from the current SIP: Rule 331, Solvent Cleaning 1. The cooling capacity of freeboard chillers has been specified. 2. A provision for a vapor level control safety switch on vapor degreasers has been added. 3. Regulations for small conveyorized degreasers have been added. 4. Provisions for Control Officer approval of alternate control devices have been deleted. 5. Test methods for determining compliance and recordkeeping provisions have been added. 6. Exemption of wipe cleaners and a proposed schedule for compliance have been deleted. 7. A definition of ``low volatility solvent'' and standards applying to low and high volatility solvents have been added. 8. In response to EPA's comments during the rule revision period, (1) the term ``leaks'' has been defined, (2) a provision for covers for remote reservoir cleaners has been added, and (3) daily recordkeeping (except for wipe cleaning) has been added. Rule 333, Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning 1. Operating requirements for dryers, filters and recovery units have been added. 2. A solvent use cutoff has been deleted.
