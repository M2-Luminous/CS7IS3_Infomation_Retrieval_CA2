Although divided into two rival camps, the coalition parties, except for the new Sakigake Party [Harbinger], have finally buried the hatchet and agreed to work for the selection of a new prime minister and the formation of a new government. If an accord can be reached within the alliance on major issues such as taxes, foreign policy and administration reform, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), will become its single candidate for the premiership, political sources say. But the possibility that former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe will become a dark horse and win the upcoming parliamentary election for premier cannot be ruled out. Yesterday, Watanabe held a last-minute meeting with Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono, who has also announced his intention to run for premier. The two failed to reach an agreement on who the party's candidate should be, but agreed to meet again on Monday [18 April]. Kono had asked Watanabe to give up his candidacy to avoid a major breakup of the main opposition party, but Watanabe rejected Kono's request. Their showdown may accelerate the disintegrating process within the LDP, which had dominated Japan's scandal-ridden politics for 38 years, until last August. A new political map is also being drawn for the coalition. Sakigake, a 15-member partner in the alliance that has been frustrated because Shinseito has led the bloc's decision-making, distanced itself from the others by declaring that it would not provide members in the next cabinet. Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura is currently chief cabinet secretary, the top government spokesman. Sakigake said, however, it will vote for the coalition's joint candidate for prime minister and support the government's position on pending issues such as the overdue 1994 state budget. The Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, both of which sided with Sakigake in opposing the Shinseito-led management, agreed to go ahead with selecting a candidate without sakigake. Meanwhile, Shinseito, the coalition's core component, still considers Watanabe a possible partner. Watanabe's stand on key issues is close to that of Shinseito Secretary General Lehiro Ozawa. The political vacuum has been keenly felt on the diplomatic front, with official visits by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai postponed at their request. Hosokawa had planned a tour of Europe this month, but now will not go. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry also postponed a visit to Japan scheduled for April 19 to 21 following the accidental downing of two U.S. helicopters by American jets over northern Iraq.
