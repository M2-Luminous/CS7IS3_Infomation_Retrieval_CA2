Kavsadze, who is a member of the Georgian delegation, told Interfax that the return of refugees to Abkhazia rather than the political structure of that republic would dominate the talks. "Abkhazia's autonomy is not questioned. It is the shape of its statehood that will be discussed by the Georgian Constitutional Commission and the whole people of the republic," he said. On the other hand, he continued, the Georgian delegation can expect anything in Geneva even though UN, CSCE and Russian officials who will attend the talks want the conflict to be resolved by political means. In his words, if the talks are impassed, "we will have to protect the national interests by force. We have the right to do this because the conflict in Abkhazia is an internal affair." Kavsadze placed the blame for the possible failure of the talks squarely on the Abkhazian authorities. He did not agree that Georgia would be in the position of a country which lost the war at the talks. He said that "there will be no winners or losers in this war" because "both Georgians and Abkhazians lost it, for this is a war within a country." The Georgian negotiators in Geneva will be headed by Chairman of the Emergency Committee Jaba Ioseliani and the Abkhazian negotiators, by Prime Minister Sokrat Jinjoliya.
