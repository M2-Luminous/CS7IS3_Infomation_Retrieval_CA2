The United States has just offered 50 vehicles, which will help in the evacuation operations of civilians still in the areas of fighting in Kigali, and U.S. President Bill Clinton once again discussed the Rwandan case during his discussions with Italian political leaders when he was visiting Rome recently. Canada is reportedly ready to provide 300 telecommunications experts, and the Canadian defense minister is reported to have left for Rwanda to study the situation on the spot in order to better understand what there is to be done. UNICEF has started sensitizing the international community to raise $5 million for the Rwandan victims. As for the RSA, it intends to collaborate with the United Nations in the framework of humanitarian assistance to the Rwandan population. The RSA recently stated it was not ready to dispatch an armed force to Rwanda. While other peace-loving countries are coming to help Rwanda, it is deplorable that the Egyptian Government continues to help the Rwandan Government clique, which has plunged our country into a bloodbath. This Egyptian Government recently offered $750,000 for arms purchases to the Rwandan executioners.
