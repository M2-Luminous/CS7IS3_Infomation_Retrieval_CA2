So any negotiations, in my opinion, that doesn't have the settlements on the top of the agenda will be senseless negotiations. [Ram] In other words, Mr. 'Urayqat, you suggest to open the DOP [Declaration of Principles] and the Cairo agreements. ['Urayqat] What I am saying is very clear. What I am saying is that the crimes, the massacres of Hebron have demonstrated to those in the Israeli Government who insisted to have the settlement issue delayed -- it has proven them wrong. If they want peace, real peace, it means this issue must be on the agenda. [Ram] Okay, Sir, so I repeat my question: You mean to open the agreement, the DOP and the Cairo agreement? ['Urayqat] Yes.
