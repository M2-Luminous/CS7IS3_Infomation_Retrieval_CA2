Speaking at a no-frills opening ceremony, he said: Since 1 January, our country has implemented a new foreign exchange control system. People in all circles at home and abroad have fully affirmed this practice. Over the past three months or so, we have successfully unified exchange rates, keeping the renminbi's exchange rates generally stable throughout and striking a basic balance between supply and demand on the foreign exchange market. We have kept foreign exchange trading conduits relatively free for all types of enterprises, thereby basically guaranteeing enterprises' reasonable demands for foreign exchange. He said emphatically: Because of the influx of foreign capital, the growth of imports, and the expansion of foreign exchange receipts from nontrading sources such as tourism over the past three months, our country's foreign exchange reserves have grown by a record margin in both absolute and relative terms compared to the corresponding periods in past years. On the significance of establishing the China Foreign Exchange Trading Center, Zhu Xiaohua said: The official operations of this establishment will serve Chinese- and foreign-funded banking institutions, as well as banking institutions funded jointly by Chinese and foreign investors, in balancing their surpluses and deficits in foreign exchange, and they will provide a reliable guarantee for the nationwide circulation of foreign currencies and for foreign exchange settlements in banks; they will also provide an effective market facility for improving the mechanism for shaping exchange rates, for implementing a unified and managed floating rate system based on market supply and demand, and for gradually making the renminbi freely convertible. According to the relevant experts, foreign exchange trading and clearing on this unified national foreign exchange trading market, which formally went into operation on 4 April, has been basically normal over the past two weeks.
