The Russian diplomat accused Estonia of "stubbornly clinging to a line that is inconsistent with the CSCE principles and leads to a dead end, not recognizing the borders shaped in this part of Europe as a result of post-war developments." The Estonian Government on March 17 approved and passed for consideration in the parliament a bill on borders. The document defines the Estonian-Russian border in accordance with the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty. The treaty designated as belonging to Estonia a number of territories which in 1944-45 passed under the jurisdiction of Russia's Leningrad and Pskov regions. Karasin reminded that at last week's hearings in the Russian parliament "the arguments of Estonian MP's [member of parliament] that Estonia's territorial claims on Russia are legitimate were decisively refuted as unconvincing from the point of view of international law."
