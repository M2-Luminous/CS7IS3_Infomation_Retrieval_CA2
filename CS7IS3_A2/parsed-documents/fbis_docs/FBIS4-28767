FBIS4-28767 "dreas114__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-114-A Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan France, Australia Urge Tokyo To Import Apples France, Australia Urge Tokyo To Import Apples OW1206140194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 11 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1206140194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] disclosed on 9 June that France and Australia have called on Japan to lift its ban on import of their apples. It said that the French and the Australian Governments had already sent officials in charge of apple export and that the Japanese Government has been officially asked to import their apples. It also said that a meeting of experts has already been held. Following its lifting of the ban last year on import of New Zealand apples, the Japanese Government is likely to allow import of U.S. apples this autumn. Since France is the largest apple exporter in the world, it is expected that competition in the apple market in Japan will intensify. According to the MAFF, both France and Australia have increased their calls for lifting the ban on the import of their apples following the Japanese Government's decision to import New Zealand apples last June. However, since their apples are affected with harmful insects, Japan, at present, bans import of both French and Australian apples for quarantine reasons. However, it will be necessary for Japan to open its market to France and Australia if their apples are found to be safe for export to Japan. As for the U.S. apples, Japan and the United States, in their meeting on quarantine issues held in late May last year, confirmed that the U.S. pest-control system meets Japanese requirements. The first shipment of American apples is expected to arrive in Japan immediately after the ban is lifted this autumn. The MAFF said that France has already sent data certifying extermination of some pests. With this in mind, Japan plans to hold meetings of experts to discuss technical quarantine problems. France, the largest apple exporter in the world, produced 2,324,000 tons of apples and exported 547,000 tons in 1992. Australia, which produces 312,000 tons, is believed to be eager to export its apples because its yearly export is only 31,000 tons.
