This Could Be Ruslan Bodelan or Borys Oliynyk or Oleksandr Moroz"] [Text] The leftist forces have ultimately agreed to form a single faction in the new Supreme Council. This became clear from the consultations held throughout the week following elections among the initiatory groups made up of newly elected members of parliament from the Communist, Socialist, and Peasant parties. Former Agriculture Ministers Tkachenko is responsible for organizing the agrarian faction. This means that the two to three dozen collective farm chairmen, who by tradition were being sorted out in political circles as one of the branches of the "party of power," will be hammered together in parliamentary style into a collective-state-farm tractor designed to ram through the decisions of Communist-oriented deputies. If the agrarian lobby is persuaded to do the same work it did in the last Supreme Council, the faction of ideologically committed Communists, which numbers 120 members, will be short of only 20 votes in their attempt to squeeze the whole country back into the same tube from which it has just begun to slowly emerge. The Red bloc is openly set on revanche. While in the preceding Supreme Council, the Communists were prepared to retreat step by step and gradually give up their symbols, command-administrative system, councils, and laws, their sole desire now is to bring all these things back. For the near future, the situation in the country will depend on their appetite and the pace at which this revanche is carried out. The simplest solution would be not to stand in the way of the Communists' passion to return to 1991 at one stroke -- the objective laws of economics would inish the Marxist movement within half a year. The problem is that these same laws could just as easily finish the state. If, however, the leftist forces have among them a few politicians capable of dragging out the extinction of the communists as a class over a longer period of time, they will urge their group to agree to a broad-based coalition government and even invite several national-democrats to join this government in order to divide equally with them the responsibility for the collapse of the state. This could be a mosaic cabinet of ministers, headed by a compromise figure (for example, Roman Shpek, the current minister of the economy), in which the reformers will sparkle like ornaments on a dried-up Christmas tree. It would be a fatal mistake for the democrats to agree to such a government. Compromises of this sort are the ones that result in the greatest disillusionment for the people. The electorate must understand that a Red parliament -- if it is not impotent -- cannot elect a national-democratic government. However, the mood among Communists attests to something else: the Leninists want revanche rather than to discredit anybody. They feel strong enough to seat their own man in the chair of the chairman of the Supreme Council, to elect their own Presidium, to appoint the head of government, and to put forward their own candidate for president. While Petro Symonenko promises to use his candidacy as a means to advertise the incompatibility between the institution of the presidency and the platform of the CPU and at the decisive moment to renounce the fight for the office of the president in favor of an ideologically likeminded claimant, the other potential candidates from the leftist camp -- Borys Oliynyk and Oleksandr Moroz -- have yet to say the same. Although the latter two are also among the claimants to the Supreme Council chairman's microphone. Under the present laws and existing trends, the most powerful person in the country for the near future will be the speaker. And the Red members of parliament have the best chance to seat their own man in this chair. Orthodox Communists will not forego the opportunity to remind Ivan Plyushch of his passivity when the Presidium of the Supreme Council banned the CPU. The most exacting counts show that today Plyushch can obtain only 160 votes in parliament. This number is insufficient to allow him to regain his favorite chair. Ivan Plyushch's closest associates are urging the former parliamentary leader to try his luck in the presidential election. Thus, even as I write these words about Ivan Stepanovych, Ivan Stepanovych is probably making up his mind. His decision will unquestionably be in favor of running for president. On 15 May, when the deputies gather for their first session, all of them will already know that Ivan Plyushch is a candidate for the office of president of Ukraine. Should the former chairman of the Supreme Council be tempted to put up another fight for his "microphone," his new status will lose him an additional 20-30 votes. I am far from believing that one of the ideologically committed "Reds" will succeed in winning the speaker's chair. They will be chronically short of about 15 votes. However, after Oleksandr Moroz and Borys Oliynyk are defeated, for want of anyone else, someone will propose Ruslan Bodelan, the chairman of the Odessa Oblast Council -- a man of openly leftist orientation, albeit not a member of either the CPU or the Socialist Party of Ukraine [SPU]. Bodelan will be able to pick up the 10-15 votes that the Red faction lacks in order to elect their own candidate. The danger of this prospect lies in the fact that today the speaker is half the parliament. If the speaker's job goes to a candidate of the leftist forces, Ukraine will be rid of the institution of the presidency, and parliament will probably form a "Red" government headed by former Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol and take over the National Bank. And everyone will become equal again. Just like before... But there are also other, more optimistic prospects. These involve the national-democratic camp and consist in the fact that the democrats have no prospects of their own. They must therefore link all their prospects with the "party of power." This is somewhat embarrassing in light of the image of the latter. The democrats are compelled to stake all their chances for success in parliament on one person -- Plyushch, who, moreover, will probably want to make an attempt at winning the presidential throne. All candidates from the democratic front for the office of chairman of the Supreme Council are doomed to failure, if only because the national-democrats will find it difficult to agree on a compromise candidate. The best solution for the democrats in this ituation would be to form an alliance with that segment of the "party of power" that supports Ivan Plyushch, or even Kravchuk, and try to seat Ivan Stepanovych in his old chair, first persuading him that he would be better off with the "first microphone in the land" than with the status of the English queen. If this proves successful, they could try to play their own game in the presidential election. Past experience in such matters, as well as the unpredictability of action and differences among the democrats give us reason to conclude that up to now the democratic forces have found it easier to agree to support a political figure from outside the democratic camp than to reach a compromise amongst themselves. However, the periodic nature of repeating the same mistakes over and over again should finally lead them to realize that such compromise figures could be found among economists who are not overly involved in politics. There are not many such people in Ukraine: they are Volodymyr Lanovyy, Viktor Pynzenyk, and Volodymyr Pylypchuk. Standing aside from politics, these reformist economists, who are prepared to assume responsibility for economic changes, could become a bridge between the two disparate halves of Ukraine and take many votes away from Leonid Kuchma. This would be an ideal solution for the national-democrats. Otherwise, they will have to trail in the wake of the "party of power," singing in tune with either Plyushch or Kravchuk, which could end in a total fiasco for the national-democratic idea in Ukraine if neither wins the election. P.S. An unfortunate error occurred in issue No. 11 of POST-POSTUP (15-21 April). In an article entitled "The Supreme Council. A Spectral Analysis," Mr. Smyrnov, the newly elected deputy from the Tulchyn Electoral District in Vinnytsya Oblast, was included among the predicted parliamentary faction of Communists. In reality, Mr. Smyrnov is an independent deputy, who is an anticommunist and a former political prisoner. POST-POSTUP apologizes to Mr. Smyrnov for any moral damage he may have suffered because of this article. * [This title is a play on the Ukrainian proverb "a tomtit in hand is better than a crane in the sky" which is analogous to the English "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."]
