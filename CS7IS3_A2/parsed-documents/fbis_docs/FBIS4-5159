The letter was published on the lapse of one year since the great leader President Kim Il-song put forward the "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country". It said if the 10-point programme of the great national unity is to be realized, it is important, above all, to wage a vigorous struggle to remove the forces of war and confrontation, the separatist forces that block reconciliation and great unity between the South and the North of the country and also to fight for the abrogation of the "National Security Law", an anti-national, anti-reunification evil law. "The entire people," it stressed, "cherishing deep in mind the pride of having sagacious Comrade Kim Chong-il, the distinguished leader of the present times, at the head of the nation, should unite under the grand banner of great national unity and dynamically advance towards the establishment of a confederal, unified state, independent, peaceful and neutral."
