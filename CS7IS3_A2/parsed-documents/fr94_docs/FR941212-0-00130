The Program includes making and issuing policies, procedures, and instructions pertaining to recovery action. (b) The term third parties as used in this section, refers to all types of contractors, carriers, and insurers of personal property. ยง536.184 Duties and responsibilities. (a) Field claims approval and settlement authorities are responsible for local implementation of the Army Carrier Recovery Program and will ensure that_ (1) Proper notice is provided to third parties (see DA Pam 27162, paragraph 2&hyph;55). (2) Claims are processed so that relevant time limitations on pursuing recovery demands are met, particularly the 6-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. 2415(a). In overseas areas, statute of limitations relevant to locally procured tenders and contracts will be observed. (3) Servicing transportation offices provide supporting documentation and perform necessary inspections in a timely manner. (4) Claims files include complete, legible documentation needed to support recovery action, including a copy of the itemized breakdown prepared by the claimant's insurer when appropriate. (5) Third party liability is correctly calculated in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 3, and is reflected on all copies of the DD Form, 1844. (6) Written demands for reimbursement are prepared against appropriate third parties, and demands are dispatched locally or forwarded for centralized recovery within 30 days of settlement (see ยง536.196). If this 30-day standard is not met or no demand is prepared because liability will not be pursued, claims personnel will explain the basis for this on the claims chronology sheet. Note, however, that files will not be forwarded for centralized recovery prior to the 21st day after settlement in order to afford the claimant an opportunity to request reconsideration. (7) Unearned freight letters are prepared when required by DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;27, and are either included in files forwarded for centralized recovery or are dispatched locally after settlement with the carrier. (8) Settlement offers from third parties are accepted or rejected within 30 days of receipt. (9) Checks received are kept in a locked container in accordance with AR 37&hyph;103, and are hand-carried to the servicing finance and accounting office within 24 hours of acceptance. (10) Claims files for which a third party fails to satisfy its liability are forwarded to USARCS or to contracting officers for offset as appropriate (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26). (11) Include demand packets for all claim files forwarded to USARCS due to incidents of bankruptcies. (b) The Commander, USARCS, is responsible for the general administration of the Army Carrier Recovery Program and for the Army Centralized Recovery Program. The Commander, USARCS, will ensure that field claims offices comply with paragraph (a) of this section, and will also ensure that_ (1) Demands for reimbursement received for centralized recovery are reviewed for correctness and dispatched within 7 days of receipt. (2) Within 30 days of receipt, checks matched to files are accepted and hand-carried to the servicing finance and accounting office (within 24 hours of acceptance) or are rejected and returned to the third party. (3) Checks which cannot be matched to files are recorded and kept in a locked cabinet in accordance with AR 37&hyph;103. (4) Unearned freight letters are dispatched after settlement with the carrier. (5) Offset action, or other collection action as appropriate, is initiated against any carrier or other third party that fails to satisfy its liability. (6) Field claims offices are promptly directed to forward files of bankrupt third parties to USARCS to protect the Government's interests. (7) Records are maintained of nontemporary storage contractors who default on their contractual obligations, and of incidents that occur in nontemporary storage warehouses, in order to pursue liability as appropriate. (c) The Chief, U.S. Army Claims Service, Europe, and the Chief, U.S. Armed Forces Claims Service, Korea, will_ (1) Assume the responsibilities outlined in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section on claims forwarded for European or Korean centralized recovery (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;22), except that offset actions requiring action by DFAS will be forwarded to USARCS. (2) Review each POV shipment file forwarded for recovery action against the European inland carrier for potential liability within 45 days of receipt. If negotiations with a POV contractor result in an impasse, USACSEUR will arrange for dispatch of a contracting officer's final decision within 30 days. ยง536.185 Determination of liability. A prima facie case against a third party is established when evidence shows delivery of an item in good condition to the third party, return of the items in a damaged condition or non-return, and the amount of damage or loss. ยง536.186 Exclusions of liability.
