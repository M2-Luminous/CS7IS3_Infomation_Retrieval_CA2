Most probably, participants in the meeting will be able to express their opinion by signing a petition which will be presented to the government and the Saeima [parliament]. As LTF Chairman Uldis Augstkalns stated at a press conference, the government does not take into account the opinion of either different political parties or social organizations. Such policies, stressed Augstkalns, result in violations of the basic condition of democracy -- respect for the interests of citizens. Taking into consideration the fact that the next round of interstate negotiations will begin on 14 March, we do not want the meeting to be interpreted as a provocation, but still, the opinion of the people should be respected, said Talavs Jundzis, LTF deputy chief and head of the Baltic Center for Strategic Research. He is of the view that concluding the compromise agreement with Russia can result in Latvia's losing its independence or even a new occupation. The real path to Latvian security does not lead to neutrality, nor does it aim toward the East or the West; it lies in a steady position on all primary political goals, summarized T. Jundzis.
