FBIS4-26632 "drchi122_e_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-122 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 Southeast Asia & Pacific New Zealand Delegation Seeks Investment Opportunities New Zealand Delegation Seeks Investment Opportunities OW2406094794 Beijing XINHUA in English 0939 GMT 24 Jun 94 OW2406094794 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- A New Zealand trade delegation comprising 70 enterpreneurs is now in China, probing new investment and cooperation opportunities. The delegation, the largest ever from that country, led by Minister of Trade Negotiations Philip Burdon, is expected to lead to a new "investment wind" blowing from the South Pacific island nation, trade officials from both countries believe. In the trade group are representatives from New Zealand's leading enterprises, such as Fletcher Challenge, Calt Halt and the Lion Company, which have already invested in China. They will tour Tianjin, Suzhou, Chongqing and Guangzhou to discuss specific cooperation projects with local officials in addition to holding two trade seminars in Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. In his talks with Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, Burdon said that his country attaches great importance to developing trade and economic ties with Asian countries, China in particular. The New Zealand Government has also launched the "Asia-2000" strategic plan targeting the shifting of its trade focus from the traditional European markets to Asia. With the implementation of the plan two years ago, New Zealand-China economic ties have entered a new stage in which sole trade has given way to a variety of methods of economic cooperation. China so far is New Zealand's tenth-largest export destination and its sixth-largest import source, involving a total trade volume of more than 500 million U.S. dollars last year, a rise of 14.5 percent over 1992. The first quarter of this year saw the bilateral trade rise to more than 93 million U.S. dollars, up 12.6 percent over the same period of last year. Chinese exports are mainly garments and textiles and electronic appliances, and imports are mainly resource-based products such as wool, timber, coal and iron ore. As a traditional capital absorbing country, New Zealand has in recent years encouraged its enterprises to invest in China. By the end of last year New Zealand had invested in 148 enterprises in China involving a total capital of nearly 70 million U.S. dollars. Last year alone they set up 76 joint ventures in pasture development, feedstuffs, woolen textiles, fishing, computers and inland oil exploration. The total contracted capital of 44.5 million U.S. dollars was more than the previous year's total. A New Zealand trade official said that the investment wind is expected to blow stronger along with China's economic development and opening drive. Over the past few years Chinese enterprises have also invested in New Zealand. They run more than 20 joint ventures with investment much larger than that poured by New Zealand into China.
