Frenkel, doctor of economic sciences, under the rubric "Forecast": "Russia's Industry in May"] [Text] The year 1994 saw the most profound decline in production in industry in the postwar era. According to analysis, cuts in the output of industrial production for the first four months of 1994 should come to 26 percent. In May, the situation will not change: the decline in production is going to continue. Dropping especially sharply will be the output of production in most branches of the machinebuilding complex (in many cases by 50-60 percent), the timber, woodworking, and cellulose-paper industry (by 30-40 percent), the production of building materials (by 30-40 percent), the output of complex household technology (by 40-50 percent), and light industry (by 25-50 percent). The least significant cut will occur in the branches of the heating and energy complex (by 5-6 percent, except for oil production). A production decline will be observed for more than 90 percent of the types of production put out. The index of the physical volume of industrial production output in May for Russia as a whole will be 0.721, i.e., the decline in production in comparison with May 1993 will reach 27.9 percent. The number of worker days in May 1994 will be 1 more than in 1993--19. The average daily volume of output of industrial production will decrease in May by 29.7 percent. To a significant extent, the drop in production in the first quarter took on a structural character. Production output was basically determined by solvent demand, which depended almost entirely on the financial status of the enterprises. That status, which has continued to deteriorate due to the ongoing payments crisis, has been conditioned by the production glut, prolonged halts in production, social tension that arose as a consequence of delayed payment of salaries to workers, etc. Thus, according to data from Russia's Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], as of 1 March 1994, overdue indebtedness to suppliers on the part of purchasers totaled 14,049 billion rubles [R], having increased in one month by 27.8 percent. In May, overdue indebtedness will increase once again. Overdue indebtedness for the payment of funds for wages and other monetary payments to workers in the enterprises and organizations of industry increased in March by R266.9 billion (25.6 percent) and as of 1 April had reached R1311.1 billion. In May, this indebtedness is unlikely to decrease. The drop in production in the branches of the heating and energy complex as a whole will be insignificant; moreover, in many ways it can be explained by the influence of the seasonal factor. The manufacture of electric power in May will decrease overall by 0.3 percent and will reach 66.4 billion kilowatts (kw) per hour. The decline in production will be conditioned by manufacturing cutbacks on the part of atomic energy power plant by 14 percent and hydroelectric power plants by 4 percent. At the same time, the production of electric power at thermal electrical power plants will increase by 4 percent. The situation in the coal industry will remain complicated. In May 1994, coal mining will drop in comparison with 1993 by 1.4 million tonnes (6 percent) and will reach 23.7 million tonnes; the mining of coal for coke 4.5 million tonnes (83 percent). Gas production will increase for May by 3 percent and come to 53.2 billion cubic meters. The relatively prosperous state of affairs in this branch is connected, on the one hand, with the significant gas reserves in deposits being exploited and, on the other, with the increase in gas exports. The coal mining industry finds itself in the most difficult situation. Use of the oil well exploitation fund has deteriorated. The proportion of nonactive wells in the total exploitation fund increased from 15 percent in December 1993 to 18.5 percent in March 1994. In the first quarter of 1994, serious difficulties arose for oil-producing enterprises with respect to the sale of crude oil to oil refineries, which led to a partial halt in production or even a complete halt for more than 14,000 oil wells. According to analysis, for this reason the cuts in oil production in the first quarter amounted to about 4.5 million tonnes, or 34 percent of the total decline in production. Oil production in May will drop in comparison with 1993 by 5 million tonnes (17 percent) and will be 24.1 million tonnes. The decrease in oil production and the cut in purchases of it by oil-refining enterprises is causing a lowering of its primary processing by 18 percent, which in turn will lead to a decline in the production of gasoline by 11 percent, diesel fuel by 18 percent, and furnace fuel oil by 17 percent. The well-established trend of dropping production in ferrous metallurgy will not change in May. The basic reason for the invariability of this trend is the decline in solvent demand for most types of metallurgical output. A complicated situation is taking shape around providing the branch with raw materials and fuel. The mining of iron ore in May will be cut by 9 percent. In machinebuilding in May the decline in total production will strengthen and exceed 50 percent. There will be cuts in production output for 93-95 percent of the types of output included in the periodic statistical accounts. For nearly half of them, the decline in production will exceed 60 percent. As before, the branch is in an extremely difficult financial situation: as of 1 March the overdue indebtedness of purchasers for machinebuilding output acquired totaled R2,517 billion, having increased in one month by 10 percent. The chief influence on the cuts in production in the branch is the decrease in purchasers' solvent demand. On the brink of a complete halt are enterprises in agricultural machinebuilding. In the first quarter, tractor output amounted to all of 18 percent of the 1993 level, 16 percent for tractor trailers, and 4 percent for grain-harvesting combines, primarily due to a lack of solvent demand. As a result, tractor output will come to only 12 percent of the 1993 level, 3 percent for tractor trailers, and 4 percent for grain-harvesting combines. The situation will not improve in transportation machinebuilding. The output of long-range diesel locomotives will be cut by 50 percent, long-range electric locomotives by 40 percent, long-range freight cars by 73 percent, long-range passenger cars by 28 percent, and trolley-buses by 44 percent. The short-sighted price policy of automotive construction enterprises led to a sharp drop in demand for domestic-made automobiles. As a result, since December 1993, there has been a monthly drop in the output of passenger cars. Nor will May be an exception, when their output will drop in comparison with May 1993 by 11 percent. The output of buses will drop by 3 percent. A significant cutback in production output is expected for machine-tools (by 45 percent), forging-pressing machines (67 percent), spinning machines (52 percent), looms (80 percent), bulldozers (63 percent), excavators (37 percent), and roller bearings (36 percent). In the chemical and petrochemical industry the drop in production will continue in May. Enterprises' financial situation will deteriorate. As of 1 March 1994, the overdue indebtedness of purchasers of chemical and petrochemical production totaled R1,962 billion, having increased in one month by 29 percent. In May the growth in indebtedness is unlikely to decrease. In the timber, woodworking, and cellulose-paper industry the drop in production will continue in May. Equipment in the branch is extremely worn out, and a shortage of manpower is observed in timber cutting. Meanwhile, the available raw material and productive potential is being used inefficiently. The load on production capacities does not exceed 35-40 percent, and in connection the equipment at most enterprises stands idle as much as 60-70 percent of working hours. Like other branches of industry, this branch finds itself in a difficult financial situation: as of 1 March 1994, overdue indebtedness of purchasers totaled R547 billion, having increased in one month by 15.4 percent. In the building materials industry no revival is forecast in May. As in the previous months of 1994, solvent demand will continue to decrease for many types of output of the branch. As a result, cement production will drop by 37 percent, asbestos cement by 61 percent, asbestos cement pipes and couplings by 17 percent, building brick by 29 percent, prefabricated reinforced concrete by 33 percent, soft roofing materials by 50 percent, and window glass by 46 percent. In forecasting volumes of output of complex household technology, it is essential to bear in mind that toward the end of 1993, on one hand, there was market saturation by domestic-made goods put out and, on the other, a rapprochement between prices for them and the prices for higher quality imported goods. This led to a drop in demand for domestic-made household technology in 1994, which caused a sharp decline in production. Thus, the output of refrigerators and freezers will drop in May by 21 percent, washing machines by 40 percent, vacuum cleaners by 54 percent, tape recorders by 64 percent, radios by 58 percent, televisions by 25 percent, sewing machines by 64 percent, and bicycles by 70 percent. The output of detergents will decline by 51 percent. In May for the first time in the last half-year, there will be a drop in the output of cotton fabric by 26 percent. This will be connected with the fact that many enterprises in the cotton branch have processed almost all the reserves of cotton fiber that had been held in reserve in the country and for which no payment had been made. As a result, cotton suppliers have halted their supply to most enterprises.
