Aleksandr Zaikin, chairman of the board of the bank, told the audience: "Indicators of our operations are closely associated with the situation of the bank's founders, among which we can point out the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia], the Social Insurance Fund of the Russian Federation, and some others, as well as our numerous business partners. The reinforcement of the financial standing of our colleagues and clients is behind the 13-fold increase in the statutory fund, the 13-fold increase in assets, and the 20-fold increase in transactions on the balance-sheet accounts of the bank." In the opinion of independent experts, Solidarity Bank is among the most stable and rapidly developing in Russia. In particular, this was facilitated by the orientation of the collective of the bank toward ensuring the complete automation of financial transactions. Solidarity has implemented a network version of an automated accounting system. Clients of the bank are offered the use of the "Bank-Client" system which makes it possible to make payments and receive original banking documents directly in one's office. Recently, Solidarity Bank received a license to conduct operations in foreign exchange which has considerably expanded the list of services it provides and made it possible to strengthen contacts with quite a number of the largest trade union banks of Europe such as, for example, the Norwegian Landsbank. The meeting of Solidarity's partners unanimously approved the report of the board of the bank and once again elected Aleksandr Zaikin as its president, thus showing complete confidence in him. Yuriy Shatyrenko, chairman of the Social Insurance Fund of the Russian Federation, was elected chairman of the bank council.
