The haul was hidden in a tanker full of egg yolk products which was driven into Britain through Dover docks. It was stopped in Dagenham, Essex, and the drugs were recovered after the tanker was unloaded, Maidstone Crown Court was told. Robert Doubtfire, 32, from Broadwalk, Blackheath, south London, and Frans van Taternhove, 44, a Dutchman, had denied the charges. Taternhove was jailed for 25 years and the £8,000 in cash that he had on him when arrested was confiscated. No other assets could be traced. Doubtfire will be sentenced next week. Judge David Croft, QC [expansion not given], said: "This smuggling operation was an attack on society." After the case, Det Insp Peter Ship, said: "This was a very sophisticated operation. A lot of money was spent on setting up the tanker to conceal the drugs." The containers were riveted shut and made to look invisible. "The tanker's tachograph was set up in such a manner that it gave the impression the lorry was on a completely different route, which made it very hard to trace," said the inspector. "We have taken two criminals off the street and hit organised crime where it hurts most," he added.
