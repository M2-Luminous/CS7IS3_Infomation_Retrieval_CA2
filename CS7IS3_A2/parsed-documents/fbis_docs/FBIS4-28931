Noting that the authorities' inconsistent "policy" towards the North increases the confusion and uneasiness of the people, the organisation decided to strongly urge the puppet authorities to "shape and promote a reunification policy giving top priority to the existence and peace of the nation." The Federation of Christian Social Movement in a recent statement clarified its stand opposed to "`sanctions' against the North," that heightens the war crisis.
