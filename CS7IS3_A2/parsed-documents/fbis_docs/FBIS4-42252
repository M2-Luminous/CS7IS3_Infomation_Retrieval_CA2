FBIS4-42252 "drweu105_n_94008" FBIS-WEU-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 NORDIC COUNTRIES Sweden Polls: Left Gains, Government Parties Lose Polls: Left Gains, Government Parties Lose PM3105144094 PM3105144094 BFN [Editorial Report] Over the last weekend in May Stockholm DAGENS NYHETER in Swedish and Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET in Swedish published their respective opinion polls for May on voter support for Sweden's political parties. DAGENS NYHETER published on page A7 of its 28 May edition a Dick Ljungberg article outlining the results of its poll, the major findings of which it summarized as follows: "The Green Ecology Party qualifies for representation in the Riksdag, while New Democracy is on its way to being counted out in DAGENS NYHETER/Temo's poll on party standings for May. The four-party government coalition is losing ground now that less than four months remain until the election." The article goes on to provide the following percentage figures for party standings: ``The poll was carried out in the period 18-26 May and comprises 1,014 telephone interviews. ``Results, with changes since May in parentheses: ``Moderate Coalition Party 20.0 (minus 1.5), Liberal Party 7.5 (unchanged), Center Party 6.0 (minus 1.5), Christian Democratic Party 5.0 (plus 1.5), Social Democratic Party 50.0 (minus 1.0), Left Party 4.5 (plus 1.0), New Democracy 1.5 (minus 0.5), Green Ecology Party 4.0 (plus 1.0), and other parties 1.5 percent (plus 1.0). All changes are within the margin of statistical error. ``The number of undecided voters is 10 percent.'' SVENSKA DAGBLADET published on page 10 of its 29 May edition a Sigfrid Leijonhufvud article setting out the findings of its May opinion poll, which it outlined as follows: ``Both the Social Democrats and the Left Party are making gains and together the socialist bloc has a total of 55 percent in SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo's [Swedish Institute for Opinion Research] May poll. An election result along these lines would at a stroke render the parties in the current coalition government powerless. ``In the April poll the government parties had in a month moved up a little over 1 percent on the left-wing bloc. The difference between the two blocs was 10.5 percentage points. But this was clearly no new trend. According to SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo, the government parties only won 39.3 percent of voter support in May and this widens the gulf to 15.7 percentage points. ``The socialist bloc strengthens its position in the run-up to the election chiefly because the Social Democrats register 50.4 percent, an increase of 1.7 percentage points since the April poll. It is also significant that the Left Party seems to have broken the trend of decline since the 1991 election when the party won 4.5 percent of the vote. With 4.6 percent in the May poll as against 3.5 percent in the April poll, the Left Party would clear the 4-percent threshold for representation in the Riksdag if there were an election today. ``When between 2 and 26 May Sifo asked its 3,708 interviewees how they would vote if there were an election today, the Moderate Coalition Party won 21.3 percent (22.1) of voter support, the Center Party 7.3 (8.6), the Liberal Party 6.4 (6.8), the Christian Democratic Party 4.3 (4.2) the Green Ecology Party 2.9 (2.9), New Democracy 2.0 (2.2), and other parties 0.8 (1.0). Compared with the April figures given in parentheses all the government parties with the exception of the Christian Democratic Party have suffered losses. The Center Party's losses of 1.3 percent are significant -- that is, statistically reliable. Other changes reported in the poll are not.''
