We do not know whether its outcome will also be effective. We hope it will. This is so because the protracted Turkish disobedience, which aims to maintain an "internationally unacceptable"--according to the White House description--status quo in Cyprus, also represents an issue of prestige for the American superpower. The U.S. President's interference, manifested in his letters to Andreas Papandreou and Tansu Ciller and his hasty dispatch of Robert Lamb to Cyprus with new proposals, does not aim to offer artificial resuscitation to Turkish intransigence when the Security Council's deadline for reaching an agreement "without delay" on the confidence-building measures (CBM's) expires. Removing the urgent need for this arrangement is tantamount to tolerating the prolongation of the pseudostate's life and rewarding the filibustering tactics that Rauf Denktas follows to torpedo every process. Besides, the U.S. element has another reason to avert any adulteration of the CBM's, since it is morally committed by its earlier declarations according to which "the measures must be accepted as they stand because they are fair." Consequently, Denktas' excuses about the customs and other points cannot be accepted or camouflaged politically with the new U.S. intervention. So, the effort to do what must be done should be focused elsewhere. There must be pressure to persuade Ankara that it cannot act arbitrarily, provoke, and renege. President Clinton has effective levers of persuasion and levers of pressure given that Turkey is facing an internal economic crisis because of the neosultan mentality that governs its policy. What is sought for Turkey's people is internal tranquillity and prosperity. If Turkey stays on the downhill slope it is on then it will pay dearly for its expansionist and arbitrary policy, because Turkey will be isolated from a united Europe and become weak about demonstrating military strength and expansionist influence in the region. President Clinton, as the leader of the sole superpower, should aim at the right Cyprus solution and also at harmonizing Turkish policy with the more general U.S. view of international problems in accordance with his specifications. The White House strategy was outlined with the Clinton doctrine, which declared: "We will try to persuade first and, if necessary, we will intervene." We have no doubt that the U.S. President tried to persuade Ankara and his new intervention is probably within this framework. But it will take a major dilemma if Turkey is to be persuaded and if a more active White House intervention is not to become necessary. This should be summed up in what would happen if Turkey remains disobedient to the UN Security Council resolutions. If we were the ones to pay for Turkish intransigence then Ankara would never retreat, since its intransigence would insure the perpetuation of what it has illegally acquired through the invasion and the unhindered distribution of the enslaved Greek homes and property.
