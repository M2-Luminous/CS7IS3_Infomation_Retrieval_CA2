At the same time, the MPPM is concerned that "although the frontist-unionist ideology and political formations have suffered a total failure, their adepts, hidden in ministries and academies, in structures of the National Radio and Television, public education and culture, in rightist newspapers, in the leadership of the Writers' Union, continue to mislead the people." They corrupt the faith of the young generation in the specificity of the Moldovan people and its culture, they impose by all means the concept of Romanism of the Moldovans, the declaration asserts. Its authors claim that supporters of unionism want to transform Bessarabia, according to the model of 1918, into a province of Grand Romania. [passage indistinct]
