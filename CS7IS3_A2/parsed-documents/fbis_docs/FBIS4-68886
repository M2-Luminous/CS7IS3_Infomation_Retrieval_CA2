Measures have been taken to curb inflation. The process of privatization is going relatively dynamically. The nonstate sector of the economy is gathering speed. The rates of decline of investment activity have slowed up. The consumer market is being restored. The country's foreign trade balance has been reduced to a positive total. Nonetheless, in spite of certain successes, the situation in the economy remains unstable. Last year crisis processes were not halted. The gross domestic product decreased by 13 percent, industrial production--by more than 16 percent, agricultural production--by 4 percent, capital investments--by 16 percent, and foreign trade turnover--by 13 percent. Prices of goods and services increased more than ninefold. The socioeconomic situation that developed during the first quarter of this year is characterized by a continuing decline of the volumes of industrial production and a lowering of the level of capital investments with a simultaneous increase in prices of industrial products and consumer goods. Measures taken by the government are still not producing the desired results. The greatest decline in the first quarter of this year occurred in the machine-building, chemical, metallurgical, and wood processing industries. The production of consumer goods and foodstuffs continues to decrease. For certain goods in light industry--from 15 to 54 percent. In February alone as a result of the closing down of 4,500 enterprises, 22 million man-days of work time were lost. Production has come to a complete halt at 428 enterprises, including such large ones as the "Kirovskiy Zavod," LOMO, the Baltic plant, "Rostselmash," and many others. This is occurring because of the lack of funds and because of difficulties with product sales. This accounts for up to 60 percent of the losses. Practically all branches and sectors of the national economy have come up against this strict limitation of demand. There is no possibility and sometimes even no hope of selling products that are produced. Inflation is exacerbating the economic crisis. As usual, nonpayments are still problem number one. While during the first half of last year monetary funds available to the enterprises exceeded the defaulted indebtedness to the suppliers, during the second half they amounted to only half the sum of indebtedness. During the first months of this year we came right up to the indicators of the summer of 1992. Now, however, commodity producers are tightening the strings: If there is no money, there will be no deliveries. As a result, indebtedness on wages has become worse. Today it amounts to more than 2 trillion rubles [R]. The problem of nonpayments has been tormenting the Russian economy for two years now. There is the widespread opinion that nonpayments arise as a result of the government's severe financial-credit policy. Perhaps this might have been fair regarding 1992, but now the situation is completely different. In my view nonpayments today are brought about primarily by debts of the budget and the CIS countries to the Russian commodity producers, particularly the fuel and energy complex. In the second place is the lack of control of monetary flows and the concealed redistribution of funds among various enterprises and entire sectors of the economy. Frequently money that is supposed to be used for settlements with suppliers and for augmenting circulating capital is used to increase wages, to cover notes, and so forth. Nonpayments are increasing because of the lack of demandingness on the part of those who extend credit to the debtors. For some reason they all apply to the government for money but they are in no hurry to file charges for reimbursement of losses from the debtors. A third reason I would call the inability on the part of many enterprise managers to engage in increasing production effectiveness, reducing outlays, updating output, and expanding the sales network. We would like the enterprises, banks, and financial institutions themselves to find a way out of the situation that has developed. Many interesting plans are being suggested. For example, "Tveruniversalbank" has developed and is implementing a system for straightening out nonpayments with the emission of their own notes. So it is not mandatory to wait for financial support from the government, they can act on their own. The state, of course, settles debts, but its debts make up no more than 20 percent. The remaining 80 percent are debts of enterprises to one another. The government cannot take responsibility for them. The Russian economy has entered the most difficult phase of its structural transformations. It is necessary to exert every effort so that these transformations bring the country not the usual problems but signs of improvement. The government has begun to revise the list of projects to be supported by the budget. Existing legislation on bankruptcy is beginning to be enforced taking into account the priorities of the structural policy and its concrete objectives this year. It is proposed to shut down a number of branches that are operating at a loss or are ineffective and to adopt measures for social adaptation of discharged workers. Next in line is the adoption of measures necessary for creating conditions for development of the activity of Russian commodity producers in markets of the CIS countries. It is necessary to find ways of restoring investment activity and providing for an influx of capital into industry from other sectors of the economy by attracting free financial funds of the banks and the population. In the near future the government intends to take a number of additional measures to stabilize the situation in the Russian economy. It has been decided to render state support to enterprises of the coal industry. During the first half year alone, in keeping with the developed schedules, R3.4 trillion is to be paid from the budget to them. A decree has been adopted concerning repayment during the first quarter of mutual indebtedness for a number of members of the defense industry and the agro-industrial and fuel-energy complexes. In order to increase the effectiveness of utilization of investments, a provision has been established concerning financing and granting credit for capital construction. Proposals have been prepared for stabilizing the work of enterprises of the fuel and energy complex. The government has taken a stand in questions of quotas for shipping strategic raw material resources, import customs duties, and a list of federal target programs financed this year from the budget. Next in line are proposals concerning state regulation and control of railroad rates and also rates for electric and thermal energy. In order to provide for payment of wages in the fuel and energy complex and the timber and wood processing industry it is permitted to leave up to 50 percent of the funds from product sales in the accounts of the enterprises. I would say that not all of the aforementioned measures can be called 100 percent market measures, but the government has been forced to resort to them.
