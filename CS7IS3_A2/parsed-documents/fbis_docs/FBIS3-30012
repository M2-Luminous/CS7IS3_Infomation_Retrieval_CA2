The program, which will help promote information processing, telecommunications, housing-related and other up and coming industrial sectors, is designed to create jobs through deregulations and government support to help offset personnel cuts resulting from restructuring measures in the private sector, MITI officials said. MITI plans to promote such business fields as housing, solar power development, multimedia-related data processing, recycling of industrial waste, medical and social welfare and new-wave distribution systems like discount stores. The ministry also aims to enhance sports and leisure-related industries and development of new materials, MITI officials said. As a common task for the eight fields, the ministry plans to review requirements for companies to be registered on the over-the-counter market to help upstarts raise funds more easily. The ministry also plans to provide assistance to improve the infrastructure for research and development activities for such companies. Among specific measures under the program, the government will purchase unused land with public funds for housing developments. The ministry also calls for introducing computers and other information-processing equipment into education programs and for better protection of copyrights for multi-media software. The ministry estimates that the measures envisaged in the program would help boost the domestic housing-related market to 33 trillion yen in the year 2000 from 28 trillion yen in 1992, and the telecommunications market to 61-70 trillion yen from 23 trillion yen, MITI officials said.
