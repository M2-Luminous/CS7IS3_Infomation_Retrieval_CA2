ACTION: Amended notice of intent. SUMMARY: Amended notice is hereby given that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will hold two additional public scoping workshops and extend the public comment date for scoping of issues to be addressed in the Northern & Eastern Colorado Desert Coordinated Management Plan and EIS. In the Federal Register notice published March 15, 1994, the close of public comment for issue identification was set as April 15, 1994. This notice amends that deadline so that public comments will now end on June 11, 1994. AREA: Portions of California counties of Imperial, Riverside and San Bernardino. DATES: BLM is seeking the involvement of interested public, organizations and other local, state, and federal agencies in the identification of issues that should be addressed in the plan and EIS. In response to public requests, the public comment period for issue identification has been extended to June 11, 1994. Written comments should be received or post-marked by that date to allow for compilation into a report on issues assessment. Many comments and requests were received from the public for additional scoping workshops to the locations of those identified in the March 15 Notice. Therefore, BLM is holding two additional workshops for identification of issues for the plan and EIS as follows: May 4, 1994, 7&hyph;9 p.m., Black Rock Visitor Center, Joshua Tree National Monument, Joshua Lane, Yucca Valley, CA, (5 miles S. of Hwy 62 at end of Joshua Lane) May 11, 1994, 7&hyph;9 p.m., Brea City Council Chambers, Brea Civic and Cultural Center, 1 Civic Center Circle, Brea, CA, (near intersection of Hwy 57 and Imperial Hwy).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The BLM will develop a comprehensive land use plan and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for federal public lands in California's Northern & Eastern Colorado Desert. BLM will prepare this plan in cooperation with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS), the California Department of Fish and Game, and Joshua Tree National Monument. The plan will identify measures to implement the recovery tasks for the Desert Tortoise which was listed as a threatened species in 1990 under the federal Endangered Species Act. Measures for the recovery of the Chemehuevi and Chuckwalla populations are called for by the FWS in its 1993 draft ``Recovery Plan for the Desert Tortoise (Mojave Population)''. BLM's plan will also address the needs of other significant and special status plants and wildlife and all use needs of the public. The plan will amend BLM's California Desert Conservation Area Plan of 1980. Dated: April 19, 1994. Henri R. Bisson, District Manager.
