Yuriy Sakharnov, the general director of BoguchanGESstroy, a friend of the newspaper and a writer for it, has traveled over half the world in search of loans: under the omnipotent duo in the former Russian Government--Ye. Gaydar and B. Fedorov--financing of the country's only power generation project of this size practically came to an end. We should have had the courage, persistence, and wisdom of the builder-patriot, who has new power generation construction projects in Uzbekistan and Siberia--in "that" life they were called All-Union shock projects--behind him; we should not despair, give up our life as a hopeless task and sell our professional talent to the nouveaux riches who are rapidly surrounding the capital with a "belt of millionaires"--cottages and villas. In our opinion, these are palaces and country estates for the wealthy, who have become rich by completely doing away with social protection for the people. Sakharnov found understanding in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. The newspaper reported on the situation at the construction site, it told about the collective which did not receive wages for months but did not abandon the work that was begun, and it told about the monetarist ministers who wanted to force Russia to live from day to day--to abandon the mines, the plants, the factories, and the construction sites... Then Arkadiy Volskiy and the entire Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs heard Sakharnov. Sensible heads also were found in the Russian Federation Government, and they understood and realized that Russia has been and continues to be held together by the might of three complexes--the military-industrial, fuel and energy, and machinebuilding complexes. One of them--the machinebuilding complex--has been lost, we believe. Since it is already being shifted, the VPK [military-industrial complex] has been castrated. And it is a fact that Russia is now living by the grace of the fuel and energy complex, obtaining not only energy resources, but foreign exchange from it as well. And Viktor Chernomyrdin is being openly defamed for his traditional sympathy for this, by the way. After becoming familiar with BoguchanGESstroy operations at the site, Vice Premier A. Shokhin came to the unequivocal conclusion thast construction of the power station cannot be discontinued if we have a responsible attitude toward maintaining and building up the country's power generation potential. Yu. Safranik, the minister in charge of the fuel and energy complex, held a similar position. It would appear that everyone is for it, but who is opposed to it? But month after month went by, and the prepared and approved drafts were not turned into actual documents. The all-powerful bureaucratic guarantee impeded execution of the directives from higher authorities and political intrigues overcame the common sense and economic strategy of the complex. The first vice premier should have had the character of Oleg Soskovets so as not to allow the document to be lost in the stratagems of intrigues and irresponsibility and to give hope not simply to the many thousands in the labor collective building the power station, but the entire energy complex; even during an economic emergency, the country cannot help but work toward tomorrow. For the loss of prospects means the loss of a future. In a recent meeting at the RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA editorial office, Yu. Sakharnov was sitting at the same table with Vladislav Fronin, the chief editor of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, who had gotten his start in it as a literary staffer in the working youth department. Speaking in a humorous vein, he said it would be good to declare the Boguchansk GES an All-Union Komsomol shock project, then all the problems would be resolved. Well, that is bad luck--there is no more All-Union. Or Komsomol, either. Unfortunately, many things that we are grieving about do not exist now. In seizing life from payday to payday, we have borrowed life. But after all, sooner or later the debt must be paid. Reproduction of our national heritage cannot be replaced by clearance sales. You cannot compensate for professional experience in building hydroelectric stations with the resources of a huge country by ultraradical incantations. In the final analysis, we are not stupid enough to reject what the entire enlightened world envied us, the Soviet people, for. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA had already been criticized in this connection by sinister democratic newspapers when it began saying in the spring of 1992 that former fraternal republics in the former Soviet Union should not erect customhouses and cordon off their borders, but restore the ties that were broken, and reinforce, not destroy (!) the unified "fields"--the information, market, legal, financial, and other fields. And the ties of relationship should not be forgotten in the process. Not of leaders with leaders, but between our brides and "their" grooms. And vice versa. In short, we should not be scattering now, but running together. In an interview with RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA at that time, Nursultan Nazarbayev first advanced the idea which is reflected today in the formula for a Eurasian Union. So the idea advanced at the RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA table by Vladislav Fronin and seized upon by Yuriy Sakharnov, the builder of All-Union shock projects, impelled us to relive the past--to organize peripheral public supervision of the government's decree on the Boguchansk GES. It produced a satisfactory effect at one time. Is it suitable under the current conditions? Will it help the labor collective of hydroelectric station builders? Yuriy Sakhanov is confident that it will help. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, as a partner of long standing with Krasnoyarsk residents, is taking implementation of this government decree under public supervision. The newspaper will be informing the Russian public regularly how the construction is progressing, who is helping the Boguchan workers and how, who is impeding fulfillment of orders for construction of the Russian state's power generation facility, and how and why they are doing it. We will be naming those who contribute to the increase in power generation potential in Siberia and the country, and we will also name those who put spokes in the wheels of the Angara construction project. So a start has been made. Everyone who has helped to bring about this decree through the responsibility of his service or simply through his duty as a citizen cannot be enumerated. But certain persons "behind the scenes" should be mentioned: A. Volskiy, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [RSPP], and his new deputy, RSPP Vice-President B. Kurakin; A. Dyakov, president of the RAO [Russian Joint-Stock Company] "YeES Rossii"; V. Zyryakov, assistant to the first deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers and Government; Yu. Mikhaylov, a government adviser; V. Zubov, governor of Krasnoyarsk Kray; and Yu. Korsun, the deputy minister of fuel and energy. Of course, in first place we ought to name all the builders of the Boguchansk GES, as well as those who did not believe that the specialty of destroyer is valued more highly in Russia than a builder. Most likely not only this truth, but economic feasibility and political realism, have helped all those participating in this to join hands and form a circle of civil and patriotic harmony to rescue the work essential to everyone. It is possible that some may be irritated by lines in my commentary: they may say the chief editor is singing like a nightingale, but where is the spring? Listing the names of lobbyists for a new Siberian construction project, for what purpose? Why, in fact? I honestly admit--without any purpose or malicious intent. It is simply pleasant to realize that there are persons in Russia who fight to the bitter end to prevent what we have built with our hands, the work of our life, from being destroyed. And it is pleasant to help them. If only in words. And this is why I listed the names--there is a clear discrepancy here. Judge for yourselves. We journalists try for weeks and months to "extract" the surnames of those involved in bad dealings. And the more such names we have to our credit, the better our statement of service, it is believed. Perhaps it is better... It is as if we have forgotten how to say a kind word, as if it has fallen into disuse in our vocabulary and become unnecessary in our contacts with the public. This is not true--it is more necessary today than under communism. My words are not an indulgence for the remission of sins. Tomorrow we may present claims against O. Soskovets and V. Kurakin, and I hope they will understand this is how RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA operates. Today, I hope they will understand this: we want the Russian people to turn to them when there are promising operations--they will help. Tell me, what is bad about this? If there are persons at all levels in Russia that can be depended upon today. There is no more powerful means of strengthening authority, especially democratic authority, than the economic might of the state and social protection for its citizens. And any government, if it wants to be democratic and strong, will not give preference to destructive instead of constructive trends. It is awkward even to say this--it is a common truth for all times and peoples. We remain to be convinced by a specific example: whether our executive authority is strong enough to realize a creative project. And there is no need to smile at a certain degree of extra passion in my commentary--yes, one swallow dos not make a spring. Especially as the decree is still not the GES. This is the situation. And we are making a fuss because of this.
