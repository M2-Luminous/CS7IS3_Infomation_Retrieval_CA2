FBIS4-9668 "drlat062_m_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 Brazil Franco Rewrites Provisional Measure on URV Franco Rewrites Provisional Measure on URV PY3003161594 Brasilia Radio Nacional da Amazonia Network in Portuguese 1000 GMT 30 Mar 94 PY3003161594 Brasilia Radio Nacional da Amazonia Network Portuguese BFN [Report by Luiz Augusto Mendonca] [Text] President Itamar Franco has rewritten the text of the provisional measure that creates the Real Value Unit, URV. The new text will be published in the official gazette today. The new text of Provisional Measure 434 establishes that the date for conversion of salaries into URV's is the 30th of each month. The difference resulting from the judicial and legislative branches decision to convert their employees' salaries into URV's on 20 March will be paid to them as a bonus, which will have to be authorized through a legislative decree. These decisions were made during a cabinet meeting at Planalto Palace last night. The joint proposal for rewriting Provisional Measure 434 was approved during the meeting. The text now establishes that all public employees' salaries be converted into URV's on the 30th of each month based on the salaries paid for the last four months. This rule does not apply to state-owned companies and other self-supported government organizations. The 10.94 percent difference resulting from conversion into URV's of judicial and legislative branch employees' salaries on 20 March will probably be paid to these employees as a bonus, which will be authorized through a legislative decree. President Itamar Franco began the meeting yesterday by saying that as head of the administration and chief of state he must protect the national interests and influence administrative measures of the other government branches. President Itamar Franco later said that, as should always occur in a state of law, he will comply with the Federal Supreme Court decision and continue to adopt and propose measures against unfair and unequal treatment of public issues. He added that he will coordinate proposals for amendments to the Constitution through the government leaders at the Chamber of Deputies and at the Senate. He established that these proposals be analyzed with the help of illustrious jurists. He said that these will be effective measures seeking to ensure an overall and legal reorganization of the Brazilian Government.
