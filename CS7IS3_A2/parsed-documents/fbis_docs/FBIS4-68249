This is the second transition period in the 20th century. The first, which began with the revolution of 1917, ended in December 1922 with the transformation of Russia into the Soviet Union. With the Union's creation, a delayed-action mine was laid beneath its foundations in the form of the disparity between form and content and specifically between the declared equality of all peoples (with nations' right to self-determination right up to separation) and the state's totalitarian essence. Such a disparity doomed the USSR either to lifelong, hopeless totalitarianism or to future reform. Reforms did not promise to be smooth, but the shocks which befell us proved excessively painful. These shocks were caused not by democratization, glasnost and pluralism in themselves, but by the fact that they developed with a hint of our boundlessness, irresponsibility, recklessness, the populism of politicians, and the indiscriminate fault-finding with everything. The absence of a proper legislative and legal base gave these phenomena an uncontrollability and at times even an absurdity. Union leadership proved unready for such a development of events and attempted to solve the new problems by old methods, aiming both to acquire capital and maintain innocence, as they say. That is how the events in Tbilisi, Baku and Vilnius became real facts. At the same time, the Union leadership was encouraging claims of components at a lower level (autonomies) to their own sovereignty and independence (South Osetia, Abkhazia, the Dniester region, Gagauzia and so on), which whipped up the process of reckless sovereignization even more. With great difficulty the center finally found an algorithm for solving the problem, a new Union treaty, which seemed to suit the majority of republics more or less. In my view, unjustified sluggishness was allowed in realizing this plan. Nevertheless, society as a whole was ready for legitimization of a fundamentally new Union by 20 August 1991. But this event was not destined to come about, since on 19 August we all became witnesses, and many also participants, of quite different events. I believe that this date (19 August) became a unique point of reference for the next transition period in our history. It was after the August "flatulence" that many components of the USSR lost faith in the center's declarations and interest in its initiatives. Some did so because of the center's inability to solve the problems which had come to a head in a civilized manner. Others felt they would be able to get by without such a center. All attempts to reanimate the Novo-Ogarevskiy process after August 1991 failed. Many problems hung in the air and a general crisis was imminent. Society naturally could not be in a state of uncertainty for long. It always needs supports--legal, organizational, moral. The Belovezh agreement on establishing the CIS, developed in Alma-Ata, became one such rather unstable and far from perfect support. It can be viewed as a landmark in the new transition period. The imperfection of the CIS model lies in the fact that on the one hand it took into account existing realities, and on the other hand it left many questions unresolved. In other words, a new form of mutual relationship of states seemingly had been found, but there was no substance. A painful search for it continues to this day. Life was supposed to have become considerably better for people in the CIS than in the USSR. The importance and nobility of this task are obvious; the difficulty of its accomplishment also is obvious. How is it to be fulfilled? Above all, don't hurry. Don't pull down everything to the foundations. Don't turn an evolutionary process into a revolutionary one. And most important, don't forget just what the CIS is--a zigzag of history or a historical necessity. I consider it more important, advisable and necessary to engage in perfecting the form and content both of the Commonwealth itself as well as of the cooperation of peoples in it--without arrogance, without extremes, without shocks. And these steps must be taken above all by those who initiated and legitimized that which we have today. Now we are experiencing a dramatic moment in the struggle between national consciousness of former components of the USSR on the one hand, oppressed in the past and now hypertrophied, and collapsing imperial ambitions on the other. Certain states go to the point of absurdity in their aspirations for absolute sovereignty. If it is a fuel crisis, it is their own; if it is hunger, it is sovereign; if it is currency, then it is whatever you like, just not Russian, and so on. The impression is created that our fully revved up independent states, not having a clue as to what conditions there will be at the destination, have made a dash toward the point of no return. The important thing was to cross it. As I see it, the reasons for this lie in the fact that a certain portion of leaders of sovereign states are prisoners of the ambitions of small groups of people of a certain leaning who adjure that absolute sovereignty is a panacea for all troubles--economic, political and social. Things have reached the point where politicians declaiming for closer integration into the CIS fear to speak loudly about their aspirations, since they will be tagged without delay as traitors to national interests by nationalists of all colors and hues, who obviously never are to understand that the main reason for an economic slump lies specifically in a severance of ties between states and peoples. I never will forget a television report from Kharkov, when one elderly man was asked: "How's life?" He responded: "There is nothing to eat here, and they are making missiles." All the unpretentious wisdom of our people is contained in this. A foreign journalist compared the USSR with a large swimming pool. Formation of the CIS divided this pool with bars: The water in it is common, but swimming is restricted. Further disintegration may lead to where the CIS will have to be compared with a large preserve in which each inhabitant will have his own absolutely independent cage. It is difficult to give recommendations and advice in our time, but why pull down that which is not falling in, break what is not breaking, or tear up what is not tearing, and specifically our age-old spiritual ties, our habits, our way of thinking and life? Some state figures evidently are indifferent to the fate of those who are not finding their place on the expanses of the CIS today and of those who will live after them. But in spite of everything, one-sixth of the earth will survive; it is obligated to survive. It will take its worthy place in the universe. If we gaze beyond the year 2000, it is not hard to see the following power centers in the future world: - North American continent; - Western Europe; - Japan and China; - the Muslim world. With a weak Russia or CIS, the aforementioned power centers naturally may direct their interests here. But in view of the enormity of expanses (Catherine II contended that Russia is the universe) and the unreceptiveness of our peoples to various kinds of diktat of foreigners, a weak Russia, like a gigantic crater, will be capable of swallowing up all these power centers along with their interests. Herein lies the strength of a weak Russia. Thus, the danger of Russia to the world lies in its weakness. Conversely, a strong Russia together with other CIS states is capable of serving as a unique balance, equalizing the universe and safeguarding it from ruin. Herein lies the strength and security of a strong Russia. Russia is a bridge between East and West. It will remain a house for many peoples who rested against it and bowed down before it. Herein lies their fate and Russia's. It will continue to be the keeper of world peace and the security of peoples who populate the Commonwealth. Being the largest element in a disintegrating but still functioning system, it keeps others afloat like a pontoon bridge--some by grain, some by timber, others by oil and natural gas, and still others by the ruble, but each and every one by hope. By the very fact of its unsinkability, Russia is capable also of pulling out others, who, not being able to swim on their own and clinging to each other, most will likely drown if they become uncoupled from Russia. It is of course possible to catch hold of someone else, but what will be the payment for help? New market-dollar relations are formed relatively easily, but there is that which does not lend itself to recarving. It is spiritual space, which never was replaced by force and gold. The new helpers of course may offer a hand, but they will not pull you out. It is advantageous for them to keep everyone semisubmerged. In my view, the disintegration of Russia is the most dangerous among other negative phenomena. Here too one sees the boundless desire of certain components to cross the point of no return as speedily as possible in general confusion. Not only the autonomies, but also the krays, the oblasts, and even the cities have begun speaking of their sovereignty. It is easy to imagine that as soon as federation components begin to be called states, they immediately will be tempted to acquire all state attributes--army, currency, foreign policy, customs and so on. It is difficult to answer this question, but it can be asserted that Russia will not survive its own CIS, or whatever it will be called there--it will turn into a kind of "black hole" which will swallow up the Russian state, natural resources, and possibly also peoples. New conquerors with old schemes will rush here, and we or our descendants will be forced to begin everything from the beginning, if we do not lose vitality. The simplest, most tested method of stopping this element of disintegration is to stand everyone up at attention; whoever does not obey, "sort it out" and punish them. But this already has occurred. The present time, I am sure, will give birth to politicians capable of solving the most difficult and tangled problems by peaceful means alone. They will serve as a worthy counterweight to those who, having become accustomed to the smell of powder and blood today and having lost all faith in any authority, raise up their peoples with frenzy and doom for a struggle in "hotspots." The most worthy way out of the situation at hand in Russia appears to be one in which a federal center and components of the federation accommodate each other. On this path some are obligated to cast off the armor of hegemonism and chauvinism, and others the armor of separatism and nationalism. But these cast-off "isms" should not be viewed as losses on the battlefield. Most likely this is harmful ballast needed by no one and restricting maneuver; having gotten rid of it, both will acquire confidence and mutual trust. Simultaneously with this, it is necessary to work out a legislative and legal base together on key problems of our existence, coordinated to the maximum and acceptable to the components. The common legislative and legal base in turn must not level out the morals, customs, traditions and other national features of federation components. These laws, common for all, must preclude such phenomena as, for example, establishment of an age qualification for the marriage of young people; an instruction, let's say, about what memorable dates to celebrate in federation components, except statewide ones; establishment of movie ticket prices, and so on. In other words, in the many-sided process of creating a new federalism, it is necessary to single out the general and the special. The general unites the center, the special is regulated locally. The general makes our society monolithic, and the special makes it flexible. By virtue of originality, multinationality, and other purely Russian features, our future social and state system should not be driven artificially into the framework of American, British, Swedish, Japanese and other systems of regulating life, no matter how attractive and civilized they may seem to us. Naturally, we must study and take in the experience of others, but today we are obliged to display our civilized nature above all in the ability to cover this most difficult transition period in our history without a scuffle, without blood, without tears and sufferings of the people, for the good of our children and grandchildren, who must live neither in a large cage nor in small ones. We can and are obligated to create such a moral, legal, sociopolitical, economic and intellectual climate in Russia that many peoples, and not just of the CIS, would consider themselves lucky to live in it.
