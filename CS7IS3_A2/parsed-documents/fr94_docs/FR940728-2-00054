L. 92&hyph;463), the Environmental Protection Agency gives notice of a meeting of the Effluent Guidelines Task Force (EGTF). The EGTF is a subcommittee of the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT), the external policy advisory board to the Administrator of EPA. The EGTF was established in July of 1992 to advise EPA on the Effluent Guidelines Program, which develops regulations for dischargers of industrial wastewater pursuant to Title III of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). The Task Force consists of members appointed by EPA from industry, citizen groups, state and local government, the academic and scientific communities, and EPA regional offices. The Task Force was created to offer advice to the Administrator on the long-term strategy for the effluent guidelines program, and particularly to provide recommendations on a process for expediting the promulgation of effluent guidelines. The Task Force generally does not discuss specific effluent guideline regulations currently under development. The meeting agenda will include discussions on draft recommendations for improving the project management and data collection processes for effluent guidelines. There will also be discussions on the methodology for conducting preliminary industry studies, and a planning session for future task force activities. The meeting is open to the public. Limited seating for the public is available on a first-come, first-served basis. The public may submit written comments to the Task Force regarding improvements to the Effluent Guidelines program. Comments should be sent to EPA at the above address. Comments submitted by August 8 will be considered by the Task Force at or subsequent to the meeting. Dated: July 14, 1994. Eric Strassler, Designated Federal Official, Effluent Guidelines Task Force. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18330 Filed 7&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
