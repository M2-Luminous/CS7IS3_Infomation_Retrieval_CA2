FR940110-1-00054 FR940110-1-00006 If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a loan under the AHP were sold prior to the end of the 30-year period or the remaining useful life of the unit, as the case may be, to a household that was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the applicant would have to either: (1) Repay to the Bank that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller, or (2) convert that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller to a market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate of interest at the time the advance was made, and any unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller would be made available by the Bank for additional AHP projects. If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant under the AHP were sold prior to the end of the 30-year period or the remaining useful life of the unit, as the case may be, to a household that was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the seller would have to repay to the applicant a pro rata portion of the grant from any profit realized upon the sale of the unit, and any amount repaid to the applicant would have to be forwarded to the Bank and made available for additional AHP projects. The Bank would have the discretion to waive this recapture requirement if imposition of the requirement would cause undue hardship on the seller, as defined in the Bank's AHP implementation plan. In addition, for owner-occupied units assisted by a grant, the Bank would have to monitor the unit during the required long-term period by reviewing land title records or reports or certifications from the sponsor or a regulatory agency, as determined by each Bank in its AHP implementation plan, to determine whether the unit had been sold to a household whose income exceeded a low-or moderate-income. As an alternative to requiring that each owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant be subject to a restriction on transfer, the Bank could have a legally binding agreement with the sponsor providing that if such unit were sold prior to the end of the required long-term period to a household that was not a low- or moderate-income household, the sponsor would make another unit available to a low- or moderate-income household. Option B. Under option B, the long-term requirement would be met by providing that an owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant or a loan under the AHP must be affordable for the initial household for the duration of that household's occupancy of the unit. However, to minimize opportunities for speculation, the unit would have to be subject to a deed restriction or other legally enforceable mechanism restricting transfer of the unit to a low- or moderate-income household if the unit were sold within five years of the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of the unit. As under option A, a household purchasing such a unit under option B would have to qualify as a low- or moderate-income household only at the time of purchase or at the time of closing on the financing for the unit, and a household rehabilitating a unit would have to qualify as a low- or moderate-income household only at the time the household received a commitment for funding through the AHP. If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a loan under the AHP were sold prior to the end of the five-year period to a household that was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the applicant would have to either: (1) Repay to the Bank that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller, or (2) convert that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller to a market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the market rate of interest at the time the advance was made, and any unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to subsidize that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the seller would be made available by the Bank for additional AHP projects. If an owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant under the AHP were sold prior to the end of the five-year period to a household that was not a low- or moderate-income household, then the seller would have to repay to the applicant a pro rata portion of the grant from any profit realized upon the sale of the unit, and any amount repaid to the applicant would have to be forwarded to the Bank and made available for additional AHP projects. The Bank would have the discretion to waive this recapture requirement if imposition of the requirement would cause undue hardship on the seller, as defined in the Bank's AHP implementation plan.

As under option A, as an alternative to requiring that each owner-occupied unit assisted by a grant be subject to a restriction on transfer, the Bank under option B could have a legally binding agreement with the sponsor providing that if such unit were sold prior to the end of the required long-term period to a household that was not a low- or moderate-income household, the sponsor would make another unit available to a low- or moderate-income household.
