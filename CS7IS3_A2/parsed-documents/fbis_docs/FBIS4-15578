The cause for this may be disagreements on issues which Moscow deems key to a settlement in Karabakh and in the region as a whole: about the deployment of Russian troops on the line disengaging the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis and on the closure of CIS external borders (notably between Azerbaijan and Iran). Yet today even the remnants of the semi-demolished Azeri opposition are at one with Aliyev's slogan, "No Russian troops in the republic!" Especially after the noisy hearings on "investigation into the intrusion of Soviet troops in Baku" in January 1990. Baku is even more negative on the plans to create Russian military bases abroad. Meanwhile, speaking a recent conference of border troop commanders in the city of Odintsovo, Andrey Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of the Russian Border Guard Troops, expressed special concern over the situation at the Azerbaijan section of the CIS borders. In Moscow's opinion, Baku does not observe the provisions of the Commonwealth Declaration on Border Protection, while the republic has long turned into a "sieve" through which not only foreign spies but also drugs and arms are getting into Russia. At the present moment Baku is considering a draft bilateral agreement on border protection presented by Russia (it is to expand into a multilateral agreement, with the participation of Armenia and Georgia). In all likelihood, the draft, which provides for the presence of Russian troops in Azerbaijan, will be met with a decisive "sovereign `no,'" timed to coincide with the CIS summit. Baku may be just blackmailing Moscow on the chance that it will take fright and let up the pressure. Yet another option is also possible: Aliyev, faced with the threat of introduction of Russian troops, will have nothing more to lose. Moreover, his advanced age and deteriorating health (KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that for this reason he cannot come to the summit but instead will send along parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev, who is tipped in Baku as successor to the president), can move Aliyev to consider that it is time to start thinking of how to go down in history as a dedicated fighter for Azerbaijan's sovereignty.
