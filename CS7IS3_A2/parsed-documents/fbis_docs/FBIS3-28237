Referring to ongoing discussions among coalition party leaders, Fujii told reporters after a morning cabinet meeting, "it's impossible to settle" (the issue) by dropping the plan into "a blank sheet." Brushing aside criticism that the ministry forced Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to decide on the tax plan, Fujii said he is "silently watching" the coalition meeting with his ministry taking an open-minded or "blank sheet" stance. Fujii also sought to justify Hosokawa's decision by stressing that the prime minister followed "required procedures" by consulting with his advisory panel, an economic policy forum of the government and coalition parties and a meeting of party leaders. But Fujii reiterated his opposition to changing the new national welfare tax into an "objective" tax -- one in which the revenues are earmarked for special accounts rather than the general account. The new tax would "virtually be an objective tax" because it would be implemented in a law stipulating that revenues be for welfare purposes. The Social Democratic Party -- the largest party in the ruling coalition -- is threatening to quit the cabinet unless the government accepts its compromise plan that primarily calls for changing the welfare tax to an objective tax. The tax plan decided by Hosokawa calls for adoption of the 7 percent welfare tax in place of the current 3 percent consumption tax in April 1997 to finance tax cuts worth 6 trillion yen. Fujii reiterated that his ministry's calculation that a 7 percent tax is needed to finance the tax cuts is "correct." Meanwhile, he said he welcomed a debate about the new tax in view of the aging of society, and noted that Hosokawa's intentions are in line with the Tax Commission's November report calling for a cut in the income tax burden and an improvement in consumption taxes to cope with the graying population. He said discussions should not be focused too much on economic measures. But in including the tax cuts in the stimulus package to be announced shortly, Fujii said the government is taking the measures with "confidence" to put the economy on a full-fledged recovery path in fiscal 1994, and stable growth in fiscal 1995.
