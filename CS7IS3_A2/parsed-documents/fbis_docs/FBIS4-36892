The incident occurred when he arrived to take up his position at the joint checkpoint on the Netzarim-al-Munthar road. Three gunshots were immediately fired at him from a nearby farm. One gunshot hit him in the right side of the chest. The source asserted that the shooting was deliberate. Our correspondents say that the perpetrators of this operation were probably Mosad men and their agents or a group of settlers. The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine has issued a statement accusing the settlers of killing policeman Abu-Hamzah. The statement said this criminal incident stresses that the Zionists harbor only malice and racism against the Palestinian people and all Arabs and Muslims. The life of a Palestinian is targeted just because he is a Palestinian, whether he is a policeman who is asked to protect the Gaza-Jericho agreement--an agreement that guarantees the security of both the Zionist entity and settlements--or the mujahidin who protect our people from malice, racism, and occupation. In its statement, the Movement condemned this criminal incident, and emphasized that it will escalate its militant activities against the Zionists.
