At his 10 February meeting with the prime minister, the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] president proposed to him the broad outline of this negotiation, and they have discussed these aims over the telephone since then, without its being ruled out that Pujol may convey them to him in writing. CiU's intention is that these aims could be achieved in 1994, although not necessarily completely, but at least that they should be well under way with a view to their later resolution, since Pujol expects progress to be made in this dialogue before deciding on his support for the state budgets for 1995. This negotiation, which will be examined by the liaison committee between Democratic Convergence of Catalonia and Democratic Union of Catalonia today, is being conducted discreetly in order to avoid the suspicions that it could otherwise arouse in certain political and social circles; although it is proceeding at a very slow pace right now, it is Pujol's intention to accelerate it after the Spanish Socialist Workers Party congress. The point that Pujol deems crucial for making possible a different implementation of autonomy -- which he believes to be perfectly feasible by virtue of the diversity allowed by the Constitution -- is that of the basic laws, which must not encroach upon the autonomous communities' exercise of their powers. For this reason, CiU proposes that some that have interpreted the [autonomy] statute in a restrictive manner be amended. The extension of the duties of the Mossos d'Esquadra [autonomous police force] is another aspect that Pujol deems essential and that Councillor Maria Eugenia Cuenca and [Interior] Minister Antoni Asuncion have already discussed at several meetings. The negotiation, which is believed to be well under way, has as its basis the autonomous police bill and could include some formula for integrating the National Police into what is believed should be the Catalan police, comprising as basic elements the Mossos d'Esquadra and the local police forces. Turning the Generalitat into the state's ordinary administration in Catalonia -- the single administration in Manuel Fraga's terminology -- is also on the agenda, and has already been achieved with respect to agriculture, on which an agreement was signed 15 February. In the sphere of justice, CiU is seeking a reform of the Organic Law of the Judiciary, which, according to coalition sources, the minister is already preparing. Regional planning is also among CiU's aims, especially with respect to coordination on the investments that the state makes in Catalonia, the Generalitat's involvement in the cohesion funds from the European Union, and the demand that the government respect autonomous powers concerning the environment. Public health funding is the last major area that Pujol wants unblocked. On this point, the Generalitat has the support of the Andalusian Junta [autonomous government].
