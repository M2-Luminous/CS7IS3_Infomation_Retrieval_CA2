It is part of a 10 kilogram batch of the radioactive material, the remainder of which was recovered Thursday in Bursa, western Turkey, in an undercover operation. Three Georgians were slightly wounded when they were arrested after trying to sell the uranium to disguised police officers. Their identities were still not revealed Monday by police. The seized material has been sent to a nuclear research centre in Istanbul for tests, as police look for links with a smaller haul of uranium in October in Istanbul. In the earlier incident police arrested five Turks and three Iranians allegedly attempting to sell 2.5 kilos of uranium, which the Istanbul research centre said was of insufficient quality for the manufacture of a nuclear bomb. Five of the group, including one Iranian, were jailed for the "illegal trafficking of nuclear material" by a court in Istanbul. Parts of the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine are still in operation despite a massive explosion in one of its reactors in April 1986 which caused the world's worst peace-time nuclear disaster, releasing a cloud of radioactive dust across Europe.
