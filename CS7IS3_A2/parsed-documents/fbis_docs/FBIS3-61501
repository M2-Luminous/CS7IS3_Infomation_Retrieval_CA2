Mikulskaya; UDC 635.1/8:631.34] [Abstract] A 2.8-m-wide experimental pneumatic vegetable planting disinsection unit for class 1.4 tractors developed by the Scientific Production Association of Belarussian Agricultural Mechanization is described. The pneumatic vegetable planting disinsection unit consists of a vacuum chamber which carries an axial-flow controlled output fan and guides for changing the flow direction as well as insect intake chambers. The operating procedure is outlined in detail. A pilot prototype of the PDO-4.2 disinsectization unit has been developed on the basis of this device and has passed preliminary tests at the Belarussian Machine Testing Station. The device manufactured by the pilot plant of the Central Scientific Research Institute of Rural Mechanization and Electrification in Agriculture has been integrated in the vegetable agriculture mechanization system of the Belarus Republic.
