"I am afraid that, in view of the extremely difficult process of the formation of public opinion, the West will no longer have the power to implement stages two, three, and four of the ultimatum after stage one. What will happen if the first stage does not yield the desired result? This will be a real disaster." Mock was also critical of the fact that Washington seems to agree to Bosnia's partition. "The division is the weakest of all solutions. It contains the danger of recurring conflicts in the long run. Yet I do not rule out that it will be implemented, because at least it will lead to a cease-fire." In the meantime, THE WASHINGTON POST has reported that the United States is apparently ready for a compromise in the dispute over the control of heavy weapons. Some of the weapons might remain on the mountains surrounding Sarajevo, the paper quoted U.S. Government officials as saying.
