According to the announcement from the President's cabinet, they exchanged opinions on the present situation in the Macedonian-Greek negotiations and the possibilities of continuing the dialogue on the controversial issues. Also on this occasion, Macedonia's position in relations to the urgent need for a lifting of the blockade and the concept -- to discuss and solve all of the questions in a package, was reiterated. President Gligorov placed an emphasis on the difficult consequences from the Greek embargo suffered by the Macedonian economy and the real threat this imposes to a broader destabilization in the region. He was also uncertain whether the latest round of negotiations with the mediators in New York would be able to provide a greater certainty as to the outcome of this situation, which is already becoming an evident element of threat to the stability in the south. During the talks, they also exchanged opinions on the further development of the relations between the United States and the Republic of Macedonia. Mr. Crvenkovski stated that other topics were the situation in Macedonia, the damages caused by the embargo and the entire situation in the region. He expressed hope that it would soon come to another meeting with Nimetz, and that the talks with Cyrus Vance would be continued. The U.S. special envoy Nimetz explained before the press that all of the sides in the negotiations have agreed that it is better not to disclose the essence of these sensitive negotiations in public, as it is a better way of conducting them more successfully. He stated that the talks were of great help to him in understanding the problem better, and that his function was to convey the stances of the two sides individually.
