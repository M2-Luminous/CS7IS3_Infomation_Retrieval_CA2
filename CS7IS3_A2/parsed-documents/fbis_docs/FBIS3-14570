"This bitter incident is a clear proof of the tense situation in Karabakh which endangers the lives of innocent people and those of foreign nationals," the Foreign Ministry said in its statement. The Iranian aircraft, a C-130 Hercules, was flying from Moscow to Tehran with families of Iranian diplomats in Russia on board on March 17, when it exploded in mid air over Karabakh after being hit by a missile fired by Armenian troops based in the region, shortly after the plane had contacted Yerevan control tower at 19:10 GMT. "The Islamic Republic of Iran reserves the right to take legal action... and receive compensations for the victims of the crash, and calls on the Armenian Government to identify and punish those guilty of downing the aircraft," the Foreign Ministry statement said. It expressed regret that tension in Karabakh not only has caused heavy casualties and losses but has also endangered flight security in the region. Those trying to fan the flame of war and heighten tension in the region should bear the consequences of such painful incidents, it warned. The Foreign Ministry statement was based on a report filed by a team of Iranian experts dispatched to the site of crash to probe the incident.
