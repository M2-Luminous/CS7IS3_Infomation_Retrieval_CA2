The news was officially confirmed by the spokesman for the Holy See, Joaquin Navarro Valls, who insisted on the private nature of her visit. However, it cannot be excluded that the presence of Deng Nan, who is the deputy minister for culture in her country, could also be interpreted as a further step in the direction of a rapprochement between the Holy See and China, following the severing of diplomatic links in the 1950's.
