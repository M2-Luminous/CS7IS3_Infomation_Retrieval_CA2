The program is moderated by Vadym Zadorozhnyy. At the beginning of the program, Plyushch is asked who is to blame for the current economic crisis in Ukraine. Plyushch responds that the reason for the economic plight of Ukraine, as well as other republics of the former Soviet Union, is the irrational structure of the production sector: In Ukraine, about 70 percent of the labor force is employed in the production of the means of production, while only 30 percent is involved in consumer production. During 70 years of Soviet rule, he continues, Ukraine was a supplier of coal from Donbass and iron from Krivbass for Warsaw Pact countries, while now Ukraine "has been left alone" not only with the problems of Donbass and Krivbass, but also with the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and a large military-industrial complex. Plyushch states that these three factors account for over one-third of Ukraine's budget expenditures. However, he emphasizes that these expenditures must be made because there are 1.2 million miners employed in Donbass and "hundreds of thousands" of workers in Krivbass. As for the military-industrial complex, the Supreme Council chairman says: "We do not need such a big Army. However, what are we to do with those people tomorrow? We started with an Army of 1 million men, now we have reduced that number to 500,000. As a result, budget allocations to pensioned soldiers are much bigger than those for regular servicemen." Asked to name specific measures for overcoming the country's economic crisis, Plyushch states that the Ukrainian people should cardinally change production relations and implement reforms so as to "make a worker master of his own labor." Commenting on the activity of the Supreme Council, Plyushch states that the Ukrainian parliament has done a lot to build up Ukrainian statehood, but contributed little to the implementation of economic reform. Asking a question concerning a possible split of the Crimea from Ukraine following the recent presidential elections on the peninsula, Plyushch states that Ukraine's territorial integrity is assured by "all our documents," and Ukraine "will never back down" in this regard. The Supreme Council chairman goes on to emphasize that there are no countries which would encroach upon Ukraine's territorial integrity. He reminds listeners that the Moscow trilateral declaration by Presidents Clinton, Yeltsin, and Kravchuk provides for noninterference in internal matters and asserts that all the sides will cooperate in securing the territorial integrity of their countries. Commenting on the remark that the Ukrainian parliament has done little to support the use of the Ukrainian language on all levels of state life, Plyushch says that the process of introducing the Ukrainian language require a great amount of time and money. As of today, Plyushch claims, Ukraine is not able to publish a sufficient amount of Ukrainian textbooks and train a sufficient number of teachers of Ukrainian language. Asked to explain the "associated membership" of Ukraine in the CIS economic union and cite concrete results of Ukraine's participation in this union, Plyushch states that these questions should be addressed to the government. He also says: "We have already concluded over 400 various agreements within the CIS framework, but none of them is working. Is there any need for such a union?" He states that cooperation between CIS countries is necessary, but it should be accomplished on the level of "permanent commissions and committees." Cooperation on the level of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly is assessed by him as "pulling one another's leg." At the end of the program, Supreme Council Chairman Plyushch is asked to comment on the balance between legislative and executive power in Ukraine. He states that Ukraine had been living too long under unified authoritarian rule, both in czarist and Soviet times. Therefore, he adds, Ukraine needs a redistribution of power between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. He admits that the distribution of power between legislative and executive bodies has not been accomplished "very well."
