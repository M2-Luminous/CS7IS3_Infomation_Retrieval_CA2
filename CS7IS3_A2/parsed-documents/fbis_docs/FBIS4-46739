Will It Be Noticed in Moscow?"] [Text] The presidium of the Council of the Federation of Trade Unions of the oblast passed a resolution on 18 May to conduct a workers' rally in Novosibirsk on 9 June 1994 at 1500 on V.I. Lenin Square in support of demands that the president, the government, the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, the oblast administration, and the mayor of Novosibirsk prevent a slump in production, pay wages in a timely and complete way, adopt a state employment program, and guarantee citizens' safety. An application for the conduct of a rally was addressed to V. Tolokonskiy, the city's mayor. The proposed number of participants--30,000 persons. There have been no actions on such a scale in Novosibirsk since 1992, when a delegation nominated here at a rally departed for Moscow "to shake loose" money for wages. The trip was successful at that time. But time passed, and the needs of Novosibirsk Oblast were forgotten in the capital. Our position cannot be called pleasant. Seventy percent of the oblast industrial complex consists of defense enterprises that are shutting down shops one after the other and sending workers on forced leave. The NPO [scientific production association] Vostok has been idle since 24 April, the Lenin plant has gradually been coming to a stop since 16 May, Kometa stopped on 23 May, and the condenser plant has been idle since 1 May. The Berdsk electromechanical plant is stopping work in two stages from 6 to 14 June. Sibselmash is stopping agricultural and foundry production starting 1 June. The sorrowful list can be continued. In the words of V. Medvedko, director of NEVZ [Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant], he has already been left without half of his skilled personnel. Director of Sibtekstilmash Popelyukh says: "Production is stopping--robbery is increasing..." It is not especially necessary to explain how the situation of the large enterprises will affect the city budget, and this means the people who get their wages, pensions, and allowances from it. April payments to the budget totaled 17 percent of what was planned. Sibselmash alone went into debt to the pension fund for 1.2 billion rubles [R]. Sibtekstilmash owes R7 billion and Novosibirskenergo R5 billion to the budget. The oblast trade unions hope to attract attention to all these problems with the multi-thousand-strong rally. Following it, a delegation will go to Moscow with a package of proposals. The oblast trade unions are observing a "nonaggression pact" with the government and are not putting forth any kind of political demands. Time will tell whether this loyalty will be appreciated in Moscow.
