Albino Malungo, minister of assistance and social reintegration, discusses the situation: [Begin recording] [Malungo] Right now, Malange is the province with the largest food supply problems. The province has a huge population and people cannot work. They depend on relief aid from the government, the United Nations, and nongovernmental organizations [NGO's]. That is a sad situation because UNITA is still not serious. It is using relief aid for political gain. From 16 to 20 May UNITA attacked WFP aircraft. That is a gross violation. We have already had talks with the United Nations and will once again meet its officials this afternoon. I think the government will take measures regarding supplies for UNITA in areas like Huambo and Jamba where we are not sure whether UNITA has distributed aid to the right people. [Unidentified correspondet] Does that mean retaliatory action will be taken? [Malungo] Not exactly. Regarding the suspension of relief aid for Huambo, I have information that UNITA soldiers raided NGO and UN warehouses. They either did it on their own or were following orders. That is a violation of the principles governing relief aid. We are owed an explanation. [end recording]
