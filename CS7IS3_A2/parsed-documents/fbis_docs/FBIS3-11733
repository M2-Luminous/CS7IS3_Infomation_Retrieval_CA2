I am committed to not allowing impunity. Yesterday I sent the Federal District attorney general to the scene of the incidents. He has conducted preliminary investigations and is ready to report the results to the competent authorities. I do not want any doubts, questions, or concerns to remain, so I have given instructions to the Attorney General of the Republic to create a special Deputy Attorney General's Office that will be in charge of thoroughly investigating the causes of this treacherous crime, fully and totally dedicating its time to this task. In response to a request from Mrs. Diana Laura Riojas de Colosio and based on my own convictions, I have decided to appoint Miguel Montes Garcia for this important task of national interest. He will hold this post if the Permanent Commission of the Congress of the Union authorizes the request for leave he has made to the Supreme Court of Justice. Miguel Montes is a outstanding jurist who is well known for his straightforward personality, his profound knowledge of the law, and his honesty. In carrying out his duties, Jurist Montes will have the support of the lawyers and expert investigators he may deem necessary to help him in this important mission. The leadership of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] and the coordinators of Luis Donaldo Colosio's political campaign have endorsed this proposal. I will place at the disposal of the Deputy Attorney General's Office and Montes all the resources and necessary tools he may need to fulfill his responsibility of promoting justice and facing this inadmissible action for Luis Donaldo Colosio's family, the PRI, and all Mexicans. The law will be enforced. Justice will be served.
