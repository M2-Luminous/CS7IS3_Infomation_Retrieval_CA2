Highlighting the development are operations in the northern part of Shaanxi Province, where blocks totaling 40,000 square kilometres contain an estimated 1 billion tons of oil. Preparations for development in Sichuan Province have also been progressing, according to executives with the China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), which oversees on-shore oil operations. In an interview, a senior official with the CNPC specified the improved conditions in northern Shaanxi: - Better relations between State-chartered oil firms and regional operators. The relations necessary for quick development were cemented by an agreement signed early this month by CNPC and provincial authorities. The agreement binds the CNPC and governments and enterprises in the province to join together to accelerate oil development. They will also co-operate to beef up protection of oil resources. Before long, the official said, millions of tons of oil are expected to be produced in the region each year. A large portion of the output is to be pumped by joint operations involving the CNPC, regional authorities and enterprises. - The availability of technology for developing oil there. Petroleum development started in the 330,000-square-kilometre Shaan-Gan-Ning Basin 90 years ago, but only 2 percent of the resources has been recovered because of inadequate technology. - Enough evidence of easy drilling for oil lies only 500 to 1,500 metres underground, compared with several times that depth elsewhere in the country. With the newly signed agreement, the CNPC official said, long-awaited large oilfields will be built in the area before long. Over the past 18 months, hundreds of work units have rushed to drill wells there to extract oil that legally belongs to the State. These work units, inexperienced in oil operations, sought quick profits and had no long-term commitment to protecting the resources. Their operations were inefficient and hindered overall planning, the official said.
