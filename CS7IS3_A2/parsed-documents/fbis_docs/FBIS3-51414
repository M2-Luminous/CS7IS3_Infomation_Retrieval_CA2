Perez Trevino has been municipal president of Ciudad Acuna, Coahuila, a federal deputy and a leader of the Chamber of Deputies in that state. He is an agronomist who graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. The PARM candidate is a nephew of General Jacinto Blas Trevino, the founder of the political organization. Gen. Trevino left the ranks of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the 1950's due to differences of opinion with the party's leadership to found a new organization. With the nomination of Perez Trevino, each of the nine officially registered parties now have their own presidential candidate with whom to go out on the campaign trail in search of votes. At the same time, the announcement also put an end to the intentions of several parties to run for the Mexican presidency with a common candidate. The other presidential candidates are: Luis Donaldo Colosio of the PRI; Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the National Action Party; Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the Party of the Democratic Revolution; Cecilia Soto of the Labor Party; Marcela Lombardo Otero of the Popular Socialist Party; Rafael Aguilar Talamantes of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party; Pablo Emilio Madero of the National Opposition Union; and Jorge Gonzalez Torres, for the Mexican Green Ecologist Party. A group of parties formed a coalition known as the National Democratic Front in 1988, which nominated Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano. This, in turn, made that year's elections the most criticized in recent decades. Election legislation reforms made it extremely difficult to create coalitions among political parties, consequently, each party was forced to select their own candidate for 1994.
