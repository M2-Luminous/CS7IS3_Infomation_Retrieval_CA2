Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should resolutely implement the arrangements of the party Central committee and the State Council and adopt realistic and effective measures to fulfill the three tasks of the anticorruption struggle to be accomplished in the near future. We must win notable results by the end of this year and never do a superficial job so as to win the trust of the people. Liu Fengyan, standing committee member of the municipal party committee and secretary of the municipal discipline inspection commission, gave a report at the working meeting. He said: The municipal party committee and government have adopted a firm attitude and carried out down-to-earth work to implement the arrangements of the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission for the anticorruption struggle. Notable results have been won in some aspects. Tianjin started early and carried out solid work to check "wanton levies." It has by and large canceled the items of wanton levies according to the explicit order of the State Council. The municipal government publicized on two occasions 195 items of wanton levies to be canceled, and a fairly good job has been done in this regard. After self-inspections, all districts, counties, and bureaus have also canceled more than 300 items of wanton levies. The unhealthy trends of private travels abroad (beyond the border) with public expenses has been checked. Leading cadres of party and government organs conducted earnest self-inspection and self-correction in line with the five regulations on honesty and self-discipline. With municipal-level leading bodies taking the lead, leading bodies of departments, committees, offices, districts, counties, and bureaus as well as the units at the county or section level have held democratic meetings, where cadres who violated regulations took the initiative in reporting their problems to the organizations and corrected most of them, and where results of the self-inspection and self-correction activities were made public to cadres. The work to investigate and handle major and serious cases is being carried out in depth, and a number of criminal elements have been punished according to law. The municipal discipline inspection commission recently also organized inspection promotion groups and sent them to more than 40 units to inspect how major work is carried out, thus developing in depth the anticorruption struggle. Gao Dezhan pointed out in his speech: Tianjin's previous anticorruption struggle has developed in a healthy manner, and fairly good results have been achieved. However, development has been uneven. As the year is drawing to an end, we should pay more attention to and do a better job in the anticorruption struggle in line with the arrangements of the party Central Committee and the State Council and make sure that notable results are achieved by the end of this year. Gao Dezhan put forward five demands on the in-depth anticorruption struggle: First, we should further improve our understanding. Leading cadres at all levels should further intensify the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of important theories on correcting party style, intensifying efforts to build a clean government, and opposing corruption, conscientiously implement the guidelines of the important speeches of Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng on the anticorruption struggle, surmount various obstacles, actively adhere to the principle of "attending to two tasks simultaneously and achieving competence in both," adopt a firm attitude to make the anticorruption struggle successful, and never do a superficial job and lose the trust of the people. Second, we must fulfill all the three tasks of the anticorruption struggle to be accomplished in the near future in line with central arrangements. All departments, committees, offices, districts, counties, and bureaus should conduct an inspection on their previous anticorruption struggle to find out their problems and where they lag behind. After this, they should give prominence to work priorities, pay close attention to weak links, and solve problems one by one to achieve good results. Leading cadres who did a poor job in self-inspection and self- correction should step up efforts to take remedial measures and never be vague on this matter. The honesty, self-discipline, self-inspection, and self-correction of leading bodies and leading cadres should be made public for the supervision of the masses during the year-end democratic appraisal of performance. Mistakes found during the inspection should be corrected and dealt with according to regulations and never recur. We should pool efforts to step up investigation and handling of major and serious cases and conclude them more rapidly. Regarding the endeavor to check wanton levies and unhealthy trends in some trades, we should consolidate the achievements already won and adopt measures to make it still better. We must never slacken efforts in it. Third, we should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the "circular on strictly banning waste and extravagance like using public funds to hold parties and buy gifts during the 1994 New Year and Spring Festival period" issued by the general offices of the party Central Committee and the State Council and establish a new style of honesty. The municipality has also issued a document on this. Leading cadres at all levels should maintain honesty and self-discipline, set an example in honesty, and be clean and honest during the jubilant New Year and Spring Festival. This should be a practical criterion to judge the results of the previous anticorruption struggle and an important indicator to show whether leading cadres are honest and self-disciplined. Cadres found to have defied instructions and violated the circular should be investigated and punished strictly and promptly and never be tolerated. Fourth, the more the anticorruption struggle is developed in depth, the more we should have a correct and strict command of principles and policies. We should always take economic construction as the central task and serve better the endeavor to promote reform and opening up and accelerate economic development. We should adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, adopt a firm attitude, and do down-to-earth work to carry out the anticorruption struggle in a healthy and orderly manner. We should soothe popular feeling and further boost the enthusiasm of all the people of the municipality through the anticorruption struggle. Fifth, we should conscientiously strengthen organizational leadership and do a good job in supervision and inspection. Tianjin's anticorruption struggle has entered a crucial period, and the period before the end of this year is very important to determine whether notable results can be achieved. Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to it and never slacken efforts in the struggle despite their busy work. We should conscientiously strengthen organizational leadership and apply the responsibility system to every level which should be responsible for the work of the next lower level. The municipal party committee and government will organize an overall inspection in January next year on the anticorruption struggle of all units.
