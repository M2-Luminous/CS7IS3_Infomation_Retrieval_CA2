Angolan Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and other government officials went to Luanda's international 4 February Airport to bid farewell to the Mozambican head of state, who was accompanied by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. President Joaquim Chissano, who had arrived in Luanda on 1 February after visits to Switzerland and Portugal, held talks with a team led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and met with the Angolan Government's economic team led by Prime Minister Marcolino Moco. Before leaving Luanda, the Mozambican head of state held a news conference at the airport and said he was a witness to the great openness shown by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the Angolan Government with a view to achieving peace and solidifying democracy. [Chissano] "We have been very [words indistinct] the stance adopted by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos concerning the search for solutions to the extremely complex Angolan issue. We were very surprised by the degree of openness shown by the Angolan Government and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, particularly if you take into account the destruction that has ravaged Angola, the killing of people, and the current state of the economy because of the war. It is enough to say that many Angolan cities have lost all their industrial assets and that the areas that are perhaps most central to this country's development have been occupied, destroyed, and their production has been completely blocked. Any attempt to try and reverse this situation will indeed require much courage. We have seen that courage in the Angolan Government. It is full of initiative and imagination, to the extent that we feel our problems are minor by comparison and we feel quite encouraged to look for solutions to our problems." President Joaquim Chissano described as groundless rumors going around that Mozambique's multiparty elections might be postponed. [Chissano] "More often than not such rumors are created by people who make their own assessments and predictions. They speculate. However, neither the Mozambican Government nor our country's political parties have put forward any such suggestions yet. We believe everything is going well and we believe it will be possible to hold elections by October of this year, as scheduled. [Unidentified correspondent] "However, President Chissano, the government appears to have had some problems concerning the troop confinement process. [Chissano] "Those who want to exaggerate problems and make the whole process unworkable will probably say so. What I know is that there are times when the implementation of the accord goes faster and there are others when it goes slower. One cannot adjudge the whole process because of what happened over one or two days. The troop confinement process can and will be implemented in good time. The delay you were talking about has to do with the government forces. I know that we can confine all troops before the scheduled deadline and that is what we are going to do." The Mozambican head of state said that the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party's victory in the October elections is already a certainty. [Chissano] "There is no argument that Frelimo will win. What appears to be a greater source of debate at this stage is how the other parties will fare in the elections, how may seats they will get in the Assembly and whether they come second, third, fourth, and so on. Frelimo's victory seems to me to be a certainty, even to the opposition. Nonetheless, I must tell you that my party's belief is that we must work hard. If we fail to do so, things could change over the next few months and, as you know, several factors play a hand in elections but, were elections to be held today, tomorrow, or a month from now, Frelimo's victory would be....[pauses] Well, we would be faced with a new problem: we would not know how to accommodate the other parties."
