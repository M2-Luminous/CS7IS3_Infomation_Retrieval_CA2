The newly-appointed chief director of communications in Mr Mandela's office, Mr Joel Netshitenzhe, said the PAC was interested in participation in an integrated defence force and the ANC in principle agreed that the relevant legislation should be examined. Defence Minister Mr Joe Modise had been part of Mr Mandela's delegation at Sunday night's talks, and Mrs Patricia de Lille part of Mr Makwetu's. Mr Netshitenzhe said talks between Mr Mandela and Home Affairs Minister Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi about the controversial KwaZulu land deal would possibly not take place on Sunday night, but on Monday morning before the Cabinet meeting.
