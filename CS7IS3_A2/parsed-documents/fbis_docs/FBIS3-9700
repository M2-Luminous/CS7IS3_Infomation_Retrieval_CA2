The new drugs, based on the substance developed by the Czech scientists, affects diseases caused by the so-called DNA viruses, or retroviruses [retroviry], that appear in connection with immune deficiency, particularly in AIDS patients and patients who have undergone tissue transplants. "The new preparation should solve, for example, the problem of shingles (an eye disease causing blindness), hepatitis, and even AIDS. It has an effect on viruses for which medical science has no drugs," Antonin Holy, from the Academy of Sciences said. Patients would take the drug once a week or at longer intervals. The U.S. firm Gilead Sciences from California has obtained a license for utilizing the discovery of the Czech scientists and is attempting to manufacture the drug. In the United States, where the preparation is being tested on AIDS, experts say that it really affects the condition of people who suffer from full-blown AIDS. Clinical tests of all of the preparations are not yet completed.
