The agreement was signed at the conclusion of the Sixth Session of the Mixed Intergovernmental Commission which was presided over by Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas. Hao Jianxiu of the Chinese Planning Commission served as vice chairman of the meeting. Hao arrived in Havana on Sunday. The high-ranking officer described the agreement as positive and told the press that he is aware of the difficult economic situation Cuba is confronting, which translates into serious cutbacks in supplies and services for the people. Without going into detail on the protocol that has just been signed and which encompasses commercial trade goals for 1994, Cabrisas said the most important thing is that these agreements ensure the future development of cooperation between the two countries. During the meeting, four documents for bilateral cooperation were signed including the final document of the meeting. The Chinese delegation was received by Carlos Lage, vice president of the Cuban Council of State and the person responsible for supervising Cuba's economic activities, as well as other high-ranking officials from the light, steel, food, and sugar industries. Cuba holds second place in Latin America in terms of trade with China. These trade activities exceeded $400 million in 1993. The Chinese have sold rice, bicycles, and even machinery spare parts to Cuba in exchange for Cuban nickel, biotechnology products, citrus products, and sugar.
