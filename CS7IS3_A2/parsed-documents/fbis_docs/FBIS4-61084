Strictly speaking, we should have gone past that point a long time ago, but the undeveloped nature of market relations, the complex economic situation, and political instability have not permitted us to do this. The first two factors are still in place. As far as the third is concerned, certain positive moves have evidently occurred here. To all appearances, Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet felt sufficiently strong to set about tackling a very unpopular task. In terms of its social and economic consequences, the administration of mass bankruptcies is comparable to the price liberalization in January 1992. The expected "pluses" as regards putting the economy's structure in good order are obvious, but will the possible "minuses" finally sink it? Unfortunately, the market mechanism for bankruptcies is being put into effect using glaringly nonmarket methods. It will not be the market which singles out the "no-hopers," but officials at various levels in accordance with criteria which they themselves have devised. It is proposed, for example, that the basic indicator of insolvency be the so-called liquidity coefficient, which is derived by dividing the sum of financial assets by the sum of short-term credits received by the enterprise. According to figures from the Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics, more than 1,000 Russian enterprises could by this criterion have been deemed to be bankrupt at the beginning of this year. Clearly, those who do not wish to go bankrupt will devise a thousand and one ways of not getting on the "black list." Those who, on the contrary, want to go bankrupt will find this an absolutely simple task: Having acquired and spent credit, they go under the hammer. You can have no doubt that quite a few will wish to do this. In January of this year alone, more than 100 enterprises applied to Russian Federation State Committee for Management of State Property volunteering to be declared bankrupt. In the opinion of legal specialists, they wanted in this way to avoid an even less pleasant court examination involving their creditors. There is in general a danger that energetic behind-the-scenes activities will unfold around the administrative "bankruptcy" procedures, with all the features associated with them from "disinterested" lobbying to bribery and financial machinations. We can expect the same when the question of how to deal with insolvent enterprises is resolved: Should they be made to go bankrupt or should they be given money in order to "rescue" them. As we can see, there is a significant difference, and it will again be an official who decides whether to eliminate or spare them. The paradox lies in the fact that in both cases a lot of money will be required. Private investors are unlikely to step up their involvement here, therefore the basic responsibility for expenditure will again fall on the budgets at all levels. Their "reserves of stability" will clearly determine the rate and scale of the bankruptcy process in a decisive manner. Whatever happens, it is wrong to delay the reorganization of insolvent enterprises, and we do not possess any mechanisms other than administrative ones. The task is to make this process manageable, predictable, efficient, and open, and to reduce social costs to a minimum. Many ministries and departments are working on this at present.
