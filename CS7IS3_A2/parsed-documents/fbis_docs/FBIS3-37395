Speaking in Minsk, he described the situation as compounded and called for political issues to be resolved through dialogue but not pressure or violence. Hryb is sure that the strike was not initiated on the ground but from on high -- "the republican strike committee and opposition People's Front which are in pursuit of their own political goals having nothing to do with the interests of ordinary workers." The strike organizers demand the resignation of the government and dissolution of parliament. The Belarusian leader says the strike "may delay the signing of a monetary union with Russia." He also said that in the emerging situation, "the law enforcement bodies would act "within the legal framework and check any illegal action." For his part, Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich told Interfax that "the strike committee is trying to disorganize the national economy by capitalizing on economic hardships". He described as groundless committee claims of calling for widespread stoppages. The Prime Minister said a large part of the factories came to a standstill for economic reasons long before the strike was called. Interfax correspondents in Minsk say that a crowd of about 2,000 people gathered in front of the Government House in Independence Square at 12:00 Moscow Time, but all approaches to the House itself are blocked by police units. Our correspondents who inspected nearby streets say they found no military hardware there. The police are having to put up with the protesters' violation of the government ban on any mass action, except on state occasions, in Independence Square, a senior police official told Interfax on condition of anonymity. He said the police did not intervene to avoid "fuelling tension." The demonstrators demand the government resign before the parliament convenes on February 22 or face an indefinite strike. The protesters have decided to stage a march to the parliament building to hand in a petition demanding the dissolution of parliament. It is still unclear how many people are involved in the general strike though preliminary reports from the regions say the committee's call failed to drum up widespread support on the ground. In the meantime, messages of support to the strikers have come from independent trade unions of Russia and Ukraine and Russia's independent mineworkers unions, committee spokesman Aleksandr Lysenko told Interfax.
