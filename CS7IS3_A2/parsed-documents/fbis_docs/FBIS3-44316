Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang said it was impossible to hold up the bill. "I was extremely pleased to hear the door to resumed negotiations between the Chinese and the British was not closed," she said. "But I don't think there is any possibility of the Governor withdrawing the first-stage amendment bill." The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said a formal message was sent to Britain last Wednesday saying talks would only be resumed if the bill submitted to the Legislative Council last month was withdrawn. "The door to Sino-British negotiations is open, but it hinges upon the attitude of the British side," said the statement, carried by Xinhua (the New China News Agency). But Mrs Chan said tabling talks was the only way to allow the more controversial aspects of the reforms to be tackled. "We are ready to meet with the Chinese at any time convenient to them, so we can resume talks and arrive at an agreement," she said. Meanwhile, Beijing's new think tank on Hong Kong's political future will discuss this week whether or not there should be new elections for the three tiers of administration after 1997. Local members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) political sub- group said new polls might not be needed, and it was unlikely a PWC meeting in Beijing on Friday and Saturday would reach any conclusions. The news comes days after the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office announced the Legislative Council, the two municipal councils, and the district boards would be "disbanded" and "re- established" after 1997 because of the breakdown in Sino-British talks. But PWC member Xu Ximin said the definition of "re- established" was open to interpretation. "It could mean new elections or some kind of confirmation procedure," he said. Fellow member Professor Lau Siu-kai said the PWC should first discuss whether there would be any form of "through train" for members of the Urban Council, Regional Council and district boards. "If there was a through train for them, then it would reduce political uncertainty and gain the support of district leaders," he said. It is understood that at least four options have already been considered for the future political structure. These include the appointment of a provisional assembly to take office after the change of sovereignty, or a postal ballot to be held before 1997. Maverick lawyer Liu Yiu-chu has proposed the Preparatory Committee for the Special Administrative Region, to be set up in 1996, elect legislators qualified to serve after 1997. "It would not require new elections, respects the choice of the people, and shows the sovereignty of the mother country," she said. But Professor Lau said he thought the most likely option was a three- to six-month recess to allow fresh elections. "Law and order could be maintained under the existing structure," he said. "This would be acceptable to Hong Kong people, and would avoid anyone making use of the legislative vacuum to pass harsh laws, or trying to expel someone from office." Other, more radical, options include either the future chief executive of the Special Administration Region or the National People's Congress taking control of the legislature during the first few months after the handover. Professor Lau said all the options had disadvantages, since they offered the potential for a great deal of interference from Beijing during the period just after China resumes sovereignty.
