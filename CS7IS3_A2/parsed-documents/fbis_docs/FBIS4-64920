In charge of the intelligence service, then? This time Berlusconi concurs: He likes the idea, in fact he likes it a lot. But he adds nothing further and continues posing for the photographer, rapping the candidates who appear in front of the television cameras with their jackets unbuttoned over the knuckles. [LA VOCE] Excuse me, Mr. Berlusconi, but you must at least have a list of names for the Viminale [Interior Ministry] following Di Pietro's refusal? [Berlusconi] What list are you talking about? Difficulties are all I can see. [LA VOCE] So the Viminale still constitutes a great hurdle. [Berlusconi] There are no hurdles. Or, if you like, everything is a hurdle here, because nothing is ever easy. Anyway, the problem for the Viminale is who goes where and who goes somewhere else. [LA VOCE] But have you already got this list of ministers ready? [Berlusconi] Yes, but it all depends how the various pieces fall into place, so I do not know whether I shall be able to tell the head of state tomorrow that I can lift the withholding of the list. We are continuing with our work, but I am in no hurry. In any case, these are matters beyond my control; we must wait and see if the people to whom I shall extend particular invitations in the next few hours will accept them. We must be patient. Anyway, there are no deadlines. The timescale is laid down by the needs of the country and, for my part, the need to succeed. [LA VOCE] But will all your allies feature in this list of ministers? [Berlusconi] All the allies will be represented in the government. [LA VOCE] Will Tremonti, who was voted in under Segni's Pact, be in it as well? [Berlusconi] Only if he puts his past behind him and comes in as a technical minister. [LA VOCE] If you do not go to Scalfaro with the list of ministers tomorrow, will you manage to stand by your undertaking to go before the Senate on Thursday? [Berlusconi] I have my doubts. The schedule is a tight one, and I should also like to avoid the weekend break. [LA VOCE] To get back to the Viminale, is it downhill all the way now or not? [Berlusconi] What road is ever downhill all the way? A downhill stretch is always followed by a climb, and it has always been that way for me, right from the beginning. [LA VOCE] And if you were to put Giuliano Urbani at the Viminale? [Berlusconi] I have always stood by my undertaking not to name names, so I do not want to talk about names.
