FBIS4-23546 "drafr111_e_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-111 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Ex-Interim President on Support for ECOMOG Ex-Interim President on Support for ECOMOG AB0806170094 London BBC World Service in English 0600 GMT 8 Jun 94 AB0806170094 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Network Africa" program] [Text] Well, Dr. Amos Sawyer used to be the interim president of Liberia but last year, when a new peace agreement between the warring factions took effect he had to step down as part of the deal. However, he has remained in the public eye and even continues to attract some controversy. Dr. Sawyer helps to run an organization called the Center for Democratic Empowerment which analyzes political developments in Liberia and helps to find solutions to the problems that may arise, but some people are accusing the organization of setting out to promote ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], the peacekeeping force which is trying to end the fighting in Liberia. Well, Cholo Brooks met Dr. Amos Sawyer in Monrovia and asked him for his response to that accusation. [Begin recording] [Sawyer] Indeed, we have no qualms about promoting ECOMOG here for what ECOMOG is doing and what ECOMOG has done here. Now, we know there are a few warlords that for their own purposes may play down this effort. The fact that Monrovia and the refugee camps combined have perhaps two-thirds of the population of this country is an indication that people are running to ECOMOG-protected areas and there they find some security. [Brooks] Okay, one thing that perhaps worries people or people always think of is that Amos Sawyer was a one-time president of the interim government and at that time he was advocating for lasting peace, and at the same time asking the people to lay down their arms, but still people are still having arms and there has been no progress yet. [Sawyer] We are concerned and saddened by the fact that there is not so much progress with respect to disarmament but you see Liberians have to get deeply involved in this process. We cannot see disarmament as an activity that involves warlords, ECOMOG, and UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia] and the rest of the Liberian society stands aside as spectators. Who are to be disarmed? They are young men but are Liberians. Where have they come from? They have come from our villages, they are part of our families, they have been associated with our schools and our churches and our mosques, and all of these and so the institutional heads and forces of all of these various structures should all bring their influence to bear on the process of disarmament. [Brooks] Okay, back to the center itself. Is your center connected with any international institutions? [Sawyer] We are a new outfit and we intend to go from strength to strength. We intend to begin (?giving) our modest resources, looking at the issues that are at hand here. We have just finished preparing our agenda for Liberia. We are now consulting with colleagues across this continent, largely in West Africa and in some related institutions in Europe and the United States. We are interested in applied research consultancy on these crucial problems of governance and we will seek resources from international sources basically to attack some of these problems and see if we can make some headway. [Brooks] Okay, Dr. Sawyer, as you know there is a deadline with regard to elections in September and your organization is taking part in the coming election. How do you look at the (?date) set for the election to be held here? [Sawyer] Well, first let me make some comments here that we are not going to take part in the election as an institution but we are very much interested in the development of a responsible electorate. We believe that at this stage in the development of Liberia, what we should be trying to come up with during the first postwar elections here is something of a grand convenant where a national convenant will be agreed upon by political parties and leaders so we do not find a "winner-take-all" situation and that we can move smoothly through the first six years of the postwar era with all hands on board attacking the problems of reconciliation and reconstruction.
