He stressed that contacts are under way with parties and independent people in the south to form a government. [Begin recording] [Al-'Attas] By taking this step, we hope to prevent disintegration and to maintain the situation that existed before unity was established on 22 May 1990, that is the existence of two states in Yemen. In light of the bitter experience of unity over the past four years we can examine this experiment and its problems and mistakes and lay down the foundations to make things right. [Question] What is the working program of this government? [Al-'Attas] The main task is first to implement the Pledge and Accord Document which enjoys national consensus in Yemen and which was endorsed after being formulated by various political forces. Within the framework of this task, we must remove the effects of the war which has destroyed numerous establishments and left a great deal of damage in the hearts of the people. We must act to remove these effects. [Question] You have visited the United States, Britain, Egypt, and now Syria, did you gain support from these countries for your stances? [Al-'Attas] Certainly, in all our meetings in the United States, Egypt, and Syria we felt considerable support for the efforts being made in the Democratic Republic of Yemen to halt the war and address the damage, primarily to end this war which is destroying our people and exposing them to the danger of disintegration. [Question] Thus, there is hope for establishing a unified Yemen in the future. What are the foundations on which Yemen must be built? [Al-'Attas] During the national dialogue we emphasized the principle that resorting to war would mean striking at unity. This war that was declared by the military leadership in Sanaa has struck at the Yemeni unity. However, the failure of this unity now does not mean that the goal is gone, or removed from our national tasks. We must assess the situation, pause, and look to the future with optimism. [Question] In Cairo, you requested placing the Yemeni crisis on the UN Security Council agenda. What do you expect from the Security Council? [Al-'Attas] As an international organization responsible for security, stability, and peace in the world, we expect it to take the necessary measures and pass resolutions to halt the bloodshed and the ongoing war. We have great confidence that the Security Council members and the permanent members will make a decision to stop this war. [end recording]
