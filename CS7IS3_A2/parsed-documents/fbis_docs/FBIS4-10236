The senators are hesitant because risks exist in parliament, he explained. He stated, however, that everything will be done to resume activities in the Senate. Let us listen to Senator Firmin Jean-Louis. [Begin recording] [Jean-Louis] Certainly, words were spoken. You have heard Osny Eugene say he is resolutely waiting for us. We have assessed the situation and again hesitate. The senators [words indistinct] safety. Once there is a risk of danger or real danger, we hesitate. The diplomatic lounge is not meant for holding sessions. As you know well, there is a session room. It is not question of meeting once or twice. It is question of running the parliamentary institution, the senatorial institution. There is now a problem -- the occupation of the premises by those elected during the contested 18 January [1993] elections. We make it a point of.... [pauses] We wish to resume work. We wish to resume normal sessions. To do so, we must, of course, have the session room; we must actually control the administration of the institution. [Unidentified journalist] Senator [Yvon] Gislain, a member of your office, has accused you of having done nothing to resume activities. How do you react to his statements? [Jean-Louis] Perhaps, Sen. Gislain (?did not attend) our last meeting. There are a total of 17 senators, including five who are more or less dissident, who now side with the 18 January parliamentarians; five others who peremptorily say they will sit only in the session; and others who might possibly agree to work elsewhere. You know very well that to hold sessions, you need a minimum of 11 [senators], which constitutes our quorum. Until now, it has been (?impossible) to hold sessions in a place other than the session room. If the police would like to give us a hand to convince those elected in the 18 January elections to put an end to their occupation of the premises, we would certainly not say no. [Journalist] There is no formal request? [Jean-Louis] No, not yet. [end recording] That was Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the National Assembly, who was answering questions from a crowd of journalists concerning the situation in the Senate of the Republic. No formal request has been sent to the Haitian police to ensure the safety of parliamentarians if the activities resume in the Senate of the Republic.
