FBIS4-5457 "dreas070_m_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Thailand Government Rejects Charge on Helping Khmer Rouge Government Rejects Charge on Helping Khmer Rouge BK1104142794 Bangkok Voice of Free Asia in Thai 1030 GMT 11 Apr 94 BK1104142794 Bangkok Voice of Free Asia Thai BFN [Text] Thailand rejects a charge that it helped Khmer Rouge leaders to escape. The Thai Government has issued an explanation denying a report that said Thailand helped the Khmer Rouge leaders to escape. The Thai Government, however, does not think the accusation was made by the Cambodian leaders, but rather views it as a misinterpretation by news agencies. Relations between Thailand and Cambodia have been smooth and growing closer. Both countries understand and accept each other's stand concerning its foreign policy. Thailand, especially, has a clear-cut policy of recognition to the elected government of Cambodia, and noninterference in Cambodia's internal affairs. It has abstained from giving support to the Khmer Rouge. This policy has been emphasized by the Thai Government to the Cambodian Government on several occasions. The report accusing Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge leaders to escape was utterly inaccurate. The distortion of facts might come from misunderstanding or misinterpretation by news agencies. It could also be possible that some news agencies wanted to destroy the good relations existing between Thailand and Cambodia. Thailand does not want to see the close relations it has with Cambodia destroyed by just an error of news agencies that occurred regularly and, sometimes, inadvertently. For the sake of mutual understanding and to safeguard the good relations existing between the two countries, should there be any doubts about Thailand, the Cambodian Government is hereby requested to directly address Thailand through diplomatic channels. There is no need to go through a third country since Thailand and Cambodia have several proper channels for contact.
