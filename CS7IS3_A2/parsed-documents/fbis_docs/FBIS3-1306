Reports reaching Dar es Salaam from Kigoma say the soldiers have defied a call by President Ntaryamira to return to barracks, and instead they have been killing innocent civilians and children and burning their houses. The reports said the president is still in Bujumbura and that no government minister was killed in the Army mutiny. In Dar es Salaam, Burundians living in exile in Tanzania have called for an international peacekeeping force to be sent to Burundi to contain the situation.
