Confidence that Near Field Is Adequate In a document entitled ``state of progress on HLW geologic disposal R&D,'' which was issued in July 1993, JAEC judged that R&D had proceeded appropriately and steadily and was adequate at this stage, and listed the following as future topics for geologic disposal R&D: (1) Investigative Research on Geological Environment Conditions a. From the viewpoint of geologic disposal, give further emphasis to geological environment conditions which are important in ensuring long-term safety; and provide more highly reliable data concerning the deep underground region and improve and develop investigative technology and equipment to accomplish this. b. Further investigate and evaluate the effects of natural phenomena on the multiple barrier system. c. Develop evaluation methods and technology for region-specific natural phenomena. d. Study the effects on the geological environment of large-scale human activities. (2) Disposal Technology R&D a. Put emphasis on developing a more reliable artificial barrier.b. Study new materials for overpacking and buffer.c. Carry out large-scale testing of execution methods.d. Improve technologies for comprehensive analysis, investigation and execution of design, construction and operation of the disposal site.e. Conduct tests based on hypothesized situations that are even greater threats to safety and study long-term safety of mine passageways and other cavities. (3) Performance Evaluation Research a. Improve near field performance evaluation and multiple barrier system reliability.b. Improve and develop analytical models and methods and confirm their adequacy; and ensure reliability of data.c. Expand the database.d. Carry out natural analog research. (4) Common Research Topics and Future Procedures a. To achieve more reliable research results, enhance research facilities and equipment and train personnel.b. The deep strata research facility is an important and useful facility that will serve as a common research base.c. Conduct an evaluative study of research policies through the national assessment of PNC's second compilation of research results.d. Activate relevant private sector technological capability and cooperation from various institutions and universities.e. Efficiently promote international cooperation. Future R&D will develop in accordance with the above listed topics and philosophy set forth by JAEC. PNC plans to issue the second compilation before the year 2000. It is to cover crystalline rock and sedimentary rock without specifying regions or rock varieties, with the goal of quantifying near field functions (including quantification of the artificial barrier) and a summary evaluation of far field functions. This is because, as stated in an earlier section, it is clearly important that substantial prevention of movement of nuclides can be expected in the natural barrier that surrounds and is a short distance (several tens of meters) from the artificial barrier. Functions of the near field can be clarified further through the results of laboratory tests and on-site tests. The next section summarizes the tests that will be carried out as part of this. 2. Research Provides Scientific Verification A new research facility for further advancement of geologic disposal R&D has been built at PNC's Tokai Works. This is the ``geologic disposal basic research facility,'' an above-ground facility where research will be conducted on the technological base of geologic disposal, which includes consolidation of the results achieved through PNC's geologic disposal R&D. The following is a summary of the research plan. (1) Research Facility Goals and Features The goal of research at this facility is to focus on the ground water influencing process, one of the variety of hypothetical influencing processes in geologic disposal, and to analyze and evaluate the behavior of the multiple barrier system vis-a-vis ground water. (Photograph 3 [omitted] shows the building exterior.) The facility's features are as follows:a. It is a cold facility that does not use radioactive substances.b. It has atmosphere control equipment.c. Tests ranging from basic tests to large-scale tests can be conducted.d. Various types of phenomena can be simulated. (2) Research Facility Outline The facility is composed of a research building with four floors above ground and a test building with one floor above ground. The research building is equipped with analytical research equipment for computer simulations, etc., and equipment for quantitative analyses. The equipment in the test building can be divided into two main categories. The first can be called equipment to test changes in the near field chemical environment. It is composed of two testing devices that collect data on chemical action in the ground water and artificial barrier under conditions in the deep underground environment. The other can be called equipment to test near field composite phenomena. It is composed of four testing devices that are used to conduct research on ground water flow under conditions in the deep underground environment and research on composite phenomena of simultaneous action of ground pressure and heat from the waste. (Photograph 4 [omitted] and Table 9 are summaries of the test equipment.)

As the central facility for strata R&D in the future, substantial results are expected. 3. Accumulation of Deep Strata Data PNC is conducting a variety of tests, using existing cavities, to accumulate data on deep strata. The following are the primary goals:a. Acquire data concerning the geological characteristics of the deep underground region.b. Gain understanding of deep underground region phenomena and establish methods for creating models for these phenomena.c. Improve and establish survey testing technology (survey testing methods, survey measuring equipment, etc.). At this point, we will introduce the content of the strata scientific research being conducted by PNC at a mine in Kamaishi and the Chubu Works. 3.1 On-Site Testing at Kamaishi Mine On-site testing at the mine in Kamaishi is being conducted on the Kurihashi granodiorite fissured base rock, mainly using a 250 m level passageway (600 m below ground level), to gain an understanding of geological features and depth dependency of phenomena, to get a detailed grasp of the characteristics and mechanism of formation of the so-called slack zone around the passageway, and to confirm the appropriateness of existing survey technology. With the above as the focus, the research is being carried out on the five items described below. (1) Understanding Dynamic, Hydraulic, Geochemical Features and Geological Structure of Base Rock in Deep Region Gain an understanding of deep region geological features in crystalline rock and acquire the following basic information concerning the conditions of the test site that are required in order to analyze the results from carrying out (2) through (5) below: (a) geological structure surrounding the on-site testing location (Photograph 5 [omitted]); (b) by-depth dynamic characteristics of deep region base rock; (c) by-depth hydraulic characteristics and geochemical characteristics of deep region base rock, and changes in these characteristics over time. (2) Evaluation of Region Affected by Excavation in Deep Region Base Rock Create a model of the excavation effect mechanism and gain an understanding of the three-dimensional distribution of the region affected by boring a new passageway and measuring and assessing its effect (slack zone) on the base rock. (3) Research Concerning Hydraulic/Substance Movement in Single Fracture in Crystalline Rock Proceed with research on the following items to understand the retardation of substance movement in a single fracture, the basic unit of the movement path. This is the first thing that needs to be understood to evaluate substance movement in crystalline rock. - Establish geological and geochemical investigative methods to understand substance movement in fractures. - Understand substance movement retardation in fractures through laboratory and on-site testing. - Confirm adequacy of existing models as regards substance movement in fractures. To evaluate substance movement by ground water in crystalline rock, it is also important to understand substance movement characteristics that prescribe dispersion and transport by water, such as fissure structure and porosity of the fissured medium. Conducting hydraulic tests and non-adsorptiveness tracer tests on a rock formation of a fixed scale at the Kamaishi on-site test location will provide an understanding of substance movement characteristics, such as fissure structure and porosity of the fissured medium, of the site of the substance movement by ground water. (4) Artificial Barrier Testing a. Testing of application of grouting technology on the fracture zone: To contribute to the assessment of stability and waterproofing effect of clay-based grout, clarify the long-term stability of grout and the relationship between width and other characteristics of fissure shape and processing conditions (injection pressure, viscosity) on the one hand and grout stability, waterproofing effect and depth of grout immersion on the other. b. Testing of clay filling in base rock: Gain knowledge on the following items to contribute to understanding bentonite swelling, change in water content and heterogeneity due to penetration by ground water through fractures in the on-site base rock: - Heat conductivity of clay and base rock. - Effect of pressure from clay swelling on surrounding base rock. (5) Earthquake Testing and Research Observe earthquake motion in the Kamaishi mine to accumulate knowledge concerning diminution of earthquake motion underground, and along with this, develop methods to create a model to simulate earthquake motion. Through model analysis, predict the behavior of underground cavities during earthquakes and assess their aseismatic capacity. Monitor hydraulic characteristics and changes in water quality during earthquakes and apply this to prediction of changes in hydraulic conditions and geochemical environment. The four items below are the specific goals: a. Generalize and create formulas for rate of diminution underground of earthquake motionb. Build optimum model that simulates earthquake motion in deep underground regionsc. Confirm through simulation the stability of underground cavities during earthquakesd. Confirm whether earthquakes cause changes in underground water pressure, quality or amount of gushing, and study the change mechanisms. 3.2 Chubu Works Investigative testing and research at the Chubu Works is being conducted in the Tono uranium mine and the surrounding region. This region is composed of sedimentary rock covering granite rock. Research on the four items given below will be conducted in two phases (first phase: through FY96; second phase: FY97-2003). (1) Base Rock Dynamic, Heat Characteristics Research The goal of this research is to study heterogeneous sedimentary base rock and grasp the dynamic characteristics of this base rock between the surface and the deep regions, and to establish methods to quantify and evaluate the effects of excavation and long-term reaction to it. The first phase will consist of the following: (a) Using a survey passageway in the Tono mine, study mechanical and smooth blasting excavation methods and the difference in their effects. (b) In the survey passageway, conduct tests on the effects of excavation, consisting of excavating a passage that intersects a fault, and study the effects of a large-scale, non-continuous surface. (c) Develop survey methods that can quantify the physical properties of base rock within a slack zone. (d) Observe long-term displacement in base rock and acquire data necessary to grasp long-term base rock behavior. (e) Study the applicability of existing analytical methods. The second phase will consist of the following: (a) Based on the measurements acquired in the first phase, conduct base rock behavior analysis and create a model; and modify and improve analytical methods. (b) Validate these modeling and analytical methods by application to different base rock conditions. (c) Based on long-term observation data accumulated in the first phase, modify models for long-term behavior prediction. (2) Research on Flow of Ground Water in Deep Underground Region The goal of this research is to develop rational investigative technologies and evaluation methods to apply to the hydraulic environment between the surface and the deep underground region of a given location. In the area surrounding the Tono mine, the following will be carried out: (a) Conduct hydraulic surveys in surface strata, mid-strata (sedimentary rock) and deep strata (granite bedrock); and ground water flow analysis based on the results of these surveys. (b) Verify ground water flow model for this region. (c) Develop ground water survey equipment usable at a depth of 1,000 meters, which is needed to investigate the characteristics of deep region ground water (Photograph 6 [omitted]). (d) Optimize the hydraulic survey and analysis system and define the scope of evaluation. (e) Establish technology for rational investigation of hydraulic characteristics between the ground surface and deep regions, over a broad area. (3) Research on Geochemical Characteristics of Ground Water in Deep Region The goal of this research is to grasp the geochemical characteristics of ground water in the deep region and water formation mechanisms, and to establish geochemical models for prediction and evaluation of future changes. In the first phase, a 8km x 7km area will be used to (a) grasp the geochemical characteristics of ground water and analyze its formation mechanism; and (b) develop investigative technologies and equipment for geochemical model building and establish evaluation methods. (4) Research on Substance Movement and Settlement in Geological Environment The goal of this research is to grasp the mechanisms of substance movement and settlement in the geological environment, establish substance movement models for grasping future changes, and establish technologies for rational investigation of substance movement and settlement in the geological environment. In the first phase, laboratory and on-site testing will be used to grasp the characteristics of the microscopic (mineral scale to outcrop scale) geological medium (path of movement) that regulate substance movement and the mechanism and process of substance settlement. Investigation of geological medium characteristics (movement path) will include (a) extraction of composition and structure of rock that could be the movement path in sedimentary rock; (b) building of conceptual model for movement path in the microscopic scale; and (c) grasping of matrix diffusion and other mechanisms of movement and settlement, or settlement alone. To accomplish this, substance movement testing under atmospheric control will be conducted to (a) grasp the behavior of substances at the border between solid and liquid, (b) reveal substance sorption and settlement mechanisms, and (c) carry out sorption/desorption tests using natural rack and ground water. Based on results from these tests, (a) a model of the structure of the movement path and a model of chemical reactions on the path will be built and (b) to validate these models, the distribution of uranium and uranium series nuclides in the geological environment will be inspected and analyzed. In the second phase, the following will be carried out: (a) Comprehensive evaluation of the mechanisms of substance movement and settlement in the macroscopic (ore deposit scale) geological environment; and (b) provision and analysis of historical data (concerning geographical and hydraulic changes in the past) and ore deposit science data in order to verify macroscopic substance movement and settlement mechanisms. 4. International Cooperation Various forms of research have been conducted in other countries concerning the effectiveness of the multiple barrier system in geologic disposal, and they include some in which Japan has participated as joint international undertakings. International cooperation is important for (a) sharing of the principle of safety, (b) improving the reliability of technology and evaluation methods, and (c) efficient use of facilities and increasing of data. Here we will present a summary of the contents of international co-research concerning HLW geologic disposal and underground strata science and technology, which PNC is carrying out at present. (1) United States From 1993 to 1996, under a technical cooperation agreement with the Department of Energy (DOE), PNC and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) are developing a model for substance movement in heterogeneous media that takes into consideration effect of scale and fault structure, with the goal of a composite revelation of radionuclide movement in underground strata. (2) Canada Since 1986, at the Whiteshell [phonetic spelling] underground research facility of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), PNC has been conducting on-site tracer tests using multiple sample gimlet holes, with the goal of developing and establishing methods for investigation and analysis of hydraulic and nuclide movement characteristics covering the shatter zone in crystalline rock. (3) Switzerland Since 1989, joint on-site testing is being carried out at the Grimzel [phonetic spelling] base rock research center of the radioactive waste disposal national cooperative (NAGRA) with the goal of revealing the hydraulics of ground water in a single fissure in crystalline rock, and developing methods for evaluation of radionuclide movement and developing a nuclide movement model. The results of this research will be reflected in verification of the Japanese model and on-site testing of crystalline rock in Japan. Also, in view of the geologic disposal concept shared by Japan and Switzerland, the two countries are exchanging information and are evaluating each other's research. (4) Sweden From 1991 to 1994, PNC is participating in a project at the underground research facility (HRL) of Sweden's nuclear fuel waste control company (SKB), and has carried out a variety of on-site testing of crystalline rock. The goal of the project is to develop technology to grasp with precision the geologic environment of the deep underground region, which will be the geologic disposal site, and develop methods to predict changes to the geological environment caused by excavation. Along with construction of the underground research facility, whose main feature is a slanting shaft extending from the surface to 500 meters underground, the on-site testing will be carried out in stages in each area --geological, ground water hydraulic and ground water geochemical tests -- with the goal of developing and establishing methods to grasp (predict) the geological environment through a repetition of the process of: Prediction -assessment of predicted results - method modification. (5) France Since 1991, PNC has been participating in information exchange and joint research, mainly on the theme of the geochemistry of radionuclides, at the Fontenay-au-Rose [phonetic spelling] research institute of the Atomic Energy Agency of France (CEA). (6) Great Britain Since 1993, PNC has been conducting joint research with AEA Technology (AEA), focusing on development and modification of a database on thermodynamics and acquisition of data concerning adsorption mechanisms at the Harwell [phonetic spelling] Research Institute, and information exchange. (7) OECD/NEA and Other Joint International Projects Thus far, PNC has participated in a project at Sweden's Stripa [phonetic spelling] mine with the goal of developing geological environment evaluation technology and methods, verifying the applicability of ground water flowpath hermetic sealing technology and other disposal technologies, and conducting comparative studies of ground water flow assessment models; and in the alligator river analog project, which was implemented in Australia's Kungalaulan [phonetic spelling] ore deposit with the goal of elucidating the mechanisms of nuclide behavior in a geological environment. PNC also is participating in INTRAVAL, with the goal of validating nuclide movement models, and in DECOVALEX (secretariat run by SKI of Sweden), with the goal of developing and validating a heat-water-stress compound model. Hereafter, for the reasons given earlier, it will become increasingly important for Japan to take a leadership role in international cooperation projects.
