The United States and Russia will be better at finding a peaceful solution than the EU's [European Union] negotiator, Lord Owen, Bosnian Muslim Vice President Ejup Ganic told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. The Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government considers the recent Geneva peace conference chaired by EU mediator Lord David Owen and his UN counterpart, Thorvald Stoltenberg, to be concluded. The United States and Russian have now taken over the initiative to find a broad peaceful solution to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and this is giving rise to optimism in Sarajevo. So said Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic in an interview with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. Ejup Ganic is chiefly happy that Lord Owen is no longer at the center of the negotiations. The Bosnian Government has tried several times in vain to have Lord Owen, whom they accuse of being responsible for the deterioration in the situation of the country's Muslims, removed. Lord Owen's biggest mistake, Ejup Ganic said, is that from the start he has accepted that the Bosnian Serbs should have territorial gains from their military conquests. It has not been possible anywhere in the world to create a stable peace by rewarding the aggressor. Why should Bosnia be an exception? said the vice president, who takes the view that the EU-UN negotiations in Geneva were set up for academic reasons. "Lord Owen has made a mess of everything by not having a clear agenda," said Ejup Ganic, who unlike several Bosnian Muslim leaders does not fear that Russia's active role both diplomatically and through the deployment of Russian soldiers in the Bosnian Serb-controlled areas could freeze the current military frontiers. "Of course there is a strange feeling around. I grew up with news reports that now Russia has invaded Hungary, now they have invaded Czechoslovakia, and now Afghanistan. Every time Russia has come into the picture we have been used to seeing them as an invading power. But now they are here under the UN umbrella and under General Rose's command which will try to mix them with soldiers from other countries. When the Russian soldiers arrived, there were quite a few who did not behave particularly well (by celebrating with the Serbs -- editorial note). But I am satisfied with the official Russian statements. "We could have refused the Russian soldiers access for the same reason that the United Nations rejected offers from Turkey, Pakistan, and Iran, because those countries would have taken sides in the war. But we accept the Russian soldiers who will perhaps support that element in Russian diplomacy which is trying to wrest the initiative away from Vladimir Zhirnovskiy's wing in Russia," Ejup Ganic said. Ejup Ganic is happy about the past week's cease-fire in Sarajevo, but gave me constant reminders that the capital is still besieged and divided militarily. "The killing of civilians has been drastically reduced because the artillery and the tanks in the mountains were used primarily to kill civilians. Our fronts are only 50 meters from each other and therefore the Serbs' artillery has not been particularly effective against our infantry, but it has been effective against the civilian population. That is why we are now seeing a clear reduction in the bombardment. But the city is still under siege and all the other conditions are still the same. In the next few days we will see what further steps we can take to break the siege and turn Sarajevo into an open city." Vice President Ganic, who earlier in the war was viewed as one of the most pessimistic and uncompromising figures in the Bosnian Muslim leadership, views the events of recent weeks in Sarajevo as a turning point in the war. "This has had a decisive psychological effect on the Serbian regime. They hade become absolutely certain that concrete steps would not be taken against them by the international community. They were 100 percent sure that the jets flying over them were only a show. For eight days they ignored NATO's ultimatum. But now I believe that they know that they have to negotiate. They are still trying to create confusion, but they did nevertheless move out of the mountains," Ejup Ganic said. However, the Bosnian Muslims' optimism is still guarded and contains a large portion of bitterness toward the international community. When Ganic, as NATO's jets thunder through the air above Sarajevo's presidential palace, began to discuss the background, he tried to overcome the noise with his own thunderous words: "NATO only needed to produce a single piece of paper which contained an ultimatum to the besieging Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms from the mountains around Sarajevo. If they had produced this little piece of typewritten paper earlier we would not today have 1,000 new graves in Sarajevo. "The lesson for NATO and the United Nations is that they must stop writing all these declarations which no one understands. Make public something that is crystal clear. Something that has a clearly defined beginning and end. Something that has a clear deadline and a description of concrete actions which will be set in motion at a specified time and with specified means. Past declarations have been watered-down nonsense," said Ejup Ganic, who despite all the war's murders and destruction still believes that there is a possibility of creating a multiethnic Bosnia-Herzegovina. "We must begin from within and try to recreate what we had. In the area controlled by Karadzic's forces 50 percent of Serbs have also fled. No one is asking them what sort of Bosnia they want. They are Bosnians. They will not suddenly be able to feel themselves to be something else. People from all groups in the population are in Croatia, Serbia, or in Western Europe. They have now gotten to know what a refugee's existence means. One day they will wake up and think about the blessings they had in Bosnia, and they will travel home and help in the rebuilding of their homeland. A partition of the country is unnatural. We have to heal ourselves after this tragedy. First people will have to learn to greet each other again. A year later they will perhaps be able to drink coffee together and the younger generation will be able to play sports together. "The key point for the recreation of the multiethnic Bosnia is that those who are guilty of war crimes are punished. When this happens everyone who has lost a son or a daughter will be able to see who the guilty ones are, who gave the orders, and who carried them out. Those left behind will then perhaps be able to feel some relief," the Bosnian vice president said.
