"The Committee for the Control of Sensitive Exports and Weapons has never permitted the sale of weapons to the countries of the former Yugoslavia based on the fact that Argentina strictly respects the UN resolution that prohibits such activities," states the communique from the Argentine Embassy in Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). To avoid the spread of war in the Balkans, the United Nations prohibited, in September 1991, the sale of weapons to the parties at war. However, during the eight months of the war in Croatia and the 22 months of confrontations in Bosnia, the Croatian forces and the Bosnian Muslims have clandestinely obtained weapons to fight against the powerful Army of Yugoslavia, a country which is currently made up of the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro, and which inherited the military arsenal from the government of Belgrade when the Republic of Yugoslavia was dismembered. The Argentine Embassy note refers to a commentary by U.S. military expert Paul Beaver transmitted by the U.S. radio station which included Argentina in a list of countries that supplied weapons to the Muslim forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina, openly violating the embargo imposed by the United Nations to prevent the worsening of the Balkan conflict.
