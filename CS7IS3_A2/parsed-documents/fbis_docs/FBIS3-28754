"Today, the partnership spirit has become the new pattern of the North-South cooperation," said the head of state when receiving 21 representatives of NAM members here on Thursday. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas quoted President Suharto as saying that the North-South cooperation should be implemented on the basis of mutual interest and inter-dependency spirit. The president said that some resolutions and agreements reached by NAM members at the Jakarta's 10th NAM summit 17 months ago in the sectors of debt management, population, food etc have been implemented. Suharto said he had discussed with leaders of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries debt burden issues involving 50 NAM members, 18 of which are classified as the poorest countries with the slowest GNP. The G-7 groups the US, Japan, Britain, Canada, Germany, France and Italy. The leaders of the G-7 have admitted the important roles played by the 108-member movement in settling the debt burden, Alatas quoted President Suharto as saying. Stating that the NAM will always strive to put more emphasis on such an economic issue, the head of state said that Indonesia is ready to share its experiences with other members in managing the debt. "We made an effort to soften the debt burden faced by countries having the lowest revenue. It could be the re-scheduling of the debt payment," he added. On the Bosnian issue, the head of state has expressed his strong support for the establishment of an international conference on Bosnia. For this aims, the chairman of the NAM will give inputs to the NAM coordinating bureau in the U.N. to follow up their planned international conference. Minister Alatas said that he could understand if there are some groups of people who have expressed dissatisfaction towards Indonesia's inability to send its troops to Bosnia. He said that the sending of the troops would never settle the problem. "It would only be worsening the condition," he said, adding that the key to the settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue is to implement the U.N resolutions and abide by the international law. Alatas strongly asked the Serbian and Croatian forces to stop the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying "If necessary, the U.N may use the arms force to stop it."
