FBIS4-1324 "drafr080_cs94022" FBIS-AFR-94-080-S Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Mandela Urges Everyone To Vote in Elections Mandela Urges Everyone To Vote in Elections MB2604094194 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0859 GMT 26 Apr 94 MB2604094194 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Statement issued by the African National Congress on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 26 April] [Text] I address this message to all South Africans. Today is a day like no other before it. Voting in our first free and fair election has begun. Today marks the dawn of our freedom. As we travelled around every part of the country we saw your misery. We shared your hopes and dreams. Now your day has come, because this election is about you. It is your election. It is your vote that counts. Years of imprisonment could not stamp out our determination to be free. Years of intimidation and violence could not stop us. And we will not be stopped now. You hold the future in your hands. And now is the time to rise to the challenge. Standing together, let us send a message loud and clear: We will not let a handful of killers steal our democracy. Our surest way to stop them, and to bring peace, is to cast our vote. Let us vote in such overwhelming numbers that we show everyone how much we love our country, how much we love our people, how much we love peace, how much we love life itself. We will show the world that we are determined to stand up against the violence, determined to vote for a better life for all. Every South African knows: Now is the time. Sekunjalo ["Now is the time" in Zulu]. Ke nako ["Now is the time" in Sotho].
