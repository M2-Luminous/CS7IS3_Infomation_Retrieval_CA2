To secure its latest loan, it had to sign over to a syndicate of foreign banks led by the Union Bank of Switzerland first rights to government revenue from major resource projects. Here is Sean Dorney. [Begin recording] [Dorney] PNG has received something of a jolt from the international commercial banking community. In its first attempt in a number of years to borrow from non-concessional sources overseas, it has found the banks reluctant and skeptical about its financial management. The PNG Government was looking to borrow US$160 million that it wanted to repay over five years. But, after 12 months of tough negotiations, it could get only US$90 million to be paid back over three years and it had to give the banking syndicate led by the Union Bank of Switzerland rights to first call over its revenues from its mining and oil projects. They'll be paid into a bank account in London and if PNG defaults the banks take the revenue. The resource revenues in taxes and dividends are paid into what is called the mineral resources stabilization fund. And the finance minister, Masket Iangalio, had to push an amendment bill through the PNG parliament last week to allow payment into the fund to go to London, not to the Bank of PNG. The fund was set up in the 1970s to help PNG cope with wide fluctuations in revenue resulting from sharp movements in the world's prices of copper and gold. PNG's former prime minister, Rabbie Namaliu, is aghast at the bank's demand. [Namaliu] What concerns me and the opposition very much is the fact that this is the first time ever in our history since independence that we have been asked to mortgage national assets to foreign banks in order for us to obtain commercial loan. And that's really worrying because not even our grit [as heard] has been accepted by commercial banks, and, in fact, before we could go and borrow commercially without problems and risk because, basically because, the international financial community still had a great deal of confidence in this country. [Dorney] Mr. Namaliu claims that confidence has been wrecked by the Wingti government's policies of the past three years including such moves as renegotiating the Pago gold mine agreement. The finance minister, Mr. Iangalio, admits he is disappointed by the terms demanded by the foreign banks. [end recording]
