Lu Ping, deputy director and secretary-general of the preliminary working committee for the Preparatory Committee for Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said this during a meeting between the Chinese mainland members at the committee and Hong Kong deputies to the Chinese National People's Congress and local members of the national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Lu said his committee will take into full consideration opinions from all walks of life in Hong Kong in order to ensure a smooth transfer of power in 1997. He stated that China originally hoped to solve the "through train" for the last Legislative Council in the territory, but the British side closed the door of cooperation. Thus, the Sino-British talks on arrangements for the 1994/95 elections broke down and there would be no "through train", Lu said. "But Governor Chris Patten does not believe there would be no through train. So I sincerely hope he would not cherish any illusion on that," Lu said. By July 1, 1997, he continued, the first SAR Legislative Council will be produced in the territory according to the Basic Law and relevant regulations of the Chinese National People's Congress. At that time, all members of the last Legislative Council should step down the "train" and this is definite, Lu added. He noted that his committee will listen to various opinions on formation of the first SAR Legislative Council and of the district boards and ensure a smooth transition.
