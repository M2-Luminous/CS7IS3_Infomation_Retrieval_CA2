[Shams-al-Din] The Islamic Republic of Iran is one of the greater governments of the region and is capable of becoming even greater, in view of its population and geographical base. There is no doubt that a political role is of foremost importance. We are confronting problems that we should be prepared to understand so that the region may not experience negative developments. We are aware that the region has entered a phase that is being characterized by peace operations in the Middle East and in the world. As I have said frequently, most of the Arab systems have not entered this phase willingly. The Islamic Republic of Iran has not entered this phase and has declared its dissatisfaction with what has occurred ideologically and politically in the wake of the peace operations. Even though the Zionist entity is a regional phenomenon, it is an unlawful one. If circumstances were to move toward what is known as peace talks, the region would be engulfed in conflicting political ideologies. One of these believes in compromise and abiding by the results of these talks and the other rejects compromise and its results; the last one is mostly prevalent in the Arab world. This is because the Islamic movements in the Arab world and in part of the non-Arab world contribute to this view and prefer this stance. The current phase that is taking shape is placing heavy responsibility on the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Arab systems. We believe that the Islamic Republic of Iran is necessary for the Arab world and vice versa. Therefore, a proper policy should be formulated for an appropriate approach by the Islamic Republic of Iran toward the realities present in the Arab systems. The latter should also have a more suitable attitude toward the stance chosen by the Islamic Republic of Iran--which should not be construed as inevitable--regarding the developments in the Middle East. The stance adopted by Iran is its own choice and is not an unavoidable necessity as Iran can adapt to events. However, Iran has adopted the harder approach. At this stage, all of us should move toward coexistence to attain mutual understanding. If we were able to do so, it would be a major achievement. The Iranian stance should be coordinated with Arab needs and vice versa so that it can assume a more suitable form. Without this equilibrium, an erratic and inappropriate trend will be generated on which the Zionists and the West will capitalize. They will be able to exploit the Arabs even more and will acquire more power to strengthen the embargo against the Islamic Republic of Iran. [passage omitted]. I should emphasize that if God grants us success so that we are able to achieve conformity between the stances of the Arabs and the Islamic Republic of Iran, it will give Iran ample opportunity to share in the security of the region and to safeguard its own security. This will also enable it to minimize the siege that the West is seeking to impose on it. However, if this reciprocal understanding is not achieved, I cannot express what ill-omened consequences it will have on the security of the Islamic Republic of Iran and on some Arab governments. We can also view the economic impact within this perspective. If the policies of the two sides are harmonized and yield results, the neighboring and non-neighboring countries will provide a suitable market for Iran and the Iranian market will probably be beneficial for them. This will generate reciprocal economic growth for Iran and the Arab governments. On this basis, we tell the Arabs that economic cooperation with Iran can be one of the most important instruments of resistance in the face of Zionist collusion. Iran is capable of preventing the imminent compromise from happening, as was the case at the time of the Islamic Revolution when Iran created an equilibrium in the region. We are hoping for the glad tidings resulting from the closeness between the Islamic Republic of Iran and some of the Arab governments, such as the monarchies of Morocco and Jordan as well as the Kuwaiti Government. We are optimistic that this scope will expand and that all the Arab countries will join this trend without exception; we have made efforts toward this end in the past. Regardless of who initiates this trend, it is hoped that both sides will adopt a positive approach toward it. I do not see any other means of promoting mutual relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Arab world. [ETTELA'AT] In view of the political, economic, and security developments in the Middle East, what difficulties do you foresee for Islamism and what avenues do you perceive for its future growth? [Shams-al-Din] The most important issue for the Arab and non- Arab Muslims, after that of the Zionist regime, is the Islamic movement. This movement is a manifestation of the spirit of the ummah, which is a source of strength and power and exists among all Islamic nations. Iran is an exception among the Islamic movements as it was victorious, and today it is formulating its own policies. I can openly assert that whatever goes on outside Iran has a spiritual link to Iran. [passage omitted] At its outset, the Islamist movement in Algeria mobilized all its resources in the elections, which was a mistake. It would have been better if it had not projected itself as the foremost force in Algeria, and as we mentioned to some of its prominent figures, it should have appeared on the scene gradually so that the Algerian system would not have risen in confrontation. On the other hand, society was not ready to accept what the Islamist movement represented, as such a plan needs time in a society such as that of Algeria. It was not the kind of society in which the Islamic experiment could be implemented immediately. It is necessary to ponder two topics: One is that only non- Islamic governments are against the Islamic movement. In fact, some of the nations who are not totally ready for this plan are on our side. Our nations are Muslim, and even though the experiment of a Western-style government has proved unsuccessful for them, this does not mean that they are ready to accept the Islamic experiment in view of their current obligations. The other point is that the Islamic movement, with the exception of Iran, incorporates a political plan and needs the guarantee of a political democracy. It is possible that this could be in the form of a real council and not a pyramid-type structure. After the Persian Gulf war, we proposed that an open, frank, and realistic debate on the negative effects of the organizational structure and existing trends in the strategy of the Islamic movements be conducted. This is because the Persian Gulf crisis underlined the deep problems that exist in the larger Islamic movement groups. We perceived that most of these problems resulted from the actions of Saddam Husayn, who had projected himself as an imam Khomeyni to the world. He tried to adopt the imam Khomeyni way of speaking and an approach used by Gamal 'Abd-al-Nasir. There were many who were deceived by Saddam's slogans, and this caused a disruption in the relations between governments and nations with the Islamic movements. [passage omitted] [ETTELA'AT] What is your appraisal of the present and future situation in Lebanon in the economic, political, and cultural areas? [Shams-al-Din] At present all of us are waiting to see how events shape up. Some describe this period as a formative one or one of peace resulting from certain developments that are in the throes of materializing in the Middle East. In this environment, Lebanon is an area that is bound to be affected by regional developments, depending on the extent of its involvement in these events. In light of the nature of its domestic system, it is endowed with more brilliant and numerous factors for recovery than other Arab countries. Lebanon does not require internal economic changes, as it was the founder of a free economy in the region and has enjoyed greater democracy than other Arab countries. Another factor that ensures Lebanon's future is the variety provided by the presence of Christian and Muslim elements in its society. These are factors that lend it a distinctiveness compared to other Arab societies. If a plan to set up a system in the Middle East region or a proposal for a regional accord fails, Lebanon has resources to detach itself from this climate or to minimize the negative effects. I believe that, despite the presence of a state of political flux and a political crisis situation, Lebanon has put the dangerous stage behind it. The conditions are not as bright as the Lebanese Government projects, but the current situation will not continue and the economic conditions will improve. I would not describe it as brilliant but I believe that in the next year we will witness better conditions in the Lebanese economy. [passage omitted]
