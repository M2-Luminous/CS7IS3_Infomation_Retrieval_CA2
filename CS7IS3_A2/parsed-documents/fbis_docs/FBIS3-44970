Ren Jianxin, member of the secretariat and secretary of the Central Commission on Politics and Law of the CPC Central Committee, pointed out during the meeting: The major tasks of the politics and law front in 1994 are to implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; adhere to the strategic principle of "building both material and spiritual civilizations and attach equal importance to both"; meet the demands of establishing a socialist market economy; improve and reform the work of politics and the law; strengthen the functions of the people's democratic dictatorship; strike resolute blows at hostile forces and crime; step up the investigation and handling of major cases during the anti-corruption struggle; make great, comprehensive efforts to improve public order; provide more effective legal protection to socialist market economy; and take a further step toward maintaining political and social stability. Luo Gan, state councillor and deputy secretary of the Central Commission on Politics and Law, presided over the meeting and conveyed to it the important instruction on improving the work of politics and the law issued recently by the Central Political Bureau Standing Committee. Present at the meeting were nearly 200 responsible people from various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, the People's Liberation Army, and departments concerned. Ren Jianxin said in his speech: The "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, is China's general plan for establishing a socialist market economic structure. It is our economic restructuring action program, as well as work guidance for our politics and law front. He pointed out: It is necessary to further mobilize the force of the whole of society and pay attention to implementing measures for comprehensive management of public security in the new circumstances. He said: In the new circumstances in which we are establishing a socialist market economic structure, the comprehensive management of public security must be further strengthened, not weakened even a bit. We should continue to adhere to the principle of integrating special projects with the mass line, mobilize more thoroughly forces in all quarters of society to work on projects together at the grass-roots level, and implement the measures for comprehensive management of public security at the grass-roots level. We should seriously study the new situation and new problems at work, overcome difficulties and resistance, actively explore, and forge ahead. Ren Jianxin fully affirmed the efforts made by the politics and law front in cracking down on crime, maintaining stability, and promoting reform, opening up, and economic construction over the past year. After analyzing the current situation at home and abroad, Ren Jianxin said: Next year will be a very important and extremely crucial one for deepening reform and the tasks of maintaining stability will be heavier and more urgent. Following the continuous deepening of reform and the adjustment of the relationship of interests, some new contradictions and problems are bound to crop up. We must keep a clear head, correctly analyze and size up the situation, be prepared for danger in times of peace, and meticulously do a solid job of maintaining social and political stability in order that we may ensure the smooth development of a socialist market economy. Ren Jianxin said: We must have a correct understanding of the dialectical relationship of mutual promotion and mutual integration among reform, opening up, economic development, and social stability. It is definitely necessary for party and government leaders at all levels to persist in the strategic principle -- "attach equal importance to promoting reform and opening up and to cracking down on all sorts of criminal activity, and take a tough stand on both types of work" -- at meetings, in documents, and, above all, in action. While working successfully to implement reform and promote development, they must conscientiously do a good job of building spiritual civilization, improving the work of the ideological and cultural fronts, and shouldering the political responsibility of maintaining stability in a down-to-earth manner. Ren Jianxin stressed: We must correctly and properly handle the contradictions among the people under the new situation and enhance our capability of dealing with every contingency. Party and government leaders at all levels must earnestly study the characteristics of contradiction among the people under the new situation as well as their forms of manifestation, the conditions leading to their escalation, preventive measures, and the methods to deal with them; they must spend time immersing themselves in the masses to resolve contradictions, actively prevent their escalation, and solve problems at the level of grass roots units in a timely manner before they become too big. Ren Jianxin called on the politics and law front to take an active part in the anticorruption struggle and to concentrate efforts on investigating and dealing with such big and important cases of economic crime as corruption, bribery, and so on. He said: As the politics and law departments undertake an important task in the anticorruption struggle, they must not fail to accomplish their mission and must live up to the expectations of the people. It is necessary for party committees at all levels and their politics and law commissions to strengthen leadership in a down-to-earth manner, directly supervise the handling of big and important cases, and support the politics and law departments in breaking through various resistance, eliminating all interference, and strictly enforcing the law. In compliance with party discipline and national laws, they must mete out stern punishment to those who stand in the way of the handling cases and harbor corrupt elements. Ren Jianxin pointed out: In a sense, there are more problems concerning the management of public security now than those in the period before the "harsh crackdown" drive was launched in 1993. Politics and law departments must resolutely correct the problem caused by the ineffective crackdown, conscientiously raise the level of the "harsh crackdown," and improve its results so as to provide an environment in which the masses of the people can live and work in peace and contentment. The "harsh crackdown" in 1994 must focus on "cracking big cases, dealing gangsters a blow, and chasing escaped criminals." Directed against problems that stand out, strong and effective measures must be taken to organize a concentrated crackdown or special struggle to check the momentum of a sharp increase in the number of big and abominable cases. In addition, Ren Jianxin also expressed his views on the issues of accelerating reform of politics and law work, improving the discipline and work style of the political and legal contingents, and strengthening and improving the party's leadership over the politics and law work.
