In an article today entitled "The New Iraqi Move...the Timing and the Response," the paper says: A policy of isolation, oppression, and inflicting harm does not befit the relations that should prevail among states. Peace and justice alone befit good neighborliness, understanding, the exchange of legitimate interests, and an open ear to all viewpoints without exception. The paper adds: The new Iraqi move stems from clear realities whose starting point is the fact that Iraq has fulfilled its commitments and its political and procedural pledges regarding the Security Council resolutions. This was documented in the recent Security Council deliberations. The paper explains that while reminding the Arab brethren and foreign friends of the division in the Security Council, Iraq is looking forward to the political conduct that the United Nations should adopt in harmony with its goals stipulated in the second article of the UN Charter and also in harmony with the world declaration on human rights, especially since this blockade has inflicted grave damage on the Iraqi people. AL-THAWRAH adds that the blockade has caused many tragedies and a great deal of grief for the Iraqi people, which can under no circumstances be acceptable and which can only be interpreted as seeking to inflict deliberate harm. The paper emphasizes that the blockade has inflicted grave damage on the Iraqi people, and that international will should rise against this situation if it actually respects its own credibility and if it really honors the principles of justice and fairness it is seeking. Otherwise, remaining silent on what happened will only be regarded as encroachment on this credibility and a flagrant violation of these principles. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: We can fairly say that there has been a measure of Arab and world response to the new Iraqi move. The statements made by Arab and foreign leaders after their meetings with President Saddam Husayn's envoys expressed real understanding of Iraq's proposals, and are a positive sign to be added to many positive signs in the international arena. These signs indicate that the end to the blockade must come soon.
