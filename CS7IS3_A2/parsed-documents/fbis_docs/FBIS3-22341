He called these rumors a propaganda trick. In the interview to the SNARK reporter, Mr. Zurabyan expressed an opinion that such rumors are spread out in order to prevent renewing of the Armenian nuclear power station's work and thereby not to allow Armenia to have an independent energy source. Meanwhile, as he pointed out, by spreading out, Azerbaijan makes a vain attempt to prove that Armenia infringes on the Azerbaijan's territory and even is going to use it for own purposes. Mr. Zurabyan said that absurdity of these statements is obvious.
