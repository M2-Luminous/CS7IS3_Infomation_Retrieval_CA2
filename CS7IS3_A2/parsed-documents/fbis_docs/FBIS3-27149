In a statement he issued this evening, he said that "I am satisfied that we have achieved effective compliance with the requirement to remove or place under UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) all heavy weapons within the 20 kilometer Sarajevo exclusion zone." Both the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serb side, he said, had been complying with the ceasefire agreement that was reached on February 9 between the two sides. Before making the decision, he said, he had consulted with UN military commanders in the field, as well as leaders of the warring parties in Bosnia. However, he said, "this is only the first step on a very difficult road, but we are determined to build on this development to achieve lasting peace for the suffering citizens of Sarajevo." In the meantime, he said, UNPROFOR would continue to monitor compliance and any remaining verification required would be completed without delay. "It is my hope," he said, "that the consolidation of a durable peace in Sarajevo is an example that will be followed in the other cities and towns of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
