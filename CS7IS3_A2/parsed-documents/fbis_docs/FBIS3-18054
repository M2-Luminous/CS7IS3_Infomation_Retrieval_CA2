At the SPD headquarters in Bonn, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping called on the about 10,000 SPD officials in 27 German towns not to rest in view of the current lead that the SPD enjoys over the Christian Democratic Union in opinion polls. "We won numerous opinion polls in the past few years," he stressed. "Now we want to win the Bundestag elections for a change." SPD treasurer Inge Wettig-Danielmeier reported that the SPD wants to spend about 70-75 million German marks for the Bundestag and European elections this year. SPD manager Verheugen called on the party members to wage a fair election campaign without "mud slinging." The SPD campaign will focus on the safeguarding of jobs and social security. Lower Saxony Minister President Gerhard Schroeder, who participated in the satellite conference from Hanover, recommended that his friends communicate directly with the citizens in the coming election campaign, and not through "screens."
