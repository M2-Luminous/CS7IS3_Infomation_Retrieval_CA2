This agreement is to be signed today in Jerusalem by both sides. The establishment of relations between the Vatican and the Israeli regime is actually an about-face by the Christian world, which is symbolized by the Vatican, who has suddenly ignored all its principles and values and a holy place that is under the occupation of Zionist usurpers has been handed over on a silver platter to them on behalf of all the Christians of the world. The Pope, as the leader of the Catholic Church in the world and who has rewarded the Zionists for the crimes they have perpetrated and for their occupation, should be asked by all the Christians of the world and by all mankind: Will the noble Christians of the world allow the Vatican to reward the Zionist traitors and criminals? The Zionist groups in the United States and the Western countries have placed the Vatican under pressure to compromise with the Israeli regime. But this will only lead to further discord and disagreement in Europe and will definitely give rise to insecurity and protests there. Pious Christians will never agree to this compromise. The Christians of the world should prove that this is not a reward by the Christian world to the Zionists, but a reward that has been handed out by the corrupt club of the powerful who rule the West.
