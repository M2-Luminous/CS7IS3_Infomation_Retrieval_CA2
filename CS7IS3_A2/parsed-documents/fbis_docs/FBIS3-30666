It is rather difficult to understand how someone could invite Zhirinovskiy, who a week ago spoke in an inappropriate manner about the Czech Republic and its political life, Zieleniec said. Miroslav Sladek's SPR-RSC today invited Zhirinovskiy to visit the Czech Republic with the goal of "obtaining objective information about the programme and objectives of Zhirinovskiy's party." Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which emerged victorious in the recent Russian parliamentary elections, told REUTER that "the Czech Republic will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few breweries in which the beer will turn sour will be left of it." Zieleniec voiced the view that what is important in the world from the international point of view is also important for the Czech Republic. He said he firmly believed that the developments in Russia were important not only for the Czech Republic but for Europe and the whole world. "It is a matter of dire significance for all of us whether or not democracy will be installed in Russia and whether or not a market economy will be stabilised there," Zieleniec said.
