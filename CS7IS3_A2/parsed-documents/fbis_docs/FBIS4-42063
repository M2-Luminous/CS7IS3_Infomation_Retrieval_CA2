According to the federal public prosecutor, all 62 Kurds, except one who has been staying in Germany illegally, were released by Saturday [28 May] night. Police had prepared the large-scale operation after being tipped off about the secret meeting taking place in the building of the Kurdish Cultural Association in Saarbruecken. Apart from the GSG-9 antiterrorist unit, officers of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations and of Saarbruecken police were involved in the raid. According to the Federal Public Prosecutor, there was no major resistance to the operation. The authority says it has been conducting investigations since last autumn against PKK leaders who are suspected of forming a terrorist association. The reason for this is a number of offenses committed against Turkish institutions in Germany in 1992, 1993, and 1994 .
