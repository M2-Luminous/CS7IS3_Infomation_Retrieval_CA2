As is known, on Tuesday the Russian president took a decision on the start of the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. In accordance with the presidential decree the peacekeeping action begins today and will be carried out by the efforts of units of the Russian forces deployed in Transcaucasia. It is expected that during this week they will take up positions on the line of disengagement from both sides of the Inguri River. "All this once again confirms that the main key to solving the Abkhazian problem lies in the hands of Moscow, which head of the Republic of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze has repeatedly asserted," noted the Georgian ambassador. In his opinion, the fact that in Russia both the politicians and the military have got down to the settlement of the conflict is evidence of the peacekeeping potential of Russia in terms of solving conflict situations on the territory of the former USSR.
