Justice Ministry statistics show that last year 1,244,000 prisoners were kept in prisons or reform-through-labor camps in the country. In the same year, 247,000 prisoners had their sentences reduced, 33,000 prisoners were released on parole, and 34,000 were released on bail for medical treatment, all because they had shown repentance or had done deeds of merit during their terms of imprisonment. A total of 301,000 prisoners were released on the completion of their terms of imprisonment last year. Jia Jingping said: Reform-through-labor organs throughout the country have always adhered to the principle of integration of penalty and reform, with reform as the primary goal, and they have further strengthened surveillance, management, and reform of prisoners; tried hard to improve the quality of their work to reform prisoners; helped prisoners make a fresh start; and thus made contributions to preserving social stability. He revealed that last year was yet another to witness stability in prisons and reform-through-labor camps across the country, with the case occurrence rate lowered to the lowest level since 1984. The prisoner escape rate is 1.4 per thousand, still at a relatively low level, compared with past records. Asked about conditions in re-education-through-labor centers, Jia Jingping said re-education-through-labor organizations in the country have further stepped up their efforts to educate and help personnel undergoing the re-education-through-labor process. Stability has been retained in re-education-through-labor camps, with the escape rate remaining at the lowest level, as compared with past records. By the end of 1993, detainees kept in re-education-through-labor camps across the country totaled 153,000, an increase of 16.1 percent over 1992. These detainees included 3,800 women detained for prostitution, accounting for 47.5 percent of the females detained in reeducation-through-labor camps. A total of 11,800 people were detained for drug addiction, making up 7.7 percent of all the detainees. In the same year, a total of 75,900 were released from re-education-through-labor camps following the completion of their terms of detention, while 55,800 detainees had their re-education-through-labor periods shortened because of good behavior in camps.
