But there were three conditions to taking the talks further, he said in an exclusive interview with YONHAP News Agency. "...There are a number of conditions... Including exclusive adherence to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, a resolution of its difficulties with the South Koreans, and progressing its relations with the United States," Bilney said in a written interview relayed through the Australian Embassy here. The talks were held "in recent weeks in Southeast Asian capitals," according to Bilney. "We're not acting alone -- we're not going solo on any particular initiative," he said, adding that Australia is officially conferring with the concerned parties such as the United States and South Korea. Canberra and Pyongyang established diplomatic relations in July 1974 but North Korea unilaterally closed its mission in Australia in October 1975, when Canberra backed South Korea's bid for membership in the United Nations. Australia followed suit one month later. "The fact is that the initiative did come from North Korea," Bilney said when asked who took the first step. Australia chose to play a part in talking with North Korea, Bilney said, because of his country's role in the region and Australia's position as chairman of the IAEA Board of Governors. Asked about possible advantages in reopening ties with North Korea, he said, "I think it's far too early to speculate about those things."
