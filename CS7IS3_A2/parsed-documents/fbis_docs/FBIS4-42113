The talks were conducted between Communications and Works Minister Adhamos Adhamidhis and Russian officials during Adhamidhis' eight-day visit to Moscow, which ended this morning. Discussions focused on the possibility of amending an existing bilateral agreement on air transport to allow an increase of the respective national carriers, from one to two. A Russian delegation is expected to visit Cyprus soon to examine in detail the repercussions of such a move. Direct satellite telecommunications links were also on the agenda of the talks, during which the two sides expressed satisfaction with this facility. Cyprus suggested that its network is used to link Russia with Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Greece, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The matter will be discussed further at a later stage. The ministers decided to organise a joint philatelic exhibition and possibly issue a common series of stamps.
