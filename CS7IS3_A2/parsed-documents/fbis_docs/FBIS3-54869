The year 1993 has become a year of defeats of the Ukrainian people: As a result of the collaboration of the democratic-communist elite with Moscow, Washington, and Tel Aviv, certain agreements have been signed, which endanger Ukraine's sovereignty, its territorial integrity, and its Armed Forces. During this year, Ukraine has not even approached its long-dreamed independence. Thanks to the communists and the democrats, who are Russian and American fifth columns, as well as due to their protectionist policy toward the Russian and Jewish ethnic minorities, the situation of the Ukrainians on their own soil has become unbearable. Nowadays, the Ukrainians are kept even farther away from the levers of power than on the eve of the proclamation of independence; the birthrate has dramatically dropped, mortality among the Ukrainians has increased, and life expectancy has considerably decreased. Russification is rampant: Stores are jammed with Russian Stalinist literature and OSTANKINO has spread its expansionist propaganda to the Ukraine. At the same time, Ukrainian publications and books are disappearing. The Russian language dominates on the streets, in courts, in the Army, and at the Supreme Council. Separatist movements are flexing their muscles. The socioeconomic situation of the Ukrainians has deteriorated, living conditions have declined, and foreign capital has become deep-rooted on our territories. Ukraine has become a territory, on which counterespionage services of hostile states operate freely: First of all, these include the Russia's KGB and Counterintelligence Service, America's CIA, and the Jewish Mosad. Agents from these countries have become leaders of a majority of Ukrainian parties, movements, banks, and funds. There are plenty of them in the Supreme Council, the president's offices, the Security Service of Ukraine, and the General Staff of the Navy. Simultaneously, patriotic officers are being released from duty in the Armed Forces. Due to the defeatist policy of [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine has lost the Black Sea Fleet and its tactical nuclear weapons. In accordance with agreements signed by the president, tanks, airplanes, armored carriers, and the equipment of the Antiaircraft Defense are being dismantled. Russian troops still remain on Ukrainian land. Parties comprising advocates of Ukraine's statehood are persecuted by the democratic-communist structures: Telephones belonging to activists of the national movement are being bugged and their correspondence monitored; activities of Ukrainian economic structures are hampered; statements by DSU, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party [UKRP], and the Union of Ukrainian Youth are sporadically presented by the media. Television is available only for Kravchuk's servants, the Russian and Jewish ethnic minorities, and adherents of Western "values." The official press is conducting a smear campaign against Ukrainian patriots, which is called the fight against Ukrainian fascism. The anti-Ukrainian authorities are trying to ban opposition newspapers, particularly NESKORENA NATSIYA, as well as to arrest their editors and other leading Ukrainian journalists. The political trials of members of DSU, UKRP, the Ukrainian National Assembly, the Ukrainian National Self Defense, and the Volyn Sich Cossacks are being continued. Ukrainian patriots still remain in prisons. Today, only Ukrainian nationalism with its program principles -- "Ukrainian state above all!" and "Ukraine for Ukrainians!" -- is able to avert a national catastrophe. The main task of DSU is to unite all the patriotic forces of Ukraine around the nationalistic idea, as well as to shake off our necks the shameful foreign yoke. It is necessary to introduce a national dictatorship for a transitional period of national liberation and for establishing a national infrastructure. National dictatorship is an urgent necessity of the transitional period. Only national dictatorship is capable of fulfilling the historic task of reviving Ukrainian statehood, as well as of establishing a just nationalistic order and a permanent political system in Ukraine.
