But, at the same time it is a point of agreement for Cairo and Khartoum that Sudan should stay united with all its seven provinces. The repeated U.S. attempts to convince Egypt of the need for the secession of southern Sudan has expanded to include Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda. In the past three months, the U.S. Administration exerted intensive efforts to convince these three countries' presidents to support the right to self-determination for the inhabitants of south Sudan and of Jabal al-Nubah in western Sudan. Harry Johnston, vice chairman of the African Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, played an important role in these efforts. This prompted Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to invite Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir for talks in Nairobi on 18 February. Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi had already accused Khartoum of interfering in Ethiopian affairs and warned it against attempting to export terrorism to Ethiopia and Eritrea through Islamic groups. The three countries' presidents had received U.S. reports about the southern Sudanese people's need for military and material support to confront the Sudanese Government, who has succeeded, according to these reports, in supporting and increasing the strength of the Eritrean al-Jihad Movement. This group is hostile to the Eritrean Transitional Government in Asmara, the Somali Union Organization in northeast Somalia, the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Oromo in Ethiopia, the Islamic Union Forces in "Ogaden," and the Islamic groups in Kenya. Egypt's Foreign Ministry sources pointed out that the Al-Bashir-Moi meeting in Nairobi will be followed by meetings with the two leaders of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army [SPLA], John Garang and Riak Machar, who signed the agreement in Washington last year on working together to obtain the right to self-determination for southern and western Sudan. These sources stressed that Harry Johnston told the three African presidents that one of the aims behind the dispatch of U.S. forces to Somalia in the "Restore Hope" operation was to resolve the southern Sudan problem within the framework that maintains security and stability in the Horn of Africa region. The sources added that the U.S. interest in south Sudan is Khartoum's support for the Islamic movements and exporting them to neighboring countries. To make the Sudanese Government stop this support, the U.S. Administration sought to change the approach to solving the problem in the south from negotiations to the overt call for its secession from the north. For this purpose, the U.S. Administration recently held direct contacts with some southern leaders, including Machar, to prepare for large-scale military operations against the Sudanese forces to achieve self-determination for the southerners. Machar recently called for international intervention in the south to stop what he called the genocide of Christian civilians at the hands of the "Islamic" Sudanese Government. The sources noted that Cairo learned of the U.S. contacts with the secessionists in the south and the U.S. Administration's inclination to move U.S. forces from Somalia to southern Sudan. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry summoned the U.S. ambassador in Cairo to ask about these contacts and the nature of the role U.S. forces deployed in Somalia will play in the south. The same sources noted that the U.S. ambassador's answer, conveyed to President Husni Mubarak at the end of December, pointed out that the goal of the U.S. military reinforcements in the south is to confront centers of "terrorism" in Khartoum, which represent a threat to security and stability in neighboring states. According to the same sources, the U.S. ambassador went beyond this explanation when he asked President Mubarak to back these U.S. efforts by requesting direct Egyptian participation in any military operations that may be carried out against the Khartoum Government. He expressed his country's readiness to work out military arrangements that could secure the participation of some Egyptian military units, particularly since the U.S. State Department appreciates the embarrassment Egypt could face as a result of a potential direct military confrontation with Sudanese Government troops. Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources have disclosed that the number of U.S. troops prepared for dispatch to southern Sudan is 4,000, along with equipment and modern military aircraft. In early January, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry learned of a deal involving the supply of advanced U.S. weapons to the rebel troops in southern Sudan via Israel. According to Arab diplomatic reports from Washington, direct U.S. intervention in the south is serious. The sources added that Britain had agreed to join in this intervention. Some British societies, sponsored by Baroness Cox, have invited leaders of the Sudanese opposition and the two wings of SPLA to "a meeting on Sudan" to be held in the House of Commons in London this month. The meeting will discuss the two main issues; the political and the humanitarian problems in southern Sudan. The same sources disclosed that the United States will use some military bases in neighboring African states as launching pads for attacks against the Sudanese troops in the southern areas, particularly in the Equatoria Province, Bahr El Ghazal Province, and the Upper Nile Province. An expert on African affairs at the Egyptian Foreign Ministry has pointed out that the objective of these U.S. military preparations is not just to protect the U.S. interests in the Horn of Africa but to cover up the failure of the operation in Somalia. This failure has been a major political setback for the new U.S. Administration and has resulted in a 30 percent drop in the U.S. public's support for President Bill Clinton's foreign policy. President Clinton personally wishes to score a major victory in his foreign policy similar to that achieved by former President George Bush during the Gulf war. The Egyptian expert added that, aware of his mistake in settling matters inside Somalia, President Bill Clinton was convinced of his friend Harry Johnston's advice that a major military victory over Sudanese Government troops is possible, particularly since the southerners will provide all the necessary military assistance to make the U.S. role in this mission successful. The expert adds that Clinton expects the southern Sudan operation to last two months. During the operation, the U.S. Administration will declare the right to self-determination for the southerners within a state independent from the north. The Egyptian expert points out that the United States decided to take part in the operation in Somalia to create permanent posts after the restoration of stability in that country. To achieve this objective, U.S. military officials visited Somalia successively to determine the locations of the posts. They initially chose seven posts and held exchanges with some Somali leaders. However, six of those leaders, including President Ali Mahdi, did not approve the establishment of the posts on Somali territory. The Egyptian expert disclosed that the U.S. Administration recently went back on its decision temporarily to build military bases in Somalia lest these bases be sabotaged by the Somalis. Hence, Johnston advised that these bases could possibly be set up in southern Sudan as this move enjoys the approval of the southern rebels leaders, particularly since Machar previously called for establishing secure zones in southern Sudan. The Sudanese Air Force would not be allowed to overfly these zones, similar to northern and southern Iraq. The Egyptian expert pointed out that the idea of building permanent U.S. military bases in southern Sudan is an old one. It was first expressed by former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, but they could not implement it because of the instability in southern Sudan. Bill Clinton is now trying to achieve this objective within the context of Washington's statement advocating the southerners' right to self-determination by setting up an independent state. The Egyptian expert noted that the strategic importance of these bases is to ensure an advance U.S. presence during disturbances and military operations in the African Horn states, adjacent Arab countries, and the Red Sea. Cairo has urgently asked the U.S. Administration not to intervene militarily in the Sudanese problem and not to dispatch U.S. forces from Somalia for this purpose. In its request, Cairo said that supporting the secession of the south from the north is bound to encourage several ethnic groups in Sudan and Ethiopia to take similar measures. This would actually threaten stability in the Horn of Africa. Sources said that although the U.S. ambassador in Cairo tried to convey his government's assurances that it would not carry out military intervention in Sudan, he said that Washington wants the Egyptian Government to cooperate with it to curb "terrorism," which takes Khartoum as its center, and to support the idea of independence for the south from the north, as it represents the ideal solution to the southerners' suffering and does not harm Egypt's southern security. This solution would also enable the independent Sudanese southerners to establish good relations with Cairo and to revive joint economic projects, including the Jonglei Canal project, which has been obstructed by the ongoing war. However, Cairo received all these assurances with extreme caution and has not supported the U.S. position on the matter. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources said that the reasons for the U.S. retreat from direct military intervention in the south, which became apparent from the U.S. ambassador's assurances, were the differences that erupted between the secessionist leaders over accepting the U.S. role in the south and the condition of setting up permanent U.S. military bases in their areas. While some, including Machar, backed the establishment of these bases, Garang expressed some reservations. To narrow the differences between these two leaders, Harry Johnston sought to tell them that the U.S. Administration will make military commitments to the rebel forces. In this context, he effected a reconciliation between Garang and Machar (leader of the Nuer tribes) to get the two leaders to agree on these military commitments, which Washington will make later. Confirmed Egyptian information noted that Machar approved these military commitments while Garang opposed them and expressed fears about them, and even conveyed these fears to Cairo. In view of this frenzied activity on the part of Washington to resolve the problem of south Sudan on the basis of self-determination, intensive Egyptian-Sudanese contacts were held at the end of last month during which a message was conveyed from the Egyptian president to his Sudanese counterpart in which he stressed Egypt's support for Sudan in any attempt to partition it. The Egyptian president also underlined the link between Egyptian and Sudanese security. Egyptian and Sudanese sources in Cairo said that Mubarak's message to al-Bashir left a good impression on Sudanese officials. This led to the two countries' agreement on resolving the Egyptian-Sudanese dispute over the Hala'ib triangle within the framework of the bilateral joint committees and on resolving the differences between them over the issues of terrorism. In this connection, the Sudanese authorities recently built a port on the Red Sea and not in Shalatayn (the disputed area between the two countries) to avoid any disputes and to improve bilateral relations. As part of Egypt's efforts to achieve a common conception of security interests in the Horn of Africa between Cairo and Washington, President Husni Mubarak contacted the presidents of Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Eritrea, and some Somali leaders in his capacity as OAU chairman. The contacts were designed to underline the importance of the Egyptian role in the Horn of Africa and the possibility of Egypt playing a prominent and direct role in protecting U.S. interests and African countries' interests in this region. This Egyptian role could be the alternative to the direct role that Washington intends to play in southern Sudan. Although this common concept has not been achieved yet, Washington, according to the African affairs expert in the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, has not been convinced of the Egyptian role in this region, especially in Somalia, and has sought to belittle its importance or to marginalize it. Washington is insisting that any action taken in the Horn of Africa has to go through it. But Cairo continues to believe that the problems of the region could be resolved within the framework of the OAU and UN charters, which call for maintaining the territorial integrity of Africa's countries and prohibits their partitioning.
