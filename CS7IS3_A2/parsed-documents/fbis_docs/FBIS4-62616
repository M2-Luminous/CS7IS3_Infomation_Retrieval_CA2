FBIS4-62616 "drsov096_a_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Cooperation With NATO, Grachev Visit Viewed Cooperation With NATO, Grachev Visit Viewed LD1705154594 Moscow Radio Moscow World Service in English 1110 GMT 17 May 94 LD1705154594 Moscow Radio Moscow World Service English BFN [Text] The Russian defense minister, Pavel Grachev, will go to Brussels on the 23d of this month on a three-day visit. He will submit at the NATO headquarters Russia's proposals for the NATO program Partnership for Peace. Here is what our observer Anatoliy Potapov writes about Russia's relations with NATO: It is hard to guess what proposals the Russian defense minister will take to NATO. Most likely it is not going to be one of those documents currently under preparation by Russian experts. Apparently General Grachev intends to talk about the terms in which Russia will participate in the NATO program. Given some statements made recently by President Boris Yeltsin and other Russian leaders, there are no objections to Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace program. The single document, obligatory for signing by all the member states, does not perceive any concrete actions or joint decisions. As many European politicians describe it, it is only a declaration of intentions. The signing of the document will not commit Russia to anything. The document does not outline any prospects for cooperation. Then what is this partnership all about? The point is that Russia is seeking serious, large-scale, equal cooperation with NATO. Russia has the right to expect NATO will not disregard its special geopolitical situation, its role on the world scene and, finally, its military might no other European state can boast of. Thus it is necessary to find a reasonable combination of the equity of all participants in the NATO program and Russia's special role in it. This is the essence of the problem of Russia's partnership with NATO. As for Russia, it is preparing a bilateral document with clear-cut, concrete parameters of partnership. So far, the concept of the future document is a matter of guesswork. Hopefully it will reflect the principles of preserving the organizational structure and the unique character of the Russian army, now numbering some 3 million, and the standards of its often unique armaments. Russia is a European but also an Asian state. It would be reasonable to word the future document so as to rule out all possible fears and speculations on the part of its Asian neighbors. It's worthy to note that some East European countries regard the NATO program only as the first stage of their full-fledged membership in this bloc. Some statements by prominent Western politicians support such aspirations. While Russia's idea of the Partnership for Peace is different, Russia wants all European states to join efforts to promote stability on the continent. It does not see this document as a way to extend NATO in the eastern direction, a way to a new splitting of Europe. Russia is open and straightforward about this, seeking to provide a firm basis for its wide-range [as heard] cooperation with the North Atlantic bloc.
