The ministry's spokesman, Irawan Abidin, told ANTARA that Indonesia may cancel its hosting of the Indonesian-sponsored peace talks if Manila, between today and june, could not convey its proper response over Jakarta's displeasure over the conference. The Moro-Manila peace talks were originally scheduled to resume on mid-June, after the first talks held in Jakarta last year. Irawan Abidin did not deny that Jakarta has expected Manila to abrogate the conference due to take place in Philippine university from May 31 through June 3. "If it is still carried out as scheduled, surely we'd regard it as "improper," said Abidin, who refused to consider his statement as a threat. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has previously described the entitled "Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor" previously as a political campaign against Indonesia's national integrity instead of an academic seminar discussing about the human rights. His statement was based upon the fact that Jose Ramos Horta, an East Timorese figure who opposes the East Timor integration into Indonesia, Filipino leftist Renato Constantino, and Cecilia Jimenez were among the conference's organizers. Commenting on the Philippine Embassy's statement that its government would try to limit the topics to be discussed during the conference, Alatas firmly said that it would not be enough. "I don't see how a political discussion could be limited," he added and reaffirmed that Jakarta regarded the conference as political activities. Spokeswoman of the Philippine Embassy in Jakarta, Sonya Braddy, earlier told a delegation of the Indonesian Youth National Committee (KNPI) that Manila does not want to annoy its bilateral relations with Indonesia due to the conference. "The Philippines would try to minimize or even to eliminate any provocative attempts which could emerge in discussing the substances of the conference," the KNPI chairman, Tubagus Haryono, quoted Braddy as saying. In the meantime, Irawan Abidin stated that he could not receive the reason that the Philippine Government could not cancel the conference as it is organized by a non-governmental organization in a university that has its own autonomy. "I'm sure that the Philippine Constitution is containing articles, which acknowledge the government to take a certain action considering its national interest," Abidin concluded.
