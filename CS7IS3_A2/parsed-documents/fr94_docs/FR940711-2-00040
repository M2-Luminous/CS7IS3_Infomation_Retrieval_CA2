There will be one policy for the Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of projects progressively implemented. It will become effective upon publication in the Federal Register and will be applicable to the sale of system power in respective utility areas as then existing contracts, or necessary extensions, expire. The policy will be implemented through negotiated contracts for terms not to exceed 10 years. Transmission facilities owned by utilities within the marketing area will be used for all necessary purposes including transmitting power to load centers. Deliveries may be made at the projects, at utilities' interconnections or at customer substations, as determined by Southeastern. The projects will be hydraulically, electrically, and financially integrated, and will be operated to make maximum contribution to the power supply of the selected utility areas. Preference in the sale of the power shall be given to public bodies and cooperatives. Marketing Area. The marketing area shall consist of the approximate 112,000 square mile area generally known as The Southern Company service area, and the approximate 40,000 square mile area generally known as the service areas of the South Carolina Public Service Authority and the South Carolina Electric and Gas Company plus that portion of the Duke Power Company's service area within a radius of 150 miles of the Hartwell, Russell or Thurmond projects. Eligible public bodies and cooperatives in this marketing area are listed in Appendix A attached hereto. Allocations of Existing Power.
