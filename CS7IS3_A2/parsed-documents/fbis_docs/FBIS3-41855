This agreement establishes a series of safeguards for Argentine and Brazilian nuclear activities. The least that can be expected is that there are grave enough reasons -- which must be publicly explained -- to justify an omission that will make Brazil subject to the affronts normally piled on irresponsible governments. The committee is not empowered to hold Brazilian foreign policy hostage without clearly explaining the reasons behind such a drastic measure. The highest national interest is at stake. The silent inspiration of the representatives of false nationalism, which also seek to become mentors of the nation's representatives, cannot prevail over those interests. The Quadripartite Agreement achieved in a single stroke an inspired way of guaranteeing, in the eyes of the international community, the peaceful purposes of Brazilian and Argentine nuclear programs. It is a powerful instrument to build trust between the two signatory countries. It is also worth noting that Brazil has for some years suffered a variety of pressures to join the Non- Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. It does not do so because it believes the NPT is unacceptably discriminatory and differentiates between those who have and those who do not have nuclear weapons. In view of the progress in the nuclear program, the simultaneous increase in international efforts to achieve nonproliferation, and faced with the inescapable need to raise the level of relations with Argentina, Brazil chose to strengthen regional nuclear control instruments as a way to guarantee the international community of our peaceful use of the atom, and as a way to obtain the required approval to legitimize this sensitive area. The country acted on two fronts: First, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) was created and the Quadripartite Agreement was negotiated with Argentina, authorizing the ABACC and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to supervise and control nuclear activities in the two countries. Second, efforts were made to eliminate the obstacles that prevented Brazil from accepting the Tlatelolco Treaty. The purpose of this double action was, we repeat, to obtain the international community's respect and credibility without accepting the costs of the NPT. As a result, Brazil is possibly the only country that does not have a nuclear weapon and which did not sign the NPT. But in order to earn political profit from this -- that is, credibility and respectability -- it is necessary for Congress to approve the Quadripartite Agreement. If that does not happen we will only encourage the international community's general mistrust without a way to counteract it. Contrary to what is feared by narrow-minded and perhaps well- intentioned people, the Quadripartite Agreement does not restrict our national sovereignty. Skillfully drafted, it does not present obstacles for building a nuclear submarine and it protects our autonomously obtained industrial and technological achievements. The supplementary arrangements introduced into the Agreement -- which originally raised doubts because of the scope of regulations that could have gone beyond what was established in the main body of the agreement -- were finally accepted in the record time of two negotiating sessions, as a demonstration that the IAEA has great political interest to see this Quadripartite Agreement entering into effect quickly. The Brazilian Government thinks likewise. The Senate must approve the agreement before Brazil can join the Organization to Ban Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Opanal), the agency responsible for the implementation of the Tlatelolco Treaty. The Opanal meeting scheduled for 7 December was postponed until 19 January at the request of the Brazilian Government. Opanal directors expect that Brazil, Argentina, and Chile -- countries that reviewed their positions on the Tlatelolco Treaty -- will formally join the organization by that date. For Brazil, joining Opanal now will mean influencing -- as the country with the region's most complete nuclear program -- the organization's working agenda that will be elaborated in January. From a broader point of view, approval of the agreement will be evidence of the respect Brazil has for joint efforts with the Argentine and Chilean Foreign Ministries on this extremely sensitive issue. By not joining, however, we will be ridiculed for unnecessarily delaying the meeting. Brazil will also pay the political price of showing, before the international community, that the government is incapable of approving the Quadripartite Agreement on time. Congress has been convened for a special session and could discuss international agreements and treaties as well as the specific item on the agenda. There are, therefore, ways for the Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate plenum to approve the text of the agreement before 19 January. To fail to do so will hurt the Brazilian image in the world.
