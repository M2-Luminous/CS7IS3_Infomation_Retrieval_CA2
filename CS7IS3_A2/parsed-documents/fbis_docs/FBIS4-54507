FBIS4-54507 "dreeu084_c_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-084 Daily Report 8 Mar 1994 CZECH REPUBLIC Proposal To Transform Military Education Due Proposal To Transform Military Education Due 94CH0210H Prague A REPORT in Czech 8 Mar 94 p 3 94CH0210H Prague A REPORT Czech CSO [Article by Miloslav Frydl: "Three Schools To Remain"] [Text] By 1 September 1994, the advanced military education system is supposed to be reduced. As of that date, however, three advanced military schools will remain. During the meeting of the Education Committee of the parliament of the Czech Republic, it was noted last week by the rector of the Advanced Military School for the Ground Forces at Vyskov, Lubomir Odehnal. The idea of a unified defense university, about which we wrote in A REPORT two issues ago, is, according to L. Odehnal, by far not as topical now as it was several weeks ago. "It could be the final goal," noted the rector from Vyskov. "But work on the concept is in fact beginning from scratch. There will probably not be any specific changes in our orientation, but we shall be a lot wiser by the end of April." L. Odehnal further stated that the last consultation with the minister resulted in a decision to move the deadline for transformation to 1 September 1995. But the definitive project for transforming military education must be submitted to the Education Committee of parliament by 30 April 1994, according to the resolution adopted last week by the deputies. "Everything that could have been said has already been said; now it is time to finally act," noted Kozel, chairman of the Education Committee. We asked Jiri Pospisil, first deputy minister of defense, if the proposal to transform the advanced military education system is in such a state that it could be submitted to the Education Committee by the date specified. "Yes. There are a number of alternatives; discussions are continuing. I liked what the chairman of the committee said--it is time to submit some kind of results. It can be done by the deadline." At the moment, Pospisil does not know whether the required proposal will contain the idea of a defense university. "I believe that it might be the case," he said in response to our question. "But, in my opinion, the basis for the transformation is a meaningful system, and it is essentially unimportant whether it will be divided into a single element or into three elements." According to Pospisil, the final version of the proposed transformation of the military education system is to be submitted to the advisory board of the minister by the end of March. According to the Vyskov rector, the final language is expected to partially take into account the original proposal formulated by the commission of rectors of advanced military schools: "Some of the material will be utilized, some will be reworked. We will most likely not back down from adhering to advanced school principles. The toughest nut will be finding a common path for the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Education, and the General Staff. The material to be presented to parliament by 30 April will contain a schedule for transformation, with a deadline for realization by 1 September 1995. Much will depend on whether this schedule will be adopted," said L. Odehnal.
