Trade unions and employers do not want the neopopiwek to be reinstated, whereas the government insists that the neopopiwek be in force until the end of the year. Abandonment of the neopopiwek is one of the main demands put forward by Solidarity during its strikes. The All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] and other trade union centers also agree with the demand. Strikes Continue Solidarity is dissatisfied with the results of talks within the trilateral commission. "There is no reason to stop the strike action," Ewa Lewicka of Solidarity told GAZETA WYBORCZA. "There is almost nothing we have managed to resolve completely, the government failed to come up with specific solutions, and a time schedule for meeting the demands of Solidarity, on which stopping the strike action depends, has not been agreed upon." "Strikes as an invitation to talks place the government in a very difficult situation," Andrzej Baczkowski, deputy labor minister and the commission's chief, told journalists. OPZZ Will See To It? The government insists that the popiwek be reinstated now so as to prevent an eruption of inflation. It will be possible to lift the popiwek no sooner than the beginning of next year. But employers and trade unionists do not fear excessive increases in salaries. OPZZ Deputy Chairman Maciej Manicki has told GAZETA WYBORCZA that, if the popiwek becomes law, the OPZZ will file a lawsuit with the Constitutional Tribunal. "We will see to it that salaries do not rise by more than the 27 percent contained in the budget. Other trade unions should also reduce employee appetites for the popiwek," Manicki declared during the commission's session. "Over 200 trade unions are active in Poland, but there are only a few talking in this meeting hall," replied Deputy Finance Minister Waldemar Manugiewicz. "How does the OPZZ plan to go about managing the salary situation in all of the enterprises?" Flexible Abandonment of the Popiwek Despite this lack of agreement over the popiwek, Solidarity will talk within the commission about abandoning it, by, among other means, introducing a regulation of salaries through collective agreements and through commercialization of state-owned enterprises. The commission determined that the government will address the Sejm Presidium to have parliament adopt the so-called Chapter 11 of the Labor Law Code as soon as possible (this is provided for by the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises). The chapter provides that the most important employee issues--such as salaries, working conditions, and so forth--should be decided jointly by employers and employee representations. Adopting the law is indispensable for a lifting of popiwek. Then salary increases would no longer be directed centrally but, instead, would depend on collective agreements within enterprises. What would also happen is that the current automatic dependence of salary increases in the production sector on such increases in the budget sector would be eliminated. Solidarity wants salaries for budget sector employees to be dependent on increases in the GDP. In addition, valorizations of retirement and other kinds of pensions would be based not on increases in average salaries the way they are now but, instead, on increases in prices and in living expenses. (The government is supposed to present its proposals on this issue as soon as possible.) Companies Full Speed Ahead! According to Deputy Ownership Transformations Minister Andrzej Zebrowski, a commercialization of state-owned enterprises is a precondition for a lifting of the popiwek (the government has preliminarily approved of a draft law). The commercialization would be about gradually transforming the enterprises into companies of Commercial Law--for instance, into share companies--in which the state would participate. The government would start with the most efficient enterprises first. Those enterprises that have economic losses would be subjected to supervision by contract managers before they are commercialized, which would make it possible to improve their financial results. The worst enterprises would simply be dissolved, but only after a plan for a further management of their wealth is prepared. In the companies, supervisory boards would be set up, which would conclude collective agreements. A decision was made that the government is supposed to come up with proposals concerning the commercialization of enterprises by 15 June. On 16 May, in turn, the commission will be dealing with a draft law on the privatization of state-owned enterprises (this is one of the laws making up the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises). Among other things, the draft law describes the principles of employee participation in the privatization of an enterprise. A Time Schedule? Not Yet According to Solidarity, commercialization will go on for years, whereas salaries should be shaped through collective agreements and not through the popiwek. That is why Solidarity wants the popiwek to be lifted as soon as possible through the adoption of Chapter 11 of the Labor Law Code. When asked about the impact of talks within the trilateral commission on the strikes, Longin Komolowski, a member of the Solidarity National Commission and of the strike headquarters, replied: "We have not reached the stage yet where we would be ready to accept a time schedule for working on the trade union's demands." Let us recall that Solidarity has been making the end to the strike action dependent on approving such a time schedule and on the government's specific proposals and measures. What They Managed To Agree Upon The government agreed to meeting the demand by Solidarity that people who compute their taxes along with their spouses be able to make the lowest amount of advance tax payment. Deputy [Finance] Minister Manugiewicz reported that the Finance Ministry has already prepared a legal measure regarding the issue, and the commission is due to debate it on 16 May. The government also approves of the idea that, effective in 1995, tax breaks be introduced that would take into account the cost of commuting to work (the government is to submit its proposals soon.) On 16 May, the commission is also scheduled to deal with a second batch of demands by Solidarity: a popular enfranchisement of citizens, reducing the workweek to 40 hours, social support for the poorest families, and salaries for budget-sector employees. Solidarity initially refused to agree to the 16 May date. "It is too late," the trade unionists said. They insisted that this amounts to a violation of the Konin agreement. They made it clear that the strike may spread even further by 16 May. The government was trying to convince the trade unionists that it needs the time to prepare its proposals. But, in the end, Solidarity was outvoted on the issue.
