FR940912-0-00033 FR940912-0-00006 The FCA supports the commenter's view that the cost involved in providing meaningful information to investors should not outweigh the benefits derived. The FCA also notes that §630.20(e)(2), which requires the System to ``describe the statutory requirement that a borrower purchase stock as a condition of obtaining a loan; how such stock is purchased, transferred, and retired; and how earnings are distributed,'' will ensure that investors continue to receive information that describes the nature of borrower stock of the System. As a result, proposed §630.20(g)(1)(ii) has been deleted from the final rule and proposed §630.20(g)(1)(iii) and (iv) have been redesignated. 4. Section 630.20(g)(1)(ii)_Risk Exposure Proposed §630.20(g)(1)(iii) requires discussion and analysis of the risk exposure of the loan portfolio. The FCC suggested that the term ``nonperforming loans'' replace the term ``high-risk assets'' in this section of the regulation because it is more widely used in the commercial banking industry. Use of the term ``high-risk assets'' in proposed §630.20(g)(1)(iii) is consistent with the recent amendment of the FCA's accounting and reporting guidelines in part 621 of this chapter. See 58 FR 48780 (September 20, 1993). In the FCA's regulations, the term ``high-risk assets'' is a generic reference to loans and loan-related assets that are to be categorized for loan performance and valuation assessment purposes according to the criteria set forth in §621.6 of this chapter. Collectively, the classifications identified in §621.6 of this chapter are consistent with the terminology used in the commercial banking industry for nonperforming loans. There is no regulatory requirement to categorize the classification as ``high-risk assets'' in the report to investors. Rather, proposed §630.20(g)(1)(iii) requires discussion of any risks that could adversely affect the loan portfolio and loan-related assets. Accordingly, the FCA has retained the term ``high-risk assets'' and adopted §630.20(g)(1)(iii) essentially as proposed. Proposed §630.20(g)(1)(iii) is redesignated as §630.20(g)(1)(ii). The FCA further notes that it expects to revisit the issue of accounting for impaired loans in the future to assess the impact of the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, issued by the Financial and Accounting Standards Board. 5. Section 630.20(g)(1)(iii)_Secondary Market Activities The FCC commented that secondary market activities have never been and currently are not anticipated to be material to the System's financial condition. The FCC suggested that proposed §630.20(g)(1)(iv) be modified to require these activities to be described when they become material to the System's financial condition. The FCA agrees with the commenter that the System's involvement in the secondary markets should be disclosed to investors when the effect of such activities on the financial condition of the System is material and has revised proposed §630.20(g)(1)(iv) to add materiality tests. This provision is redesignated as §630.20(g)(1)(iii) of the final rule. The FCA believes that the System's statutory authority to participate in secondary markets should be disclosed to investors in any event. A new paragraph has thus been added in §630.20(a)(1)(vi) of the final rule to require, without regard to materiality, a description of the authority of System institutions to purchase and sell interests in loans in secondary markets and the risk involved. 6. Section 630.20(g)(3)(ii) and (iii)_Liquidity and Investment Section §630.20(g)(3)(ii) and (iii) require that the System provide a brief description of the System's policies regarding liquidity and investment. The FCC pointed out that each System bank adopts its own liquidity and investment policies according to its business objectives. In the absence of universal policies regarding investment and liquidity among System institutions, the commenter suggested that the proposed regulations be revised to require only a general description of System banks' policies. The suggested change is consistent with the intent of the proposed regulations. The FCA has clarified the proposed regulations by revising §630.20(g)(3)(ii)(A) and (g)(3)(iii) to require a brief overview of liquidity and investment matters.
