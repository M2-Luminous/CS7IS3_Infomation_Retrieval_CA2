For the government, parliament, and the president, however, one of the most crucial visits to Moscow, and one of the most difficult working days, will take place tomorrow. This was not an easy decision, and at the basis of it were those processes which have troubled the minds of many of you. I think that this is a visit which in many ways is a first in history. It is the first visit by the state president to democratic Russia. It is the first summit meeting between Latvia and Russia in unprecedented circumstances and conditions. Democratic Russia want to achieve its goals by talking to a free and sovereign Latvia. This path is taken not only by Russia and Latvia; it has been created with the participation of many European countries as well, especially in the past two weeks. And perhaps it is the views of the European countries, the views of the European Union, the letters and messages from leaders of many countries, and the promises, as well as the practical work of giving material support to these processes, that have inclined us to the decision to go to Moscow and commence political dialogue. What are the basic aims and tasks in setting off on this short but crucial road? In the first place our task is to bring about, without reservations and by the appointed date of 31 August, the departure from Latvia of the last soldier of the Russian army. There is proof that this process is by no means easy in the facts of the past few days, that the withdrawal of the Russian army is proceeding with great difficulty and complexity, and quite often the tasks that are are already set today are not being fulfilled. I think that in accepting such an agreement, our government, our Ministry of Defense, will have to make great efforts for these soldiers to be really withdrawn. We must ensure that Skrunda acquires the status of a military institution under civilian control, so it would not be possible at all, even in theory, and as a the result of a mistake, as happened recently, to acquire the status of a military base. We must ensure that soon after the signing of this agreement the new monster of Skrunda is demolished, so that it can never return, and there can never even be any more talk of the reinstating of this military base. I think that in the past week two very essential improvements or supplements have been achieved: they are, on the creation of the repatriation fund, on the functioning and significance of this repatriation fund. I am convinced that through this repatriation fund many former soldiers and military personnel will have a chance to leave Latvia in a civilized way. And another achievement, if it can be called anything in this difficult struggle, is that we have received from Russia the number of those retired military personnel -- 22,320 -- who will be subject to the application of these agreements and laws. So, if we talk of the fourth agreement, and whether it will be signed at all, it could be a matter of the futures of 22,320 people, and Latvia will one way or another bear its civilized responsibilities only for the fate of those people in the social (?sphere). I think that this kind of checking will allow us to remove the range of responsibilities rumored recently - that there are 100,000 150,000, or 200,000 in Latvia -- no, this agreement covers only that number that will be checked and monitored every year. I think that the last two questions we are to talk about, namely the commencement of political dialogue and the future settlement of economic relations, are less important. We are taking with us more than 10 agreements, about which there will definitely be talks, and I think they will allow many economic industrialists, farmers, producers, to breathe freely, because the way to the eastern market, in my opinion, is today after all somewhat easier than the way to the western market. And I cannot speak about the last question that we are definitely to discuss at our meeting with Yeltsin - that is the question of our moral, of our spiritual responsibility in the face of those forces from which we have still not freed ourselves today. They are the consequences of the occupation, they are the consequences that our people is still living through since the deportations of 1940 and 1949. I am convinced that the Russian leadership will acknowledge the criminality of these consequences, acknowledge the destructive effect of these consequences, not only on the Latvian people, but also on many other peoples. And in conclusion I want to confess that this journey is undoubtedly very complex and very hard, and I can say with certainty that I am travelling with a (?heavy) heart and doubts -- but not doubts about the road that Latvia is taking. Here neither the president nor the government has any doubts. But we have doubts about whether the new democratic Russia will be able to receive and accept us - not as the near abroad, not as a possible sphere of influence, but as a sovereign independent state. I know, and I am acquainted with, the great hospitality of the Russian people. I hope that the Russian government, too, will be able to comprehend these efforts being made by the Latvian people. I would like our delegation to have as its travelling provisions not only those harsh words and critical remarks you have made; it has also done much good in assessing our work for us; but also to have wishes for us for a bit of endurance, a bit of strength, patience and persistence in this lengthy, but for Latvia very important, process.
