[Andrzej Kruszynski] Speaking at the deliberations of the Self-Defense National Front, at whose leader's, Janusz Bryczkowski's, invitation Zhirinovskiy came to Poland, the Russian politician sent a message to Polish politicians saying that Poland can have in Russia a real help in the implementation of its national interests. Denying all interference in the internal affairs of our country, the main body of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's address was aimed at convincing the Poles about the benefits ensuing from close economic and political ties of the whole Slavonic commonwealth, not excluding a military treaty. Such a commonwealth can become the greatest power in the world, the Russian politician added. There were also anti-Western accents in his address. In Zhirinovskiy's opinion, the West would be happy to see enmity amongst the Slavs. This is Andrzej Kruszynski speaking for the First Program of Polish Radio.
