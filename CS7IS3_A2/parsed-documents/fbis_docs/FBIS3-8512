[passage omitted] The statement was issued here after the presidential council of the republic of Hereg-Bosna met in Mostar, southern Bosnia [location as received]. The council has 11 members and is chaired by Kresimir Zubak, who has also headed the Bosnian Croat delegation in Vienna at talks on the proposed Moslem-Croat federation, brokered in Washington last week. The council expressed its "full support" for its delegation in Vienna, but said that it had an "obligation to coordinate daily with the members of the presidential council who are not part of the delegation." The report came after Zagreb's deputy foreign minister Ivo Sanader said that the talks in Vienna could be concluded Friday with leaders from both sides flying in to work out the final details. Further discussions would be needed on the "demarcation of the Croat and Moslem cantons" in the future federation. [passage omitted] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said on Monday that the question of a confederation would be put to a referendum in the republic, but added that the issue could not be settled "so long as the question of Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina remains unresolved."
