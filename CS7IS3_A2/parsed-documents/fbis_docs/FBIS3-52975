FBIS3-52975 "drnes007_a_94001" FBIS-NES-94-007 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Jan 1994 ARAB AFRICA Algeria FFS To Boycott National Dialogue Conference LD1001151894 Algiers Radio Algiers Network in Arabic 1200 GMT 10 Jan 94 LD1001151894 Algiers Radio Algiers Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] The date of the national conference -- 25-26 January -- is approaching, and the political arena is ready to decide on the participants, two weeks before the date of the conference. A spokesman for the National Dialogue Commission said that the conference would not be a conference of parties. The conference was the axis of the latest party contacts and statements. The FFS [Socialist Forces Front] has announced that it will not participate in the national conference scheduled for 25 and 26 January. This stance was contained in a statement issued today by the National Executive Committee of the FFS. In its analysis of the general situation and the reasons behind its nonparticipation, it said that there was a return to the unilateral system, the one language and the one thought, without any consideration for the Amazighi [Berber] peculiarities. The FFS added that it was working for the restoration of hope for Algerians, as the statement put it. On the other hand, some parties are holding meetings in the form of blocs for consultation and coordination before the convening of the conference. Yesterday, a tripartite meeting was held between the FLN [National Liberation Front], HAMAS [Islamic Society Movement], and the Movement for Democracy in Algeria. The meeting, which was held at FLN headquarters, was devoted to the preparation of a draft document containing the measures, methods, and means for making the national dialogue successful, to be sent to the Higher State Council [HCE] and the National Dialogue Commission. On this issue, our colleague Brahim Zewash telephoned FLN Secretary General Abdelhamid Mehri, who answered at the beginning of this short conversation a question about the tripartite meeting: [Begin recording] [Mehri] Contacts were made between four parties -- HAMAS, al-Nahdah, the Movement for Democracy, and the FLN. It began within the framework of the suggestion that we submitted to the HCE and the National Dialogue Commission to hold a tripartite meeting to study some of the measures that will help to make the national dialogue successful. Naturally, the suggestion was rejected but the issue remained, as we thought that it was beneficial that we should continue our meetings and our consultations as part of the measures that are apt to help make the national dialogue successful by expanding it, on the one hand, and by restoring assurances to society, on the other. I believe that we have reached a common ground that will be communicated within the next few days to the HCE and to the National Dialogue Commission, and will be published. [Zewash] Can you tell us the broad lines of this common ground? [Mehri] I prefer, as we have agreed, that we should wait until the petition is published. [Zewash] In other words, is there an attempt by these parties to get closer, either because of the FLN [word indistinct] or because we are noticing that these parties have participated in the multi-sided meetings? [Mehri] No, the subject of the meeting is defined and all the sides are in agreement that we meet only on this point. Each party has its own independent ideas with regard to the remaining issues. We did not attempt to coordinate our stances with regard to all issues. [Zewash] In other words, does not the FLN's proposal, manifested in a meeting of the political parties -- the HCE and the National Dialogue Commission -- mean that there is a somewhat exclusion of the social and economic front? [Mehri] There is no exclusion of any side. The HCE and the National Dialogue Council have placed us in a group called the Group of Six Parties -- we move within this group. We are not the ones who called for the dialogue so that we can exclude others. The side that called for the dialogue is either the HCE -- when it conducted the dialogue -- or the National Dialogue Council. On the contrary, we are for expanding the dialogue. [Zewash] Abdelhamid, two weeks remain before the convening of the national conference, and as you have not participated in the recent meeting, is that not considered an obstruction of the national conference? [Mehri] No, we were not committed to attend the national conference, irrespective of the circumstances. From the first day, when the idea of convening a national conference was suggested, we asked: Will the conference be a phase of the dialogue or the conclusion of the dialogue? We were told: It is the conclusion of the dialogue. We said: Therefore, we should first agree on the content of the conference. If we agree, we will go to the conference, but if we do not agree on the content, then we will not attend. [Zewash] What are the proposals that the FLN can submit in order to participate in the upcoming national conference? [Mehri] This is a long issue, because a year and a half ago we submitted a large number of proposals, and, so far, no proposal has been taken into consideration. [Zewash] According to (?close) sources that attended the tripartite meeting yesterday, there was an attempt to bring about the participation of the dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]. [Mehri] We are confined to work within the group that the National Dialogue Commission collectively called, and we are moving within this group in order to avoid any misinterpretation. But the question of the participation of the faction that remained in existence following the dissolution of the FIS is now naturally recognized by all. [Zewash] The Central Committee of the FLN will be holding an emergency meeting in the middle of this month, and it appears -- according to press sources -- that there are differences within the FLN. Is this true? [Mehri] This is a healthy sign. We do not claim that we are working in one voice. All our resolutions were adopted following a discussion of all views, and we will discuss all views. There is no complexity in this. Even in the darkest of circumstances we held meetings that were open to journalists, and in these meetings we held discussions openly, but this deep and frank discussion among ourselves made the attitude of the FLN characterized by responsibility and effectiveness. [Zewash] Will the upcoming meeting of the FLN Central Committee be open to the national press? [Mehri] The issue is being discussed, and as yet, no final decision has been taken. [end recording]
