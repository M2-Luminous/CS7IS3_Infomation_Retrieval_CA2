As measures to deal with Japan in case the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks end in failure, the U.S. Government has begun to study the possibility of using a presidential order to revive the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act and of setting its own criteria to measure the openness of the Japanese market. The U.S. Government is believed to be employing the tactic to wring trade concessions from Japan for the time being. "Five schemes" are now under study by the U.S. Government and a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN correspondent has examined how realistic these schemes are. The rejection of a package of political reform bills in the House of Councilors disappointed the U.S. Government beyond imagination. A White House official said, "Prime Minister Hosokawa did not specifically explain to Treasury Secretary Bentsen about the income tax reduction" and expressed his disappointment at the lack of prospects for Japan's stimulus measures which have been viewed as a trump card to make the February Japan-U.S. summit talks a success. At a plenary session of the vice ministerial economic framework talks that began on 24 January, the U.S. side took a "tough attitude again" for setting an objective criteria, about which the U.S. side has recently taken a flexible attitude, (says a Japanese Government source). Treasury Secretary Bentsen has publicly spoken of the need to "reexamine the bilateral economic framework talks," and his statement has been regarded as an expression of toughness in the U.S. attitude. One of the schemes under study by the U.S. Government is to revive the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. It is highly possible the U.S. Government will decide to revive it if and when the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks fail to produce any results or are broken off. The second scheme is for the United States to "set its own criteria to monitor the openness of the Japanese market." These two schemes would create a mechanism whereby the United States monitors and declares sanctions as it likes. A plan is under study by the U.S. Government to send U.S. Trade Representative Kantor to Japan in early February with the mission of presenting Japan with the two schemes and feeling out Japan's attitude toward them. The third scheme is an ultra-hard-line one whereby the United States expresses its unhappiness with the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks by notifying Japan of its decision to postpone the planned Japan-U.S. summit talks. The White House, however, is cautious about the third scheme. The remaining two schemes are long-term in nature. One of the two schemes is to trigger again the "yen's appreciation" as occurred in the first half of 1993 with the aim of forcing Japan to take measures to stimulate its economy. Some officials in the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the Treasury Department are opposed to this scheme and the possibility of its actually being put into effect is slim. The last scheme is for the United States to "keep Japan in check by bypassing it in strengthening its relations with South Korea, the Southeast Asian nations, and China." It is highly possible that the Untied States will adopt this scheme. Needless to say, the United States will only use these schemes as a bargaining tool to wring trade concessions from Japan for the time being. However, it is true that the patience of the United States, which has decided to "refrain from taking tough steps against Japan until after the prime minister carries out the political reform," is wearing thin.
