SUMMARY: This action adds to the Procurement List commodities and services to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, Suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 15 and 22, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 F.R. 36168 and 37466) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodities and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than small organizations that will furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodities and services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Commodities Stamp, Rubber 7520&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0084 7520&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0085 7520&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0086 (Requirements for the Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho) Printing and Binding ``En Garde'' Newsletter 7690&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0079 (Requirements for the U.S. Government Printing Office, New York, New York) Services Janitorial/Custodial, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Miami, Opa Locka, Florida Janitorial/Custodial, Landrum Federal Building and U.S. Post Office, Jasper, Georgia Janitorial/Custodial, Clifford Davis Federal Building, Memphis, Tennessee Janitorial/Minor Maintenance, Lennon Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse, Wilmington, North Carolina.
