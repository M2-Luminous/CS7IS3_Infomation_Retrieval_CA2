If it had happened before the election of the prime minister [in the Diet], the SDPJ would not have voted for Mr. Tsutomu Hata, and consequently, the Hata cabinet could not have been formed. The exclusion of the SDPJ from the coalition immediately following the election is nothing else than a breach of political faith. It thus is natural for the SDPJ to have left the coalition. When Mr. Hata was elected prime minister, the mass media gave prominent coverage to Mr. Hata's political career and character, regarding him as "faithful," "honest," "a common man," and "earnest." But judging from what Mr. Hata has done to the SDPJ, I cannot say that he is an upstanding figure. I wonder whether he is defending himself in saying that everything was plotted by Mr. (Ichiro) Ozawa, who controls the Hata government from behind the scenes. When asked about the existence of the "dual-power" structure involving Mr. Ozawa, Mr. Hata said "even an actor has the right to choose a scenario," thus admitting that he is no more than an actor. However, even if the recent move was plotted by Mr. Ozawa, Mr. Hata has to take responsibility for choosing Mr. Ozawa's plan. I wonder how far Mr. Hata will play his role in a political drama scripted by Mr. Ozawa. It seems that Mr. Ozawa's plan for realigning the political parties is increasingly gaining momentum with the ultimate goal of materializing his plan to rebuild Japan by forming the Imperial Rule Assistance Association after breaking up all the existing political parties. If Mr. Hata, in taking part in such a plan to forcibly realign the political world, which breaks faith with the SDPJ, intends to carry out Mr. Ozawa's plan to rebuild Japan, he should stop considering himself a "common man" and should instead call himself "crafty" or "a person who always follows a high-handed person [Ozawa]." Now that the SDPJ has decided to secede from the coalition, it is unavoidable that the Hata cabinet will be short-lived. But there is the possibility that Mr. Hata will try to prolong the life of his cabinet by undermining the solidarity of the SDPJ and the Liberal Democratic Party. However, this may lead to further political turmoil, and we do not want see that. What the people want to see is the immediate dissolution of the Diet and a general election. Japan's politics is faced with a historic turning point, but what Japanese politicians are doing is instead only political warfare, and in such a situation, wherein the people's wishes are not being reflected, the wheel of history is about to turn. We should avoid this. What we expect from the new government is the dissolution of the Diet and a general election to hear the judgment of the people.
