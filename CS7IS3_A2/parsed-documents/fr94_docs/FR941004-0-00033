This has been reflected in the State permit number 1838T(M&hyph;2) dated October 16, 1991. The figures in the table for the waste gas vent have had the ethane component removed because the EPA policy does not treat ethane as a VOC. Currently, emissions from three of the VOC storage tanks (6L, 8S and 8T) are controlled. Discussion The State submittal was reviewed for compliance with requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 40 CFR part 51, and proposed and final ETPS published by the EPA on April 7, 1982 (47 FR 15076) and December 4, 1986 (51 FR 43814), respectively. The EPA Evaluation Report titled Alternative Emission Control Plan for Dow Chemical, U.S.A., has been prepared and updated to correspond with circumstances presented in this final rulemaking notice. Before the EPA would grant final approval of this bubble, the State of Louisiana was required to furnish the EPA with the following assurances specified in the proposed rulemaking: (1) That the State will document that none of the ERC was ever utilized in former planning to develop the SIP for the area so the entire 595.7 TPY serves as baseline; (2) that the State will document that the 407.5 TPY of remaining ERC designated for the bank is voided; (3) that the State will submit a revised, more enforceable permit_modeled after the ones finally issued and approved for Vulcan Materials Company, Geismar Chemical, and American Cyanamid Company Fortier facility bubbles and, ultimately, corresponding with the emissions table presented above; (4) that the State is addressing the post-87 SIP call; (5) that the State will submit a plan to demonstrate attainment for the area; and (6) that the State has resources to fulfill the requirements of numbers (4) and (5). On October 16, 1991, the permit was revised and a copy forwarded to the EPA. The State of Louisiana provided assurances addressing each of the six required elements in a letter to the EPA dated September 17, 1991.
