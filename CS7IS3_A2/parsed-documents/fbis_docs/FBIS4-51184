Fu Quanyou said: To effect rigorous troop management, we should first give top priority to the work of enhancing the political and ideological integrity of the troops; closely link study of the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping with the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, with the study of Chairman Jiang's important speeches and the principles and policies laid down by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, and with the study of the theories and basic knowledge about the socialist market economy; link such studies with the thinking and routine work of the troops; enhance the consciousness and firmness of officers and servicemen in carrying out the party's basic line; keep a high degree of uniformity ideologically and politically, and act in unison with the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission; and firmly obey the orders of the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core at any time and in any circumstances. It is necessary to strictly enforce discipline and take this as the central link in routine troop management. Routine troop management should be combined with routine ideological work. Resolute action should be taken to correct the loose and lax conditions in troop management, discipline enforcement, and the work style of the troops. Troops must act strictly according to orders and instructions issued by the upper commanders. Leading organs and officers must set a good example for their subordinates and men in this regard so that "iron units" in the logistics front will be created. The behavior of the troops must be strictly brought into line with the relevant orders, rules, and regulations so that a regular and orderly condition can be established in war preparations, training, routine work, and daily lives. Management of war materials must be strengthened, construction and management of infrastructural facilities must be improved, good state of war preparations should be kept for all types of materials, guarantees should be made that necessary materials and equipment will be delivered to the right places as soon as the orders are received, and efforts should be made to ensure implementation of the "Program for the Building of Grass-Roots Units." Fulfillment of all tasks for the logistical organs will eventually be dependent on the work of the grass-roots units. Party committees and commanding organs at all levels should, according to the "Program for the Building of Grass-Roots Units" and Chairman Jiang's five-point general requirement, regularize and guide the work of grass-roots units, attach importance to their work, concentrate attention on their work, guarantee various services for them, improve the ability of the grass-roots party branches to exercise comprehensive leadership, help grass-roots cadres command their men, and improve the material and cultural lives of officers and men so that a solid foundation can be laid for troop building. Fu Quanyou emphatically pointed out: Party committees and leading organs at various levels of the logistical front should, according to the instructions of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and Chairman Jiang, give education to cadres and soldiers with regard to outlook on life, values, and morals in connection with new conditions and problems; deepen education in patriotism, collectivism, and revolutionary heroism; effectively carry out the activities of "loving the valleys, loving the warehouses, and loving the work posts;" extensively carry out the activities of emulating such heroic figures as Lei Feng and Xu Honggang; guide officer and men to carry forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character pioneering spirit" advocated by Chairman Jiang, to willingly resist the corrosive influence of the decadent ideology, and to make themselves revolutionary soldiers meeting the "four requirements." Zhou Youliang, deputy director of the General Logistics Department, accompanied Fu Quanyou to inspect the work of the military unit in Wuhan.
