The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, told the NAM [Nonaligned Movement] foreign ministers meeting at Jakarta that Pakistan is misusing the forum by raising an issue which has to be resolved bilaterally. He said the foreign secretaries of the two countries had met recently and New Delhi had made proposals on resolving bilateral issues. Islamabad's reply is still awaited. He said violating the well-established NAM tradition, Pakistan had raised the Kashmir issue. He asserted that Kashmir is an integral part of India -- the largest practicing democracy with independent judiciary and a free press. Fundamental human rights for all its citizens are enshrined in the Indian Constitution. Mr. Bhatia was using the right to reply after a Pakistani delegate raised the issue at the meeting yesterday.
