[Scharping] We hope Roman Herzog will carry out his duties as excellently as Richard von Weizsaecker did. But that will remain a hope for the time being. The first speech by Roman Herzog did not suggest this. There were many things he should have said and did not. [Reporter] What do you mean by that? [Scharping] Well, no one will contradict him when Roman Herzog says he supports a tolerant, peace-loving Germany that is open to the world. But, you have to choose the appropriate words to do so, and also relate it to the conditions as they are in Germany -- high unemployment, the economic and social worries many people have, the justified concern that we are jeopardizing the basis of our existence too much. And, also, I think right now we have to give a clear signal in Germany that extremism, and violent right-wing extremism in particular, has no chance. And I hope the European elections on 12 June will give this signal. Unfortunately, Roman Herzog did not give this signal. I am not saying that he is not thinking this, but he did not say it. [Reporter] In his first speech, Roman Herzog said that he wants to represent Germany as Germany really is -- easy-going. What does that mean to you? [Scharping] I also asked myself that. [Reporter] In a first reaction, Chancellor Helmut Kohl described the election of Roman Herzog as a good omen for the Bundestag elections and said: We will sow the seeds in April and May, and in October we will bring in the harvest. What's your view on this? Has a preliminary decision been made? [Scharping] Even the vegetable growers in the Palatinate region and in Oggersheim [Kohl's home town] tell me it is right that the cabbage should be harvested in the autumn. The chancellor's statement also confirmed that this election was purely to do with holding onto power. And that influenced the decision much too strongly. If the Federal Assembly had been sovereign enough to support the visible wish of the majority of the population and to support the particularly high respect for Johannes Rau -- his great popularity right across Germany, right across all social and political groups -- then we would have had a different result. But, a legitimate decision was made. The Free Democratic Party [FDP] surrendered itself totally to Kohl's interest in holding onto power. And one thing is crystal clear now: Anyone who is conservative in Germany votes Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and anyone who has a social or liberal point of view, votes for the SPD. After the way it behaved, the FDP is no longer needed in this set up. [Reporter] So do you consider the FDP vote for Herzog as a rejection of what in terms of numbers could have been a possible social-liberal coalition? [Scharping] I noted with concern that Mr. Kinkel said that coalition considerations were the reasons why it was necessary to hold the test vote in his Federal Assembly group to get a majority together, and I also noted the comment by Roman Herzog. Overall, this is not a good advertisement for liberalism but for the wish, whatever the cost, to retain power. That is not the FDP which we got to know as a liberal party, and, in this respect Mr. Kinkel is taking an unusually difficult path for himself and his party. But that is his responsibility and I do not have to worry about that. [Reporter] Will the consequence be that you will seek to move closer to the Greens with a view to the elections in October? [Scharping] No. There is only one conclusion we draw from the presidential election and that is that a change in political leadership in Germany, which is urgently necessary, can only be achieved with the Social Democrats. And we will fight for this. The Federal Assembly made a decision on the basis of majority decisions mainly from 1990. The people will be able to make their first decision on 12 June [European elections]. We are appealing to all social and liberal and reasonable people in Germany to show what they think of the three rounds of voting in Berlin in the fourth round of voting. [Reporter] Mr. Scharping, in retrospect was it not a mistake by the SPD to nominate Minister President Rau? Would it have been better to nominate an eastern German, such as Richard Schroeder? [Scharping] If you look at the way that Mr. Kohl dealt with Mr. Heitmann, who did not even qualify for membership of the Federal Assembly, then you will soon recognize that Helmut Kohl has always played a tactical game with the office. First he proposed Johannes Rau. Then he brought into play the considerations which he cited and a few more things up to and including Mr. Heitmann. I think that the office of federal president has not deserved this handling characterized by power tactics. [Reporter] Nevertheless, would it not have been appropriate to place an eastern German at the head of our state and to give him an opportunity bearing in mind that all the other posts have been occupied by western Germans to date? [Scharping] In my view, the best person we have belongs at the head of our state and particularly in the office of federal president, and that person was clearly Johannes Rau. [Reporter] You have said that if the majority of the population had an opportunity to elect the federal president directly, Johannes Rau would probably have been elected and not Roman Herzog. Do you now seriously want to seek an amendment to the constitution in favor of direct election of the federal president? [Scharping] We are certainly seeking to clearly broaden the public's opportunity to take part in political decisionmaking and possibly in the election of the federal president. We have made these proposals within the constitutional affairs commission which has been dealing with reforms to the Basic Law. In my personal view, the whole process of reforming the Basic Law has progressed in a rather regrettable manner. All the initiatives from the civil rights movement of the collapsed GDR have not been adopted, including the possibility of a petition for a referendum or referendums themselves. We shall continue to pursue this with the aim of increasing the direct opportunities for the public to take part in political decisions. [Reporter] Can I put the question to you again: Do you want to seek the direct election of the federal president, yes or no? [Scharping] Against the background of this decision I do not want to put this up for discussion, because that looks immediately as if we are looking for a new procedure in a huff. However, I would like to point out that the present federal president, who enjoys great respect and recognition in the SPD, has raised the question of whether the procedure is the correct one if the members of the Federal Assembly make a decision ignoring the recognizable will of the majority of the public. This is a matter which has been raised by Richard von Weizsaecker. [Reporter] But was it not the oldest member of the Federal Assembly, 93-year-old Josef Felder, from the SPD, who warned against a direct election during the election. He spoke of the dangers that a populist might be elected as head of state. How seriously do you take such an argument? [Scharping] This is a serious consideration and therefore I would not like to shoot from the hip in the heat of the moment on this issue. It has to be weighed up very carefully and we have about four years in which to do this. [Reporter] Mr. Scharping, you have made forecasts in recent elections. The SPD has remained the same, the CDU/CSU have caught up a bit. There is a difference of just one point between the two major parties. Nonetheless you have managed to increase your personal lead over Helmut Kohl. Do you have difficulties passing on the popularity which you enjoy to your party? [Scharping] No, the SPD is making headway and you will see this on 12 June.
