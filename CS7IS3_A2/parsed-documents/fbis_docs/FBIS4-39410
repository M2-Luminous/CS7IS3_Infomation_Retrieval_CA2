Their Property Will Be Available for Purchase for One Ruble"] [Text] By the end of this month the first decisions will be made on competitive sell-offs of state enterprises considered insolvent. This was announced by Sergey Belyayev, chief of the Federal Administration on Insolvency (Bankruptcy) under the Russian Federation State Property Management Committee [Goskomimushchestvo], at a press conference yesterday devoted to the presidential edict "On Selling State Debtor Enterprises." All decisions will made by a special commission created by the Administration, taking into account the opinion of sectoral ministries and regional authorities. According to Goskomimushchestvo, approximately 100,000 Russian enterprises can today be classed as state controlled. Federal Administration on Insolvency (Bankruptcy) experts made a preliminary analysis of the payment balances of medium-size and large enterprises with a staff of over 1,000. The results of the examination have shown that approximately 1,500 enterprises with a state share in their incorporation capital of over 25 percent fall under the criteria of insolvency. The most difficult situation has developed in the textile industry, machine building, and the transport sector. By 1 July, according to Belyayev, his department will prepare a list of potential bankrupts. As of now 30 enterprises have been officially ruled insolvent, 20 of which are in Moscow. Moscow's predominance, however, administration officials explained, is in no way related to the confrontation between Goskomimushchestvo Chairman Anatoliy Chubays and Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov. It is simply that the proximity of the Moscow industrial region to federal power bodies makes Moscow a convenient ground for testing bankruptcy procedures. In spite of a large number of organizations that meet insolvency criteria under the presidential edict, Mr. Belyayev noted that the document's thrust is to prevent the real bankruptcy of state enterprises. The state legalizes its ownership rights in order to stop the spontaneous self-dissolution of enterprises, prevent latent unemployment, and in a civilized manner resolve the payments crisis, he said. The entire process -- from deeming an enterprise insolvent to making a decision to sell it -- envisions a whole number of procedures. Experience -- limited so far -- has shown that the stigma of insolvency serves as a good incentive for enterprise directors to repay their debts as soon as possible. If the old management fails to cope, the enterprise will pass under the trusteeship of the Federal Administration on Bankruptcy which will decide which is economically more effective: to restore its balance of payment or take it out of the production sphere. The criterion of "economic effectiveness" in decisionmaking will, however, be substantially influenced by existing social realities. First of all this will bear on so-called town/enterprises that contain more than 50 percent of the town infrastructure. In any event, administration officials believe, the extra-juridical bankruptcy procedure stipulated in the edict is more advantageous to enterprises than dealing with creditors in arbitration courts would be. The basic criterion in determining the bankrupts' selling price will be the sum of their unpaid debts. In this connection Belyayev did not rule out a hypothetical option whereby property can be acquired for a symbolic price of one ruble. Competition for bankrupt enterprises, Belyayev noted with optimism, will attract domestic and foreign investors because the edict allows them, in addition to debt obligations, to take control of the entire property at once. An objective analysis of the reasons for insolvency, it was noted at the press conference, will identify the range of enterprises really needing state support. Nonetheless, the state 1994 budget envisions subsidies only to coal mines. Until next year Goskomimushchestvo hopes for wide solicitation of extra-budgetary funds. By 1 September, the Federal Administration on Insolvency chief promised, a new bankruptcy law concept will be published.
