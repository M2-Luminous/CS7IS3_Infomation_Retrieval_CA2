First, concerning the backup measures, the main objective of this CFA franc adjustment was the restoration of our economies' competitiveness, which should significantly increase exports and investments. However, in order to ensure the success of the CFA adjustment and achieve the objectives that we sought, it was absolutely necessary to adopt a set of backup measures, which government endeavored to implement after the decision was announced. The government's first objective was to check inflation and uncontrolled price increases. Thus, the machinery to control price increases following the devaluation was immediately set up. On 13 January, a decree was signed by the president of the Republic aimed at freezing, for a maximum period of three months, the prices of 34 items which were considered essential. [passage omitted] What is the bottom line on the devaluation at the end of these first five months? On the whole, the balance sheet could be said to be positive. First, the results obtained in the area of inflation are very encouraging, since the rate for the first four months of this year stood at about 21 percent. Even better, the monthly consumer price index trend since the devaluation shows a downturn in the inflation rate. For example: The consumer price index for an African household headed by a workman registered a monthly increase of 8 percent in January -- the month of the devaluation -- 6 percent in February, 5 percent in March, and down to 1 percent in April. Similarly, the consumer price index for an African household headed by a professional also showed a monthly increase -- of 9 percent -- in January, before falling gradually to 1.5 percent in April. The index for a European household, which, as everybody knows, involves more imported goods, registered a 17-percent upturn in January -- before stabilizing at about 7 percent in February and March, and then falling to 2 percent between March and April. The obvious result is that we are winning the battle with inflation, and this is thanks to the support of the entire private sector and all the different social categories of the population. Already we can see that the prices of certain specific items have stabilized, or even dropped. This significant progress made in the area of prices shows that the devaluation is being well managed, and that, for the moment, it is a success. It is a success for everyone, Ivorians and resident businessmen in Cote d'Ivoire, who have shown a great sense of responsibility on this issue. I would therefore, on behalf of the head of state and the government, like to thank them for the efforts and sacrifices they made in managing the devaluation. The second area of satisfaction concerns the trend in public finance. Looking at the trend in revenue and expenditure, we can say that the primary balance -- the balance between revenues and primary expenditures -- of the state's financial operations has improved significantly, and stands at a very positive level of about 100 billion, as against the 57 billion projected under the program. This trend is expected to continue in the coming months and years, and should enable a gradual reduction in the payment of mostly domestic arrears, which is a vital factor for economic revival. The third area of satisfaction is the resumption of economic activities. Of course, it is early yet to talk of very appreciable growth. However, the blossoming of activities that we have observed indeed confirm that there is a reversal of trends. The reasons for this phenomenon are many: The restoration of the Ivorian economy's ability to compete, the gradual return of the private sector's confidence in the post-devaluation running of affairs, political stability, and the social peace prevailing in Cote d'Ivoire, despite the considerable shock caused by the devaluation. All these factors explain the changes currently taking place within our economy. Thus, for the first quarter of this year, the index for industrial production increased by 5 percent; for agro-industry, it rose by 15 percent; and for the electricity and water sector, by 8 percent during the same period. This favorable development is even more evident in the area of the country's external trade. The restoration of competitiveness led to a 13- percent increase in the volume of exports during the first quarter of this year resulting mainly from a substantial increase in the export of food crops to other countries, rough and processed timber, and especially industrial goods, whose volume increased by about 34 percent for the same period. This really shows that the devaluation has opened up new development prospects for our goods in external markets. Concerning imports, the trend is also encouraging. The volume of food imports decreased by about 3 percent during the first quarter of this year, which also shows a gradual change in eating habits of Ivorians, who now tend to consume more locally produced goods, thus reducing the need to import foreign goods. As for the monetary situation in our country, the process is going smoothly and positively and it is marked by a money supply worth 112.04 billion CFA francs which is an increase amounting to 149 billion CFA in terms of external assets. For the money supply, this evolution is characterized essentially by an increase in bank deposits worth 106.03 billion due mainly to the progress made in increased assets in the private sector amounting to 14 billion CFA francs. This, in conjunction with the return of private capitals, added to the automatic effect of the devaluation on the upturns of export goods. As for external assets, the 149 billion-increase is the result of the loans by the Central Bank of West African States of 49.9 billion CFA francs and the reorganization of the banks' external statements of 99.1 billion CFA francs. The Ivorian banks have now become creditors vis-a-vis overseas banks. As for internal debts, they are now reduced to 75.5 billion CFA francs, compared with December 1993. This reduction is achieved through joint government's aid that has also been reduced to 21.8 billion, and economic loans that have been reduced to 57.3 billion CFA francs. [passage omitted] The devaluation should enable us to start afresh. The first indicators I briefly presented showed that we are on the right path. Indeed, much remains to be done. We should therefore make more efforts to achieve economic growth and significantly reduce unemployment, particularly within the ranks of the youth. The palliative measures aimed at rural areas should continue. The productive sector should be more dynamic in order to integrate this new environment by seeking new markets by increased production. Efforts are to be still made at the level of interest rates which should be reduced. The banking system should play a leading role in the financing of investments necessary for economic revamping. [passage omitted] In conclusion, all this is aimed at achieving an increase in the kind of economic growth we enjoyed in the past and at making Cote d'Ivoire -- like the Asian dragons -- an African elephant of which Ivorians and Africans would be proud. An African elephant, that is, a country with a solid, sound, and diversified economy, capable of efficiently and victoriously resisting the various economic storms. An economy with an agriculturally and industrially diversified basis and a sector of functional services immune to variations in agricultural product prices. All these efforts would yield results only if peace prevails as President Henri Konan Bedie stressed on May Day. A peace that was dear to our founding father, late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Therefore, we must continue to work together under the high authority of President Henri Konan Bedie for a better future for Cote d'Ivoire and in order to see this great Ivorian dream come true. Thank you. [passage omitted]
