Heads of the ``Greenpeace'' hazardous waste group Kevin Stairs and the Baltic Sea group Rune Leithe-Eriksen attempted to convince the minister to adopt stricter measures against import of hazardous waste. Estonia has joined the Basel convention on the transport of hazardous waste and its national requirements are even stricter than those of the convention. But Estonia has been opposing a total ban, which would prevent import of any materials. Tarand pointed out that the Tallinn Water Treatment Plant uses certain titanium waste which comes under the intended ``Greenpeace'' ban. The Estonian Green Movement intends to hold a news conference today to express its opinion.
