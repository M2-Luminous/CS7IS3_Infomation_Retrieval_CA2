Gao Dezhan made an important speech at the conference. In her speech, Li Huifen, vice mayor of the municipal government, set forth specific requirements for reforming the industrial enterprises. Responsible comrades of the municipal economic commission, made specific arrangements for deepening the industrial enterprises. At the conference, the leading cadres at or above the bureau level on the industrial front submitted to the municipal government letters of responsibility for fulfillment of fixed tasks. The machinery bureau and the Tianjin magnetic products company introduced their experiences at the conference. Gao Dezhan said in his speech: Since the beginning of this year, the broad masses of cadres and the staff and workers of the industrial front have conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the second session of the sixth municipal party committee and the municipal economic work conference, rapidly taken action, firmly attended to their work, and solidly carried out their jobs. So, the situation in the first two months was very good. That various industrial bureaus and the municipal economic commission submitted letters of responsibility for fulfillment of fixed tasks to the municipal government today embodies the high sense of enterprise and the sense of high responsibility possessed by the leaders at various levels on the industrial front. This is a major measure for fulfilling the 1994 tasks for deepening enterprise reform and promoting economic development. He hoped that the comrades on the industrial front should continue to make efforts, maintain and develop the current gratifying situation, make new improvements, big breakthroughs, and big headway in this year's industrial production. Gao Dezhan set forth three opinions on industrial enterprises' reform and development. First, we should deepen reform, make comprehensive improvement, and concentrate efforts to achieve and enliven industrial enterprises. Gao Dezhan said: Enterprises should be taken as a foundation in developing the economy. Enterprises are the foundation. Only when enterprises are vigorous will Tianjin become prosperous and vitalized. Tianjin has a good foundation and many favorable conditions for development. However, the municipality is also confronted with many difficulties and problems. We should rely on vitalized enterprises and enterprises' good economic results to solve these problems. The industrial department should adopt major measures to change the appearances of the enterprises having difficulties, accelerate the development of good enterprises, and enhance the strength of the municipality's industries. We should be determined and actively go into action to vitalize enterprises. The leaders at various levels should enhance the sense of urgency, the sense of crisis, and the sense of responsibility to enliven enterprises as soon as possible. To enliven enterprises, we should foster the idea of relying on reform to promote development, take reform as motivation, take efficiency as a central link, give different instructions to different enterprises, and make comprehensive improvement. We should do a good job in using foreign capital, readjusting structures, intensifying management, developing products, and conducting technological transformation, and building leading bodies. By deepening reform, changing mechanisms, and increasing economic results, we should ensure that more is handed over to finance, that enterprises obtain more, and that staff and workers gain more. We should focus the deepening of enterprise reform on changing the enterprise managerial mechanism; continue to implement "the enterprise law" and "regulations" well; no longer limit small accounting units within enterprises; deepen the reform of the labor personnel, wage, and distribution systems; streamline organizations; and reform and perfect the organizational managerial system. In addition to enhancing internal functions, enterprises should also positively create good external conditions. It is necessary to vigorously advocate the practice of doing solid deeds for enterprises. The departments in charge of the overall work, the departments in charge, and administrative and law enforcement departments should support enterprises and turn on green lights for enterprises' reform and development. We should go deep to the grass roots to actively serve enterprises, try every possible means to help enterprises solve their problems, and adopt realistic measures to continuously reduce enterprises' burden. Second, we should conscientiously implement the system of responsibility for fulfillment of fixed tasks and ceaselessly upgrade the leadership level. Gao Dezhan said: Carrying out this system is a specific indicator for doing solid work and firmly fulfilling tasks as well as an important guarantee for promoting work and fulfilling tasks. So, at the time of defining targets and implementing tasks, we should be sure to be realistic, rigid, and perfect. That is, tasks should be assigned to individuals; targets should be advanced and fixed persistently according to high standards, high starting points, and the general requirements of the municipality; and the contents of the tasks should be complete and reach general levels. On the basis of grasping the work of his own department, each and every leading cadre at or above the bureau level on the industrial front should take charge of the work of two good enterprises and two money-losing enterprises, use the experiences of the good to promote overall work, and strive to make key breakthroughs. We should persist in the system of responsibility for fulfillment of fixed tasks and regularly examine the implementation of the system. It is necessary to examine and assess every season to make a general assessment at the end of the year. The assessment should be linked with the assessment of cadres' political achievements. Third, we should comprehensively implement the "222 project," change as soon as possible the appearances of the industries, and restore the prestige of Tianjin's industries. Gao Dezhan said: The second plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee set forth the necessity to implement the "222 project." That is, grasp two large key enterprises, namely the general vehicle industrial corporation and the steel tube company; grasp 20 municipal-level key enterprises; and grasp 200 key enterprises at the bureau, district, and county level. These enterprises are key enterprises of Tianjin as well as pillar industries. They must attain advanced international and domestic levels, become enterprises with large amounts of profits and taxes, and play a decisive role in the municipality's economic development. Upon the successful accomplishment of this project, these enterprises will become a model of reform and management and make greater contributions to developing the economy in a better and faster manner. All fronts should pay high attention to this project, make concerted efforts to grasp it, perfect plans, implement measures, give preferential treatment to key enterprises, and carry out the project in a ladder- like manner. We should concentrate energy on grasping the work of key enterprises to promote the work of the ordinary ones, ensure that good enterprises improve and groups of good enterprises emerge, also carry out the principle of selecting the best and eliminating the bad, gradually balance the paths, embark as soon as possible on the orbit of taking a favorable turn in Tianjin's industries, and realize the grand target of restoring the prestige of Tianjin's industries.
