The coldest temperatures were registered closer to the middle of the month, when the freezing Arctic air penetrated all the way to southernmost latitudes. On clear nights the temperature in many cities in Russia and the Baltic countries dropped below the absolute lowest values. On 12-13 February new cold records were registered in Kursk, Voronezh, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, Saratov, Astrakhan, Krasnodar, and Kaliningrad; in Ufa on 12 February the cold temperature reached the -40 degree mark. Thus February has lived up to one of its names--"the severe month." However, as the end of winter approached, there were few blizzards and snowstorms. Only during the last days of the month did the snow swirl descend. Still, despite the cold, on clear days we were cheered by the sun and the anticipation of imminent spring. Ahead of us is March--the morning of the year. True, the first half of March is still winter in the middle belt of Russia and the north of the country: solid snow cover, frequent blizzards and snowstorms. On a considerable part of the European territory of the country, however, the average 24-hour temperature climbs above the freezing mark, and in the southern parts of the country (Sochi) it rises above five degrees. The day of 22 March is the spring equinox, the beginning of spring astronomically. The number of sunshine hours increases. The snow begins to melt. In the north and the middle belt of Russia there is still ice cover on rivers in March; in the south of the European territory (the lower part of Volga, Don, and Dnieper) the ice begins to break. Even more noticeable than in February will be the increase in daylight hours. And the sun's warmth reaching the earth's surface will be twice as great as in February. This is a dangerous time for orchards. The trunks of fruit-bearing trees crack because of sharp fluctuations in temperature over the 24-hour period. If the orchard is neglected at this time and the trees are not stained with bleach, they will be traumatized and may die altogether.
