These attitudes have deviated from the principles governing the peace process. It is clear that such attitudes seek to circumvent these principles instead of being a motive to rectify the course of these principles, which has been marred and obstructed by Israeli policies and practices. The reservations--which were expressed only by the United States over the term "occupied" in reference to the Israeli-occupied territories, including Jerusalem, in return for a mere oral condemnation of the terrible massacre--amount to blackmail which would grant Israel a false legitimacy regarding the status of Jerusalem. These reservations also violate the international resolutions which consider this holy city as an occupied territory and regard Israel's annexation of Jerusalem as null and void and an illegal measure. Stemming from Jordan's realization of both this serious situation and the political facts which could result from it under the aegis of the UN Security Council, the Jordanian leadership and Government have embarked on a high-level political move to circumvent the ongoing attempts regarding Jerusalem's legal status and cautioning against the dangers posed by any resolution which would ignore Jerusalem's legal and legitimate status as part of the peace process. This could undermine the whole peace process and bring things back to square one in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The contacts held between His Majesty King Husayn and Presidents al-Asad, Mubarak, and 'Arafat and King Hassan II, as well as the summoning by the minister of state for foreign affairs of the ambassadors of the five permanent Security Council member states and other council members both emanate from the bases of the consistent Jordanian position on holy Jerusalem. King Husayn asserted that sovereignty over Jerusalem will only be that of God, and that Jerusalem will remain a holy city which is yearned for by all believers in God from the three monotheistic religions. The inclusion in the Security Council resolution of the condemnation of the bloody Friday events in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and a demand for effective international protection measures for the defenseless Palestinian people against the oppression of the occupation army and the Zionist extremists and terrorists should not mean selling out the Arab character of holy Jerusalem or relinquishing this city for the cheap price Israel is trying to push under the aegis of the United Nations and its Security Council through absolute U.S. support. In view of this serious situation and the great challenge posed to one of the holiest Arab and Islamic places, the Arab and Islamic nations are now urged to adopt a decisive and effective position to confront the usurpation, exclusion, and annexation of Jerusalem by the Zionist entity. Stemming from a sensing of the danger and feeling of national and pan-Arab responsibility, we appeal to the Arab and Islamic leaders to rise to the level of this challenge and ignore all differences, trifles, and tribal fanaticism, as well as support the Jordanian move designed to close ranks, unify the Arab position, and champion both Jerusalem and the Palestinian people, who are standing fast on their land with unwavering faith, thwarting the danger, and paying the tax of blood, souls, and jihad, before it is too late.
