The first time that the words "Red Sun" appeared in the Ecuadoran press was on 2 January 1992. Lost among the pages of the Red columns, the newspapers published the report of a dynamite attack on the Offices of the Supreme Electoral Court in Quito, which occurred during the night of 31 December 1991. That morning, a flyer had been circulating in the media editorial rooms. In it, a certain "General Ruminahui Revolutionary Commando" group took credit for the act. It also predicted the resumption of the armed struggle during 1992, hailed "Marxism-Leninism-Maoism," and called for a struggle on behalf of "the Red Sun of liberation." No one paid much attention. Nor had anyone done so in Lima 12 years earlier, when, during May 1980 (a day before the elections), five hooded persons entered the electoral office in Chuschi, Ayacucho, tying up the official in charge and burning the ballot boxes. It marked the beginning of the Shining Path war, whose spread through Latin America apparently is being attempted. During 1992, at least 14 attacks claimed by "Red Sun" were reported. Most of them were dynamite explosions in public offices during the early morning hours, explained as a rejection of the privatization plans of Sixto Duran Ballen's government. By 1993 (after Abimael Guzman's capture), "Red Sun's" activity had declined considerably: Only three attacks were reported, one on the trans-Ecuadoran oil pipeline (causing only minor damage). Although, last August, the defense minister, General (ret.) Jose Gallardo, after admitting the existence of "Red Sun" to the Congress, described it as "incipient and under control"; one fact is true: a minuscule Maoist group with a clearly Shining Path orientation has declared war against the Ecuadoran state. According to Simon Strong, a British journalist and expert on Shining Path, "The rebels have demonstrated that, once the phase of embryonic entrenchment in one locality has been completed, depending on the strategic circumstances, they will make their power felt." Unlike the Peruvian forces of order, those of Ecuador have one advantage: they have been warned. Who Are They, Where Are They? What is known about "Red Sun"? Two years since the start of its armed activities, the state intelligence services are able to draw a profile: It is a small Maoist group (calling for the prolonged people's war), consisting of approximately 50 militants (and some 300 sporadic sympathizers), operating primarily in university environments. They are headed by a central committee, consisting of five members whose names are unknown, and which is structured in the form of regional and base committees. For the present, the group's power appears very slight, and its destiny, linked to the survival or nonsurvival of Shining Path, on which it depends ideologically, financially, and militarily. Its origin is not very clear: Police intelligence attributes it to a meeting of dissidents from Alfaro Lives and Montoneras Free Fatherland (held about 1990), headed by Kleber Gia Bustamante. According to naval intelligence, however, its origin lies in the breakoff of a Maoist branch of the old Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Ecuador, which reportedly has made contact with the International Revolutionary Movement, the Communist International, over which Abimael Guzman wields an influence. The police theory (pointing to Alfaro Lives dissidents) agrees with the findings of the Peruvian police investigations. In 1991, Victor Malca, the Peruvian interior minister, claimed that Shining Path was possibly allied with a faction of Alfaro Lives. He remarked: "They say that they have laid down their arms, but there is a small group among them apparently linked with Shining Path, and operating in the Piura sierra region, near Huancabamba." Marco Troya, an AVC leader, denied the story, asserting: "Although we respect Shining Path, we do not agree with its methods." Edgar Frias, one of the two survivors of the AVC central commando group, commented: "I was in Peru, but Shining Path was something totally different; we had no relationship whatsoever." Pedro Moncada, one of the high-ranking cadres in AVC, which is currently attempting to become a legal party, gave a forceful denial: "We do not know anything about it." Nevertheless, the Naval Intelligence Service has followed a different path: Its members claim that "Red Sun" is the armed representative of the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Communist Party of Ecuador (PCMLE-Maoist), a radical faction of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Ecuador. They call it an organization that has proposed the "armed struggle" since 1964, when it broke off from the Communist Party, linked internationally with Moscow. Nicknamed "the Chinese," because it is identified with Mao Tse-Tung's revolution and the People's Republic of China, the PCMLE maintained a critical position toward the electoral system. It developed mainly in university environments and in the teachers' union organization, but became increasingly distant from Beijing until about 1975, when its linkage with the Communist Party of Albania began. In 1979, PCMLE militants became established as a political party, taking as its name the Democratic People's Movement [MPD]. Although it is denied officially, the MPD is considered the legal and public representative of the PCMLE, operating in the teachers' union through the National Union of Teachers, UNE, and in university environments through the University Leftist Revolutionary Front, FRIU. Clandestine, and governed by a five-member central committee, the PCMLE reportedly received a delegation from the Shining Path organization in Europe during 1989, to propose its affiliation with the Peruvian revolution. The details are unknown, but the central committee apparently refused to submit to "Gonzalo's Thought" (as Abimael Guzman's philosophy is called). The dissidents, who were expelled, became united in the PCMLE-Maoist. According to naval intelligence, that same year they reportedly joined with the dissidents from Alfaro Lives and Montoneras Free Fatherland. From Mao to Guzman "For 29 years, the PCMLE has preached armed struggle without ever moving to action." This statement was made by an "ex-Chinese" who was later a militant in Alfaro Lives. Now a member of the group that surrendered its arms to the Rodrigo Borja government, he is attempting to form a new political party, Patriotic Union. He added: "That preaching of armed struggle is the principal means of attracting members but, since nothing ever happens, there is never a move to action. As soon as they arrive, they leave. For that reason, if those dissidents are involved, it is possible that a faction of the PCMLE has succumbed to the influence of President Gonzalo" (the title by which Abimael Guzman is known). That preaching of armed struggle and the PCMLE's development in university environments have prompted the state intelligence services to discern a possible "Red Sun" stronghold at Guayaquil University. They cite a student demonstration on the outskirts of the university compound in September 1992, against the government's economic measures. During it, slogans were chanted calling for the release of Abimael Guzman, then recently captured in Lima. They also cite the statements made by an ex-FRIU militant, Joffre Macias, a student of obstetrics at Guayaquil University. In September 1993, he assured the press that "Red Sun" would have its base of operations at Guayaquil University, and would be headed by the MPD. Gabriel Cabrera, spokesman for the PCMLE in Guayas, declared: "I believe that `Red Sun' is a creation of naval intelligence, and they want to implicate us, because we are the only ones maintaining the basic principles of the revolution in this country." Immediately after Joffre Macias's accusations, the ex-MPD deputy, Jaime Hurtado, denied them; and the present deputy and UNE leader, Juan Jose Castello, called the defense minister to Congress. General (ret.) Jose Gallardo neither confirmed nor denied anything. He commented: "Military intelligence has not prepared any report intended to establish the links that might exist between `Red Sun' and the MPD." He also stated that "Red Sun" exists, and that its members have been identified, as have the national and foreign organizations with which they are connected. Based on the statements of Jaime Cortez Pozo (a 19-year-old Quito native and university student, the first one arrested on charges of belonging to "Red Sun"), a November 1993 police report cited Kleber Gia Bustamante as a member of the "Red Sun" central committee. His present whereabouts are a mystery. His father, Clemente Gia Gia, claims: "After 13 years of struggle he obtained his release, and is now enjoying all his citizen's rights. He is a scholar, an ideologue, who has been in Europe for years, studying and working on research." If he has joined the International Revolutionary Movement, as the security services think, it is likely that we shall have more news about him sooner or later. [Box, p 11] Kleber Gia: In "Red Sun"? Kleber Elias Gia Bustamante, accused by the police of being a member of the "Red Sun" central committee, has been living clandestinely since his escape from the Garcia Moreno Prison, where he was held accused of assassinating the industrialist, Jose Antonio Briz Lopez. In October 1990, the third judge of criminal proceedings in Pichincha, Gonzalo Falconi, pronounced the invalidity of the process by prescription. Since then, Kleber Gia has been legally free; however, his whereabouts are unknown. According to his father, he is living in Europe, a claim corroborated by his ex-comrades from M-19: "Kleber was never a Maoist. His ideological training is incompatible with Shining Path."
