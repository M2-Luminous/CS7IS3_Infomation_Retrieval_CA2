Samdech Hun Sen and I are very pleased to meet again with His Excellency the Vietnamese prime minister and other high-ranking officials of the Vietnamese Government in our land. His Excellency Vo Van Kiet warmly welcomed our delegation on a visit to Vietnam in August 1993. During the visit, we exchanged views on various issues of our respective countries and those of the region. It was a great honor for our delegation to be received by His Excellency Le Duc Anh, president of the SRV, and His Excellency Do Muoi, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Through that visit, we have gained new ideas about the Cambodia- Vietnam cooperation relations, especially our determination to continue talks on various issues which are aimed at expanding cooperation between our two nations. We unanimously agreed that we will give priority to cooperation projects related to the economic, trade, scientific-technological, tourism, and other essential domains. We still have many issues that require consistent consultation and discussion so as to strengthen and develop the relations of friendship and cooperation between our two peoples. We have but a common mission; I am convinced that our two states and governments have the same aspiration of maintaining long and lasting peace, security, and stability. We have built a fine, healthy atmosphere with an aim to consolidate the relations of friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness. These are factors that help strengthen relations between our two peoples. Our struggle for prosperity and happiness at present not only serves the interest of peace and stability in the Southeast Asia region, but also in the Asia-Pacific and the world. On this occasion, I would like to express the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia's gratitude to the SRV Government for its positive contribution to restoring peace and stability in Cambodia through the signing of the 23 October 1991 Paris Agreement on Cambodia. We still have many important issues to be resolved. We are confident, however, that we can resolve them through the principle of respecting each other's national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and noninterference to each other's internal affairs as well as in the spirit of respecting the Kingdom of Cambodia's neutrality. His Excellency the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, I would like to express our appreciation on U.S. President Bill Clinton's correct decision to lift the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam. This has created new relations between the United States and the SRV and through which various nations in the region are gaining potential to quickly develop their economies. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you, together with me, to turn our attention to a great personage who has brought about peace to the Kingdom of Cambodia: Samdech Norodom Sihanouk. I have the honor to invite His Excellency the Prime Minister, Their Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen to a toast for the good health of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk, the esteemed King of the Cambodian people. I would like also to propose a toast for the good health and happiness of His Excellency Le Duc Anh, president of the SRV, and of His Excellency Vo Van Kiet, prime minister of the SRV; for the happiness and prosperity of the Vietnamese and Cambodia peoples; for the good health and success of Their Highnesses; and for the good health of Excellencies, Samdech Hun Sen, and all ladies and gentlemen who are present here. Thank you very much. [end recording]
