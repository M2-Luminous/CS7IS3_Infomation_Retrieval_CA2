Both countries play "a major, if not decisive role" in the creation of a European security system, Naumann said in an interview with (the Friday edition of) the Moscow army newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. Naumann does not rule out the joint deployment of German and Russian peace troops in UN missions. Naumann voices the view that blame should not be apportioned to one side only in the conflict in Bosnia. He hopes all the warring parties will comply with the NATO ultimatum. Naumann has been on a four-day visit to Russia this week, during which he met Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.
