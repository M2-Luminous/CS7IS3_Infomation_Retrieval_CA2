FR940504-1-00062 FR940504-1-00018 Comment: The comments on the assessment of lost nonuse values were widely divergent but generally fell into two primary schools of thought. One set of commenters thought that trustee officials should have the discretion to decide on a case-by-case basis when lost nonuse values should be included in a damage assessment. These commenters stated that assessment of lost nonuse values is necessary to ensure that the public is made whole for natural resource injuries. One commenter noted that inclusion of lost nonuse values in damage assessments is particularly crucial in the case of injuries to tribal resources because of the special spiritual and cultural significance that natural resources hold for Indian tribes. Some commenters stated that if the Department does not include provisions for assessing lost nonuse values in the regulations, then the Department would send inappropriate economic signals to PRPs and could cause risky activities to be directed toward pristine environments where use values are very low. Further, this set of commenters thought that CV is a reliable methodology for calculating lost nonuse values. Some of these commenters stated that studies purporting to demonstrate that CV produces unreliable results have failed to distinguish between well and poorly designed CV surveys. A few of these commenters took issue with the Department's discussion in the July 22, 1993, Federal Register notice of the potential for bias in CV studies. Some commenters stated that the Department had failed to recognize that the real bias lies in using methodologies that consistently undervalue public losses by computing compensable value based solely on lost use values. Other commenters questioned the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993, Federal Register notice that although all valuation methodologies have potential reliability problems, CV, when used to estimate lost nonuse values, poses more significant problems because the per-person bias is multiplied by a larger population. These commenters thought that the Department's line of reasoning, if taken to its logical extreme, would dictate the nonsensical result that only small values should be measured. A number of commenters made reference to the report issued by the NOAA panel. According to these commenters, the NOAA panel report concluded that CV can produce reliable estimates of lost nonuse values. The other set of commenters thought that the rule should not include any provisions for the assessment of lost nonuse values. These commenters stated that assessment of lost nonuse values is not necessary to compensate the public because trustee officials already have the discretion to assess lost use values in addition to the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources. These commenters stated that assessment of lost nonuse values was inconsistent with general legal principles designed to prevent speculative damages. For example, the commenters noted that courts only allow certain categories of individuals to recover damages for pain and suffering in tort cases. Other commenters stated that allowing assessment of lost nonuse values would be punitive because it amounts to charging PRPs for hurting the public's feelings. Some commenters expressed concern that allowing assessment of nonuse values could drive companies out of business and cause an increase in consumer prices. A few commenters expressed skepticism that nonuse values were actually economic values. This set of commenters also thought that CV cannot reliably calculate nonuse values. These commenters stated that the results of CV studies are inconsistent with rational decisionmaking. For example, a number of commenters cited CV surveys in which stated WTP did not respond to increases in the commodity being valued. Some commenters stated that the results of CV surveys are overly sensitive to the wording and administration of the survey instrument. Several commenters thought that CV results seem unrealistically high compared to actual contributions to environmental causes. Some commenters stated that such disparities result because CV respondents do not adequately consider their budget constraints when determining their WTP. A number of commenters thought that responses to CV surveys were likely to reflect feelings of vengeance toward PRPs or the warm glow of supporting a worthy cause rather than the respondents' actual WTP to prevent injury to the specific resources in question. Other commenters noted that CV studies require respondents to perform difficult valuation tasks with which they have little prior experience. A few commenters expressed particular concern about the public's ability to provide accurate values for injuries in industrial areas where contamination may exist that is unrelated to the release in question. Some commenters provided citations to studies purporting to demonstrate the unreliability of CV. A number of commenters stated that even some CV practitioners have called CV experimental. Other commenters noted that the NOAA panel did not conclude that CV could produce estimates of lost nonuse values that were reliable enough to be granted a rebuttable presumption. Rather, according to these commenters, the NOAA panel stated that even if a CV study met a number of strict standards, it would only be reliable enough to serve as a starting point in litigation. Therefore, these commenters thought that even if the Department allowed CV to be used to estimate lost nonuse values, it should not grant the results of CV studies of lost nonuse values a rebuttable presumption. Finally, most of the commenters who thought that CV was unreliable when used to estimate lost nonuse values also thought that this unreliability was the result of fundamental flaws that economists do not know how to correct at this time.
