FBIS4-34171 "drlat116_m_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-116 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 Brazil Presidential Candidates Seek Evangelical Vote Presidential Candidates Seek Evangelical Vote PY1506200694 Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 12 Jun 94 p 15 PY1506200694 Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO Portuguese BFN [Article by Claudia Trevisan] [Text] Orestes Quercia (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) [Workers Party] are the two presidential candidates who have taken the most concrete steps toward attracting evangelical voters. Quercia chose an Evangelical -- Iris de Araujo Machado -- as his running mate for the presidency. The PT campaign has a national evangelical committee charged with organizing pro-Lula evangelical committees in every capital city of the nation. The PT candidate is determined not to repeat the error he committed in 1989, when he lost most of the evangelical votes to Collor. All the presidential candidates regard the evangelical group -- consisting of 25 million people, 13 million of whom are voters -- as one of their priorities. The campaign that is least focused on the Evangelicals is that of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] presidential candidate. Deputy Lezio Sathler, a Presbyterian and the only PSDB evangelical member serving in Congress, said: "I have noticed a lack of action in that area. Cardoso must urgently shift his attention to the Evangelicals." Cardoso has the support of Deputy Salatiel Carvalho (PP-PE) [Popular Party-Pernambuco State], a member of the Assembly of God, who coordinated Fernando Collor's campaign among Evangelicals in 1989. Carvalho has not shown, however, great enthusiasm about this job. He said: "I am going to ask for votes for Cardoso to comply with my party's decision." PDT [Democratic Labor Party] candidate Leonel Brizola is well accepted in some segments of the evangelical community, especially in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] candidate Esperidiao Amin, who has already started to meet with Evangelicals, plans to intensify these meetings. Lula's attempt to strengthen his ties with the Evangelicals dates back to before the start of this electoral campaign. Presbyterian Pastor Caio Fabio, president of AEVB (Brazilian Evangelical Association), said: "For two years, I have met almost every month with Lula to pray and to read the Bible." In 1989 there were widespread rumors that, if elected, Lula would shut down all evangelical churches. The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God went so far as to compare Lula with the devil. Evangelical leaders note that Lula has managed to reduce resistance to his name, but not to the point of earning the majority of evangelical voters. Silva Malafaia, pastor of the Assembly of God church, said: "The PT ideology upholds materialistic views that are contrary to ours." Salatiel Carvalho also opposes Lula. He said: "I will ask for votes for any candidate running against Lula in a runoff." Most evangelical leaders believe that Quercia's decision to pick Iris de Araujo as his candidate for vice president will influence evangelical voters. Iris Araujo said: "The fact that a sister of the faith will be on the ticket will have a greater effect on evangelical voters." She said that an evangelical candidate will attract evangelical voters. She added: "We have to expand our field of action to change somewhat the materialistic mentality that prevails in today's world."
