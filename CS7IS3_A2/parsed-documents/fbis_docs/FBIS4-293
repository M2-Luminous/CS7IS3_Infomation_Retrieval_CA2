(In Paris, the Quai d'Orsay announced that there were reportedly "no survivors.") The Rwandan national radio did not broadcast any report more than three hours after eyewitnesses reported heavy weapons firing was heard around the airport shortly after 2100 local time (1900 GMT), a military official of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] has stated. The prime minister, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana told AFP that she has learned from UNAMIR Commander General Romeo Dallaire that the plane bringing the president back from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, had crashed but she could not get any official confirmation. UNAMIR has sent a team to the area to get more information, it was stated at the UNAMIR headquarters. All the Kigali inhabitants remained at home for fear of violent incidents in the capital, a Radio Kigali reporter said.
