The meeting chaired by both first deputy defense ministers -- Andrey Kokoshin and Mikhail Kolesnikov, who is also chief of the General Staff -- was prompted by a reason just as serious as any threat to the country's national security. Namely, money. Or, rather, by a lack of it. The Armed Forces have virtually no money even to pay salaries to officers and to maintain elementary combat readiness. Participants in the meeting of the Defense Ministry's commission on financial support to the Armed Forces and the implementation of the state defense order faced a very complex task: to choose on what the ministry's rather meager funds should be spent. The military can hardly be reproached for insatiable appetites. For reasons of economy they have already reduced even mobilization targets and given up plans to procure many types of weapons. But this has improved the situation only marginally because the state debts to the Armed Forces and enterprises carrying out defense orders have exceeded 3 billion rubles. At the same time, there is no longer any hope that the army will be rich enough to pull through on its own. A high-ranking official on the commission pointed out that "internal financial reserves of the Armed Forces have effectively been exhausted." In the end, the meeting decided that money should be spent first of all on the payment of money allowances, supplying of military units with food and electric power, and also the maintenance of nuclear security. Even these areas, however, will not have guaranteed funding: the withdrawal of troops from foreign countries and their accommodation in Russia will require extra spending. As for weapons procurements, combat command, control, and communications equipment, high-precision weapons, and electronic warfare equipment will still be a priority. The commission meeting results were summed up by Andrey Kokoshin. After the meeting he told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that "it is becoming harder and harder to ensure the combat efficiency of the Armed Forces given the current conditions of financing." Lower-ranking officials of the Defense Ministry, however, described the situation in the army in different, stronger expressions.
