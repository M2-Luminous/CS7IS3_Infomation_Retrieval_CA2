The meeting was transferred there from Stepanakert, where it was supposed to be, at the request of the CSCE and RF [as received] representatives. The reason was the bad weather that did not allow them to visit the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. As acting Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet Chairman Karen Baburyan told SNARK, the sides agreed that it was necessary to combine CSCE's and Russia's intermediary efforts in order to obtain stable and guaranteed truce. The latter will be the cornerstone of the further gradual settlement of all the problems connected with Nagorno-Karabakh. The Karabakh side, represented by the Supreme Soviet Chairman, as well as the Chairman of Karabakh State Committee for Defence Robert Kocharyan, and Foreign Affairs Minister Arkadiy Gukasyan, put forward their proposals. "I consider this meeting to be positive, at least because the representative of Russia came to Karabakh together with the Minsk Group representative," said, in particular, Karen Baburyan. In his words, this fact testifies to the tendency of combining the efforts of CSCE and Russia in the way of peaceful settlement of the conflict.
