The purpose of the meeting was to relaunch discussions with the various partners so as to rebuild the social, political, and economic fabric which has been torn up following the assassinations perpetrated in Burundi. The participants discussed the main issues on which no compromise was reached during previous meetings, notably a formal framework for consultation, the drawing up of an open schedule, and the profile of the future president of the Republic. All the participants agreed on one important point. They decided on a political truce and called on the Burundi people to stop the demonstrations, destruction, harassment, and intimidation. Apart from this meeting, Chairman Sylvestre Ntibantunganya of the Front for Democracy in Burundi, Chairman Joseph Nzeyimana of the Rally for Democracy and Economic and Social Development [RADDES], and the president of the Unity and National Progress Party [Uprona] made statements calling on their activists to act responsibly during these difficult times. First, here is the statement by Sylvestre Ntibantunganya: [Ntibantunganya] "I would like to tell Burundians who are listening to us either on radio or television that the current times in our country are difficult and that in order to surmount them, there is a need for positive contributions from everyone. We need peace, we need security. We need the establishment of trust between the various components of the Burundian nation, a nation which, if we are not careful, could go as far as breaking up. I therefore launch an urgent appeal to everyone to make a commitment to countering the danger. This country belongs to all of us in our diversities, ethnic, political, social or others. We therefore have to manage it, to live in it together without excluding anyone. We must manage it in security and ensure security for all. [passage omitted] "Henceforth, destruction, killing, and harassment of others must no longer be accepted. Burundi has had enough. Burundians have had enough and instead wish for the rapid restoration of peace. We have responded to this call by deciding, at the level of political parties, on a truce, a truce implying that the demonstrations, the destruction, the harassment, the intimidation, and all sorts of misfortunes, must be stopped rapidly. "We desire, at least at the level of our party, that the government will take all the adequate measures so that from tonight this can be achieved. We hope that all the partners understand that anyone who acts against the jointly expressed will will not be considered as being against such or such a political party or against such and such an ethnic group but against the Burundi people, who are vividly expressing their thirst for peace and security and their thirst to see trust reestablished among their components today. "Therefore, men and women, the young and old who are listening to us, come behind us, help us to reestablish the peace which is yours, you Burundi people, the peace which is yours, you youth, women, housekeepers but also educators of the youth, the peace which, if we are not careful, we could lose control of. Lets keep all this world for peace and in peace. That is the meaning of the political truce that we have decided. Thank you." The second statement is by Uprona parliamentary group chairman Jean-Baptiste Manwangari: [Manwangari]" [passage omitted] There is a real will on the part of all political parties and associations present here and on the part of government to build on something solid in order to restore peace to our country. We all insisted that the common interest will henceforth guide all party and government activities. We believe that our people have gone through so much suffering that they should not be deprived again of the peace which they so badly need. We therefore call on all forces to come together in the movement searching for peace. We call on activists to promote peace, so that trouble ceases, both in Bujumbura and in the countryside. We believe that everyone will have a place in seeking solutions, and we are convinced that although discussions have not yet ended, if everyone continues on the same path, we will reach a consensus on solutions so that no one feels left out in the restoration of peace. [passage omitted]" Last, let us listen to the statement by RADDES Chairman Joseph Nzeyimana: [Nzeyimana] "I wish to tell those who are listening to me on radio and television that the political parties and the various associations met today to discuss important issues which could help restore peace to this country. [passage omitted] "We call on citizens of this country--foreigners, those we have welcomed, those who came to invest, to keep the peace--to help us to succeed in the search for peace. We call on the youth and other forces to keep the peace and to await solutions and not to break windows, destroy people's huts, destroy houses, and especially not to kill. We ask you to wait for a while. Maybe you will get the solution you are seeking. Then we shall build a new Burundi with a new political framework, since we are moving towards a new social pact where nothing similar to what happened before can happen again; a pact that will ensure that no one kills his neighbor, that Hutus are not killed, that Tutsis are not killed, that Twas are not killed, that soldiers are not disturbed and that they do not kill others or get killed. Then, Burundi will be different, and we shall remake the image of this country in the eyes of foreign countries, since the outside world has started seeing us in a bad light. [passage omitted]"
