Strong-arm methods should not be used on the path toward peace, for force gives gives rise only to force." These words were uttered by North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov, who today received a Russian parliamentary delegation which is visiting the region. The delegation is headed by Valeriy Fateyev, member of the upper chamber's security committee. During the meeting between the president and the parliamentarians there was discussion of the problems of regulating the situation in the state of emergency zone on the territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. In the opinion of Akhsarbek Galazov, "the problem of the return of refugees must be solved in an integrated manner on the basis of the Kislovodsk agreements. In this complicated question the coordinating commissions which have been set up in all populated points of Prigorodnyy Rayon have the deciding word." Valeriy Fateyev told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the aim of the parliamentarians' visit to North Ossetia and Ingushetia is to gather objective information about the situation in the conflict zone, to assess the situation in the region, and to try to find a path toward peace and accord between the two republics. They are to have meetings with the leadership of Ingushetia, the interim administration, and various categories of refugees, and will visit populated points of Prigorodnyy Rayon. "The path toward peace and accord," Valeriy Fateyev stressed, "is long and hard, but it must be sought. There must be a stable situation in the northern Caucasus."
