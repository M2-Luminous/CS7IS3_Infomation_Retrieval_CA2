Whether this also means that Laar will continue as prime minister and that the Pro Patria-led rightist coalition will remain in power becomes clear after the four other coalition parties have announced their position on the issue. [passage omitted] Laar in remarks after his victory said that allegations about Pro Patria's dissolution or abandoning of the political scene didn't hold true and that "there is much more that unites us than what separates us." Laar in an interview with BNS said the decision made by the party general meeting had been a clearer one than anybody could have expected. "How strong will Pro Patria come out of the crisis now depends on what we do next and whether or not the diversities within Pro Patria can be healed," he said. It now hangs on the decision of Pro Patria's coalition partners whether or not Laar can also continue as prime minister. The parliament's deputy chairman, National Independence Party's Tunne Kelam told BNS Pro Patria's coalition partners had never unconditionally demanded that Laar should leave, but added that Laar's remaining in office had to be agreed upon with his and the other three parties in the coalition. The so-called "small coalition", or the ruling parties beside Pro Patria, earlier have said they would announce their prime minister candidate Monday. Laar's rival candidate in Saturday's vote, parliament Chairman Ulo Nugis has predicted that the legislative body will fail Laar in a confidence vote. Also one of Laar's fiercest rivals, his Cabinet's recently resigned Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, told BNS Saturday that the future of the current government depended on what the small coalition was going to decide. But Kannik declined to predict the outcome of a possible parliamentary confidence vote. Parliament Chairman Ulo Nugis, showing regret over entering the conflict, said the election outcome for him had been an unexpected one. "If it wasn't for the coalition partners' proposal, I maybe shouldn't have become active in the election of the party chairman," he said. The parliament leader said he had his own way in politics that didn't include becoming a prime minister. He added that what he did had been aimed at resolving the government crisis and helping the party on its way toward the next elections. Kaido Kama in comments on the election outcome said he considered a split in Pro Patria unlikely. "There are no major program-related diversities between different wings in Pro Patria," Kama said. But he added that Laar's re-election was no solution for problems inside the party. Finance Minister Heiki Kranich said he will hold his promise and step down. Kranich already last month said he will resign if the party congress re-elects Laar as chairman. Kama after the vote said that his anti-Laar party suffered a defeat because having been unable to bring enough members of the anti-Laar opposition to the congress. Kama said it would have been possible to bring some hundred more anti-Laar Pro Patria members to the congress. All rival candidates in their remarks to the meeting before the vote criticized Mart Laar for failures in his performance as prime minister. Kama warned the Pro Patria members that the party can retain good relations with its partners in the ruling coalition only if a new prime minister from Pro Patria is appointed to office. Kama promised before the vote that he as party chairman would "correct Laar's biggest mistake and restore a united team," and act according to guidelines by the party general meeting. Ulo Nugis in his remarks said Pro Patria's coalition partners wanted to have a new prime minister. "I have more power at the moment than the ruling party, because I have the support of a great deal of the parliament and of the Estonian people. Therefore, I was out for nothing when running for chairmanship -- I just wanted to extend my helping hand (to Pro Patria)," Nugis said. [passage omitted]
