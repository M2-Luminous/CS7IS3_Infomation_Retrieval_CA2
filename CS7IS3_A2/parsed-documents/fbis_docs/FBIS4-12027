The sources said that these negotiations are going through "a crisis," despite some positive statements. The Palestinian sources told MENA that the Israeli side continues to refuse to draw up a definite timetable for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. They added that the Israeli side is also refusing to draw up a timetable for the entry of the Palestinian police and specifications for the type of weapons to be used by this force. The Palestinian sources went on to say that the Israeli side, which has mainly used civilian negotiators with the exception of Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, wants to ignore the Palestinian military commanders' view of the security and military situation in Gaza and Jericho. They added that these commanders are demanding a definite timetable for the entry of their main forces into the Palestinian self-rule area in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. They are also demanding an agreement on the type of weapons needed for these forces to achieve security in the areas from which Israel will withdraw.
