Parliament speaker Tahir al-Masri met Defence Minister Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Rashid Al Maktum in Dubayy late Monday to convey greetings from King Husayn and Crown Prince Hasan, the agency said. They discussed the Middle East peace process and other Arab issues, it added without giving further details of the visit or saying whether al-Masri would meet President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan. It was the first visit to the UAE by a senior Jordanian official since Amman was ostracised by Gulf Arab states for its alleged sympathy with the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Jordan has denied such support and sought to mend fences with the Gulf but has been rebuffed. King Husayn tried to meet King Fahd of Saudi Arabia this month during a pilgrimage to Mecca but was shunned. However he has visited Oman and will go to Qatar. The two countries are the only members of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) that have not severed ties with Amman.
