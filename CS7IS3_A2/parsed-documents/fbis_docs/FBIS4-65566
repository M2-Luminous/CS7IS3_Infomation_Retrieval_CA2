Should this not have been yours? [Pagliarini] We discussed this during the negotiation stage of the formation of the government. However, I do not think that there are still problems. The responsibility should go to [Industry Minister] Gnutti. He will have to manage the layoffs with my agreement and with that of the treasury minister [Dini]. [LA VOCE] But was there not a Northern League move to give Lamberto Dini the authority? [Pagliarini] We have gotten to know each other better, and I am sure that there will be an agreement with Dini. We will not have great difficulty. Those who are speculating about presumed quarrels within the three-man team are making a big mistake. I have the impression that the government will not delude expectations, particularly on privatization. [LA VOCE] Then let us get down to details. Let us start with the mother of all privatization: STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company]. Is it true that you want this to be a public company? [Pagliarini] Certainly, we are even in favor of a super public company. However, STET must also manage to find strong industrial alliances. In the coming years there will only be five giants in the world telecommunications market. STET must have its cards in order to be one of these. [LA VOCE] So an alliance with [French] Alcatel-Alsthom will be all right? [Pagliarini] Let us put it this way: I think that perhaps it would be possible to find a partner that would offer STET better guarantees of success by looking in Asia, or in the United States. No, Alcatel is not the best. However, STET is open to offers. [LA VOCE] Excuse me if I am insistent. Will the Berlusconi government diligently take [former Prime Minister] Ciampi's last note on STET's privatization into consideration? [Pagliarini] I repeat that we are in favor of a public company. However, we will discuss everything again. Berlusconi's privatizations will not see any clashes between small shareholders and the Mediobanca-type shareholding. Decisions will be made wisely, case by case. [LA VOCE] Let us pass on to ENEL [National Electric Power Company]. What are the government's ideas? [Pagliarini] The hypothesis of the golden share over 10 years is good for ENEL. We still have to discuss the AGIP [Italian National Oil Company] issue in greater depth. We have to take measures that favor plurality, and avoid one thing in particular at all costs. [LA VOCE] What? [Pagliarini] We must avoid making harming the small saver. It is a risk that could be run with the privatization of STET, and that risk must be eliminated completely. Finally, privatization must be used to trigger off a real industrial policy.
