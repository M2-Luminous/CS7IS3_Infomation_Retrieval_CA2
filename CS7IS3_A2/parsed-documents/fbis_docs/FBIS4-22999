To this end, the effect of the delta sleep inducing peptide on the focal and generalized seizure activity and a model of chronically elevated seizure activity, i.e., the pharmacological kindling, are investigated. The particular problem of examining the effect of the delta sleep inducing peptide on the seizure activity when it is injected intravenously and determining the delta sleep inducing peptide concentration in the central mesencephalon segment which includes the reticular section of the substantia nigra under the condition of chronic seizure syndrome in rats which is formed by pharmacological kindling and is characterized by disintegration of endogenous control of brain stimulation and spastic readiness is addressed. The experiment is carried out on 20 2.2-3.5 kg cats, 280-320 g male Vistar rats (with at least ten animals in each group) and 18-24 g F-1/CBAXC57B1/6 mice (at least ten). The experimental procedure is outlined. The experiment shows that the delta sleep inducing peptide is capable of inhibiting the seizure activity in the foci created in the cortex of cats by strychnine application, developing a delayed seizure kindling syndrome in rats, and preventing the development of seizures in mice induced by bicucullin, pycrotoxin, and corazol but has no such effect on thiosemicarbazide and strychnine. The study reveals that the delta sleep inducing peptide's anticonvulsant activity is due to its effect on the reticular section of substantia nigra whereby the peptide level terminates is that section at the late stages of pharmacological kindling. It is speculated that this peptide may be one of the factors of endogenous control of the brain excitability. The findings demonstrate that the peptide and the preparations on its basis may be useful in developing new methods of cupping off and preventing the convulsion syndrome.
