After the talks the Latvian prime minister told reporters about what was discussed during the meeting with the Polish president. [Begin Birkavs recording] The Polish president's visit is a new stage in Latvian-Polish relations. There is a mutual desire to make our relations considerably more active in two main spheres -- security and economy. In the security sphere, a deeper military cooperation is meant. We have agreements which have already been concluded between the ministries of defense. Deeper military cooperation means cooperation within the framework of the Union of Baltic Sea Countries, cooperation between the Baltic region and the (Wyszogrod) region, and, of course, the development of bilateral relations between Latvia and Poland in the security context. We also discussed the problem of the Kaliningrad region where there an is extremely large concentration of armed forces, and about which the world knows practically very little at the moment. In the sphere of the economy we discussed our opportunities. So then, we are waiting for a Polish trade visit, an exhibition. We are waiting for the Polish prime minister's visit to Latvia. We discussed development of a transport corridor which is extremely necessary, including reciprocal ferry transport between Liepaja and Szczecin or Liepaja and other ports, Polish ports. Very good foundations have been created for Latvian-Polish relations, both legal foundations and also personal foundations in relations between the heads of the states. Mr. Walesa said: If I were once again to make a revolution, I would not make a mistake which I made in Poland. I would begin privatization much sooner, I would carry out it much more vigorously, and I would begin with large rather than small enterprises. I think Mr. Walesa answered precisely the question of whether the Latvian government is acting correctly when it is beginning a vigorous privatization process, or not. I think that this is Polish support for the Latvian Government. [end recording]
