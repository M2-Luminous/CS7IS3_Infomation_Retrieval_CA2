This has prompted the government to implement the real on 1 July. Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero's team believes the decision to introduce the real in July and to announce its implementation 35 days in advance will give the economic agents more security and reduce price readjustments. The Finance Ministry attributes the increase in prices after they were converted into URV to entrepreneurs' fear of an eventual price control and of a freeze on the basic foodstuff basket produce. The inflation in URV has made Ricupero give up the idea of implementing the real on 1 June.
