After this they went on to new victories. The LPA maintained its control of the situation and attacked the enemy fiercely at many points. In addition they resolutely beat back the large enemy offensive in the area of Phou Soung and the junction at Sala Phou Khoun 27 times, liberated Kasi District, Vang Viang District, Hinheup and other places and forced the American imperialists and the opposing side to sign the Geneva Treaty of 1962 for Laos and agree to the formation of the coalition government of the three factions which reunited Laos for the second time. In addition to supporting and using the rightist forces, the American intelligence department created a special force (the Vang Pao force). This was the second force under the direct command of the Americans. Its purpose was to carry out the long term policy of dividing the nation and destroying the revolution. They built this force up from 5,000 to 30,000 and gradually used this force to attack and seize liberated areas. They used this force to seize Pha Thi in an insane attack. This was a position in a liberated area of ours. After they were painfully defeated at Pha Thi and other places, they hoped to redeem themselves from these defeats. The American imperialists assembled 50 battalions of special forces including many Thai battalions. With major support from American forces and the engagement of every type of aircraft including strategic B-52's, they started Operation "Kou Kiat" [redeem honor] in August 1969, an insane attack against the liberated areas of the Plain of Jars and Xieng Khouang. After they had advanced their forces, they put into effect the policy of the three eliminations which was very brutal. In order to punish the enemy, at the beginning of December 1970 the LPA and patriotic, neutralist forces fiercely attacked the special forces of Vang Pao. They destroyed all the major positions of the enemy so that the special forces of Vang Pao were not able to further defend the reactionary Thai forces in the center. The YMT 21 of the special forces of Vang Pao was seriously hurt, and then their YMT 23 was wiped out completely. This caused the three Thai battalions on Phou Keng to be cut off. That same month the flank of the LPA south of the Plain of Jars attacked the Thai forces in Ban Ton Village and wiped out four battalions. By attacking along with the other flank in the West, the LPA was able to attack the two battalions of the special forces of Vang Pao at Meuang Soui and shatter them. At the same time we wiped out the Thai reactionary forces located at Phou Keng completely. With this storm of attacks by the patriotic armed forces, we caused the enemy to lose spirit. In just 3 days of fierce coordinated attacks from every direction and flank, our LPA liberated the Plain of Jars and Meuang Soui and completely took back the area the enemy had seized. They drove the enemy back to its bases at Sam Thong, Long Cheng, Sala Phou Khoun and Kasi. They had eliminated and weakened more than 20 enemy battalions. Of these 10 were Thai reactionary battalions. Because of their incorrigible love of war, the American imperialists started the Lam Son 719 operation at the beginning of 1971. They used more 20,000 soldiers of the Saigon puppet regime supported by American aircraft and artillery. But the army and people of Savannakhet working with the liberation army from the South of Vietnam resolutely defeated them in the battle called "Lam Son 719" along highway 9. Their forces were shattered during 44 days and nights. This was a heavy blow for the "Nixon" doctrine that Indochinese should be used to fight Indochinese. [passage omitted]
