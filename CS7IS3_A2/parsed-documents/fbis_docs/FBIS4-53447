Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai announced at a press conference a sweeping freeze until the year-end of raises in public charges, including domestic telephone charges, public housing rent, taxi fares and tolls for the nation's expressways. It was the first such wide-ranging freeze on public charge hikes since 1964, when the government was combating strong inflationary pressure. The announcement was made amid an increasingly vocal broadside from the public and business to the planned hikes. On Tuesday, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), urged Construction Minister Koji Morimoto to freeze the planned raise in tolls for the nation's highways for two years. The leading business mogul excoriated the government over the plan, arguing a hike in the tolls would put a big damper on the nation's flagging economy. The move was prompted by concerns in the government that the planned series of public charge raises could cast a pall over the nascent recovery of the economy as well as by public criticism, government sources said. It is also Hata's apparent bid to rally public support for his government in the face of the opposition's relentless attack on his shaky political standing, analysts said. Kumagai made clear at the press conference it was a "political decision" by Hata. He said the premier, "with reckless valor," made the decision after taking into consideration "the criticism from every corner" of the proposed hikes. "The people are displeased with the planned charge hikes," Kumagai said, adding, "we have to respond to the people's voices." He said the government will also ask local authorities to follow the government's example and not raise public-sector bus and subway fares. Asked about the decision, to be endorsed at a cabinet meeting Friday, Hata said it is the government's response to the criticism that it is too willing to raise charges for its services while the private sector is going through a tough restructuring to tide over the slump. Hata also hinted the move is designed to sweeten the government's proposed tax reform, which is expected to include a hike in the consumption tax. "Well, we will have to obtain support for the tax reform and some other things," he said. Political pundits were skeptical of the move, calling it a claptrap. "It is a stopgap effort to gain popularity. (Hata) is simply pulling the wool over the people's eyes," said Makoto Sataka, a social commentator. Hata heads the first minority government in four decades. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest bloc in the opposition camp, has signaled it will submit a motion of no- confidence in the government after the overdue state budget for fiscal 1994 passes the Diet. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest opposition group and a partner in the ruling coalition of Hata's predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, has also called for an early general election for the House of Representatives. The move is also aimed at selling Hata's "strong leadership" and his compassion for people's hardships as a snap election grows more likely, analysts said. Business and consumer groups, however, mostly welcomed the decision. Nikkeiren's Nagano said at a press conference it will benefit the Japanese economy. "I am happy to hear the news. It is good for the economy," he said. A senior executive of a major chemical company said, "I really appreciate Mr. Hata's decision." Some companies and government ministries, however, were perplexed by the sudden decision to freeze the public charges. An official of the Transport Ministry, which supervises the taxi industry, said, "it was a bolt out of the blue. I cannot comment until we receive an official notice." A taxi company executive said, "we will be in trouble if the taxi fare hike is not permitted. But...we cannot revolt against the order." Kosaku Yamada, who heads Japan Highway Public Corp., which has planned an average 10.6 percent hike in highway tolls, said, "we can do nothing but to accept the government decision." Nonlife insurance companies were also rocked by the freeze, which covers fire insurance premiums. "I was really surprised by the sudden announcement," said Takashi Onoda, head of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of Japan. Some government economists voiced skepticism over the move. "It is a political decision by the cabinet. If the hikes are postponed the margin of raises may have to be larger later," said Koichi Tani of the Economic Planning Agency. "(The decision) is undesirable from an economic policy point of view. The planned hikes would not have put a major drag on consumption." The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the No. 1 opposition party, also took a dim view of the move. "It is a mere postponement. The hikes in the next year may be larger than planned," said Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council. It should be called "claptrap," Hashimoto said.
