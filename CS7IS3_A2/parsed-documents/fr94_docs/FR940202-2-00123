FR940202-2-00123 FR940202-2-00071 CATEGORY IB a. Collect environmental samples from potential sources of Aspergillus spp., especially those sources implicated in the epidemiologic investigation, by using appropriate methods,424,427,428,472,484,488,666 e.g., use of a high-volume air sampler rather than settle plates. 424 CATEGORY IB b. Perform molecular subtyping of Aspergillus spp. obtained from patients and the environment to establish strain identity. 476,477 CATEGORY IB c. If air-handling systems supplying high-risk patient-care areas are not optimal, consider temporary deployment of portable HEPA filters until rooms with optimal air-handling systems are available for all patients at high risk of invasive aspergillosis.469 CATEGORY II d. If an environmental source is identified, perform corrective measures as needed to eliminate the source from the high-risk patients' environment. CATEGORY IB e. If an environmental source is not identified, review existing infection-control measures, including engineering aspects, to identify potential areas that can be corrected or improved. CATEGORY IB III. Modifying Host Risk for Infection A. Administer cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor, to increase host resistance to aspergillosis by decreasing the duration and severity of chemotherapy-induced granulocytopenia. 464,465 CATEGORY II B. NO RECOMMENDATION for administration of intranasal amphotericin B or oral antifungal agents (including amphotericin B and triazole compounds) in high-risk patients for prophylaxis against aspergillosis.466,467,667 UNRESOLVED ISSUE Prevention and Control of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection (The principles and recommendations below are applicable for prevention and control of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections due to adenovirus, parainfluenza virus and rhinovirus.) I. Staff Education and Infection Surveillance A. Staff Education Educate personnel about the epidemiology, modes of transmission and means of preventing spread of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).215,611&hyph;613 CATEGORY IA B. Surveillance 1. Establish mechanism(s) by which the appropriate hospital personnel are promptly alerted to any increase in RSV activity in the local community. CATEGORY IB 2. During periods of increased prevalence of RSV in the community (and during December&hyph;March), attempt prompt diagnosis of RSV infection by using rapid diagnostic techniques as clinically indicated in pediatric patients, especially infants, and in immunocompromised adults admitted to the hospital with respiratory illness.545,549 CATEGORY IB II. Interruption of Transmission of RSV A. Prevention of Person-to-Person Transmission 1. Primary Measures for Contact Isolation a. Handwashing. Wash hands after contact with a patient, or after touching respiratory secretions or fomites potentially contaminated with respiratory secretions, whether or not gloves are worn.207,503,524&hyph;526,547 CATEGORY IA b. Gloving. (1) Wear gloves for handling patients or respiratory secretions of patients with proven or suspected RSV infection, or fomites potentially contaminated with patient secretions.215,503,524,525,543,549 CATEGORY IA (2) Change gloves between patients, or after handling respiratory secretions or fomites contaminated with secretions from one patient before contact with another patient.215,217 Wash hands after removing gloves. (See II&hyph;A&hyph;1&hyph;a, above.) CATEGORY IA c. Gowning. Wear a gown when soiling with respiratory secretions from a patient is anticipated, e.g., when handling infants with RSV infection or other viral respiratory illness, and change the gown after such contact and before caring for another patient. 215,542,544,549 CATEGORY IB d. Staffing. Restrict healthcare workers in the acute stages of an upper respiratory illness, i.e., those who are sneezing and/or coughing, from taking care of RSV-uninfected infants and other patients at high risk for complications from RSV infection, e.g., children with severe underlying cardio-pulmonary conditions, children receiving chemotherapy for malignancy, and patients who are otherwise immunocompromised.547,549 CATEGORY IB e. Limiting Visitors. Do not allow persons with symptoms of respiratory infection to visit uninfected pediatric, immunosuppressed, and cardiac patients.543 CATEGORY II
