Official reports here said two rockets fell in Betar Nullah on the outskirts of Poonch town and three exploded at two different places around the positions of security forces. However, there was no casualty. The firing of time bombs with rockets is a new phenomenon in the Poonch-Rajouri areas near the Line of Control. Experts say that time bombs are thrown with rockets having solar batteries which are charged by sun. The bombs explode at fixed time. Since last week in Poonch-Rajouri areas, about 45 such rocket bombs exploded at various places. But these did not cause any casualty as almost all of these rocket bombs landed in deserted areas. The Governor, Gen. (Retd) K.V. Krishna Rao, on Tuesday accused Pakistan of actively aiding and abetting terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. In his message to people on the eve of Republic Day, Gen. Krishna Rao said that Pakistan and militant outfits have been propagating merger of the State with Pakistan or independence, which were illusory objectives. He said that Pakistan has not only instigated, trained and armed the Kashmiri youth to indulge in subversion and sabotage. The Governor has ordered the release of 167 detenues on the eve of Republic Day, while the security forces apprehended 20 militants in the Valley during the period, an official spokesman said. Meanwhile, intermittent firing by Pakistani troops at Indian posts in forward areas near the Line of Control continued. Three civilians were injured in the firing during the past week. Two people were injured in Poonch district and one in the Chamb sector of Jammu district on Monday, when Pakistani troops fired from across the Line of Control. Security forces have stepped up vigil along the Line of Control following reports that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) has planned massive infiltration of Afghan mercenaries who are trained in guerilla warfare and subversive activities. The security forces have successfully foiled another attempt of Pakistani troops to push fresh groups of militants into Poonch and Rajouri areas for escalation of violence in the State. Srinagar: A red alert has been sounded in the Kashmir Valley in view of the militant threat to disrupt the Republic Day functions, while two militants and a security personnel were among 10 people killed during the past 24 hours. Militants lobbed a hand-grenade on a Border Security Force (BSF) guard at Chadoora bridge injuring three personnel, one of them died in the Army Hospital. One militant was killed in an encounter with the security forces during search operations. Two more militants were nabbed and arms and ammunition, including two AK 56 rifles, one universal machine gun, one rocket were recovered. Meanwhile, day curfew in Kishtwar town of Doda district in the Jammu region was lifted on Tuesday following improvement in the overall situation. Curfew was imposed on Saturday last following the killing of two people by militants in Dool area, which had caused tension in Kishtwar and other adjoining areas.
