Of course, by unity of thought we must understand a similar position on the part of the leaders of the two political poles in the country on the situation of the Bulgarians in the Western Outlands [border region of southeastern Serbia populated by ethnic Bulgarians]. The political consensus on this issue, which was anticipated for a long time, was inevitable. It is a positive thing, because after all, the issue preserves the Bulgarian character of this Yugoslav region populated with Bulgarians. Provoked by the unofficial announcement on banning the Democratic Alliance of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, Filip Dimitrov and Zhan Videnov immediately reacted. Their statements differed only on the issues of who should help our compatriots and by what means. There can hardly be a serious political force in Bulgaria that has a different opinion on this issue from the BSP and the SDS. It was the same 75 years ago, when for a long time no Bulgarian politician could be found who was prepared to sign the Treaty of Neuilly [treaty signed on 27 November 1919, by which Bulgaria ceded territories to Serbia and Greece and lost about 300,000 citizens]. We know what kind of peace it brought to the Balkans. We could see the consequences in the Western Outlands, and not only there. One remembers the universal joy that engulfed the country after the return of Southern Dobrudzha in 1940. Naturally, we are not speaking about any correction of our border with Yugoslavia, but about a normal and humane attitude toward our compatriots in the Western Outlands, as they requested in the memorandum they addressed to the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The SDS and BSP have committed themselves to this demand. The two political forces are not interested in a political flirt along patriotic lines, but in real actions in the sphere of scientific and cultural exchange, and in respecting the religious freedom and rights according to international documents. Let us hope that the divided Bulgarian Orthodox Church will follow the example of the politicians, and that the Holy Synod (which of the two?) sends Bulgarian priests to the Western Outlands on time, as the population there has requested.
