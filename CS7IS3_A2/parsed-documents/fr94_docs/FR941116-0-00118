FR941116-0-00118 FR941116-0-00022 (2) Agreeing not to market, barter, donate, or use on the farm (including use as feed for livestock) in a marketing year a quantity of production in excess of the production limitation quantity (PLQ) and eligible carryover from prior years for the crop on the farm for the marketing year. The PLQ for a crop shall be determined by multiplying the acreage permitted to be planted to such crop under an ARP by the PLQ yield. The PLQ yield is the higher of the farm program payment yield, or the average of the yield per harvested acre for each of the 5 years preceding the crop year in which the producers first participate in the pilot program, excluding the highest and lowest crop year yields, and any year in which the crop was not planted on the farm. Carryover production is defined as eligible and ineligible carryover as follows: (1) If the crop was enrolled in the VPLP the previous year and is enrolled in the current year, the carryover production from any previous crop year is considered ineligible carryover and if marketed, bartered, donated, or used shall be counted against the PLQ for the current year, except the producer may destroy the carryover, under supervision of employees of the county ASCS office, so that no benefit will be derived from the carryover; or (2) If the crop was not enrolled in the VPLP the previous year but is enrolled in the current year, the carryover production from a previous crop year is considered eligible carryover and may be marketed, bartered, donated, or used without being counted against the PLQ for the current crop year; or (3) If the crop was enrolled in the VPLP the previous year and is enrolled in the ARP in the current year, the producer may devote an amount of acreage to conservation use equal to the excess production divided by the PLQ yield for the crop. Producers shall be considered to have complied with the terms and conditions of ARP or land diversion program for the crop, even though the acreage planted to such crop might exceed the permitted acreage and the available flex acreage under the terms and conditions of the ARP. Producers may store any quantity of the enrolled crop exceeding the PLQ for the crop for a period not to exceed 5 marketing years. Any excess commodity stored longer than 5 years is subject to forfeiture to CCC. Corn and grain sorghum permitted acreages are combined for the 1994 through 1997 crop years. A farm with both corn and grain sorghum CAB's will have the PLQ determined by multiplying the combined permitted acreages of such crops times the corn PLQ yield for the farm. If a farm has a corn CAB, and a producer on such farm plants grain sorghum; or if a farm has a grain sorghum CAB, and the producer plants corn; or if a farm has both corn and grain sorghum CAB's, these farms will have the PLQ expressed as corn equivalent bushels. An example calculation follows: (1) Corn-100 acre CAB, 100 bushel PLQ yield, permitted-100 acres. (2) Grain Sorghum-100 acre CAB, 50 bushel PLQ yield, permitted-100 acres. (3) Total permitted acres-200. 200 (permitted acres) X 100 (corn PLQ yield) = 20,000 bushels total corn equivalent PLQ. The result is the total PLQ for both crops. Grain sorghum production is converted to corn equivalent production (CE) based on a ratio of the corn PLQ yield to the grain sorghum PLQ yield for such farm. In the preceding example, the yield ratio is 2 to 1. Therefore, if the producer markets 100 bushels of corn, then 100 bushels of CE is considered marketed. If 50 bushels of grain sorghum is marketed, then 100 bushels of CE is considered marketed. The ``0/85/92'' provisions, in accordance with ยง1413.41, and flex provisions, as set forth in ยง1413.43, will not apply to farms enrolled in the VPLP. Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota have been selected as the States in which to conduct this pilot program. From these States, a total of 15 counties have been selected to participate in the VPLP. The proposed counties are: Fremont, Harrison, Mills, Monona, and West Pottawatamie Counties in Iowa; Adams, Furnas, Harlan, Kearney, and Phelps Counties in Nebraska; and Bon Homme, Charles Mix, Douglas, Turner, and Yankton Counties in South Dakota. It is further proposed that the following provisions will apply to the VPLP:
