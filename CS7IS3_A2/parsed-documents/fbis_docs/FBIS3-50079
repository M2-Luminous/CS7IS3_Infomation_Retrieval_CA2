The cardinal clearly rejected the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. If a change of Bosnia's borders by force were permitted, the borders of Croatia and other countries would no longer be inviolable either. The church is calling for a peace that does justice to all nationalities, explained the cardinal, who sharply condemned anti-Semitic media reports in Croatia only a few days ago.
