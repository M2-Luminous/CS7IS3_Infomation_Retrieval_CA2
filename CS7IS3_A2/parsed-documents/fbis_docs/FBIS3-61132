It states: The Second Congress of Victims of the Totalitarian Communist Regime of Moldova which took place on 20 November 1993 noted with profound concern the aggravation of the socioeconomic and political situation within the republic capable of leading to social explosions with severe consequences. The steady and uncontrolled rise in prices for essential food items, complete devaluation of monetary savings of the population, non-indexation and delayed payment of wages, pensions, stipends, and grants, the growth of mafia-like groups and the blossoming of corruption led to a state where all of society was engulfed by a severe economic crisis and most of the population lacks any guarantees or certainty about what happens tomorrow. Such economic chaos is a consequence of the blocking of democratic reforms in the economy by conservative forces, the inability of the current leadership to manage a sovereign and independent state, and the lack of an effective program for transition to a normal economy. At a time when the population is growing poorer with every day, the number of ministries, departments, and governmental and parliamentary commissions is growing inordinately, naturally, along with the ranks of officials as hundreds of government and parliamentary delegations travel by air to all countries of the world while hundreds of delegations arrive in our country which requires the expenditure of huge sums of money without any practical benefit. The government finds money for the maintenance of excessively numerous structures as well as for the foreign trips and reception of delegations, but not for the indexation of wages, pensions, and stipends. Privatization of state property is fiction. It is conducted within the narrow sphere of a corresponding department. The process of endowing peasants with land is being blocked and confiscated property and nationalized real estate is not being returned to victims of the totalitarian Communist regime. Moreover they are compelled to acquire above-norm living space at astronomical prices, including balcony areas, and apartments being privatized. The president of the republic is not fulfilling his campaign promises regarding the conduct of democratic reforms, while a number of edicts of the head of state are being ignored by parliament and the government. Unqualified affiliation with the Commonwealth of Independent States and the so-called economic union, carried out to the detriment of the economic and cultural integration with Romania and development of economic ties with western countries, will further aggravate the economic recession in the republic. The policy being conducted by the current government in the field of taxation, excise taxes and licensing led to the bankruptcy of most of the producers and is stimulating the growth of speculation, crime, and mafia-like structures. A number of errors by the government likewise led to a decline in culture, education, public health, and the lack of social protection for impoverished segments of the population. Taking into account the socio-political and socioeconomic situation that developed in the republic, participants of the Second Congress of the Association of Victims of the Totalitarian Communist Regime of Moldova deem it necessary to raise the question concerning elaboration and conduct of a broad and concrete program of economic and socio-political reforms by the leadership of the republic, which would ensure the following: 1. Stimulation and development of the reform of the taxation policy and production enterprises regardless of forms of ownership. 2. Accelerated privatization of state property under strict government control. 3. Most effective functioning of all state structures in the development of small and medium-scale businesses. 4. Endowment of peasants with land, adoption of the law on private land ownership with the right of sale and purchase; transformation of kolkhozes into joint-stock companies, cooperatives, and farms with simultaneous development of a market infrastructure, including creation of credit societies, land banks, cooperatives and joint-stock companies in the material supply of farmers and individual farms as well as in the sale of their products. 5. Along with the restoration of economic ties with the eastern republics, full social and cultural integration with Romania through the signing of a fraternal treaty with it, coupled with development of economic ties with western countries through the attraction of investments in the development of industry and the agricultural sector. 6. Resolution of the Dniester region conflict along with differences with southern regions, withdrawal of the 14th Army, ensurance of the integrity of the republic with the aid of international organizations, unconditional release of Tiraspol political prisoners of the Ilashku group. 7. The swiftest conduct of territorial-administrative and judicial reforms and observance of human rights in all spheres. 8. Liquidation of the bureaucratic system through a wholesale decrease in the number of ministries, departments, and commissions, as well as in the size of their staffs. 9. Stimulation of the development of culture, science, public health, and education. 10. Social protection of the impoverished segments of the population--pensioners, invalids, elderly persons living alone, mothers with many children, employees and workers whose wages are below the minimum subsistence level through the indexation of wages, pensions, stipends, and grants and also through a cutback in irrational expenditures by state structures. 11. Restoration of the rights of all victims of the totalitarian Communist regime through the observance and amendment of the law on rehabilitation of political victims of the totalitarian Communist regime of 8 December 1992, to wit: Return of property, real estate, and other confiscated or nationalized assets or award of compensation for victims or their descendants with the conclusion of an agreement for that purpose with Russia--the country which is obligated to provide compensation for all the material and moral harm caused victims of the totalitarian Communist regime. Free privatization of all living space for families or heirs of those who suffered because of the totalitarian regime; Recognition of the time spent by victims and members of their families registered in Russia and in other republics of the former USSR where they were forced to live after exile until their return to the republic as full active service in the computation of pensions and privatization of state property. 12. Indexation of monetary savings in savings banks at the expense of privatization of state property through the issuance of special bonds. 13. Restoration of history and national culture, the state language, national traditions, as well as ethnic development of the population of the republic. Adopted at the Second Congress of Victims of the Totalitarian Communist Regime. Chisinau, 20 November 1993
