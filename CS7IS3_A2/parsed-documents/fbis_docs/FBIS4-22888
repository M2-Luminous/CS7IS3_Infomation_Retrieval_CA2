As a consequence, a new approach to studying the biological activity of natural oligopeptide whereby the investigation proceeds from the structure to the function, i.e., in a direction opposite to that of existing approaches, was developed by the authors. It is rooted in the understanding of the structural arrangement of the low-molecular peptide molecules, a direct correlation between the conformational capabilities of a number of peptide hormones and their physiological action, and an assumption of the principal similarity of the physical and chemical origin of the hormone-receptor and enzyme-substrate interactions. The natural oligopeptide structural-functional organization principles underlying the approach are outlined. The study pursues two goals simultaneously: to establish the structural-functional arrangement of the angiotensin II molecule with the help of a known approach to examining natural oligopeptides (a more particular task) and testing the approach used in the specific analysis and assessing its actual capabilities (a more general task). The study shows that the angiotensin II molecule organization is, in essence, described by a set of low-energy conformational states of several groups which are easily transformed one into another. The two most energy- and entropy-wise efficient groups are identified and the geometrical parameters of their representatives are summarized. The values of the dihedral angles of the backbone and side amino acid hormone residual chains are calculated, and the energy of the intra- and inter-residual interactions of all potentially physiologically active conformations is evaluated. The findings are compared to numerous published sources. Figures 5; tables 7; references 45: 13 Russian, 32 Western.
