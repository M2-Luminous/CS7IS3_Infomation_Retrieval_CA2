FBIS4-5219 "dreas068_a_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Urges New Parliamentary Group Urges New Parliamentary Group OW0804122494 Tokyo KYODO in English 1154 GMT 8 Apr 94 OW0804122494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa renewed his call on Friday to create a new large parliamentary group of various political parties within the House of Representatives with his Japan New Party serving as its core. Hosokawa made the appeal at a plenary session of his party's 38 legislators a few hours after announcing his decision to give up the premiership, JNP legislators said. "We have to assemble people with the ideal of reform while making our party the core of the new group," Hosokawa said. The premier proposed naming the new group "Reform." The JNP legislators agreed to give Hosokawa a mandate to decide how to proceed with the project to form the new parliamentary group. The idea had earlier come under a barrage of criticism from the new party Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Social Democratic Party, which charged that such a proposal, if realized, would lead to the formation of a new large party amalgamating the JNP, Shinseito and Komeito. The premier's renewal of the call may add fuel to a simmering intracoalition rivalry between the Sakigake-SDP camp and the JNP- Shinseito-Komeito camp at a time when the coalition is moving to pick a successor to Hosokawa, political analysts said. Hosokawa also told the plenary session he had decided to dissolve the current JNP-Sakigake parliamentary group, the legislators said. Meanwhile, JNP executives said the party had decided to report the formation of the new parliamentary group "Reform" to the Secretariat of the lower chamber. In addition to the 38 JNP legislators, two United Social Democratic Party legislators had decided to join the new group, they added.
