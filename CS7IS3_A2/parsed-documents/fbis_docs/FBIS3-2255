This was emphasized here today by Wang Guangya, vice deputy of the Chinese delegation attending the fifth session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. "In recent years, a few Western countries and some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have attacked China for what they allege are human rights violations and have frequently tabled anti-China draft resolutions on this issue. They either purposefully ignored the truth or know little about the real situation in China," said Wang. "China is the biggest developing country in the world, with a population approaching 1.2 billion, and is now dedicated to economic construction to achieve a modern state. The Chinese Government is profoundly conscious of the fact that there is an imperative need for a stable and harmonious social environment in order to reach this goal," he said. He pointed out that a tumultuous China would not only mean disaster to the Chinese people, but would also have grave repercussions for Asia's stability, as well as the whole world. "It is precisely because of this responsible attitude to the Chinese people, and the world, and based on the actual conditions within the country that the Chinese Government has formulated, and is in the process of implementing, a policy that has economic construction as its center-piece, stresses reform and opening to the outside world and aims at building socialism with Chinese characteristics. "Facts have shown that this was the right choice and it is now bearing fruit," he added. "China today is experiencing rapid economic development, political stability, harmony among nationalities, and social advances. We are in the process of perfecting our democratic and legal institutions, and the living standards of the people of all our nationalities are constantly on the rise. All these are facts which are as clear as daylight," he said. However, he stressed, some countries and ngos turn a blind eye to these facts and have tried to kick up a rumpus about the so-called "human rights questions in China". This is simply to put political pressure on China with the hope that the Chinese people will be forced to deviate from the path of development that they have chosen for themselves based on their own national conditions. The Chinese people and the Chinese Government will never accept this kind of pressure. Speaking about the issue of so-called "human rights in Tibet", the Chinese vice deputy emphasized that more than a million of the Tibetan people only rid themselves of the yoke of serfdom to become their own masters and enjoy democratic rights, including the freedom of religious belief, after 1959, when the Chinese Government abolished the serf system and carried out democratic reforms in tibet. Since then the Tibetan economy has enjoyed rapid growth, its distinct culture given full respect and the opportunity to develop. There has also been a marked improvement in the livelihood of the people. He said that the reason why some people with ulterior motives still ignore these facts and continue to repeat the lies that the Chinese Government is violating human rights in Tibet is because they are trying to use the human rights issue as the pretext to instigate and support a handful of tibetan separatists engaged in splitting Tibet from China. Wang said the fact that some NGOs openly advocate an "independent Tibet" in their public statements demonstrates their political motive. "That sort of activity, inciting national hatred and the dismembering of sovereign states, has already caused turmoil, conflict and wars in many parts of the world, constituting a threat to regional as well as global stability and also endangering the human rights and fundamental freedoms of millions and millions of people. This runs totally counter to the purpose of this commission which is the promotion and protection of human rights." he went on. "Safeguarding the territorial integrity and the unity of all the nationalities in China, and rejecting any acts to foment hatred and splits amongst them are principles embodied in the Chinese Constitution. "They reflect the fundamental interests of the Chinese people of all nationalities, including Tibetans. No attempts to break Tibet away from the rest of China will succeed," he said.
