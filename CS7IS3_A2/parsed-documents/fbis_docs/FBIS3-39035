It can be proved that he is lying when he says that wealth will ran from the skies as long as he is handed the keys to the government. It can be proved, in fact it is already apparent, that if those keys did ever fall into his hands, he would throw them into a river so that nobody could ever find them again. But to document his demagoguery and his questionable vision of democracy cannot be enough; it is not enough to say that the Forza Italia "miracle" is a mere illusion, that Berlusconi's "magic" lies only in his words. Beyond that, beyond the lies, there is a true fact: If they do win and if they do govern, millions of Italians will pay the price. All those who need medical attention will pay. They will pay good money -- forget about wealth for all. The money that Forza Italia is promising to the "strong" will be taken from the "weak." [Fuccillo] You seem worried to me, Mr. Occhetto. Do you too feel that there is trouble brewing? Berlusconi's popularity ratings are rising, he is commanding attention, and nurturing hopes. Did you not forecast this, or did you fail to understand the situation? [Occhetto] Indeed, the immediate impression is of a flood, a sudden downpour of water. What is coming down is the old system, and it is all collecting together in a single swimming pool. At present we are under this waterfall. But its force results from the fact that hitherto there has been no aggressive and threatening right. Now it is arriving all at once, moving from zero to 18 or 20 percent, or whatever it may be. We shall see whether this flow dries up, ebbs, or continues to increase. [Fuccillo] For the present the water is flowing. The "joyful war machine" seems to be that of the right rather than of the progressive forces. [Occhetto] There is no doubt that it is a war machine; indeed, they are intent on occupying territory. They have no common program other than to seize power. They cynically believe that this is the only important thing, and have allied only in order to share out slices of Italy among themselves, openly and shamelessly. The nationalists of the National Alliance together with the federalists of the League, notwithstanding [League Secretary] Bossi's blather. The League which grows furious when it hears the word "solidarity" used in connection with the south, together with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] which promises aid to the south. Together, held by Berlusconi's right and left hands. They have formed a chain, and for the sake of no political principle other than: Let us seize Italy, then we will see. [Fuccillo] Should they compete to lose? Was it not you who called for the establishment of an Italian right? [Occhetto] I expressed the hope for the emergence of a right capable of proposing a government, not a group of enemy gangs coming together solely to occupy territory, just as, and worse than, in the past, when the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] occupied the state. [Fuccillo] Be that as it may, they are together, and they are strong... [Occhetto] They seem strong, but it cannot be taken for granted that the League, Forza Italia, the MSI, and the former Christian Democrats can come together without losing something. I would ask those voters who have become League supporters out of a sense of disgust and protest: Do they not realize that they are being offered an even worse form of Craxism, its poisoned fruit? That same Berlusconi that every history book would describe as a monument to the entrepreneurship that emerged in the shadow of that regime? [Fuccillo] Perhaps those voters are concerned less with the past and more with the paradise promised by Berlusconi and company, the paradise where there are no longer any taxes to pay. [Occhetto] Taxes will fall if the state is reformed, and that is our objective -- to really reduce them for those who are now paying too much, and not to promise that those who have never paid their taxes will never have to pay them again. As for the promised paradise, if Berlusconi were ever to explain who would have to pay, it would become apparent that it would be like a hell for millions of Italians. It is no accident that Berlusconi talks a lot but will not answer any questions. [Fuccillo] You say he talks a lot. Do you want to reduce his number of minutes, in fact hours, on television? [Occhetto] I would grant Berlusconi even more minutes and hours as long as he agreed to an exchange of views, a debate, to answer some questions. But he will not and cannot. He can only exercise his charm at long distance, like a flash of lightning. To succeed in making him talk about specifics in a specific manner would be like putting on the light and ending the dream. I appeal to him to conduct a debate in public with the others, if he can. He says that he suspects censorship. Let me reassure him, as far as I can: no limits, no excuses for him to act the martyr. For him, who is deafening us, to be afraid of being gagged: That is absurd. That is, unless for Berlusconi being gagged means not being able to do whatever he wants while the rest cannot. Or is it no longer the case that the rules must be the same for everyone? He moves like a tank, and we are not stupid enough to try to bar the way to him, but we never want tanks, especially when we are talking about government and information. [Fuccillo] It seems likely that there will be some reckonings and in fact some acts of revenge after the elections. If the progressive forces win, will their adversaries have to plead for mercy? [Occhetto] Rotation in government does not stop after the first round; the first election under the new system is not the key to establishing a new totalitarian regime. If this had been our intention, we would have tried to remain as before and would not have exposed ourselves, would not have been the first to pursue, with conviction, the democratic risk of winning or losing. But Berlusconi does not reason this way: As far as he is concerned, there is the pole for freedom, that is, the right, and the pole of evil, that is, all the rest. I believe that we are all full members of the pole for freedom, and whoever denies this is unwittingly admitting that he considers freedom his own private privilege. [Fuccillo] Let us come to your own alignment, that of the progressive forces: When it comes to discussing candidates, people are kicking each other under the table. Do you know what I was told by someone from your party in Emilia? "They are sending us here people to elect with our votes, and telling us that we must do so because they are moderate candidates. Well, we have been moderates ever since 1943." [Occhetto] For one thing, the table has eight legs, and the political problems seem to have been resolved. Also, I would tell you that when it comes to choosing candidates there comes a point when you feel like despairing: You are confronted with five or six different criteria, all beyond criticism, but mutually conflicting. The remark that you cited is both perceptive and true. There are those who are entitled to tell us how victory can be achieved in their own constituency without having to be told by Occhetto, [Rete Secretary] Orlando, or [Democratic Alliance leader] Adornato. But some are rather less in the right. Be that as it may, after a history of the left composed of hostility and cannibalism, we have already established a minor miracle, whereby we are seeking candidates capable of both winning and persuading. This criterion must prevail above all others. [Fuccillo] The candidates issue is not the only problem for the progressive forces: You seem to be in disagreement over who should be prime minister and who should comprise the government team. [Occhetto] Look, I have here on my desk the remarks in which centrist leader D'Onofrio, accuses me of having ruined [Prime Minister] Ciampi's chances, no less, simply by stressing that I appreciate what he has done in government. I do not want to attach too much importance to D'Onofrio, but the issue that you raise is a serious one, and my reply is that I have respected, and I still respect, Ciampi's desire to stand aloof from the various alignments. However, nobody can prevent me from believing that Ciampi is, and will remain, a democratic asset.
