Last year, a total of 206,000 people found jobs through labour markets, reducing the unemployment rate of the province to two percent, lower than the country's average. To answer the call of establishing a socialist market economy, Jiangsu labour departments have exerted themselves to foster development of labour markets in recent years. By now, well-functioning profession-introduction institutions have been established in Jiangsu's 11 cities and 64 counties and more than 75 percent of its towns and villages have improved services involving employment. Combining group recommendation with individual introduction, these labour markets manage to satisfy the fluctuating needs of enterprises and institutions for labour forces. They also offer a series of services for employers, including delivering employment information, handling recruitment procedure and taking out employment insurance. Apart from setting up labour markets all over the province, local labour departments have strictly implemented the relevant laws and regulations and strengthened supervision and direction for the operation of privately-owned profession-introduction institutions, to keep the development of labour markets sound. Employment training programmes have been offered by labour departments at all levels. However, as the improved labour markets have attracted not only those who are seeking employment but also those who want to change jobs for more lucrative ones, substantial changes have also occurred in employment training courses. Now people from all walks of life can benefit from these courses by learning skills and knowledge, either to increase competitiveness in employment or just for interest. Various employment training centers all over Jiangsu province now total 601, with more than 110,000 people having received technical training last year. Jiangsu Province is abundant in labour forces. Surplus rural labour forces in northern Jiangsu used to be a headache for local people. In past several years labour markets have effectively channeled surplus labour forces to other provinces or even foreign countries which are short of labour. Along with a flourishing labour market, competition for employment has become more fierce. Local provincial government has accordingly attached much importance to the improvement of unemployment security. Relief funds are extended to people who are out of work for less than two years. Some well-run large enterprises are chosen to provide temporary working opportunities for jobless people. Jiangsu Province has also boosted the development of the service industries as part of the efforts to create more employment opportunities for unemployed people.
