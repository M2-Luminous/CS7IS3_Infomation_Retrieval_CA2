That is the aim of a blueprint called "Stepping Into the Front Rank," which will be implemented from this year, according to the autonomous regional government. Officials say the aim was made in line with one of Deng Xiaoping's speeches in 1987 on the future development of the autonomous region. Officials quoted him as saying that Inner Mongolia might well "step into the front rank" in the future since it has a vast grassland and a relatively sparse population. Agriculture, animal husbandry, coal, electricity, metallurgical industry, petrochemical industry, construction materials industry, wool spinning industry and forestry will be developed as leading sectors to boost the locality as one of China's major producing areas in basic industries. Officials say Inner Mongolia is facing a rare development opportunity now as the central government, stressing the development of remote areas inhabited by ethnic minority nationalities, has brought in a series of preferential policies for them. In addition, they say enterprises producing raw materials will become more competitive in national market as China has freed the price of most energy and raw materials. Other favorable conditions for the region's growth include its closeness to Beijing and Tianjin cities and neighboring to northeast and northwest China. And the past 40 years of construction have laid a certain material basis, local officials said. According to the plan, this year the autonomous region is to raise its total output value of agriculture and animal husbandry to 20.5 billion yuan, up 6 percent over 1993. Grain production will be maintained at more than 10 billion kg and heads of livestock are to reach 56.50 million. A dozen model townships and villages will be set up as examples to become prosperous ahead of others. By the end of this century, major bases for the production of corn, wheat, soybean and beef will be established. A dozen major thermal power plants will be expanded to convert more coal into electricity. The electricity will then be transmitted to neighboring areas which now use most of the coal rather than electricity shipped in from Inner Mongolia. Further reforms will be carried out in state enterprises as a way to revive them. And more local specialized markets will come into being, covering grain, fur and leather, meat, medicinal herbs, wood, coal, iron and steel, construction materials, oil and textile products.
