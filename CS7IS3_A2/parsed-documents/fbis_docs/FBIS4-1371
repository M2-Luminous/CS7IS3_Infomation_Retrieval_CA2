It killed many people and left in its wake real legions of war-displaced people and refugees. That war ended with the signing of the Rome peace accords in October 1992, but Carlos Reis, president of the Mozambican National Union [Unamo], has said that a fourth war could break out if a federal system is not introduced in this country. The Unamo leader also made hitherto unheard of disclosures. For instance, he said that the political opposition parties could nominate Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader, as their candidate in the upcoming presidential elections. Like Unamo, those parties are defending a federal system. Unamo President Carlos Alexandre dos Reis said he had warned Afonso Dhlakama that, should he fail to follow the path of federalism and should another war break out in this country, a war like the one in Angola, he -- Dhlakama -- would be to blame for the blood to be shed by the Mozambican people. [Begin recording] [Reis] I have already told President Dhlakama that if he does not follow that path and we are faced with another war such as the one that has beset Angola, he will be to blame for the blood that is shed by the Mozambican people. Afonso Dhlakama fought for 16 years for change to come to Mozambique. We recognize that. Now, he should agree to a federal system. That would prove that he does not crave power. That would show that he does not want power, that he is not doing it all just to replace Chissano. Should he fail to do so, he is quite certain to lose all his credibility among the Mozambican people. It will show that he wants to come in and play the same game the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] used to play: It took over and fulfilled none of the promises it made. If he fought for the benefit of the Mozambican people, then he should agree to a federal system. Should he do so, with our support, we would be certain to dislodge Chissano from Ponta Vermelha Palace [words indistinct]. [Unidentified correspondent] In one of his latest statements to the national media, Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama suggested that the candidate with the second highest number of votes should be appointed vice president. [Reis] No, that is not democratic. The Frelimo Party has already rejected it. That will depend on the party that wins elections. As the ruling party, it must resolve the problem of government. It will form its government and it will ask whoever it pleases to be part of government. Now, no elections would be needed if someone could just come along and dictate the composition of government to the ruling party. I do not agree with that position because I do not perceive it to be democratic. [end recording]
