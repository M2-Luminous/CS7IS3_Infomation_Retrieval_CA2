Thanks to faster hydropower resource exploitation, the province's electric power industry has witnessed an unprecedentedly fast growth, resulting in the construction of more power installations across the province in the past year. Thus, protecting power installations has become a pressing issue confronting the province's electric power and public security departments. The conference revealed: In 1993, a total of 121 cases of stealing or sabotaging electric power installations occurred, 49 of which were major and serious cases, inflicting direct economic losses of about 400,000 yuan. A growing number of similar cases occurred in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period of last year, some posing a real threat to the province's normal production. The conference participants unanimously held: At present, it is imperative to conduct exhaustive education on the importance and urgency of protecting power installations by proceeding from the overall interests of social stability; properly solve such problems as power supply disputes between adjacent counties and between adjacent villages; properly handle, by seeking government assistance, such incidents as besieging power plants, beating and abusing power plant staff and workers, and other similar incidents; step up investigations as well as crackdowns on such criminal activities as theft or sabotaging power installations and other similar activities; and make redoubled efforts to rectify the salvage market with an eye on blocking the source of income of the criminals. The conference urged public security organs at all levels across the province to assist security departments of the electric power organs in strengthening safety management of large power plants, large power stations, large transformer substations, and key power supply lines; rectify and maintain social order in adjacent villages; and take full precautions against the outbreak of similar incidents in the future.
