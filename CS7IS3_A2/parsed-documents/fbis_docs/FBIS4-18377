Karayalcin told a press conference prior to his party's group meeting, which will decide on whether to continue the coalition government, that his party was receiving a great number of documents, complaints and evidence, showing that the elections were fraudulent. Karayalcin advised the citizens, already perplexed by the overwhelming victory of the fundamentalist Prosperity Party (RP), not to be provoked. "Turkey is a state of law and the warranty of our freedoms is the legislation, not the municipalities," he said. Karayalcin went on to say that no one had the right to intervene into the way people dressed, to the length of dresses women wore. Karayalcin stressed that the country definitely did not have a Moslem-secularist conflict.
