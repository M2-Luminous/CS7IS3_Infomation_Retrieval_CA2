FR940727-2-00014 FR940727-2-00011 Golden Field Office; Federal Assistance Award to Sacramento Municipal Utility District AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Financial Assistance Award in Response to an Unsolicited Financial Assistance Application; 36&hyph;94G010024. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District for the implementation of utility, grid-connected photovoltaic systems. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: W. Webb, Contract Specialist. The telephone number is 303&hyph;275&hyph;4724. Dr. Paul K. Kearns is the Contracting Officer. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: DOE has evaluated, in accordance with the DOE Federal Assistance Regulations, 10 CFR 600.14, the unsolicited proposal entitled ``Sustained Utility Implementation of Photovoltaics'' and recommends that the unsolicited proposal be accepted for support without further competition in accordance with ยง600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations. This award involves cost sharing on the hardware, installation and evaluation of utility, grid-connected photovoltaic systems for residential, commercial/utility sized (substation), and building-integrated applications. Sacramento Municipal Utility Districts' (SMUD) ``sustained orderly development'' effort to advance the commercialization of grid-connected photovoltaics plans to install about 900 kW of grid-connected PV systems. This will include about 100 residential ``PV Pioneer'' systems, several systems of the commercial/utility size, and building-integrated applications such as PV integrated as architectural building components and demand-side management applications. The phase I activities include procurement activities, including issuance of the RFP, bids, proposal evaluations, negotiations and SMUD board approval. Phase II activities include the installation, monitoring and evaluation of PV systems. This project represents a unique opportunity to evaluate large-scale, distributed, utility grid-connected PV applications; implement a substantial hardware procurement; and support the commercialization of grid-connected photovoltaics. SMUD has a high probability of achieving the project objectives based on past projects, a ``large'' service area for the implementation of grid-connected applications and community commitment to the adoption of PV technology. SMUD's resources and commitment to extending the utility PV collaborative process and promoting cooperative ventures to accelerate the commercialization of utility PV applications should provide a basis for the successful implementation. The program cost is estimated to be $10,800,000 total, with the DOE share being $1,600,000 or 14.8%. The proposed DOE funding for FY 94 is $500,000 and for FY 95 is $1,100,000. Issued in Golden, Colorado, on July 13, 1994. John W. Meeker, Chief, Procurement, GO. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18289 Filed 7&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
