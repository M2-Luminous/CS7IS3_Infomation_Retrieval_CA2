SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268, and 270. B. New Mexico New Mexico received final authorization January 25, 1985, (see 50 FR 1515) to implement its base hazardous waste management program. New Mexico received authorization for revisions to its program on April 10, 1990 (see 55 FR 4604), July 25, 1990 (see 55 FR 28397), December 4, 1992 (see 57 FR 45717) and August 23, 1994. The authorized New Mexico RCRA program was incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), effective December 13, 1993 (see 58 FR 52677). On July 26, 1994, New Mexico submitted a final complete program revision application for additional program approvals. Today, New Mexico is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3).
