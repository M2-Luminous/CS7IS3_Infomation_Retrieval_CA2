He said this in a speech to about 200 students and teachers at Qinghua University, one of the most prestigious in China. He expressed his satisfaction with the academic exchanges between the universities of the two countries over the last decade. He made the speech during a tour of the university after his meeting with Chinese acting Premier Zhu Rongji in the morning. Following the speech, three Qinghua professors gave him an outline of the cooperative projects between Qinghua University and Canadian ones. Professor Zhao Chunjun, deputy dean of the School of Economics and Management of Qinghua, told Hnatyshyn that since the Sino- Canadian cooperative project on management education began in 1984, over 30 Canadian professors had taught at Qinghua, and a center had been set up in the university to train Chinese management officials. About 200 Chinese managers had taken courses on international marketing, international finance, technology transfer, securities and stocks, as well as development of human resources, Zhao said, adding that the project had yielded good results. In the afternoon, Hnatyshyn visited the Beijing International Earth Station. There he attended a ceremony marking the finish of initial testing of the first phase of construction of the Beijing domestic satellite telecommunications earth-station, a cooperative project between China's Post and Telecommunication Ministry and the spar company of Canada. It was learned that 19 earth stations will be established in China after the project is completed, and 14 of them have been set up in the first stage. China and the Canadian company were satisfied with the testing of the first phase of the project. During the second stage, which is predicted to be finished within the year, another five stations will be established. The governor-general spoke highly of the project, and said that Canada would continue its cooperation with China in the fields of telecommunications, personnel training and technology transfer. The guests are due to leave Beijing for Shanghai tomorrow.
