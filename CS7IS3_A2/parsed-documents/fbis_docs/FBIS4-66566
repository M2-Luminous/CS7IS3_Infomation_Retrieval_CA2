Pakistan has been an active supporter of this principle on humane grounds from the very beginning. However, as any intelligent person can understand, the only way to protect human civilization from the nuclear danger is to remove all nuclear weapons and related technology from the whole world. It is amazing that the United States and some other powers are using threats, deceit, avarice, fraud, and other despicable methods against the countries that have this technology and whom they think are a danger to world peace. However, the countries that have the support of the United States and its allies are not checked and are allowed to have these destructive weapons as if they are toys. This attitude is totally atrocious, unfair, and extreme. It is especially used against Pakistan and other Islamic countries, North Korea, and other third world countries about which the United States and its allies for some reason do not have a good opinion. Let us reflect a bit. If India has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and Pakistan is stopped even from using this technology for peaceful uses, how can they guarantee making this region safe from nuclear dangers? This situation can help only make nuclear weapons available for unilateral expansionist designs. Had Japan had nuclear weapons, we can safely say that nuclear bombs would not have been dropped on its two highly populated cities. Therefore, seriousness and responsibility calls for the United States and its cohort nations to either totally end nuclear technology in the whole world or at least form a fair policy for controlling nuclear weapons in this region, instead of coming after the Pakistani nuclear program. If this is not done, then Pakistan has no reason to have its hands amputated and live at the mercy of a cruel country like India. Doing this would be more dangerous than signing one's own death sentence.
