FR941216-0-00024 FR941216-0-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [IL96&hyph;1&hyph;6539a; FRL&hyph;5124&hyph;1] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Illinois AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approves Illinois' May 18, 1994, request to repeal the Stage II vapor recovery control requirements in the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone in the East St. Louis (Metro-East) moderate ozone nonattainment area which consists of three Illinois counties: Madison, Monroe and St. Clair. Section 202 of the 1990 Clean Air Act (Act) provides that Stage II regulations are not required in moderate ozone nonattainment areas if USEPA promulgates on board vapor recovery (OBVR) regulations. The USEPA promulgated OBVR controls on April 6, 1994, which became effective on May 6, 1994. USEPA made a finding of completeness on the SIP submittal on August 24, 1994. In the proposed rules section of this Federal Register , USEPA is proposing approval of and soliciting public comment on this requested SIP revision. If adverse comments are received on this action, USEPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments received in response to this action in a final rule on the related proposed rule which is being published in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register . A second public comment period will not be held. Parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: This final rule will be effective February 14, 1995 unless an adverse comment is received by January 17, 1995. If the effective date of this action is delayed due to adverse comments, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Copies of the Illinois submittal are available for public review during normal business hours, between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., at the above address. A copy of this SIP revision is also available for inspection at: Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Docket and Information Center (Air Docket 6102), Room 1500, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Randolph O. Cano, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Telephone: (312) 886&hyph;6036. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The USEPA approved the incorporation of Stage II vapor recovery control requirements in the East St. Louis area (Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair Counties) of Illinois which was designated as a moderate ozone nonattainment area pursuant to the 1990 Act on January 12, 1993 (58 FR 3841), at 40 CFR 52.720(c)(93)(i)(B). On May 18, 1994, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) submitted a SIP revision request in the form of a February 17, 1994, Final Opinion and Order of the [Illinois Pollution Control] Board in rulemaking R93&hyph;28. Rulemaking R93&hyph;28 repeals the Stage II vapor recovery controls applicable to the East St. Louis area. Stage II vapor recovery systems are designed to control and capture hydrocarbon vapors during the refueling of motor vehicles. Vehicle fuel emissions consist of gasoline vapors displaced from the vehicle tank by dispensed liquid gasoline as the tank is filled. The Stage II system captures these vapors as they exit the fuel fillpipe, thereby preventing escape of the vapors into the atmosphere. Vapor capture is accomplished by one of several types of devices attached to or part of the nozzle of the fuel dispensing system. The Stage II regulations at issue are found at Illinois Administrative Code, Title 35: Environmental Protection, subtitle B: Air Pollution, chapter I: Pollution Control Board, part 219: Organic Material Standards and Limitations for the Metro-East Area, subpart Y: Gasoline Distribution; ยง219.583 Gasoline Dispensing Facilities_Storage Tank Filling Operations, amended at 16 Illinois Register 13883, effective August 24, 1992, and; ยง219.586 Gasoline Dispensing Facilities_Motor Vehicle Fueling Operations, added at 16 Illinois Register 13883, effective August 24, 1992. The USEPA approved the incorporation of these regulations into the Illinois SIP on January 12, 1993, (58 FR 3841). This approval was codified at 40 CFR 52.720(c)(93). Section 202 of the amended Act provides that Stage II regulations are not required in moderate ozone nonattainment areas if USEPA promulgates OBVR regulations (42 U.S.C. 7521(a)(6)). The USEPA promulgated OBVR controls on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16262), which became effective on May 6, 1994. This promulgation was ordered by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as the result of a suit brought against USEPA by the Natural Resources Defense Counsel and others ( NRDC v. Reilly, No. 921137, DC Cir. January 22, 1993). On October 21, 1993, IEPA petitioned the Illinois Pollution Control Board (IPCB) to repeal the Stage II vapor recovery regulations applicable in the East St. Louis area. The IEPA based its petition on the large capital costs associated with Stage II controls and their impact on the economically depressed East St. Louis area to satisfy a requirement which would cease to exist once USEPA completed promulgation of OBVR regulations. The Illinois administrative record for this repeal estimated that 377 facilities would be subject to Stage II control requirements in the East St. Louis area. Capital costs associated with installing these controls exceeded $8,500,000. Further, these controls would not be required once USEPA promulgated OBVR regulations. Based on the administrative record for its rulemaking the IPCB repealed the regulations requiring Stage II vapor recovery in the East St. Louis area. Since section 202 of the amended Act provides that Stage II regulations are not required in moderate ozone nonattainment areas if USEPA promulgates OBVR regulations, USEPA believes that it must allow States to repeal Stage II regulations and revise their SIPs in moderate ozone nonattainment areas unless the State will rely on these regulations to provide emission reductions to satisfy other requirements of the Act, such as to achieve reasonable further progress toward attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. As part of its submittal of this repeal of the requirement for Stage II in the East St. Louis area, IEPA provided assurances that emission reductions from Stage II had not been relied upon in the 15 percent plan for the East St. Louis area. On November 22, 1994, Illinois submitted its final 15 percent plan for the East St. Louis Area. The State's 15 percent plan does not rely on emission reductions from Stage II to achieve the required 15 percent emission reduction requirement. Based on the State's submittal, USEPA is approving the repeal of the Stage II requirements for the East St. Louis area from the SIP. The USEPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, the USEPA is proposing to approve the requested SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective on February 14, 1995 unless adverse or critical comments are received by January 17, 1995.
