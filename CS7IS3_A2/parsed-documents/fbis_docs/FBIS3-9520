A striking figure on the Hungarian literary scene, President Arpad Goncz is certainly the most popular political figure in his country. A renowned former opponent of the communist regime, he is highly respected and represents a kind of moral authority in the country. For two years now he has devoted himself to defending one of the key pillars of democracy: freedom of the press. In this interview he presents his views on this subject as well as on the rapprochement between his country and the EU to L'ECHO. At this juncture, it should be noted that on Tuesday the Hungarian parliament gave the green light to the government to submit an official application for EU membership. That will be done this 1 April, Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross announced. [Delstanche] Your country would like to join the EU and NATO. Do you, like Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, think that 1999 will be too late to join the EU? [Goncz] Yes, I share this view entirely. We would like to join as soon as possible so as to anchor our position among the Western economic system. However, accession also means integration in a security system. Our security does not necessarily have to be guaranteed by NATO. However, the role of the WEU has not yet been clarified, no more than that of the Atlantic Alliance. Nevertheless, we believe that our security should not necessarily be regarded exclusively from the military point of view, but rather considered from a social, material, economic viewpoint, which also implies economic development. Meanwhile, the Partnership for Peace has constituted a very important step forward toward greater security, first because it is an open system and because that means there can be a certain amount of differentiation between the various countries, and second, because the various possible forms of cooperation mean that it can be adapted to local peculiarities. [Delstanche] Does firing 129 journalists from the state radio represent a method that is compatible with Western norms regarding the freedom of the press? [Goncz] The important thing is to understand that it is compatible with the norms regarding freedom of the press as enshrined in the Hungarian Constitution. The provisions of the Hungarian Constitution stipulate quite unambiguously that the freedom of the press be respected, as must citizens' rights to express their opinions. Since until now we have not had any law governing the media, a law that sets out the situation and position regarding electronic media, for the time being it is up to the government to ensure the impartiality of the media while we wait for such a law to be enacted. I fervently hope that the government will meet this obligation. I would like to add that in Hungary we have set up a democratic institutional system. This system is working, but in a fledgling democracy there is also a need to learn the unwritten rules, which takes some time. I am not certain that the preelectoral period is the best time to learn them. [Delstanche] Hungary is often cited as the pioneer of economic and political reforms in Central and Eastern Europe. However, the discontentment seems to be increasing, not only in the political arena, but also at the economic level. What adjustments do you intend to make to your economic strategy? [Goncz] We were indeed pioneers regarding economic transformation, for the reforms introduced in Hungary preceded those launched in other countries by roughly 10 years. And I am absolutely certain that there will be no drastic change. Firstly, because we have three priorities at the economic level: We must bring inflation under control, get to grips with the budget deficit, and reduce the rate of unemployment. These three objectives are calling for compromises on a daily basis. This means to say that any government which comes to power will be obliged to take account of economic realities. It is true that at the economic level, society was expecting a greater share of the new power. However, it started out with a sizeable foreign debt. Moreover, the country, the government, and society were no more prepared for the collapse of the markets in the East than they were for the economic decline that has prevailed in Western Europe. Throughout the region the crisis is rampant, and we will only have put the situation behind us when we manage to increase production, which has dropped in all the countries. In addition, our region will constitute the largest market for Western Europe in the near future. However, for us to be able to welcome its products and prove to be solvent, the Western markets must definitely be opened up. To have one market, another market must be assured in return. That is in our common interests. [Delstanche] The polls are predicting that the Socialist Party will win the elections. Do you accept the interpretation according to which the success of this party is provoked by the economic difficulties caused by the transition, and do you see any danger in this apparent rise of the socialists? [Goncz] No result can be prejudged, and in my capacity as head of state, I am bound over to bow to the opinions of the electorate. However, regardless of whichever party or coalition comes to power, it is certain that the priorities regarding foreign policy will not change. For from this point of view there is a complete consensus at national level. The economic priorities will remain the same, for if we are really seeking to join the international community, we cannot do an about-turn. So it is up to the electorate to decide how we might succeed in meeting these priorities, which will remain unaltered.
