FR941007-2-00085 FR941007-2-00051 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Land Management [MT&hyph;921&hyph;04&hyph;4121&hyph;14&hyph;P; MTM 80697] Availability of Final Environmental Impact Statement and Request for Comments on the Fair Market Value and Maximum Economic Recovery; Coal Lease Application MTM 80697_Western Energy Company AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Land Management announces the availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Western Energy Company's Federal Coal Lease Application MTM 80697 and requests public comment on the fair market value (FMV) and maximum economic recovery (MER) of certain coal resources it proposes to offer for competitive lease sale. The land included in Coal Lease Application MTM 80697 is located in Rosebud County, Montana, and is described as follows: T. 1 N., R. 39 W., P.M.M. Sec. 2: S1/2NW1/4, N1/2NE1/4SE1/4 T. 1 N., R. 40 E., P.M.M. Sec. 6: Lots 1,2,3,4, S1/2N1/2, S1/2 Sec. 8: E1/2, N1/2NW1/4 Sec. 14: S1/2SW1/4, SE1/4 T. 2 N., R. 40 E., P.M.M. Sec. 32: All 2,061.00 acres The Rosebud seam, averaging 22.3 feet thick, is the only economically minable coal seam within the tract. The tract contains an estimated 35.6 million tons of recoverable reserves. Coal quality, as received, averages 8,360 BTU/lb, 25.52 percent moisture, 10.03 percent ash and 0.97 percent sulfur. This coal bed is being mined in adjoining tracts by Western Energy Company. The FEIS addresses the cultural, socioeconomic and environmental impacts that would likely result from leasing these federal coal lands, the cumulative impacts of the coal lease application, and the irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources involved with this action. Three alternatives are addressed in the FEIS: Alternative 1_(Preferred)_Lease the 2,061.00 acres of federal coal lands to Western Energy Company as applied for in the coal lease application with two additional mitigation measures: (1) Establish a 160-foot buffer zone to protect cultural properties; and (2) Plant trees in the buffer zone to screen the traditional cultural properties from intrusions. Alternative 2_(No Action)_Reject or deny the coal lease application. The federal coal lands would not be offered for lease. Alternative 3_(Cultural Resource Avoidance)_The coal lease application would be partially approved. Two cultural properties with values as traditional cultural properties and sites with intangible spiritual attributes would be avoided by excluding federal coal lands in and around these two sites from the coal lease application. The public is invited to submit written comments on the FEIS, the FMV and MER of the tract. In addition, notice is also given that a public hearing will be held on Wednesday, November 2, 1994, on the proposed lease sale, the FMV and MER of the proposed lease tract. DATES: Comments must be received on or before 1 p.m., November 2, 1994. The public hearing will be held at 1 p.m. on the same date at the Miles City District Office, Garryowen Road, Miles City, Montana.
