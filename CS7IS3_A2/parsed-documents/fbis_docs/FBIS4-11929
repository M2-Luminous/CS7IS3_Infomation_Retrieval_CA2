Israeli officials began to stress that Hebron sovereignty is Israel's alone and that this step was taken to calm the situation and explore efforts to bring life back to normal. It seems Israeli acceptance of this step has three objectives. The first is to bring the Palestinian party back to the table of self-rule negotiations in order to implement the Gaza-Jericho First accord. The Palestinian and Israeli delegations began negotiations immediately after signing the agreement. The second objective is to absorb the vengeance and anger of Palestinian citizens in Hebron and the occupied Arab territories in the wake of the massacre and the consequent killing, terrorism, and siege. The third objective is to mislead world public opinion and circumvent the world protest that accompanied and followed the massacre in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque and, since then, the continuing coercion. Despite its importance and significance, this step is not enough to prevent more massacres, terrorism, and deliberate killing in the Hebron area, Jerusalem, and the occupied Arab territories. This will be especially true as long as the occupied territories are planted with settlements and as long as the Israeli Government is providing weapons, support, and protection for the settlers, and even considers them a complementary part of its political and security policy. What happened in Hebron happened before in Jerusalem, 'Ayn Qara, Dayr Yasin, Qibya, and in Gaza, a few days ago. There are plenty of examples. It is likely to happen again anywhere, any time. The Zionist objective has not changed, namely, land without people. What is really needed to end the attacks on defenseless citizens is eliminating the settlements, ousting the settlers from inside and outside Hebron and from the occupied territories, and providing real and effective international protection for the Palestinian people, paving the way to the end of the occupation.
