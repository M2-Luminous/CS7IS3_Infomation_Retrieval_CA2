Aizpeolea and Anabel Diez] [Text] Felipe Gonzalez is paying the price for having formed "too technocratic" a government. Gonzalez admitted as much Friday [11 February] during a rare, unscheduled news conference following the Council of Ministers--he had not called one in the last four years--and noted that although he had not called it for any special reason he intends to do it more often in the future. Gonzalez has told his close advisers to step up public appearances to make up for the invisibility of his government. He thinks that over the last seven months the cabinet has done a great many things, but has failed to get the message to the people. Gonzalez and his advisers understand that as long as the economic situation does not improve, neither will popular perceptions of the work accomplished by his government, which at times seems very little. But the invisible government that Gonzalez put together in July has not made the task of allaying that impression any easier. Gonzalez respects his ministers but has concluded they have only limited capacity to articulate and communicate the kind of political message which, in a time of recession and political complexity, is more essential than ever. Controversy over the alliance with the Catalonian nationalists, divisions among the socialists, and the confrontation with the unions are some of the most serious problems the prime minister has had to face. Problems have been exacerbated by the absence from the Council of Ministers of two heavy hitters on whom Gonzalez was counting: Carlos Solchaga and Jose Luis Corcuera. The two highly combative ministers gave the government a certain gravitas it now lacks. Their replacements, Economy Minister Pedro Solbes, and Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion, have the image of technocrats. Serra's Role Nor does Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra present the appearance of a political heavyweight, and tensions in the cabinet's bicephalous leadership--more specifically between Antoni Zabalza and Jose Enrique Serrano--only make matters worse. Serra too has become concerned about the government's lack of political visibility and has turned to making more frequent appearances in parliament. "In this government, there is only one minister with an established political image: Jose Borrell, minister for public works and transportation. There is another one, Foreign Affairs Minister Javier Solana, but he maintains a low profile owing to his intense dedication to international policy. There is a third who is a politician but doesn't act like one: Minister of Industry Juan Manuel Eguiagaray," according to high level officials in the prime minister's office. Political debate is also virtually absent from meetings of the Council of Ministers. That body cedes absolute authority to Felipe Gonzalez, who is never contradicted. Nonetheless, out of political necessity the head of government last month opened two debates in the lower house--one on the 27 January general strike, and the other on the conflict between the Constitutional Tribunal and the Supreme Court. "The problem is not so much whether things are debated, which hardly matters. The problem is the political stature of the ministers, which is low. The majority of the better ministers are not politicians," say highly placed sources in the administration. Economy Minister Solbes and Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas are good examples. Then there are some ministers who make frequent public appearances but without any political impact. Several independent cabinet members, including Cultural Affairs Minister Carmen Alborch and Commerce and Tourism Minister Javier Gomez Navarro, are clear examples of this type. The refreshing whiff of novelty which Felipe Gonzalez sought when he named these independents has faded. Curiously, the woman who seven months ago was least known among the independents, Health Minister Angeles Amador, has managed her portfolio with remarkable effectiveness. In this gray landscape, the work done by Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, head of the prime minister's office, as spokesman for the government is insufficient, despite his efforts and growing influence. "His visibility, though necessary, is not sufficient to establish the government's political presence," say sources in the prime minister's office. Various social strata are reacting in different ways to this lack of public visibility. In a recent statement on behalf of an association of manufacturers of equipment goods, Jose Maria Vizcaino, former head of the Basque employers' association, criticized the government's lack of leadership. In times of crisis, he said, people need something to hold onto, leadership that inspires confidence, and visibility--and government is falling down in this area. Another business leader, Enrique Kaibel, was surprised and appreciative when a politician, in this instance the undersecretary for public works, Antoni Llarden, attended a businessmen's function in Valencia. Role of Luck The government is pinning its political hopes on success in ending the economic recession. The prime minister is gambling that within a year people will see new jobs appearing and realize the recession is almost behind them. If this does not happen, chances of the government continuing beyond the municipal and autonomous elections in spring of 1995 would be remote. "This is the biggest problem we face as we run the obstacle course that lies ahead," say sources in the government. Meanwhile, the prime minister's advisers seem relatively satisfied with the work accomplished over the eight months the government has been in power. During this time, it has maintained a parliamentary majority in the face of various unpleasant "shocks" thanks to support from the Catalonian nationalists. The biggest problem with the alliance policy has been one of image--a failure to overcome suspicions fueled by the opposition that the pacts with CiU [Convergence and Union] involved offsetting concessions and would compromise the country's territorial integrity. Another recent government success is to have diffused, only two weeks after the general strike, the event's impact on public opinion. The strategy of nonconfrontation with the unions, developed by the prime minister's office, has had an effect. Its success is all the more impressive considering that the prime minister in recent months has been forced to adopt a whole series of "unpopular and necessary" measures such as labor reform and a wage freeze on government workers. What with needed legislation, sectoral measures such as the important health package, and progress on the democratic and autonomous communities agendas, the government, at least in its own estimation, has been running in "high gear" and getting more done than the previous legislature.
