The entire society should be concerned about and support it and make it show Chinese characteristics, world standards, and the Chinese people's sports style of the 1990's. Li Tieying inspected the Tianjin stadium under construction on 31 March. He was accompanied during the inspection by Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Wu Shaozu, minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission; and Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin Municipality. They held an on-the-spot business meeting in a simple work shed on the construction site and listened to a briefing of Tianjin on the preparatory work for the 43d world table tennis championship. Li Tieying said: China successfully hosted the 26th world table tennis championship in 1961. After 34 years, Tianjin Municipality will host the 43d world table tennis championship. We must carefully plan, scientifically organize and meticulously direct such a major world competition. We must make the championship a grand, lively and spectacular event, as well as a complete success. Its success will be of great significance to promoting China's sports, economic construction and building of the spiritual civilization, as well as to further enhancing our international image. The State Council will go all out to support Tianjin in hosting well the 43d world table tennis championship. All departments concerned, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities should coordinate all the activities like pieces in a chess game and contribute to the success of this major international competition. Li Tieying emphasized: The 43d world table tennis championship will provide Tianjin a stage for performance, and the 9 million Tianjin people have a glorious and yet heavy responsibility for performing well on the stage. Tianjin Municipality should take it as an opportunity to make major progresses in comprehensive urban management, appearance of the city, public order, and spiritual civilization, to promote the city's reform, opening up, and modernization, to make itself more famous in the world, and push itself onto the world. Li Tieying pointed out: In hosting large-scale sports and cultural activities, we should adhere to the principle of both striving for spectacle and complete success and practicing economy. We should advocate participation by all, free service, and voluntary work. We should form a contingent of volunteers for the world table tennis championship, integrate the preparatory work for the championship with the building of socialist spiritual civilization, and strive for success in both the sports competition and the spiritual civilization.
