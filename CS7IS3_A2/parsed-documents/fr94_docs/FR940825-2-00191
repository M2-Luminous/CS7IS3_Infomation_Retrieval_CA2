FR940825-2-00191 FR940825-2-00112 Proposed Priority An RERC on low vision and blindness shall_ •Develop technology and methods for the detection, monitoring, and diagnosis of visual impairments in neonates and infants; •Develop technology and methods for orientation and mobility in large open areas, including map reading, or crowded rooms for persons with blindness or low vision; •Develop reduced-cost engineering solutions for increasing utilization of descriptive video; •Develop technology and methods for improving access to visual displays, including flat panel displays (e.g., develop an adaptive template overlay technology for flat panel displays), found in the home, in the community, and at work such as automatic teller machines, home appliances, stereo equipment, and other devices that use LCD and LED technologies; •Develop technology to maintain access to new products with advancing technology used in the home, workplace, and the community, such as solid state displays, keypads, and compact disc technology; •Develop technology, such as emergency alarms, doorbells, and TDD phones, for persons with deaf-blindness to assist them in their activities of daily living; •Develop technology and methods for improving access by persons with low vision or blindness to electronic information systems; and •Develop an engineering design review method for application to proposed new technology projects that first considers commercially available or universal design interfaces before developing orphan technology for individuals with low vision and blindness. Proposed Priority 3: Universal Telecommunications Access Background Generally speaking, individuals with communication disabilities are those with a hearing, vision, speech, or neurological impairment, or a combination of such impairments. This priority proposes a program of research to promote greater access to emerging telecommunications technology by individuals who have communication disabilities. The coming decade is likely to bring advances in the way people communicate over distances. Access to greater bandwidth in the telephone network will lead to new advances, new devices and new services, such as switched video, TV-phones, or voice-to-print (Hinton, OSEP Final Report, ``Advanced Technologies for Benefit to Persons with Sensory Disabilities,'' 1992). Already low-cost facsimile technology, answering machines, and voice mail are changing office communications. Computer-based information services abound, and telephones themselves are no longer standard. Persons with speech impairments are increasingly at a disadvantage with voice recognition and voice mail telecommunication systems because they are designed for standard speech which is clear and contains prosody information. The employment status, social, and family life of persons with disabilities could be affected by their access to advances in telecommunications. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires private employers, State and local governments, employment agencies, labor unions, and joint labor-management committees to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities, including those with communication disabilities. The ADA also requires State and local governments and public accommodations to make available auxiliary aids and services available where necessary to ensure effective communication. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, requires the Secretary, through the Director of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and the Administrator of the General Services Administration, to ``develop and establish guidelines for Federal agencies for electronic and information technology accessibility designed to ensure, regardless of the type of medium, that individuals with disabilities can produce information and data, and have access to information and data, comparable to the information and data, and access, respectively, of individuals who are not individuals with disabilities.'' Section 508 also provides that the guidelines ``shall be revised, as necessary, to reflect technological advances or changes.''
