Notes From Interparliamentary Assembly Session"] [Text] The fourth plenary session of the Interparliamentary Assembly [IPA] of the CIS states was held in St. Petersburg last week. The assembly legally came into being two years ago, when the speakers of the parliaments of seven countries of the former Union signed an agreement setting up the IPA. In actual fact, however, it came into being last year. But I believe that the Russian Supreme Soviet's stormy activity last year overshadowed everything, leaving in the memory of readers no definite attitude toward the international parliamentary organ. To all appearances, the assembly is now breaking out of its zero cycle. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the IPA Council, has very actively set about building this institution of interparliamentary cooperation -- a process that is as yet unusual for the parliaments of our independent states. What is the essence of the IPA's work? It does not adopt binding decisions, just statements, appeals, proposals, and recommendatory legislative acts relating to the CIS states' common problems. These problems are not becoming any fewer. At the same time integration processes are gathering momentum in the Commonwealth countries, and there is a growing desire for concerted actions. Now, as distinct from 1991, positive changes in relations among the peoples of the countries of the former Union really are being felt. The Commonwealth's international organs -- the Councils of the Heads of State and Government -- have now been operating for more than a year. They adopt decisions and reach agreement on economic integration and recently, for example, they adopted the treaty setting up the Economic Union.... But, however many agreements presidents and governments reach, each state has its own laws, customs offices, currencies, borders, etc. It is only possible to surmount these obstacles and coordinate actions by formulating common rules and bringing the CIS countries' legislation closer together. Here the role of the IPA in joint norm-creating activity is inestimable. "We are at the head of the legal process," Shumeyko declared, emphasizing the assembly's role in creating the Commonwealth's common legal area. Incidentally, the day after the parliamentarians' session the international conference "Civil Codes of the Commonwealth States: Harmonization and Modeling" opened in the same place, in the Taurida Palace. But does this modeling, not to mention harmonization, do any good for people? Only in the long term. The assembly's chairman believes that it must get down in earnest to elaborating social policy and prepare some common document like the social charter of the Commonwealth states, which would clearly designate a unified system of social guarantees for citizens living in the CIS. Here there is also the problem of refugees, the possibility of free movement from one state to another, the ensuring of personal safety and safeguarding of property, the prevention of any discrimination whatever when employing people and paying them, guarantees of pension provision when changing the country of residence, etc. What, after all, was decided at the assembly's last session, in which delegations from the parliaments of eight Commonwealth countries participated: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belorussia [Belarus], Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Russia, and Tajikistan? The parliamentarians adopted 17 decrees: on the IPA's role and tasks in strengthening the Commonwealth, on peacemaking actions, the drafting of a model civil code, legal backup for the ecological safety of internal reservoirs, recognition of higher education diplomas, on the drafting of legislative acts in the fight against crime, on a list of recommendatory legislative acts governing economic relations within the framework of the Economic Union, etc. Just one of the drafts proposed by the IPA Council -- on the impermissibility of a blockade of Commonwealth members -- was not adopted. This happened because of disagreements between the parliamentary delegations from Azerbaijan and Armenia. But it is assumed that at the next session it will be possible to reach a consensus on this question too, since a special commission has been set up to work it out under the chairmanship of M. Sherimkulov, speaker of the Kirghiz Supreme Council. A question naturally arises: If all the decisions the assembly adopts are of a recommendatory nature, then surely its activity cannot have serious consequences? It is hard to say whether there will be any practical benefit from these decrees. Not only is the assembly not able to influence the CIS governments and parliaments by virtue of its consultative nature, but neither does it have a mechanism for monitoring the implementation of its own decisions. This is undoubtedly the chief difficulty -- to embody even some of the decrees in legislation. There is no need to recall the difficulty with which laws are adopted in the Russian parliament and, evidently, in others too. How much more difficult is it to bring closer together the lawmaking processes in national parliaments? No mechanisms, no experience.... But without this, all the noble impulses of the heads of state and government will remain just good intentions. The Economic Union will run the risk of remaining a paper union only. The IPA's headquarters in the Taurida Palace could become a factory of legislative daydreams unless a different status is accorded this norm-creating process. In the opinion of observers, the assembly at present is merely a good platform for contacts among parliamentarians and communication among the political elites of the CIS, something like a corridor of trust.
