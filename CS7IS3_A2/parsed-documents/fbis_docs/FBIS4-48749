LPC fighters are frustrated over failure to gain any substantial support and ground from the Bassa, Kru, Grebo, and even some Krahn citizens in the south and southeast of the country and their unprovoked battle against the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]. [sentence as heard] Eyewitnesses say the LPC has unleashed a reign of mayhem on these citizens, because LPC is of the notion that these citizens [are] original supporters of the NPFL. Political analysts are also of the conviction that the current wave of violence to depopulate the southeast is intended to deplete the area of potential voters, who are all likely to vote for the NPFL in the ensuing general and presidential elections in Liberia this year.
