FR940429-0-00259 FR940429-0-00015 (3) The ``unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment'' is computed by subtracting the amount paid by the student for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged from the scheduled cash payment for the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. (4) An institution may exclude from the calculation of a pro rata refund under this paragraph a reasonable administrative fee not to exceed the lesser of_ (i) Five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges assessed the student; or (ii) One hundred dollars. (5)(i) For purposes of this section, ``other charges assessed the student by the institution'' include, but are not limited to, charges for any equipment (including books and supplies) issued by an institution to the student if the institution specifies in the enrollment agreement a separate charge for equipment that the student actually obtains or if the institution refers the student to a vendor operated by the institution or an entity affiliated or related to the institution. (ii) The institution may exclude from the calculation of a pro rata refund under this paragraph the documented cost to the institution of unreturnable equipment issued to the student in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section or of returnable equipment issued to the student in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section if the student does not return the equipment in good condition, allowing for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date of the student's withdrawal. For example, equipment is not considered to be returned in good condition and, therefore, is unreturnable, if the equipment cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and sanitary reasons. The institution must clearly and conspicuously disclose in the enrollment agreement any restrictions on the return of equipment, including equipment that is unreturnable. The institution must notify the student in writing prior to enrollment that return of the specific equipment involved will be required within 20 days of the student's withdrawal. (iii) An institution may not delay its payment of the portion of a refund allocable under this section to a Title IV, HEA program or a lender under 34 CFR 682.607 by reason of the process for return of equipment prescribed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. (6) For purposes of this section_ (i) ``Room'' charges do not include charges that are passed through the institution from an entity that is not under the control of, related to, or affiliated with the institution; and (ii) ``Other charges assessed the student by the institution'' do not include fees for group health insurance, if this insurance is required for all students and the purchased coverage remains in effect for the student throughout the period for which the student was charged.
