The president said, the newspaper notes, that he "favours stronger economic cooperation with Russia" but denies the existence of a territorial issue and that "the international community will not recognise" stronger political ties between the Crimea and Russia. Kravchuk referred to the tripartite agreement on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, which was signed by him as well as by the Russian and U.S. presidents in Moscow. Under this agreement, Washington assumed the role of a guarantor of Ukraine's territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders. Among outstanding issues between Ukraine and Russia, Kravchuk singled out a package of questions connected with the future of the Black Sea Fleet. For instance, he is worried over how and at what price to sell the Ukrainian part of the divided fleet to Russia. The president also expressed hope for a success of his coming U.S. visit on March 4 and his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton. According to Kravchuk, this visit will "help change the position of the international community on Ukraine which will become a nuclear-free state." The Ukrainian president expressed his expectations that the United States will fulfill its obligations to boost financial aid to Ukraine. "Its total sum will possibly amount to 600 or 700 million dollars," he said.
