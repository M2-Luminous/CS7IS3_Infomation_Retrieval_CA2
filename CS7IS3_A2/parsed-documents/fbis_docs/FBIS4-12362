FBIS4-12362 "drnes068_c_94011" FBIS-NES-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Egypt Mufti on Jerusalem, Normalization, Violence Mufti on Jerusalem, Normalization, Violence NC0704123394 Cairo AL-'ARABI in Arabic 4 Apr 94, p 6 NC0704123394 Cairo AL-'ARABI Arabic BFN [Interview with Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, mufti of the Republic, by Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz; place and date not given] [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Pope Shanudah, in an interview with AL-'ARABI, has called for a meeting with al-Azhar's grand imam to discuss ways to liberate the Arab sanctities in Jerusalem. Along the same line, al-Azhar's imam called on Muslims to work toward liberating these sanctities. What is your comment? [Tantawi] I support what both the al-Azhar imam and Pope Shanudah said in this regard. I am fully prepared to cooperate and coordinate with them to discuss ways to regain our sanctities in Palestine. I strongly support this call, because Jerusalem occupies a special place in our hearts. It is the place Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, visited [in his night journey]. We all have to work together for its liberation. This does not mean that we should ignore the other religions' rights in Jerusalem. The Islamic shari'ah reaches out with peace to all those who wish to live in peace with us, but God has ordered us to defend ourselves if we are attacked or oppressed. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What do you think are the ways to liberate Jerusalem from the Zionist enemy? [Tantawi] There are several ways and means, some political, religious, and economic and some others that relate to our Palestinian brothers, who are primarily concerned. If the efforts are combined and the intentions are sincere, we will regain our right, God willing, because no right is lost if someone pursues it. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The U.S. President's recent acknowledgment of Jerusalem as the capital of the Zionist entity has aroused overwhelming Arab and Islamic anger. What is your comment? [Tantawi] First of all, Jerusalem must be Arab and Islamic in flesh and blood. Neither the United States nor anybody else can change Jerusalem's historic status. I support what Dr. Usamah al- Baz has stated; namely, that only Muslims and Arabs can settle this problem. But I repeat that this does not mean that we should deny other religions the right to practice their rites in Jerusalem and to have their share, proceeding from the Prophet's saying: They are entitled to what we are entitled and they owe what we owe. This is precisely the status that Jerusalem has lived under for centuries under Arab sovereignty. Before it was usurped, it was an Arab holy city in which the rights of all religions were safeguarded. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The al-Azhar imam and Pope Shanudah have emphasized that the Hebron massacre resulted from the weakness of the international institutions and that retribution is obligatory. What do you think? [Tantawi] The Hebron massacre is a calamity and constitutes one of the meanest acts of treachery. I believe that it must not go unpunished, because all heavenly messages endorse retribution, which is a necessity, particularly for such an appalling crime. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Do you believe that the massacre has exposed the falsehood of the alleged peace with the Zionist enemy? [Tantawi] Undoubtedly it has cast a dark shadow on the Middle East peace process and made it more difficult. At any rate, this makes it necessary for us to struggle [mujahadat] with our enemies, because we have a right to look after ourselves and defend ourselves relentlessly until death. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There are calls for normalization with Israel in different ways, such as pilgrimage [to sacred sites], which Pope Shanudah has rejected. What do you say about such calls? [Tantawi] First of all, let met tell you that I believe in the exchange of benefits among people, because man cannot live alone without cooperating with those around him. States, too, cannot survive without cooperating with other states. Thus, we welcome any exchange of benefits, but this does not mean that we must fall prey to deceit or that, under the slogan of narrow benefits, we should get involved in things that may harm our entity, beliefs, and sanctities by our enemies and that may bring evil to our country and religion. Damned are those benefits that may lead us to such an abyss. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The Jews claim that they are God's chosen people. What do you think of this claim, particularly since your doctorate degree was based on the "Israelites in the Koran"? [Tantawi] There is nothing called God's chosen people in the Islamic shari'ah, the Koran, or the sunnah [tradition] of the Prophet. Faith and goodness are the only criteria for judging any people or human group. This is what the Koran has emphasized. As to the reference in the Koran that they [the Jews] were given preference over all other people, the context relates to a specific time and place when the Jews were committed to heavenly laws. Later on, no people were so strongly vilified in the Koran as the Jews. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How true are reports that Israelis were in the Fatwa Office [which passes religious rulings] (during a conference on religions attended by university professors, physicians, and clerics from the three heavenly religions)? [Tantawi] I stress to you that the matter was nothing more than an ordinary conference. I did not know about the conference in advance; Dr. Jamal Madi Abu-al-'Azayim, in whom I have full confidence, told me about it. I do not see any reason why we should discuss and scrutinize the identities of those who attended the conference. But I emphasize to you that I did not know that those people were among the conferees. When I am asked to emphasize this, I do not mean to embarrass anyone; I only want to clarify the truth. However, I am fully convinced that the Israelis who entered the Fatwa Office by way of the conference did not, in any way, harm the office or what it symbolizes. If they had tried to do any harm, we would have stopped them and struck back more forcefully, and we have the means and ways to do it. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Some believe that the conference was an attempt to drag the Fatwa Office into the quagmire of normalization [of relations with Israel], especially that the al-Azhar imam has announced his full rejection of cooperation with Israel in any field. [Tantawi] First, I am not with or against anyone; everybody is entitled to his opinion. But I can tell you that when the Fatwa Office is dragged into normalization or other things as an attempt to harm my religion or my country, then I will be available to be called to account at any time. But I believe in a principle that says: Do not say who visited you, but say what you told him. I want to tell you something else: When President Anwar al-Sadat visited Israel, why did the Israelis not say that those who received him were betrayers because they allowed the man to infiltrate Israel? It is not logical to raise these accusations because somebody visited us and in the context I explained. Accusations of infiltration, treason, and so on should not be leveled in this way. In short, I believe that the courageous man is the one who faces the enemy, whether in the enemy's house or in his own. Retreat is a kind of cowardliness that does not find its way to Egypt's mufti. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you view the growing violence in society, and how do you envision the way out of this full national crisis? [Tantawi] Any act that horrifies innocent and peaceful people, no matter who perpetrates it, is a criminal and inhuman act rejected by religion and the Koran. As to the solution, I call for the cohesiveness and solidarity of society and individuals in an attempt to establish what is right and abolish what is wrong. There should be objectivity, honesty, and flexibility. We must proceed from a spirit of love for the homeland. If such cohesiveness is displayed, I believe God will guide us to the best solution to this problem because God certainly rewards those who do good. Security treatment alone is not enough; all institutions and bodies must demonstrate cohesiveness, as I said. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Many intellectuals and other people concerned with the phenomenon of violence believe that democracy is the main solution to this problem. They are urging further democracy. Do you agree with them? [Tantawi] I personally support this demand strongly and persistently. I demand further democracy because democracy begets more democracy and awareness, justice begets justice, good dialogue begets good understanding, and the good word has its good impact on enemies and friends. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] This leads us to the so-called national dialogue. How does Your Eminence view this dialogue? [Tantawi] I believe dialogue, especially between wise men, is the best way to persuade. I welcome dialogue as long as it is meant as a search for the truth regarding disputed issues. The Fatwa Office is open to all people, rulers and ruled, young and old, poor and rich for dialogue and discussion on issues with religious dimensions within our capabilities. I fully support and welcome dialogue over any issue with a view to reaching the truth and serving the country. But I do not favor dialogue that aims at boastfulness, publicity, stubbornness, and so on. Dialogue should be held over issues about which people have different views with the purpose of finding the truth; it should not be meant for showing off.
