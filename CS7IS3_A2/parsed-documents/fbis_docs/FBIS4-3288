During his speech, Li also gave a brief account of China's reform and open policy, as well as its efforts to build up a socialist market economy. "The fundamental purpose of China's economic development is to improve the quality of the life of the entire Chinese people both materially and morally," he said. China remains a developing country and its people are not better-off yet, he said. "It takes arduous efforts of many generations for my country to reach the economic level of an average developed country." China's development requires a lasting stable domestic environment and an international environment of long-term peace and stability as well, especially a good environment in its neighborhood, he said. "For a bright future of China and the world at large, China will make every effort to manage its own affairs well, unswervingly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, develop friendly relations and cooperation with all countries, especially the neighboring nations on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and make a new contribution to peace, stability and development in Asia and the world as a whole," he said.
