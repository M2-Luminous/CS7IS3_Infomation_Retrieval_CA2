FBIS4-53705 "dreas099_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 South Korea Government Not To Object Government Not To Object SK2305062794 Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean 23 May 94 p 1 SK2305062794 Seoul HANGUK ILBO Korean BFN [Text] The ROK Government reportedly came to the conclusion on 22 May not to object to the exclusion of the issue of resuming North-South dialogue from the official agenda of the third-round North Korea-U.S. talks. The government also established a policy that the government will propose a delegates' contact for high-level North-South talks and seek ways to improve North-South relations in general by holding various joint commission meetings, including the Joint Nuclear Control Commission, if North Korea agrees to returning to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and inspections of undeclared facilities in the third round of the North Korea-U.S. talks. The government policy is a step forward compared to when it withdrew the precondition of the special envoy exchange for the third-round of North Korea-U.S. talks announced on 15 April. The policy is based on the analysis that, in the current situation, assurance of North Korea's nuclear transparency can be hastened by momentarily separating the resumption of North-South dialogue from the nuclear issue to prevent it from being a point of dispute. A high-ranking government official said: "The government position is that it would not object to not discussing the resumption of North-South dialogue, including the implementation of mutual nuclear inspections between the North and the South, during the North Korea- U.S. talks." The official continued: "Although North Korea disapproves of the resumption of North-South dialogue, it will be inevitable after the settlement of North Korea-U.S. talks, for instance, during the process of supporting the replacement of North Korea's graphite moderated reactors with light water reactors." Linkage of the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise, which had been discussed in connection with nuclear inspections of North Korea, with the future development of North-South relations, is reportedly undergoing careful consideration by the government.
