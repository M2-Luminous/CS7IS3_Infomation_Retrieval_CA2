Explaining the reasons for the decision in a statement issued on Sunday, the group says the budget would increase taxes, contains no provision for measures to stop the decline of production, for structural reforms, for support for private business enterprise, for the reorganization of insolvent enterprises, for any changes in industrial policy, for demonopolization, for a better social policy, for any measures to improve the situation in the armed forces, or for the insufficient financing of public education and preschool health care, but would increase administrative expenditure. The economic policy guidelines that the draft budget lays provide no basis for further reforms or for solving Russia's acute problems, the group says. It says it is going to propose that the government amend the budget within the next month and put it before parliament every quarter to make it possible to adjust it to new developments.
