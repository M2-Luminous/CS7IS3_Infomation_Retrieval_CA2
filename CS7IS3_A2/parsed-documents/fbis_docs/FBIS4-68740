At a news conference on 27 April, Director of the Union of Stock Exchanges Bykov, president of the RFB [Russian Stock Exchange] Suvorov, Cochairman of the Union of Stock Exchanges Deryabin, and President of the MTB [Moscow Commodities Exchange] Milyukov gave journalists a letter from the Union of Stock Exchanges to President of Russia Boris Yeltsin. It talks, in particular, about the critical situation that has developed in the stock market, which "is threatening to grow into a full wave of scandals and exposures, as a result of which the Russian people will end up deceived and robbed. "All of this is occurring first and foremost, because of a lack of legislation guaranteeing order in the stock market and protecting small investors. In addition, criminality is continuously growing in the stock market." The Commission for Securities and Stock Exchanges and Goskomimushchestvo, which is behind it, are attempting to take the stock market into nonexchange operations and then into cash operations. This will make it possible, in the opinion of the president of the RFB, to work directly on the laundering of criminal money. Depriving the stock market of "clarity," reliability of information, and publicity will intensify the chaos that reigns in the market. The union is calling for order to be brought to bear on the stock market, to protect the population from the stream of false advertising and "open deception by unscrupulous joint-stock companies, and also to create economic conditions for attracting investment in the economy." As is known, not much time is left until the end of voucher privatization. Left without work, Goskomimushchestvo is attempting to establish a network of new, so-called "self-regulating organizations," but under the control of the GKI so that, even at the end of voucher privatization it may take control of the stock market and, evidently, the investment market as well. As the president of the MTB declared, a restoration of state forces has occurred, which it is now assumed will be directed at "curtailing private activity." The establishment of control, in Milyukov's opinion, also threatens the banking system as well. He proposed the establishment of an opposition to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Finance, and Goskomimushchestvo, by uniting the efforts of dealers. "It was not property that Goskomimushchestvo distributed, but title," said the MTB president. New stockholders have practically no influence on the old management. At many enterprises, despite privatization, the former leadership remains, and it is incapable of acting under the new conditions. The GKI is attempting to resolve the problem of the director corps not with economic principles but with regulation of their activities. Thus, a concealed transition back to the command-administrative system is being carried out. In addition, the main error in the GKI's proposed formation of a securities market, in the opinion of attendees at the news conference, is its organization according to the regional principle. The most promising, as I.V. Suvorov declared, is the branch principle, inasmuch as enterprises have maintained mainly only horizontal ties. "For the benefit of its own political aims, the GKI is ignoring the organized financial and intellectual potential of a structure that is already operating on the stock market." Nevertheless, it is exactly the stock exchanges, with their openness, that are the superior indicators of the reliability of one or another security. "Despite the fact that one and a half years ago, in accordance with an edict of the president of the Russian Federation, a Commission on Securities and Stock Exchanges was established that was entrusted with the functions of regulating the stock market, this commission was practically idle for the entire period of its activity. The clause of the president's edict on including representatives of the stock exchanges on the staff of the commission has not been implemented to this day." In connection with what was enumerated above, the Union of Stock Exchanges submitted a request to the president of the Russian Federation for a meeting, with the participation of representatives of the exchanges themselves, and also the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Economy, and the Central Bank. The purpose of the meeting--to set forth a program of immediate actions that would facilitate the prevention of "the danger that is threatening to turn into serious social shocks, and to direct the activity of the Committee on Securities and Stock Exchanges to the creation of favorable economic conditions for attracting investments in Russia's industry." Henceforth, the GKI will fight on two fronts with yet another serious opponent who is characterized by a far clearer formulation of business interests and organizations than the deputies of the State Duma.
