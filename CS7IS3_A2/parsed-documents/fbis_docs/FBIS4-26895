It is a street full of enterprises jointly funded by compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, overseas Chinese in foreign countries and their relatives, and other private businesses. The street got its name of "Taiwan Jie (Street)" because most of the investors in it are from Taiwan. Its construction in Macheng city, in central China's Hubei Province, started a year ago. Its creation has attracted considerable attention to Macheng, which has a 1,000-year history. The Dabie mountains were said to have been formed in ancient times by a god-like soft-shelled turtle. Streets in Macheng, located high in the Dabie mountains, are narrow and small, having been constructed in long-ago centuries. Over the past three years, the city has built, or rebuilt, twelve streets, totalling 12 km. The 1.2 km Taiwan Street is just one of the newly-constructed streets. According to local officials, more than 380 households have approval to build in Taiwan Street, and work has started on two thirds of them. Among more than 100 households who have finished their building, more than half have started different kinds of commercial operations in their newly-built houses. Without costing the central government a penny, the construction of the street has so far cost more than 20 million yuan, most of it directly contributed by compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and from abroad. More than 5,000 people whose origins lie in the city still live in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and in foreign countries. Their relatives still living in Macheng now number 30,000. About 1,000 compatriots from Taiwan and from foreign lands who have Macheng origins have returned to the hometown for visits over the past years. Encouraged by the local government, relatives of Taiwan compatriots have started more than 100 enterprises or businesses. The officials said the construction of Taiwan street is aimed to cater for the demands to start more enterprises funded by relatives of Taiwan compatriots, and for improving the investment environment. It also caters for the convenience of compatriots from Taiwan and other overseas Chinese during their visits to the hometown. Houses in Taiwan architectural style, many of them three-storeyed, line the two sides of the 24-meter-wide Taiwan Street. Service facilities such as amusement centers, shopping mart, hotels, restaurants and banks have also be constructed. According to the officials, when the first phase of building the street is finished, it will attract 45 million yuan for construction, see the establishment of more than 400 private businesses or shops, and the annual volume of business or output value is expected to surpass 80 million yuan. The local government of Macheng not only hopes that the building of Taiwan Street will help strengthen its urban economy, but also that the street will help to promote exchanges in various fields across the Taiwan Strait.
