She is optimistic about the possibility that our country might become the beneficiary of significant financial support. Danish economic cooperation with our country was discontinued after [former Bolivian dictator Luis] Garcia Meza's coup in 1980. The cooperation agreement was not restored for over a decade. Bolivia may now be a Latin American country chosen to receive financial support from this Nordic country. [Begin Degn recording in Danish with superimposed translation into Spanish, in progress] ...actually much interest, and eager to visit the cooperation projects between Denmark and Bolivia. [end recording] Asked why the cooperation had been discontinued for such a long time, the minister explained that Denmark had waited for democracy to be solidly established in our country. Bolivia is, however, not the only country hoping for this financial assistance. [passage indistinct] With the goal of convincing the Danish Government of our country's various needs, Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas will join Minister Degn in traveling to Beni Department and the plateau region. [Begin Cardenas recording] In our governmental agenda this cooperation is required, especially in the fields of agriculture, craftsmanship, the advancement of women, educational reform, dairy products -- an area in which they have already been supporting us in a significant manner -- and other areas that our country may propose to Denmark. I have discovered that she has an extremely positive attitude toward cooperation with our country. These three days will be dedicated to talking with her in depth to convince her -- and convince the Danish people -- of resuming and normalizing their cooperation with our country. I hope the rains will allow us to have an uneventful and successful trip. [end recording] The Danish minister was optimistic. She also visited Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and Economic Development Minister Fernando Romero. Danish cooperation will be earmarked in particular for social programs. If positive results are achieved, it will involve $20 million.
