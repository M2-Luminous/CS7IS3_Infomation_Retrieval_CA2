Because various localities have been busy with rescue and relief work, they have had no time to prepare detailed statistics on losses. The Guangdong Headquarters for Prevention of Three Kinds of Natural Disasters has sent a "report on the struggle against floods, efforts to deal with the emergency, and the state of the disasters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang." This reveals that according to incomplete statistics from the four cities of Shaoguan, Qingyuan, Zhaoqing, and Zhongshan, 29 counties and cities have been hit by floods, and 3.177 million people have been affected. Of these, 740,000 are surrounded by floodwaters, 300,000 in Shaoguan City, 340,000 in Qingyuan City, and 100,000 in Zhaoqing City. Some 280,000 houses have been ruined, 37,000 houses have collapsed, 101 people have died, 49 people are missing, 147,000 hectares of farmland have been hit, and a number of medium and small irrigation projects have been seriously damaged. The situation revealed by the flood disaster this time shows that most of the embankments which defend small areas and which have low fortification standards have collapsed. For example, 31 embankments in Qingyuan City have collapsed. Of these embankments, four were protecting a 10,000 mu or larger area of land; in Zhaoqing City, 99 embankments each protecting an area of less than 10,000 mu of land, have collapsed, and five embankments each protecting an area of 1,000-10,000 mu, have water running over them, and gates have to be lifted to let water pass through in order to protect them. The seats of counties and towns along the rivers and coast have been seriously inundated--a total of 13 county seats have been inundated. For example, Yangshan County is four meters under water, whereas in the counties of Fengkai, Yunan, Yingde, and Lechang, water has risen to the second floor. More than 70,000 people in Yingde City are now relying on biscuits, mineral water, and medicine dropped to them from helicopters. According to information, during the floods this time, torrents of water rushed down the mountains and landslides occurred, blocking many roads. For example, State Expressway 107 was not through north of Yangshan and the main roads and bridges in Liannan and Lianshan have been blocked by mud from landslides. Meanwhile, houses have collapsed as a result of landslide, for example, at Sanzhou Management Zone in Liannan County's Damai Hill, 33 people died when their houses collapsed. Power transmission lines and irrigation facilities have also been damaged by landslides. In Yangshan County's Chakeng Reservoir, a moderate landslide and the collapse of a wall along the spillway have blocked the water tunnel with rocks and mud but the situation has been promptly handled and the reservoir has been rendered safe.
