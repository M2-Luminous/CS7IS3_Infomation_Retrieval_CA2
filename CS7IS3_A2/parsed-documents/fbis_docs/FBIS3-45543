This was suggested by Ren Jianxin, the visiting president of the Supreme People's Court (SPC) of China, when meeting Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong today. During the meeting, Ren said since cooperations in economic, scientific and technological fields between Singapore and China are expanding, there will be some cases that have to be resolved. During Ren's meeting with Singapore Chief Justice Yang Pung How earlier today, the two sides agreed that China and Singapore should increase personnel and information exchanges and, in the due course, conclude an judicial agreement so as to defend foreign investors' lawful rights and legitimate private properties. Goh said the planned judicial cooperation between the two countries would play a great role in promoting economic cooperation between China and other countries, which, in turn, will attract more foreigners to do business and to invest in China. Ren and his 8-member delegation arrived here from Indonesia on Tuesday for a four-day official visit here at the invitation of Yang Pung How. The Chinese SPC president will call on Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew tomorrow.
