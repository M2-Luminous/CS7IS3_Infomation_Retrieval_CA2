This emerged this evening in consultations held by the prime minister and the foreign minister. A check conducted by our correspondent reveals that a majority is emerging in the cabinet in favor of evacuating the settlers from the heart of Hebron. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports: [Begin recording] [Rosen] Shim'on Peres set the tone in yesterday's cabinet session, when he called on his fellow ministers to comply with the new demands of the Palestinians. Today he reiterated as much it in public. [Peres] To the extent that their demands are sensible, they will be examined. For example, if the Palestinians say the size of the police force must be increased, I believe it is a legitimate demand which requires pointed discussion. [Rosen] It is now clear that the cabinet's decisions are not enough, and that the PLO will have to be given more. Some ministers, including hawks such as Ya'aqov Tzur, argue that much more than 30 settlers must be disarmed and their movements must be restricted. More radical proposals have been floated in the cabinet. For example, there apparently is a majority in favor of evacuating the settlers from Bet Hadasa, Bet Romano, and Tall al-Rumaythah in Hebron. Half the cabinet ministers are unequivocally in favor of such a move: The four ministers of Meretz -- Shulamit Aloni, Ya'ir Tzaban, Yosi Sarid, and Amnon Rubinstein -- as well as Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, Yisra'el Qeysar, 'Uzi Bar'am, and Mikha Harish, who makes his consent conditional on such a demand coming from the defense establishment. Three ministers oppose it: Shim'on Shetrit, Ya'aqov Tzur, and Ora Namir. The latter favors such a move, but does not believe it is feasible. Two other ministers, Moshe Shahal and Shim'on Peres, refused to answer. One minister, David Liba'i, said he is not knowledgeable on the matter. Nevertheless, it is hard to see any of them voting against such a proposal if it is raised. We could not obtain the answer of Minister Avraham Shohat. Yitzhaq Rabin is opposed to reopening the Declaration of Principles, but it is not certain that he perceives the evacuation of Hebron as falling in that category. When we asked him about it today, he replied: I am not prepared to elaborate. [end recording] [Later in the broadcast, the announcer adds: "The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza is furious at our report that most ministers are in favor of removing the settlers from the heart of Hebron." In a recorded passage, local settlement leader Elyaqim Ha'etzni states: "If they touch any settlement, including the Jewish settlement in Hebron, all of us to the last man will prevent it. Nobody will stay alone here. Not even one brick will be removed from this edifice. Let this much be clear. We will be followed in our footsteps by every Jewish patriot in Eretz Yisra'el. Indeed, all of us here will not allow them to tear us apart one by one. They will not start with Hebron, which may very well be the most precious of all our settlements."]
