A paper article affirmed that President Clinton had misled the supreme legislative authority and pushed it to back up an inhumane and unjust policy, entirely intercepting values and principles included in the U.S Constitution. This behaviour simply contradicts the oath of presidency in which Clinton vowed to perform his duties sincerely, the paper said. It added that President Clinton had perpetrated the crime of insistence on killing thousands of Iraqis through maintaining the blockade for longer time. If the Congress is loyal and sincere to the American Constitution and its well-known duties, it should underline Clinton's premeditation on lie and misleading the American public opinion and the Congress and committing the crime of the human race annihilation, the paper confirmed. It stressed that Clinton's lies were another evidence of his political and moral failure and bankruptcy and his weakness and reluctance.
