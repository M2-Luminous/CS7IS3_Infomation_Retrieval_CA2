Yesterday, Lech Walesa said that "for now" he will not sign the budget, while Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy recalled that the deadline for Walesa to veto the budget is 25 April. "There is conflicting information emerging from the President's Office--sometimes it is that the president will sign the budget, and, at other times, that he will veto it." So say politicians with whom we talked, and they also add that similar news was coming out of the Belweder regarding Rosati's candidacy. Why President Would Invoke a Veto "The nation has been cheated again; life was supposed to get better," Walesa said yesterday, while explaining why he would not sign the budget "for now." But he immediately made the stipulation that, "from an economic viewpoint," he is desperate because he knows that, apart from minor changes, the budget law cannot be amended a great deal. Even Walesa's critics admit that, so far, he has not undertaken any specific measure that would be targeted against market transformations. He has signed all economy-related laws (with the exception of the one concerning retirement pensions for uniformed officials), even those that limited senior citizens' income levels. Views on the budget adopted by the Sejm tend to be unanimous: Generally speaking, the budget maintains the direction of reforms implemented thus far. International financial institutions and our Western creditors express a similar view. It is obvious that lack of a budget law would get a bad perception in those circles. So why is the president suggesting that he might not place his signature on the document? "To clearly demonstrate that he is keeping a distance from the current governing coalition and to be favorably looked upon by future voters whose views are populist and geared toward making claims"--this is what some say. "He is hoping that he will manage to dissolve the parliament at the same time"--this is what other people assume. The first hypothesis could be confirmed by friendly gestures vis-a-vis Solidarity, which is demanding that the budget be changed or else the trade union will wage a general strike. "Except that, this way, Walesa would alienate those whom he once addressed by saying: `Take things into your own hands.'" This is what Wieslawa Ziolkowska, of the Union of Labor [UP], thinks. Would the president be empowered to dissolve the parliament if the Sejm failed to overrule his veto on the budget? Provisions of the Small Constitution confirm yet again that the document is not specific enough. Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], fears that one could make the interpretation that the president could indeed dissolve the parliament. But the view prevails that the parliament enacted the budget, and it did so within the three-month period required by the Constitution. Andrzej Potocki, of the Democratic Union [UD], even says that the Sejm could readopt the same version of the budget within about a dozen days. Dangers It Can Cause "The president will not accomplish anything by vetoing the budget. It will practically have zero impact on the domestic situation because the Constitution provides that, if there is no adopted budget law, the government acts on the basis of what it had itself submitted before, which in this case means the budget that was adopted and later vetoed," Sejm Deputy Ziolkowska says. But she also adds that lack of a budget law "will cause external destabilization. Our foreign creditors have agreed to reduce our debts mainly because of the solutions contained in the budget." Sejm Speaker Oleksy, among others, has a different view: "A delay in the signing of the budget law prevents financial means from flowing down from the central budget to those institutions that are financed by that budget. If the president does not sign the budget law, an unstable situation will be created `completely unnecessarily.'" We asked Elzbieta Suchocka, a director at the Finance Ministry, to explain the issue. In her view, in a situation where the law was adopted by the Sejm but was not published in DZIENNIK USTAW [official publication with final versions of laws adopted by parliament and signed by the president] (due to a delay in the president's signing or lack of a signature), the law's status is the same as that of a draft law, which means it exists in effect but with one important proviso: There are authorizations contained in the budget law for the Council of Ministers to issue executory legal acts. The government is not authorized to issue such acts without a law. So it would not be possible, for instance, to issue bonds (which are one of the sources of financing the budget deficit) or to devote reserves from centrally financed projects to gminas [small administrative units] endangered by unemployment. There would also be problems with agricultural credits. What Will Happen According to our estimates, it is almost certain that a presidential veto, if it did occur, would be overruled. A two-thirds majority vote is required for that. The SLD coalition does not have such a majority; it is nine votes short of the 307 required. As UP's Wieslawa Ziolkowska told us, she will make efforts to have the UP Sejm Deputies Club vote in favor of overruling the veto. Even though UP voted against the budget during the Sejm vote, "these are two separate votings." The government would operate under the "old budget" anyway, but it would cause effects outside of Poland. UD still does not know how it will vote, and its Sejm deputies "would have to consider the issue."
