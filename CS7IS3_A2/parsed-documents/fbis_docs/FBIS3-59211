Hardly anybody is contributing more to this postmiraculous world than the man who made change his political trademark -- Bill Clinton. This was emphasized and proved by his appearance in Congress yesterday. In the middle of an international landscape of political crises, disenchantment on the part of the voters, and superannuated governments, one could see one of the last and rare political winners. The man who a year ago in the same place complained about the economic crisis, which he allegedly inherited, has now presented himself as its triumphant master and winner. This is all the more astonishing since right at the beginning, Congress took away from him that instrument -- a $30-billion program for the stimulation of the U.S. economy -- with which he wanted to overcome the crisis. Nevertheless, the economy recovered, probably by following different laws than those that Clinton had in mind. However, yesterday he did not hesitate for one minute in presenting himself as the man who saved the nation from the crisis. It is irrelevant to ask whether this bold claim of Clinton is legitimate. The only thing that counts is that the great majority of citizens, who like to personify political movements, accept Clinton in this role. This has also resulted in a remarkable change of the political climate in the United States. No longer troubled by the recession, the citizens are more receptive and cooperative than before. The shocking and warning words of the early Clinton days -- "It's the economy, you idiots" -- are no longer up to date. The citizens are turning to other problems. They are no longer so interested in wealth, profit, and those priorities that characterized the 1980's. Priority is now being given to questions of personal security and the renewal of disappearing family values. In a nutshell: The citizens no longer expect the state so much to provide benefits and jobs as to act as a defender against the violence in the streets of the United States, which is getting out of hand and is breaking social structures. Nobody has realized that faster than the populist Bill Clinton, who keeps in closer contact with the citizens than any other U.S. president has in the past three decades. Proof of that lies in the program that he presented yesterday. It no longer focuses on economic acronyms such as NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] and GATT, but the concern about the health and security of the citizens. The reform of the health sector, and his law to contain the crime rate will be the crucial issues for the next few months. Popular as they may be -- they will not be a comfortable free ticket to success, such as Clinton had in the way he dealt with the economic crisis last year. The reason is that Americans will be going to the polls again this year. Congress, which will be reelected in the autumn, will be a significantly more reserved and difficult partner. The Republicans, who were still important and willing partners for Clinton in his struggle for NAFTA, have already assumed an aggressive posture. They have criticized Clinton's reform of the health system as "socialized medicine" and will not let him get away with taking from them their reputation as the "law-and-order" party with his "crime bill." Clinton understands his initiatives as a new partnership with the citizens for social peace. His critics have made out an excessive degree of state intervention in this partnership. Thus, the old ideological fronts between the Democrats and the Republicans, which seemed to have vanished in the past few months, will reappear. In view of these internal priorities, yesterday nobody expected Clinton to come up with a profound foreign policy program. Therefore, it was all the more astonishing that he did not degrade the issue to a mere footnote. His statement of the "responsibility for leadership" was hardly part of his foreign policy concept last year, when he was permanently concentrating on looking for the emergency exits in international crises. Since his last visit to Europe at the latest, he felt that this escape route is now only open to a limited degree. The developments in the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, and North Korea will, with great probability, require action in the near future. The promise he made yesterday, namely to stop the cuts in the U.S armed forces, which he had so far vehemently proposed and implemented, is a first sign for a U.S. security policy that is no longer exclusively based on lofty words or the action transit to the United Nations. Nevertheless, one must warn against too high expectations for change in this sphere from the so-called president of change. His appearance yesterday has emphasized that quite clearly: Bill Clinton is a brilliant political "salesman," who can still handle words better than power. Yet, apart from that -- as could be seen in the recent scandal stories -- he is still a man for unpredictable things. Before this president will really go down in history, he will first have to settle the stories that still accompany his career. Until then there is still much time for astonishment.
