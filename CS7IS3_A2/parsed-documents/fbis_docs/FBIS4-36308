This comes at a time when the Western forces deployed in northern Iraq are pretending that they have exerted great efforts to end the bloodshed! However, the Iraqi Kurds have documented proof in hand that shows that not only have the Western forces not taken any effective steps to this end, but they have been the major fomenter of these conflicts, hence their call for their leaders to ask the officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran to mediate in ending the bloodshed.
