Parliament ratified Bulgaria's credit agreement with Japan's Export-Import Bank signed last June in Tokyo. The agreement is for U.S.$100 million. The loan is extended in the form of co-financing the World Bank's structural adjustment loan. "The loan is granted at a time when this country is actually isolated in the international credit market and will have a positive effect on the stabilization of Bulgaria's economy and its successful adjustment to market principles," the prime minister wrote in his request to parliament for the ratification of the agreement. Parliament also ratified the financial agreement between Bulgaria and the European Investment Bank (the Bulgarian Airspace Development and Control Project) signed in Luxembourg last July. The agreement is for ECU 30 million and will help upgrade Bulgaria's system of air navigation services. Parliament passed on second reading parts of the road traffic law. The registration of a fifth parliamentary group -- "Nezavisimost" ("Independence"), was announced today. It comprises deputies who left the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces and the coalition of the formerly communist Socialists. Making this announcement, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov said that the "tendency towards a multiplication of parliamentary groups does not contribute to political stability." "The new formations are established far from the electors and create certain difficulties in parliament's work," Mr. Yordanov said. At the beginning of today's sitting Socialist MP Yanaki Stoilov announced that the parliamentary faction of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is ready to discuss the closing down of the Legislative Committee in order to unblock the legislative process. Mr. Stoilov demanded changes in the Parliamentary Rules of Procedure which would no longer make it possible for the Legislative Committee to stop bills. According to Mr. Stoilov many important bills are being held up in the Legislative Committee. According to Mr. Nino Stavrov MP of the BSP, at a session of the Parliamentary National Security Committee earlier today, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said that Bulgaria's stand on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is neutrality. "This country is for a peaceful solution of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia," Mr. Daskalov said, according to Mr. Stavrov. The committee heard today Colonel Stefan Dimitrov nominated as chief of the National Security Service. DPS MP's had talks today with Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov. The DPS asked for the allocation of more funds to the construction to country roads.
