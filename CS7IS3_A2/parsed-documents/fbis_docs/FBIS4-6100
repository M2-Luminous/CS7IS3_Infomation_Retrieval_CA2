Can the coalition ruling parties cooperate in the elections, given the outburst of disharmony over the people's welfare tax proposal? Who are the potential newcomers in the vacant districts? The battle has already begun. SANDE MAINICHI Forecast of Small District Seats (Total seats: 300) Political Predicted Certain Ahead Potential Potential Party No. of victory (but Seats unlikely) Ruling Parties Social 30 4 13 20 23 Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] Shinseito 50 22 25 15 8 Komeito 30 2 24 18 4 Sakigake 31 10 17 13 9 Democratic 11 1 11 3 2 Socialist Party [DSP] Others 20 5 9 8 17 Opposition Parties Liberal 123 19 51 77 108 Democratic Party [LDP] Japan 2 0 0 0 8 Communist Party [JCP] Others 3 1 1 0 4 Subtotal 128 20 52 77 120 Note: The predicted numbers of seats for the various parties were calculated centering on "certain victory," "ahead," potential winners. "Others" within the ruling parties include those candidates of the "Reform Society" who are not currently members of the coalition, but who will become unified candidates of the coalition parties during elections. The "Others" of the opposition are LDP-related independents. New Party Forces Lure LDP Dietmen Individually In a single-seat constituency electoral district, a party is officially permitted to field only one candidate. In the LDP's case, Dietmen who are based in the same district could be eliminated from designation as official candidates. For example, in Akita Prefecture which will have three electoral districts, there are currently five LDP Dietmen. Unless two of them move to proportional districts or switch to other parties, they will not survive. Dietman Tadao Sato who seeks his fourth election in the Akita first district--a new electoral district--explains his position as follows: "At this stage, I will not consider leaving the party in advance. However, if I fail to receive official party endorsement, I will probably have to decide on forming a new party. If intraparty endorsement of the LDP fails to make progress, I may refuse official endorsement by the LDP." The case of Dietman Koji Sakamoto who plans to run from the Fukushima fifth district is similar. "I will watch the allocation by party headquarters at this point. However, not only in Fukushima but elsewhere also, it is doubtful whether those who have fought bitterly against each other can adjust smoothly and cooperate. The split of the LDP is inevitable." Both Dietmen deny any overtures from the other parties. However, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Sakigake [Harbinger] parties that seek expansion are secretly competing to recruit LDP Dietmen. One Shinseito affiliate boasts: "Just you watch. We will get 20 from the LDP."

Meanwhile, the coalition parties must also narrow down their candidates in order to compete against the giant opposition party, the LDP. General Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa of Komeito made a speech at the Central Executive Committee meeting on party expansion on 9 February, and he promoted a concept of "formation by the coalition parties of a new-new party with a single party name." Certainly, if it is possible, it would be the best strategy vis-a-vis the LDP, but its realization is extremely difficult. In the large cities of Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Osaka where the new parties garnered massive victories in the previous election, the ruling party candidates will butt heads against each other here and there. Moreover, under the new electoral district system with the recognition of an overlapping among candidates, candidacy in the electoral district will be directly linked to the overlaying of proportional votes. Therefore, each party cannot simply yield ground. This was compounded by the fracturing within the ruling parties that surfaced over the people's welfare tax proposal. The general election is likely to take place with a split right down the middle between the bloc that aggressively promotes the proposal--which includes Shinseito and Komeito, and the opposing bloc which includes Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and the cautious Sakigake party. Also, Japan New Party [JNP] headed by Prime Minister Hosokawa could become the "mowing ground" for the two blocs.

However, in the actual election, there is a strong possibility of a tripolar structure consisting of the LDP, the Shinseito/Komeito, and the SDPJ/Sakigake. Of course, it is absolutely impossible to predict how the post-election composition of the administration will turn out. Meanwhile, it is likely that many of the new candidates in the single-seat constituencies will be switch-overs by local government heads and members of the prefectural and municipal assemblies. In the case of Tokushima Prefecture, the name of former Governor Shinzo Miki is rumored as an LDP candidate from the third distict, and the name of former Tokushima City Mayor Toshiharu Miki has also emerged in the first district. In the Fukuoka third district, Mikito Kusuda, mayor of Chikushino City, is seen as a strong runner from Shinseito. Also, in Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka where there are many blank districts for the LDP, multiple numbers of local assemblymen appear likely to run as candidates. "Under the single-seat constituencies electoral district system," the power of the branch organization will become stronger than the prefectural organization, and an election on a neighborhood-unit basis will become inevitable" (LDP Dietman Shunichi Yamaguchi). In addition to seeking out such local politicians, each party is also scouting nationally known newscasters and star talent as proportional district candidates to win floating votes. Yoichi Masugoe, a political scientist, and newscaster Hatae are reportedly being induced to run from Shinseito and Japan New Party respectively. Highly popular Taro Kimura and Shigeru Roki reportedly have more than one party vying for them. A general election could be held as early as next year. Aside from the question of whether the quality of the candidates will improve, a rise in the voting rate appear certain.
