They had discussions on new features of the market economy in order to strengthen comprehensive coordination of the economic operation. A decision made in the conference stated that a system is to be set up for the holding of conference to achieve such an end. Following analysis and review of the current economic situation in China, participants pointed out that much work should be done with emphasis on "comprehensiveness" and "coordination". The national economy should be kept at continuous, rapid and healthy development through means of timely regulation of the economic operation. The conference concluded that work should be done to strengthen and improve comprehensiveness and coordination of economic operation. First, establishment of the socialist market economy system is necessary. It is rather complicated in the economic operation during the transition period when the new system replaces the old one. Old problems resulting from the planned economy system were uncovered while new ones appeared under the new situation, all of which should be seriously dealt with. A large workload to cover so many sectors with emphasis on coordination is expected. Quality of such coordinated work is directly related to the reform and development as a whole. Second, it is necessary to have macro-economic regulation further strengthened and improved. Serious fluctuation in the economic development can be prevented by means of implementation of policies on timely regulation of economic operation. Third, problems facing the current economic situation involved such fields as production, transport, internal trade and foreign trade as well as many departments. It is difficult to get them solved just by one individual department, and comprehensive and coordinated efforts have to be made to solve them. Officials from Ministries of Metallurgy, Coal, Electronics, Machine-building, Chemistry, Geology and Mineral Resources, Railways, Communications, Internal Trade as well as Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation plus the China Light Industry Council, the China Textile Industry Council, the State Administration of Taxation and the State Statistical Bureau, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council attended the conference.
