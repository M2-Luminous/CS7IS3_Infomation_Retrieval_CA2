This is how Vytautas Landsbergis commented on the news that Russian President Boris Yeltsin admitted in his letter to Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas that Russia linked the implementation of economic agreements signed last autumn with transit from the Karaliaucius [Kaliningrad] region. Having received this letter, President Algirdas Brazauskas told journalists that Lithuania cannot agree to Russia's policy in this respect. According to him, the agreement signed in Vilnius last November was the result of one stage of negotiations, however, negotiations concerning the transit from the Kaliningrad region and the visa regime is a matter of further negotiations. Vytautas Landsbergis said that he believes that President Algirdas Brazauskas is not inclined to give in, however, contracts and prices for transit fixed by lower-ranking officials remain in the realm of unanswered questions. If the income for the state budget is rejected by one's own will, then this looks like corruption, Vytautas Landsbergis said [sentence as heard]. This was a Baltic News Service report.
