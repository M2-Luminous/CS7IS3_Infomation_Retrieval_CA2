Today, the honored U.S. visitor [Defense Secretary Perry] was received by Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Kazlowski and Council of Ministers Chairman Vyacheslav Kebich. In the afternoon, the defense secretary visited the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. During William Perry's visit, U.S. experts and managers of the largest industrial enterprises in Belarus worked on the issues of conversion. First Deputy Defense Minister Alyaksandr Tyshynski, leader of the working group's Belarusian team announced the results of the joint activities. [begin recording] Tyshynski, in Russian: Esteemed U.S. Minister [as heard] Perry, esteemed Pavel Pavlavych [Kazlowski]! At today's meeting, we exchanged opinions on many aspects of cooperation. We heard detailed reports by Mr. Barry Carter and Mr. Pugachev, who is chief of the Defense Ministry Scientific-Technical Committee. To many questions asked by the representatives of industries... [Tyshynski changes thought] Today, one-third of the largest enterprises are present here, those at which conversion is beginning. Those are the Belarusian optics and mechanical amalgamation Belomo headed by General Manager Hurski, the production amalgamation of computing equipment headed by General Manager Kharlap, and the production amalgamation Integral headed by its Chief Engineer Kaloshin. We heard short reports and answers to many questions asked by [words indistinct] enterprises. It was interesting for the Belarusian side to hear about the possibilities for expanding cooperation in many other directions (?including) the Nunn-Lugar direction. It would now be very important and appropriate to form a committee for the conversion of defense industries that would accelerate the implementation of those projects that have been set up almost two years ago and will enable expansion of conversion of [word indistinct] enterprises. Let me give the floor to Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Pavlavych Kazlowski. Kazlowski, in Russian: Esteemed defense minister, gentlemen. I am happy to realize that between the Republic of Belarus and the United States, between our armies and nations stable businesslike relations are developing. The declaration which we are going to sign on the principles of the Joint Committee for Conversion of the Enterprises of Defense Industries confirms the mutual [word indistinct] striving of the sides for peace, and orienting the defense complex toward the needs of a civilian society. The problems of conversion are just one of the components of the developing cooperation, and today, we talked about many elements of this cooperation. This is a demonstration of peaceful trends inherent in our state. The rather high activity of meetings and negotiations at different levels between the Ministries of Defense is a demonstration of mutual interest, necessity, and the long-range nature of our relations. In its domestic policy, Belarus has chosen the path of social peace and accord, and the development of human rights and freedoms. Their priority character has been certified by our Republic's legal acts. Belarus has proclaimed its non-nuclear status, its striving to become a neutral state, and is continuously and unconditionally observing its commitments. We are grateful to you, Mr. Minister for your understanding of the problems of the Belarusian people, your readiness to cooperate and assistance in [words indistinct]. I would like you to pass our best wishes of wealth, happiness, and prosperity to the people and the President of the United States.[end recording] The ceremony of signing the agreement on principles of the joint committee for conversion has started. The floor was then given to U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry.[passage omitted on Perry comments]
