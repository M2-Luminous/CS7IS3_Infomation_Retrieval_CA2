Mr Mathews Dikane said the large Umkhonto we Sizwe group arrived in Johannesburg on Friday last week after being told by MK officials at Shell House that they should report to an assembly point at Wallmannstal near Pretoria. "We travelled in 31 taxis from Port Elizabeth, but when we reported at the assembly point near Pretoria we were turned away. We then returned to Shell House, but since Friday we have not heard a thing from the MK people in the building. We have nothing to eat, no accommodation and we are sleeping in the taxis. The taxi drivers were told they would be paid when they came to Johannesburg, but now they are stuck here with no money coming from MK officials. The leadership of the organisation, including Mr Nelson Mandela, have not been told about our desperate plight," said Mr Dikane. Most of the MK cadres had returned from training camps abroad only last year, he added. Comment could not be obtained from ANC headquarters on Tuesday night.
