Untimely Reflections Evoked by L. Kravchuk's Visit to Lvov"] [Text] To exploit the theme of painting the grass green and other "Potemkinian" actions in preparation for the arrival of important guests is banal to say the least. And to clean house--your own personal one or our larger one--if someone has been invited there is nice, and the citizens of Lvov could only stand to gain from building up a pleasant square and cleaning up the area near the Grushevskiy Monument. It is simply that I recalled a line which seemed symbolic. They patched up the asphalt on the streets through which the important guest was to pass. They put hot patches on the pavement which was wet after the rain. Specialists say that this method of mending is pointless, because it will not last. The same sense of necessity-hopelessness arose after the festive "commitment" of the Halychyna to presidential candidate Kravchuk. Gathered in the Polytechnical Institute, as they say in such cases, were the community of the oblast. The main thing heard there was an unequivocal promise from the lips of the president's representative, Stepan Davymuka: The authorities, the political organizations, and the majority of the population of the Lvov area support presidential candidate Leonid Makarovych. No objections followed. Moreover, one of the most influential, as far as influence on the rank-and-file voter goes, forces, the Greco-Catholic church, through the lips of Bishop of Zborovskiy Mikhail, declared support for Kravchuk. True, a veiled condition was imposed--that he complete the process of rehabilitation of the Ukrainian Greco-Catholic Church, which had been crucified and banned by Stalin. The year on the calendar is not 1989, and it will not be difficult to meet that condition. Kravchuk was never one of the favorites in the Lvov area. Moreover, Lvov politicians seem to have gathered points for the opposition. And a week or two ago the breakdown looked different: They were clearly inclined to support I. Plyushch. When the crowd flowed out of the Polytechnical Institute onto the street, I forced my way through to the chief of the Lvov Rukh organization, Yuriy Klyuchkovskiy, to ask him a question: In his view, did the president's representative have the right to speak so unequivocally "on behalf of and on instructions from" ? "Let me put it this way, he did not say anything so terrible," Klyuchkovskiy answered. "Yes, Lvov Rukh members support Kravchuk. This is in line with the opinion of the Rukh high council: to make the decision independently in the local areas concerning support of the candidate for the post of president. To adopt a decision which will help block the advancement of Kuchma and Moroz to the high position." The chief of the secretariat of New Wave [preceding two words in Ukrainian in original], Yuriy Shveda, put it this way: "We also support Kravchuk. In opposition to Kuchma's pro-Russian position and Moroz's pro-communist position, which are dangerous for Ukraine. Incidentally, we are not withdrawing our complaints against the current and potential president--failure to conduct economic reforms and his personnel policy. But Plyushch? Well, anything can happen, but in our view, Ivan Stepanovych lost the first round in parliament. We see a real standoff between Kuchma and Kravchuk." I wanted very much to learn the opinion about what was taking place of Halychina's favorite, the clear winner in the last presidential elections in the West, the eternal opponent and severe critic of Kravchuk, V. Chornovol [as published]. I met him on an empty street in the center--everyone had gone to the Grushevskiy Monument, where the president was just about to appear. Vyacheslav Maksimovych, judging from everything, was headed there too. I am probably exaggerating and transferring my creative-opposition sadness to others. But....on this street, swept clean for the holiday for "welcoming the sovereign," I did not approach this exhausted person. Our conversation took place later, in the evening, in the packed theater imeni Mariya Zankovetskaya. But for now....you know, it is possible to get into a "shotgun wedding" in all kinds of ways. But the Lvov authorities were actually gleefully kicking up their heels. Respect for the legitimate president is one thing, but the phrase spoken even after the business conversations, the phrase of that same S. Davymuka, in my opinion, caused even the main hero to cringe. And so with a coquettish grin and almost a tear of emotion: "We give you, Leonid Makarovych, the strictest possible instruction: Win, please!" The people love holidays. And "sovereigns." It is easy to forgive them everything--for the holiday. The people gathered there to see the president's earlobe, his shoe. The sun was shining. It bathed the monument to the tragic president, who was destroyed by the UNR [Ukrainian People's Republic]--Mikhail Grushevskiy. The chorus sang "Chervona Kalina." The president listened. On these cobblestones these same Lvov residents who are actually and naturally devoted to the idea of state independence five years ago were beaten with the militia's clubs for singing "Chervona Kalina." At that time Kravchuk was battling it out with Rukh for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. Enough sentiments. Leonid Kravchuk can count on the support and love of the people of Halychyna if only because he has unequivocally declared and repeated in Lvov: There is no turning back. Ukraine can only be independent, only an integrated state. Politicians, including those in the opposition, also like the predictability of the actions of this president: A known "disease" is always better than an unknown one. Here are the words of Vyacheslav Chornovol [as published]: "The situation has developed in such a way that it is necessary to support Kravchuk. But not without reservation, it is necessary to make several ultimatums. I am afraid of having Kuchma as president. He wants to make us subordinate to the military-industrial complex not only of Ukraine, but also of the former Union. Yes, I am also afraid of having Kravchuk as president, but less so. We already know which "buttons" to push in order to influence this president in one way or another. But as Chornovil [as published] the voter, I give my vote to Volodymyr Lanovyy." There is no point in listing past sins. What do they have to do with present sins? Kuchma, of course, would put Ukraine in the hammerlock of the "older brother." The socialist Moroz would put us back where we were before. In addition to everything else, neither one is likely to lead the movement along the path of radical economic reforms. And Leonid Kravchuk? Let us hope that he will maintain relative political stability, that through his flexibility and a certain amount of international prestige, he will be able to preserve the civil peace in Ukraine and peace on its borders. Perhaps he will be able to be a candidate who is equally acceptable to the East and West. And what about the reforms? What about the team of those who could conduct the reforms? What about the need to settle (judging from everything, with jobs) with the left and the nomenklatura? After all, an effective opposition is being formed, it will roll up its sleeves and start looking for the "buttons".... There was another interesting pre-holiday incident. Two days before the monument was uncovered, at about 12 midnight, I saw the sculpture bare, without its traditional cover, and an alarmed group of militia officers on the square at night. Toward morning the monument was covered as it should be. I do not know how reliable this is, but an authorized person told me in a personal conversation: That night the cover was simply ripped off. Aleksandr Blok. The poem "The Twelve." The year 1917. Remember the text? The old woman is standing in front of an immense banner and grieving: Many mothers were tormented, saying, "So many foot bindings could be made for the boys....But everyone was unshod and unclothed."
