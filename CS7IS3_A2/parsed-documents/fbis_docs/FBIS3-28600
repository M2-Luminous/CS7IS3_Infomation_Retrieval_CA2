In response to Prime Minister Hosokawa's strong intention to set 1994 as a starting year for the administrative reform, the guideline stresses, among other things, the need for the government to steadily promote deregulation. The guideline is composed of eight points, including the promotion of decentralization, the promotion of public disclosure of administrative information, and the streamlining of administrative procedures. As for deregulation, the guideline calls for the need to review 1,450 licenses and approvals (800 subject to removal and 650 subject to relaxation) and explicitly indicates the need to amend 60 laws to that end. The guideline calls on the government to submit about 50 amendments to the Diet during its current session and quickly draw up concrete plans for deregulation. The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters (headed by Prime Minister Hosokawa) will formally decide on the guideline as part of a new package of stimulus measures on which the government plans to decide on 3 February. The government intends to make a thorough review of deregulation in line with a final report compiled by the Economic Reform Research Council (the Hiraiwa Committee). The government is examining ways to draw up a "five-year plan for the promotion of deregulation" in 1994 and to incorporate a clause in the law that if a regulation is put into effect, it shall be reviewed after a certain period. On decentralization, the guideline calls on the government to review the current share of administrative functions between the central and local governments, promote the transfer of administrative authority from the central government to local governments, and promote the ban or relaxation of the central government's intervention in local government affairs. The guideline also calls on the government to set a "guideline for changing the current administrative relationship between the central and local governments" on the premise that the government tries to have the Diet legislate a basic law on the promotion of decentralization. As for the public disclosure of administrative information, the guideline calls on the Administrative Reform Committee to make a full-fledged study of systems involving the public disclosure of administrative information, while calling on the government to look for a way to smoothly enforce laws concerning administrative procedures.
