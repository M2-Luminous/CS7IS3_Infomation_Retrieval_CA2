From Sobchak"] [Text] Yesterday the city court considered a claim of the former city soviet chairman Aleksandr Belyayev, who is challenging the legality of a number of articles in the statute on elections, which bars him, as a Federation Council member, from being elected to the city assembly. The case never got to the point of argument: At the very beginning of the hearings Aleksandr Komarov, deputy chief of the mayoralty's legal department, handed the court Anatoliy Sobchak's new decree, which eliminates Federation Council deputies from the "blacklist." The litigation between Belyayev and Sobchak did not end there, however. On 23 February the court will consider a new claim from Aleksandr Nikolayevich which challenges the statute's legality regarding introducing the residency and age minimum for candidates, as well as banning MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] personnel, fixed-term military servicemen, the mayor, the vice mayor, and deputy mayors from running for deputy seats. Commenting on the situation, he remarked that the mayor is not necessarily Sobchak but merely an official. Aleksandr Belyayev is against electing bureaucrats to the city assembly, but he believes that such a ban must be reinforced by federal law or at least a presidential edict. Meanwhile, on 22 January Boris Yeltsin repealed the point in the "Law on Kray and Oblast Soviet..." that barred heads of the executive branch from becoming deputies. As to the ban on MVD personnel and military servicemen on running for deputy seats, in the opinion of Belyayev and his representative, this simply violates the current law.
