This article delves into and exposes the two main dictatorial systems of the Chinese Communist Party: It looks at the mutual contradictions, use of power, and evolution of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in the period of opening up. It points out that the state security apparatus already constitutes the power behind Li Peng's clique, and is responsible for controlling and countering political dissidents. [passage omitted] The Border Control Department is called the Sixth Department within the CCP Ministry of Public Security, with its two trademarks being the External Border Crossing Usage Management Department and the Foreigner Management Department. In the more than 40 years since the CCP came to power, it has often had the formulations of "public security elders." This points to its real position in the political and legal system as a public security organ, procurate, law court, and judicial department. From a legal point of view, the MPS should only be subordinate to one arm of the State Council, and despite the fact that its name comes after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it still receives the supervision of the highest law court, and the highest procurate. In reality, the law courts and procurate in fact do not control the MPS. For example, Zeng Qinkou [2582 6024 0656], of the highest procurate's Court of Law and Discipline, told this reporter that within the public security system there is widespread extortion of confessions through torture and cruelty, and some cases are passed through other channels to the procurate, but the Court of Law and Discipline, though it sends people to the public security organs for investigations, they are without exception turned away, and at every turn are told threateningly: Aren't you going to allow us to work? After the National People's Congress passed an administrative procedural law, a large amount of cases of "people versus government officials" came before law courts, and the CPC immediately allowed the highest people's law court to issue a top secret document, which went so far as to require that various local law courts, in cases of hearing complaints from the masses against the public security police, and cases where public security police refused to accept punishment, as far as possible should maintain the original sentence of the public security officials, and preserve their "law enforcement" image. To not bring a lawsuit, is to have already lost a lawsuit, and this explains why the "public security elders" do not have a weakness that lends wings to rumors. It has been like this for many years. However, this situation began to change in the early 1980s. The Ministry of Public Security altogether has more than 20 departments, but there are only five or six that are directly on the front line of enforcing the law. Before the establishment of the MPS, the so-called "anti-revolutionary cases," including espionage and special cases, were the responsibility of the First Department, and this was a very mysterious organization. After the establishment of the MPS, a very large number of core cadres transferred from the First Department, and the CCP's Department of Investigation in Beijing's Western Gardens area attracted some of the People's Liberation Army's Second Department of the General Staff Headquarter's to form this type of special organ for uncovering spies, providing special services and handling cases of "subversion of the state." In this way, the MPS First Department became a political public security body, the Second Department became an economic and cultural public security body, the Third Department became a public security department, and the Fourth Department became a frontier defense unit, the Fifth Department became a punishment and investigation department, while the Sixth Department became a border administration body. Among these, the bodies with the most work load besides the Third, Fifth and Thirteenth (Preliminary Investigation) Departments, are some sensitive and the most mysterious departments separated from the MPS, but at the same time public security has lost a considerable portion of its special privileges. While in later name listings the Ministry of State Security (MSS) was listed after the MPS, in reality in terms of its funds, power and scope of activity, both were in position to override public security. The MSS was established in 1983, at a time when Hu Yaobang was headed the government. Hu, in order to make political and legal work gradually adapt to the circumstances of reform and opening, chose former Shanghai Deputy Mayor Ruan Chongwu [7086 1504 2976] to serve as Minister of Public Security, and Jia Chunwang [6328 2504 2489] from the Central Committee system to serve as Minister of Security. Ruan had once studied abroad in the then Soviet Union, and served in the CCP's Embassy in West Germany as a science and technology counselor. This experience enabled him to tackle solution of the reform of public security work, increase the level of transparency, and within a certain period to hold news conferences. In early 1987, Hu Yaobang had left the scene, and soon after Ruan was transferred from the MPS to serve as the Deputy Director of the State Science and Technology Committee. It was clear that he had not reduced the level of secrecy. But during the period Ruan served, the work style at the MPS had become more enlightened, and outstanding achievements were noted, and there was a marked improvement in the appearance and attitude of individuals, which had a lasting and profound effect on people. In particular, for a certain period he met with foreign journalists, and answered questions with wit and consideration, in an internationally accepted show of good form. Since this time, many officials of the MPS, in particular young ones, still cherish the thought of Ruan Chongwu. However, comparatively speaking, when it comes to the MPS, the CCP views the Ministry of State Security as its own confidential security organ. For this reason, after Ruan Chongwu was transferred as the result of Hu Yaobang's departure from power, Jia Chunwang has been retained to run the Ministry of State Security. Still, because the MSS is favored and has formed a arrogant attitude, in terms of the allocation of power, especially in the case of overlapping of MSS responsibilities with certain tasks of the MPS First Department, the contradictions between the two ministries are steadily growing. Here are just two examples to illustrate this situation: 1. The MPS at present is located on the north side of Beijing's Changan Avenue, and on the gate of the MPS there hangs not only an MPS sign, but at the same time, there is also an MSS sign. In fact, the MPS offices are primarily located at the Western Gardens supreme headquarters of the former Central Investigative Department. However, since relations between the two ministries have become strained, they do not mutually settle accounts. For example, normally government personnel and professional contacts outside the MPS, provided they go through the simple formalities of registering, are able to directly enter the MPS main compound, and even some journalists also hold credentials and can come and go as they please. But for MSS personnel, even if they display credentials, those at the gate often make up various reasons for them to be refused entrance. 2. Contradictions between the public security organs and state security organs are even more acute at the grass-roots level. Shenzhen City's Shatoujiao zone contains the investigative strongholds of a number of intelligence organs, including the Second Department General Staff, the MPS, and the MSS. However, the contradictions between the MPS and MSS are the most deep-rooted. One Shenzhen City MPS friend told the author about how they handle MSS organ personnel. Between Hong Kong and Shenzhen there is a forbidden zone, and by and large personnel from the MPS, and Peoples' Armed Police (PAP) are responsible for inspecting and controlling this zone. Normally, MPS personnel, and PAP cadre, General Staff Intelligence personnel are able once in a while to enter the forbidden zone to carry out tasks, but when it is discovered that there are MSS organ personnel entering the forbidden zone, often indiscriminately MPS personnel will first "arrest and bring them to justice," interrogate them and them suddenly release them. Allegedly, this is done on instructions from senior officials. From this it is evident that bad blood has been accumulating between the MSS and MPS. [passage omitted]
