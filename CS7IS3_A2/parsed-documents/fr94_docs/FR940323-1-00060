FR940323-1-00060 FR940323-1-00007 EPA believes that the changes outlined in this notice will simplify and streamline the process of assessing tribal eligibility while still ensuring full compliance with all applicable statutes. The Agency expects that the new process will reduce the burdens and barriers to tribes of participating in environmental management. V. Executive Order 12866 OMB has reviewed this action under the terms of Executive Order 12866. VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it merely revises existing procedural requirements for Indian tribes by making them simpler and less burdensome; Indian tribes are not considered small entities under this rulemaking for RFA purposes. VII. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed regulations contain no new or additional information collection activities and, therefore, no information collection request will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .
