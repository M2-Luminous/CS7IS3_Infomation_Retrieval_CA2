FR940603-0-00029 FR940603-0-00014 33 CFR Part 117 [CGD05&hyph;94&hyph;031] RIN 2115&hyph;AE47 Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Core Creek, NC AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment removes the regulations for the S.R. 101 bridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 195.8, Core Creek, North Carolina, because the swing bridge has been removed. A notice of proposed rulemaking has not been issued for this regulation because removal of the bridge eliminates the need for regulation. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations become effective on July 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ann B. Deaton, Bridge Administrator, Fifth Coast Guard District, at (804) 398&hyph;6222. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Linda L. Gilliam, Project Officer, and LT Monica L. Lombardi, Project Attorney. Background and Purpose The swing bridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 195.8, at Core Creek, North Carolina, was replaced by a high level fixed bridge along the same alignment. The existing bridge has been removed, thereby eliminating the need for 33 CFR 117.821(b)(3). This action has no economic consequences. It merely removes regulations for a swing bridge that no longer exists. This action necessitates redesignating the regulations listed in 33 CFR 117.821(b) (4), (5) and (6) for the drawbridges at Surf City, Wrightsville Beach, and Sunset Beach along the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway within North Carolina. Regulatory History This action is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this ruling to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because the Coast Guard is removing regulations that are no longer necessary. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this rule does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this final rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
