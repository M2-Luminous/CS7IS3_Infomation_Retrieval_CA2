An official letter by the president insisting that Ukraine should join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] was distributed among Ukrainian lawmakers on Tuesday. Last November the Ukrainian parliament ratified the START-1 imposing several tough conditions and stating that Ukraine should not join the NPT. Ukraine's membership of the NPT was one of the key issues of the tripartite meeting of the Russian, American and Ukrainian presidents in Moscow. The Ukrainian parliament is to consider the Moscow statement of the three presidents later this week.
