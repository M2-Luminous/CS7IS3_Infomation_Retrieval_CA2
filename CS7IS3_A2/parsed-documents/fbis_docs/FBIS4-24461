However, we should be aware that the task of developing agriculture remains quite arduous. In order to attain the goal of stabilizing grain output, increasing cotton output, and enriching the nonstaple food basket, it is necessary at present to stress once more the importance and urgency of depending on science and technology. Last year, thanks to a series of measures adopted by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the efforts of various quarters, a relatively good harvest was reaped in agriculture. While affirming achievements, we must be prepared against undesirable events and must soberly pay attention to severe challenges to agriculture in the future. The net annual increase in China's population is nearly 15 million. This means an annual increase of 6 million tonnes of grain can only maintain the existing level of grain per capita, and the increase in output since 1984 has all been consumed by the increase in the population. Farmland and other natural resources are decreasing day by day because of the development of infrastructure in towns and cities, such as transportation and the power industry. China's per capita area of farmland ranks third from the bottom among 26 countries with populations exceeding 50 million each. For quite a long time to come, these increasing and decreasing trends will remain irreversible. Also, in the course of becoming relatively well-off, people will set higher demands on the quantity and quality of food and industrial raw materials and, after reentry into GATT, there will be keen competition between the domestic and foreign markets. These are two facts which we have to face in the near future. The "irreversible" and "have to face" mentioned above will exert a tremendous pressure on agriculture, the primary industry, and we should not be blindly optimistic about the future. Moreover, in recent years, because of the enlarging price scissors of manufactured goods and agricultural produce, and the decreasing comparable benefits of agricultural production, those of growing grain and cotton in particular, the peasants' enthusiasm has not been great. To a very great extent, this also has an adverse impact on the further development of agriculture. Therefore, to attain the goal of agricultural development in China in the 1990's, and to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chixu kuaisu jiankang fazhan] of the rural economy, we must, on the one hand, seriously and properly grasp the implementation of various rural policies of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and, on the other hand, attach importance to the application of science and technology to agriculture, and develop the rural productive forces by means of the progress of science and technology in agriculture in a bid to ensure the effective supply of agricultural produce. History since the founding of the people's republic shows that every step forward taken by agriculture and every upgrading of agriculture in China were inseparable from progress in science and technology. Let us recall what happed in the early and middle 1980's. The state increased input into agriculture, the peasants' enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high because of rural reforms, the peasants strived to apply the knowledge, technology, and research achievements accumulated for many years by science and technology personnel, and the best combination of various factors led to achievements in agriculture which attracted worldwide attention. In a short span of several years, the phenomenon of a serious shortage of agricultural produce resulting from the 10 years of turmoil was eradicated and various rationing coupons were abolished. Farmland accounting for only 7 percent of the world's total was able to support a population accounting for 22 percent of the world's total. The steady progress of urban reforms was also ensured. Such great achievements could not be separated from the application of science and technology to agriculture. "Depending first on policies and second on science and technology" was the simplest and most profound conclusion at that time. Historical experience is worthy of our serious attention. To attain the goal of a sustained and steady growth of agriculture and the rural economy, we still must stress the necessity of depending on progress in science and technology and on strengthening science and education to revitalize agriculture. According to our national conditions, only by stressing focal points and making the targets clear for the input of science and technology, which is quite limited, can we achieve maximum economic, social, and ecological benefits. Let us take planting as an example. If an overall upgrading of species increases output by 10 percent, it will mean an increase in the output of grain of 45 million tonnes and of cotton of 400,000 tonnes; if the utilization ratio of chemical fertilizer is raised by 10 percent, it will be equivalent to increasing the output of chemical fertilizer by 12 million tonnes; as bollworm was effectively prevented and controlled in the last few years, the peasants were able to increase their income by 6 billion yuan and the textile industry to increase its economic results by several times; and if 10 to 20 percent of straw is used to feed domestic animals and the manure of these animals is used to make the fields fertile, a large quantity of animal feed will be saved for breeding cows and sheep, the leather industry will be developed, and organic matter will be added to the soil. All the measures mentioned above will also be conducive to the protection of the ecological environment. The input of science and technology has the highest output rate. Therefore, while speeding up work to spread applicable scientific research results and advanced technology, the Ministry of Agriculture has decided to lay emphasis on spreading four items of agricultural technology -- properly grasping the system for selection, cultivation, and reproduction (including systems of improved varieties of seedlings, stock, poultry, and offspring) whose function is to provide good species; raising the utilization ratio of chemical fertilizer, mainly by applying the fertilizer at a deep level; comprehensive prevention and cure for animals and plants with the prevention and cure of "one worm and two diseases" as the focus; and regenerating abandoned agricultural resources by using straw to feed domestic animals and using the animals' manure to fertilize the fields. Also, the ministry has energetically worked to lay a foundation for science and technology, strengthened research in basic science with emphasis on key points, and strived to make major breakthroughs in scientific research in order to maintain the staying power of agricultural development. To depend on progress in science and technology, we must attach importance to the use and training of qualified personnel. An important achievement in scientific research often requires the arduous exploration of science and technology personnel for 10 or even 20 years and the spreading of such an achievement over a large area again requires the hard work of tens of thousands of grassroots science and technology personnel. Leadership at all levels must adopt all necessary measures, attach importance to the building of the contingent for spreading science and technology at the grass-roots level and give full play to the role of the contingent, be good at absorbing science and technology personnel of institutions of higher learning to apply their advanced technology and research results to various projects for increasing investment benefits, make great efforts to support scientific research so that science and technology personnel will constantly score new achievements in their research, ensure the sustained growth of agriculture, show concern for the living and working conditions of science and technology workers, and dare to award those who have made outstanding contributions. In this respect, township and town enterprises and some enterprises using high and new technology, which have survived and developed amid acute market competition, have taken a step forward and have proved with their economic results and development that this strategic view is correct. We should attach importance to, and sum up, their experience. At present, the people of the whole country are studying the Third Volume of The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. We must seriously study a series of important instructions on agriculture, science, and technology given by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and really understand the scientific conclusion that "science and technology is the primary productive force" and the guiding idea that in the final analysis, agriculture depends on science and technology to solve its problems. In this way, we shall be able to emancipate our minds, upgrade our concepts, adopt effective measures to strengthen science and technology work, really put the development of agriculture and the rural economy into the orbit of depending on progress in science and technology and improving the quality of laborers, ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of agriculture and the entire national economy, and make due contributions to making the people of the whole country relatively well-off.
