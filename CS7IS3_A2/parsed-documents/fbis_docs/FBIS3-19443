The newspaper cites diplomats "in the know" as saying that Pangalos will probably move to another ministry. Meanwhile, other sources maintain that the alternate minister will definitely not seek an appointment as European Union commissioner, as was rumored late last year. According to the newspaper, this means that the list of possible successors to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou would grow by yet another strong candidate.
