The full text of the eminent leader's decree is as follows: In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Now that through divine blessing the people of Iran are celebrating the 15th anniversary of the glorious revolution with pride and a sense of victory; now that the people and the government -- united and steadfast -- have surpassed a long, adventurous march full of victories as well as difficulties; now that the serving government, through a great struggle and by taking the initiative, has removed the major obstacles in the face of economic progress and national growth and development -- thereby paving the way toward construction and general welfare with a speed suited to the conditions of the revolution, the general conditions of the country require the publicity mechanism of the Voice and Vision to take on new policies in line with the nation's progress in all fields in order to balance the cultural climate of the nation and the accelerating trend of construction and general growth and development with the bases of the revolution and the fundamental principles of Islam. Furthermore, in order to confront the propaganda and cultural onslaught of arrogance and its lackeys, the new policies should widen the scope of the media's struggle in the trench of explaining, deepening, and honoring the glorious principles of the Islamic revolution, as well as in the trench of explaining the self-sacrificing efforts of the country's officials, the three branches of the state, judiciary, executive, legislative, especially the hard working and relentless judicial branch, with new, progressive, and rational methods and through a great and vigilant jihad. Taking into account the aforementioned, and expressing my thanks and gratitude for the relentless and continuous efforts of the esteemed Mohammad Hashemi, who during his term as the official in charge of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran -- particularly during the imposed Iran-Iraq war -- carried out great and all-encompassing efforts in administrating this sensitive and important institution, I appoint the esteemed Dr. 'Ali Larijani, who is one of the outstanding scientific and cultural figures of the country and who has a proud, revolutionary background, as well as a background of cabinet responsibilities -- and an individual known for his devotion, piety, and cultural and artistic experiences -- as the head of the Voice and Vision, as well as a member of the Supreme Council for Cultural Revolution for a term of five years. It is expected that he will receive the cooperation of intelligent colleagues and revolutionary innovators from within the organization and attract prominent personalities from outside to produce a new plan and a productive agenda to utilize the organization's vast resources, turn it into a base for the development of ideas, culture, and art, and a center for the guidance of Iran's Muslim people and others who are eager to hear the voice of revolutionary Iran. A place for the presentation of the nation's achievements in different fields of life, science, politics, art, education, and other fields. Here I deem it necessary to thank the esteemed Supervisory Council of the IRIB, comprising representatives from the three powers of judicial, legislative, and executive for their valuable efforts, and while wishing its scholarly and worthy members to cooperate with the management of the Voice and Vision, announce the termination of the Council. The salient points, which should be observed in the great new plan are as follows: The operation of the Voice and Vision organization should be aimed at achieving better quality in all its programs. The quantitative expansion should be put in second place. Nevertheless, the necessary nationwide transmission to all corners and rural areas of the country should be given priority. The structure of the organization should be reviewed and the necessary changes should be made to its style and productivity. Cooperation with university scholars and scholastic circles should be used to raise scientific and social issues and present new ideas to the public. In Islamic discussions, attention should be paid to the quality, depth, and excellence of the issues. Weak and ambiguous issues and personal tastes should be avoided. In order to achieve this, wise and calculated cooperation should be made with religious seminaries and scholars, particularly the esteemed and prominent scholars of the Qom Seminary. In general, Voice and Vision should become an open school for the presentation of the realities of pure Muhammadan Islam, peace be upon him and his scion, and the instructions of the Ahl al-Beit [family of the prophet], peace be upon them, in a noble and proper way. In the production of artistic programs, cooperation should be made with the country's cultural foundations, such as the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, the Islamic publicity organization, and artistic circles, in order to make the most use of them. The dissemination of information, which is one of the most important tasks of the Voice and Vision, should find a better system, better speed, better editorial judgement, as well as intelligible and correct language, more than before. The Voice and Vision must use correct Persian, and its language should set standards. Mispronunciation and misreading must be eliminated immediately. The Voice and Vision must be the teacher of the sweet, clear, and powerful Persian language. A number of steps have been taken in his context, but they should be complemented. Artistic programs on the Voice and Vision should become sweet and attractive, with the most sumptuous theatrical arts containing social, political, and ethical messages in this all-encompassing medium. Light, empty, and misleading programs lacking in artistic quality, which are sometimes very expensive to produce, must be banned forthwith. The broadcast of banal and sensual music, especially those types of music that in this branch of the arts lack national identity and Iranian principles, must be avoided. Music can be both permitted [halal] and banned [haram]. Its permitted type should be recognized and used correctly following the clear instructions of the late Imam [Khomeyni], sanctified be his dust. Genuine Iranian arts, which suit the spiritual make up and instincts of our people, should be used more in this context. In all the programs, the general trend should be toward confronting the propaganda, cultural and news onslaught of arrogance. This important principle must be adhered to not only in news and reports, but also in scientific, social, and political programs -- especially in artistic and entertaining programs such as plays, one-off dramas, and serials. This point should be correctly clarified to all the employees of radio and television. The alien, attacking culture affects the mind and actions of the people more through plays and entertaining programs than through face-to-face talks. This unwanted effect must be vigilantly and rationally stopped. On the whole, the Voice and Vision, as the great late Imam, may he be admitted to God's paradise, had highlighted, should be a university for all in which religion, ethics, Islamic values, and the ways and methods of life, as well as new developments in the world of science and politics -- and new and pioneering thoughts -- are taught in a clear language comprehensible to all sectors of society, so that every one, from those with simple minds to great thinkers and outstanding individuals, can manage to benefit from the radio and television programs to the best of their ability, and so that everyone can become fulfilled by the programs' great bounty. Programs must be understandable and useful for all people, but must not, in any way, be banal and frivolous. A Voice and Vision suitable for Islamic Iran should gradually take shape in which intelligence, ability, and a general leaning toward culture, politics, and science exists side by side with subtlety, taste, and talent, and be accompanied by a spirit of reconstruction and recreation of a great and proud Iran, natural to this ancient, yet young nation. Apart from all that, the share of listeners beyond the borders -- millions of people who in various states and from various nations have set their sights to Iran and the voice of the Islamic revolution -- should be prominently considered. External programs should be completely free from banality, repetitiveness, and frivolity and truly depict the Islamic Iran. The carrying out of this heavy duty -- some of whose preliminaries have been prepared by the former hardworking management and officials, and some other sections of which must be prepared by the current wise and intellectual manager -- no doubt requires the cooperation of all the connected establishments, especially the cabinet and the Islamic Consultative Majles. I call upon the respected deputies of the Islamic Consultative Majles and respected cabinet members, especially the president who is a man of knowledge and is an expert in Islamic lore, to offer any assistance regarding the budget and other resources for the move that the Voice and Vision needs today. I expect the scholars, experts, artists, and other strata, which are capable of somehow getting this crucial organization to its deserved place, to cooperate with its management. Undoubtedly such progress cannot be achieved overnight. The important thing is that such a direction is pursued. I beseech God Almighty success and guidance for the respected head of the organization and the others involved, and hope that all come under the auspices of the pure prayers of God's supreme deputy [Vali al-Allah al-'Azam], may our souls be sacrificed for him, and the assistance of that great one. Peace be upon all the believing brothers. [Signed] Sayyed Ali Khamene'i [Dated] 12 February 1994
