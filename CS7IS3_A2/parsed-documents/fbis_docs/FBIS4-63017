Because of Debts"] [Text] Yamalo-Nenetsk and Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrugs -- Sabotage against oilmen. That is how V. Gorodilov, general director of the "Noyabrskneftegaz" Joint-Stock Company, views the situation that has developed with regard to black gold in Russia. How else you can explain the fact that Russia is turning down a highly valuable raw material that is the country's main source of revenue? All the main pipelines are full of oil, but the refineries do not want it. The Omsk Oil Refinery, for instance, which usually used to take 60,000-70,000 tonnes of crude a day from the men of Noyabrskiy, has now "frozen" the amount at 30,000 tonnes. And it is quite possible that the emerging downward trend in Omsk's demand will continue. As a last resort the "Purneftegaz" and Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug fields are now pumping oil only four hours a day. What does this oil policy mean for Russian citizens? The decline in refineries' receipts of crude oil will create a shortage of fuel and lubricants and increase their prices. What is the consumer to do -- in particular the agrarian sector, faced with the imminent sowing campaign? Analyzing the prevailing situation, some mass media at the prompting of high-ranking officials are trying inter alia to heap all the blame for the soaring prices on the oilmen. But they are forced to say in their defense that, whereas the increase in food prices is keeping pace with inflation at 10-12 percent, the price of production resources is up 40 percent. And that made them raise the price of the raw materials. Why am I using the past tense? Because the direct producers of oil have not been dictating anything to anyone since the beginning of the year. Inter alia in January the Noyabrskiy were getting 80,000 rubles [R] per tonne and in February just over R60,000. Incidentally, Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Yu. Shafranik recently asked V. Gordilov: How is the decree on cooperation with foreign firms in repairing wells being implemented? The answer from the well-known Russian specialist and head of a major oil production unit was unequivocal: For Russia, this cooperation does not pay. When we use oil to settle up with foreign countries we receive equipment at a price inflated, according to some estimates, by as much as 100 percent. At the same time Russia's oilmen are becoming technologically dependent on foreign firms. And that is not all. In doing that we are destroying with our own hands a national industry geared to the production of equipment for the oil and gas industry.
