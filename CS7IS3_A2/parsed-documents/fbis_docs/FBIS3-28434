This is based on the serious lesson that it is impossible to achieve independence, democracy, or reunification with the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique, which is committing treacheries to the country and the nation more viciously than any preceding regime by deceiving and disgracing the masses and drumming up civilian and reform policies, as it is. The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is a more antidemocratic fascist dictatorial one than any of the successive military dictatorial regimes. Although he is advertising civilian and reform policies, traitor Kim Yong-sam has only brought a greater disaster to the people by conducting the civilian fascist repressive politics, which is more vicious than the military fascist dictatorship of the Fifth and Sixth Republics. The Kim Yong-sam group's fascist nature is not inferior to and rather goes beyond that of any preceding military fascist dictator. It is the most malicious and vicious. The so-called civilian government of South Korea cannot coexist with the civilian politics. It follows the legal grounds of the preceding military fascist rule as they are. It is traitor Kim Yong-sam that promised to amend the notorious National Security Law during the election campaign and said on the following day of his inauguration that it was too early to amend it. Not a single phrase of the notorious National Security Law has been changed, and the unchanged law plays the role of the civilian government's fascist stick being used in repressing the people. The Kim Il-song group has not only maintained the bodies organized under the previous military fascist dictatorship to repress the people but also strengthened their functions and increased their capacities drastically. Yielding under the people's protest, the fascist clique was talking about the reduction of the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], the place of origin of fascist oppression and infringement of human rights in South Korea. In fact, however, only some NSP figures' positions have been changed, and rather strengthened the agency's function by establishing a new bureau in charge of planning strategies on the North. The demonstration-quelling task force unit of the puppet police, which is being denounced as a fascist stick, a culprit of the ruling forces, was reinforced with as many as about 17,000 new men. Special detective teams have been established in the puppet police administration of each city and province. The length of sticks carried by policemen is longer than that of ones carried by policemen in the previous dictatorial regime. Moreover, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique announced its plan to sharply increase the budget for puppet police stations and police boxes across the country annually to suppress the people. The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime has maintained and reinforced the fascist laws and repressive tools made by the preceding military dictatorial regimes, pursuing a vicious fascist dictatorial rule against the people. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is exasperatingly brandishing a sword of civilian fascist dictatorship against the struggle and march of the South Korean people and students who call for independence, democracy, reunification, and the rights to live, debasing it as an illegal violent riot and a collective egoism. The civilian fascist dictatorial maniac ruthlessly cracked down with a 100,000-strong police force on the struggle of the citizens and students urging the investigation into the Kwangju massacre, punishment of the murderers which was waged on the 13 anniversary of incident of the Kwangju popular uprising, thus leaving the injured three times more than the Sixth Republic did. Branding the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon]--a successor of the National Council of Student Representatives [Chondaehyop] that set sail to realize independence, democracy, and reunification--as an illegal group benefiting the enemy, the Kim yong-sam fascist clique announced a emergency state to ruin its inauguration ceremony and brutally suppressed it by mobilizing some 190-company riot police troops. Every university in South Korea, including Yonsei and Korea, is being constantly searched by the civilian fascist authorities. The theaters of the students' struggle have been stained with blood and many patriotic students were arrested and put behind the bars. The Kim Yong-sam puppet traitor has frozen workers' wage by shifting blame onto them for the economic crisis in South Korea which is already in tatters. Furthermore, it has gone so far as to brutally obstruct workers' strikes calling for the rights to exist, including the basic wage hike, by invoking the emergency arbitration power which the preceding dictators did not even dare to provoke. The civilian fascist dictators not only intensify its suppression on patriotic movement organizations but also set up government-controlled movement organizations and infiltrated members of the Agency for National Security Planning into progressive movement organizations. In this way, it is persistently resorting to cunning maneuvers to reform [kaeryanghwa] the South Korean mass movements and plunge them into pure civic movements. Its antipopular and antidemocratic fascist repressive rule is the most crafty, vicious and brutal despotism of a civilian fascist outstripping the preceding military fascist regimes. It is traitor Kim Yong-sam who is the most ruthless, barbarous, fascist, dictatorial maniac who would not hesitate to slay all the South Korean people if it is for gratifying his greed for power. It is a matter of course that the South Korean people and students strongly call for the removal of the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime, branding it as the most atrocious, vicious civilian fascist regime combined with both military and civilian dictatorship. Only when the Kim Yong-sam treacherous regime is removed and a genuine democratic independent regime is established in South Korea, independence, democracy, and reunification which the people aspire to could be realized.
