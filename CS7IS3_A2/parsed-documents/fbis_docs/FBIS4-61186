[Correspondent] "I will ask you several questions. First of all, on the agreements that were recently signed in Moscow, on the agreements between Latvia and Russia that are linked to the withdrawal of the Russian Army, perhaps such a general issue and then more specific ones will follow. "At a news conference immediately after returning from Moscow, you and [President] Mr. Ulmanis stressed that Latvian representatives had signed agreements with a new democratic Russia. However, that Russia is only one small part of Russia, which currently can influence the policy of neighboring countries only to a certain extent. Everything may change and turn upside down there. Not all the Latvian people support the agreements signed by the government and the state president. With this there is a feeling that the weight of these agreements is not very great and there is certain instability in the two states and perhaps one should not fully take them into account as particularly important documents. How do you respond this?" [Birkavs] "The idea that the situation is not stable in Russia is included in the question quite correctly. That is exactly why the agreements give me the guarantee of stable relations with Russia, irrespective of what events follow in Russia. That gives the guarantee that under control of the world public, the Army will be withdrawn, the Skrunda radar station will be dismantled, and it will be possible with the help of foreign money and under international control to repatriate the military pensioners. This is where the meaning and significance of the agreements lies. "I think there is not and has not been an unequivocal attitude toward the agreements in Latvia. I understand very well and support this activity of the people. Sociological studies show that approximately 15 percent of all the people in Latvia are completely and categorically against the agreements. These people also have their own considerations; it is necessary to talk to them, to explain to them. However, history will evidently give the fairest assessment of the significance of these agreements." [Correspondent] "Yes, that is an international aspect and that is also your responsibility, which you already stressed at the news conference on 1 May. That is your responsibility. "So then, can you explain -- I do not know in how much detail you can do it now -- but what will be the control mechanism over the Army withdrawal? How will the repatriation of the military take place? What controls will there be so that we, reporters and representatives of the press, will also be able to follow closely these processes? Who will be responsible for that? I understand that the control mechanism and the range of people involved in it should be rather wide." [Birkavs] "The most significant control mechanisms are provided by the agreements themselves. You stressed very correctly that, in order for reporters to be able to follow the progress of the withdrawal, and to tell the truth, it is necessary to give all the people the opportunity to follow the progress of the withdrawal. First of all, we will publish the withdrawal timetable. We are currently working so that ministries and local governments are instructed to follow the progress of withdrawal at a local level. We will also provide the assistance necessary for the army to be withdrawn from here possibly quicker. "As far as repatriation is concerned, money collection is currently under way for this purpose. At a government session today, we will approve the board of the repatriation fund and a corresponding mechanism. Mechanisms have to be created here. You very correctly understood that the idea of repatriation has not perhaps been completely worked out legally. However, this is the first time that Russia at last has agreed to call its sons and daughters back home. Before, they had only been speaking of people of Russian nationality being in the near abroad and other countries and that they would protect their human rights. The situation has changed and the Russian side will also actively promote repatriation." After this the correspondent suggests that the Russian military personnel will be withdrawn, but their families will be left behind and then the former military will come back to reunite with their families. She asks whether it will be really possible to control this process and whose responsibility it will be. Birkavs says: [Birkavs] "The repatriation will be together with families and when we begin to divide the money -- there is already real money in the repatriation fund -- then we will give priority, and I have stressed it everywhere and such is my agreement with Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, that discharged officers under the age of 50 and under the age of 60 [as heard] have to be repatriated first. Then they will need entry visas to be able to return to Latvia. That is a very simple, internationally recognized, and well regulated control mechanism. Therefore, one should not be afraid of it, but it is very necessary to exercise strict control." The correspondent then asks Prime Minister Birkavs about the possibility of monitoring what goes on inside the Skrunda radar station, which has been impossible even for the Bureau for Monitoring the Withdrawal of the Russian Army. [Birkavs] "Well, 599 military personnel, and 199 service personnel: That is the amount that can be located at Skrunda. That can be monitored simply and easily enough. Besides, considering that the guarding and monitoring is up to us, these we can monitor, and anyway, if any discussions or differences arise, a mechanism has also been created for taking up these discussions and differences." Birkavs adds he is satisfied no new troops could be brought in. [Correspondent] "About the treaty, I think the listeners too will be perhaps asking more detailed questions, but I am still interested in the government's current stability. Last week the Saeima, the Saeima deputies voted, you could say, for confidence in the government, although among the voters were the ministers themselves. Of course, they would not vote against confidence in themselves, so this vote can be viewed variously. And, as far as the nationalist forces have announced, they are forming, quite seriously forming recently, alternative government structures. How does that affect the current work of the government?" [Birkavs] "Firstly I would like to say that the vote of confidence in the government was requested by me personally, because it is very difficult to work in circumstances where there is no confidence in the government. If all the deputies of the Latvian Way and the Peasants' Union had been at the plenary session, then in fact, the result of the vote would have been 60 or 61 votes. Let me remind you that when this government was accepted, we had only 54 supporters. So in fact, the number of supporters of the government in parliament has grown. The ministers voted for themselves, yes. If they had abstained, then only deputies who have claims to ministerial posts would have to abstain, as they become interested in taking on these posts, so ethically they would not vote for them." Birkavs adds that he challenges this shadow cabinet to come out more openly, and he welcomes its formation.
