Officially just over 929,000 Australians are out of work, down by a little over 8,000 for the month. Linda Mottram reports the new figures also show another 22,000 Australians found work in January. [Begin Mottram recording] The January figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics defied a columnist's prediction that there could be a slight rise in the jobless rate. Instead, there was a fall of 0.1 percent from December to 10.6 percent in January. It is the third successive monthly fall in the unemployment rate. Most significantly, the numbers of men seeking full-time jobs fell by almost 12,500 but a longer term measure of the trend in the unemployment rate continues to be flat at 10.8 percent. The figures also show a slight rise in the participation rate, that is the combined number of people with jobs and officially registered as looking for work, indicating renewed confidence among job seekers about their prospects in the work force. The figures also give the new year school leavers their search measure of the state of the job market. [end recording]
