Commenting on this in Nuremberg, Bernhard Jagoda, head of the Federal Employment Agency, said that the labor markets in eastern and western Germany "appear somewhat friendlier than in previous months." The effects of the recession are continuing in the old laender, but they are weaker than they used to be. "Rays of hope are visible," said Jagoda. In western Germany in April, there were 2.59 million unemployed, 49,700 less than in March, and 393,600 less than in March 1993. In April, some 175,300 job vacancies were reported to labor exchanges in western Germany, 2 percent more than in April 1993. "Even if the observers only expect the fall in employment to cease at the end of the year, we already detect positive signs judging from the job vacancies that are being reported," said Jagoda. The demand for jobs in the processing industries has improved in particular. This branch of industry was hit relatively hard and early by the recession. In April, 35,400 jobs in this industry were reported to labor exchanges, 15 percent more than in the previous April. The best prospects are to be seen in the electrical, machine construction, and chemical industries. Temporary employment has sunk remarkably quickly in western Germany. One-month jobs fell by almost 100,000, and one-year jobs by 675,000, reaching 367,800. "Most enterprises have reverted to full-time work," Jagoda observed. This confirms the forecasts of research institutes, which said at the beginning of the year that following an economic improvement, working hours would be extended first of all, but manpower levels would only be increased after the economic upturn had gathered momentum. In the new laender, the number of unemployed in April fell by 44,100, to reach 1,216,000. The number of temporary employees in eastern Germany fell by 10,900, reaching 124,900, half the level of April 1993. Particularly noticeable is the fall in employment in the construction and machine industries. Concerning the development of the labor market for women, Jagoda opposed any discrimination of the feminine sex. Women do not have to be considered a general problem of the labor market, he said. After all, in the old laender, there is hardly any difference between male and female unemployment figures. At the end of April, 9.3 percent of women of working age were unemployed, and 9.4 percent of men. The labor administration says this is because female employment has decreased only slightly in recent times, and female unemployment has increased at a below-average amount. But Jagoda had "few good things to say" about the female labor market in the new laender. There, women continue to be more affected by unemployment than men, and constitute almost two-thirds of all unemployed people. Altogether, judging from 1994 figures so far, Jagoda expects a better future economic development than expected. The labor market need not revise its figures, he said. The labor market had reckoned previously that the number of unemployed persons would increase by between 300,000 and 400,000 during the course of the year.
