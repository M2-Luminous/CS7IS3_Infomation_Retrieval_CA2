This was divulged today by Police Minister Moshe Shahal. Our police affairs correspondent Uri Kohen-Aharonov reports the battalion-strong force will collect all the weapons from the Jewish worshipers. Senior sources in the Police Ministry regard this decision as a sign for the transference of more powers to the police in the territories. The police minister also said he intends to facilitate the erection of a security fence above the Western Wall. The proposal to erect this fence was one of the main recommendations of the Hefetz Committee which investigated the Temple Mount bloodbath three years ago. Minister Shahal supported the implementation of the recommendation, but so far it was delayed. In a meeting this evening in the defense minister's office in Tel Aviv it was decided to examine a series of steps to be taken against inciting elements from among the settlers in Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. The meeting was attended by the prime minister, the police minister, the attorney general, and security elements. Police Minister Shahal told our correspondent Menashe Raz this evening that there is only one law for Jews and Arabs: [Begin recording] [Raz] Mr. Shahal, you just came from a consultation held with the prime minister. Have you decided on a series of steps to be taken against inciting elements from among the Hebron and Qiryat Arba' settlers? [Shahal] I cannot give details. We held a discussion which reviewed all the problems. The legal and operational ramifications were raised. The discussion was held on a professional and general level, without entering the details of the issue. The attorney general, the chief of staff, the commander of the Central Command and other elements participated in the consultation. [Raz] Does the current law in force in the territories allow you to deport elements you do not want to remain in the territories, or to implement other measures against inciting Jewish elements? [Shahal] The authority vested with the commanders of the IDF Commands and other military officers are sufficiently broad to enable them to implement steps when the commander believes there is a danger to the public's security. In order to prevent this danger he is entitled to order an administrative detention or to remove the persons concerned, or to limit their exit from or entrance to certain areas. He can implement these steps on the basis of information he possesses and if he believes this is necessary to maintain security. In these hours of hardship, however, we must not forget that we must preserve civil rights and Israel's democracy. [Raz] Are you referring only to Kakh people, or to other familiar figures in Qiryat Arba' and Hebron who are not Kakh members? [Shahal] We are referring to whoever might pose a danger to security and those who intend to carry out attacks or have done so in the past. [Raz] Mr. Shahal, in yesterday's cabinet session, ministers referred to the necessity of implementing dramatic steps in the wake of the new situation. Will one of this dramatic steps be implemented in Hebron and Qiryat Arba' in the next few hours? [Shahal] I cannot answer this question. I do not think that any dramatic steps are called for. We need a step within the limits of the law, to be implemented firmly and without any hesitations against whoever tries to break the law. Here we will not discriminate: Everybody, no matter what his nationality, is subjected to the same law. The Israeli Government is bound to act on the basis of this principle, both morally and legally. [Raz] Today we have seen that the intifadah crossed the Green Line. There were riots in Yafo and in Israeli Arab villages. I assume the government is very concerned about this. [Shahal] The prime minister will shortly meet the heads of the Israeli Arab sector. I will also attend this meeting. We are calling on the Israeli Arab population not to lend themselves to incitement and extremists. Relations between the Israeli Arab population and the state have always been good. They know very well what the government is doing. We are calling on them -- and especially on their leadership -- to prevent inciters and extremists from gaining control. The Israeli Police are evincing great restraint, but at the same time we will firmly prevent any deterioration in the situation. This must be very clear to all those who tried to violate the law. We are holding several detainees, and we will deal with them according to law. I hope tempers will calm down. We will continue acting as we have always done, as a law abiding country where all the citizens must act according to the law. [end recording]
