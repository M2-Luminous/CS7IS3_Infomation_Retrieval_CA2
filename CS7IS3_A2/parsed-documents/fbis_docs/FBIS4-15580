He further stated that this notion is reminiscent of a return to the old Soviet structure. "Azerbaijan is an independent state and I support complete independence of Azerbaijan and I believe that having joined the CIS, the republic's sovereignty has not been defied,"said Gasanov. In addition, Gasanov said that he does not exclude the possibility that Nazarbayev's proposal could have been misrepresented in the media, "Azerbaijan's official position in regard to the Eurasian notion can be put forth only after we have seen and reviewed Nazarbayev's proposal and idea." As to whether the Russian army would return to Azerbaijan, Gasanov noted that "this decision may be solved only by the Parliament of Azerbaijan". According to Gasanov, "any politician who will deal with matters, alone, must be answerable to the people, constitution and the Parliament."
