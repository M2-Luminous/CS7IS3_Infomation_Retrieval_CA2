FBIS4-17062 "drsov077_d_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 Regional Affairs Lozovoy on Talks Lozovoy on Talks LD2004215294 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1347 GMT 20 Apr 94 LD2004215294 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The third round of talks between the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan Aushev will be decisive, head of the temporary administration in the state of emergency zone Vladimir Lozovoy said in an interview with Interfax in Nazran. The leaders of the two neighboring republics are expected to meet in the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria, Nalchik, next week. At the previous round of talks the two sides agreed only on the preamble to the treaty on the implementation of the Russian president's decree on the return of refugees and forced migrants in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. "If this time talks bring no concrete results, there is no sense in wasting time further," Lozovoy believes. In his opinion, the Russian Security Council and the Federal Assembly will then have "to clearly indicate what the temporary administration and the presidents of both republics should do." Lozovoy noted that he had established normal working contacts with Galazov and Aushev. But in resolving problems he adheres only to the policy of the center. "Precisely from this position I would like to state that all of us should work for the sake of accord in Russia," Lozovoy said.
