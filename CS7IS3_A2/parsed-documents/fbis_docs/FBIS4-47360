Zakhmatov (Problems of Material Science Institute), AN Ukrayiny; UDC 654.924.5] [Abstract] The development of a considerable industrial potential, particularly in oil and gas production, transport and consumption, has led to uncontrolled ecological catastrophes comparable to catastrophes caused by wars. The current protection technology is inefficient, poorly yields itself to control and inadequate to the scope of destruction factors. Mechanisms of pulsed detonation feeding and sputtering of powders and liquids for fire extinguishing, setting up light and heat protection screens in order to prevent explosions, and spraying of binding coatings are being studied at the Problems of Material Science Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Key propositions of the theory of pulsed protective action have been developed. A number of pulse devices have been built and tested at test sites under close to real-life conditions. A multibarrel unit that periodically creates gas-dispersed streams with controlled parameters comprise the most powerful pulsed system. The units are mounted on tank chassis (50 barrels), gun carriages (9, 16 or 25 barrels) or on skids (4, 7, 8 or 9 barrels). An important advantage of a multibarrel unit is the capability to push and spray any granular powders, liquids and viscous substances. The article presents test results of various units. Simple explosive devices and fire extinguishing bombs also have been developed and tested. Multibarrel units can be effectively used for fighting forest fires, as well as fires at oil and gas installations and chemical industry enterprises, fires that can happen at airports during emergency landing of an aircraft, and ship fires caused by spilled petroleum products.
