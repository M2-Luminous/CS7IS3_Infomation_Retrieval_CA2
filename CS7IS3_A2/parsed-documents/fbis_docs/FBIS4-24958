Individuals and companies that pollute the environment will face economic penalties, and serious cases must be prosecuted, said Song Jian, State Councillor and Director of the State Council's Environmental Protection Committee yesterday in Beijing. In a speech marking World Environment Day, Song pointed out that the discharge of pollutants into the environment violates both public ethical standards and State laws. It harms the basic interests of all people and their offspring. He said it was a crime similar to smuggling narcotics or marketing fake medicine. Song stressed that environmental protection must be based on legislative administration accompanied by scientific and technological advancement and economic development. He also urged greater publicity to raise environmental awareness. One step in this direction will be taken on Wednesday, when nine government ministries will jointly launch a TV programme of lectures on China's environmental legislation at China Central Television Station, Song said. Commemorative activities were held throughout the country on the global day, whose theme was "one earth, one family." The Zhongwei Sand-Fixation Forest Farm in Northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region received national focus, since it was honoured as one of the "global 500" projects by the United Nations' Environment Programme (Unep). Since 1987, 16 individuals and units in China have won the title, which commemorates contributions to environmental conservation. For the past three decades, the farm has successfully protected the railways from Baotou in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Lanzhou in Gansu Province. In addition, it has turned 280,000 hectares of desert and sandy land into oasis and farmland. The forest farm's techniques have been copied in other provinces and autonomous regions, as well as foreign countries. Also yesterday, the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) and the All-China Women's Federation jointly sponsored a national meeting on Women and the Environment in Beijing. One hundred women were praised for their contributions and achievements in the country's environmental protection work. Participants drew up a National Environment Declaration for Chinese Women, which called upon women throughout the country to devote themselves to global action against pollution and to preserve the ecological balance. The declaration says that Chinese women--comprising one-10th of the world population--should take responsibility for the sustainable development of the global environment. The day also featured the opening of a three-day China-United States seminar on environment surveillance administration and technology.
