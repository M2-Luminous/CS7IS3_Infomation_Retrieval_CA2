And this for two or three years. It is the specialist's duty to be at the state's disposal 24 hours a day, day in and day out. The specialist is a top-priority policeman, trained in skills that allow him to perform missions by the special police, but according to the strictly prescribed rules of the profession, says Mladen Markac. We first met Mladen Markac in June 1992, in devastated Vocin, when many people would not even speak his name to us. We had come to that ravaged region while touring the local war zone and special units of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], which were working on clearing out the terrain. Besides Vocin, we visited a dozen other abandoned and ravaged towns in that region. The more we saw, the more our journalistic respect for the "specialist" men and their commander, police professional Markac, grew. One of their lodgings was inside the sooty, crumbling walls of a hotel in Zvecevo, in rooms that reeked of the recent fire. That was one of the many areas where they were eliminating the consequences of war, chetnik barbarism, and reestablishing the safety of life. "When we arrived, there was no life here. We cleared away barricades, mine fields; in the Papuk region we removed 1,930 mines, there was no electricity, but we needed it, we reestablished electricity, then water; for communication with 'civilization' we needed telephone service, and then after the inhabitants returned, they got mail service, like everything else," Markac summarizes part of his little-known mission, which has received little public attention over these four years. Professionalism and Ethics Of course, it is much easier to talk about this "ordinary," accompanying work by the special police. The singularity of their wartime duties is in fact reflected by the case of Vocin, or rather the area of the former police administration of Osijek and Slavonski Brod, meaning the police stations of Podravska Slatina, Orahovica, and Pozega. The special police oversaw Papuk and part of Psunj. The professionalism and ethics of these strong wartime nomads, who are obviously trained for the most difficult missions, was not overlooked by the inhabitants of the region in which they were active. For example, their doctors often saved the lives of civilians, offering them first aid and needed drugs. But little is known of this, and it is almost entirely unnoted in the annals of honor and glory; instead, their wartime successes remain in their memory and in the stories of those whom they encountered in the field. Their wartime activities began with the first "massive disruptions of public order and peace by the rebel Serbs," with the first barricades, as increasingly extreme assaults turned into terrorism, and then into armed conflict, the brigadier general continues. They carried out missions in Glina, Petrinja, Dvor na Uni, and Karlovac, and after frequent attacks on Croatian police, military "skirmishes" began in the Pakrac region. During 1991, there were attacks on Kostajnica, Kozibrod, and Topusko across from Glina and Petrinja. Plitvice was one of their first experiences with war. At the same time, the barracks of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] were captured, which was very important since "there were no weapons and there was an embargo on importing them," Markac recalls. The weapons captured there were used not only to arm the police, but also to begin creating an army. First to Oppose Terrorism The organization of additional special-purpose MUP units, known at the time as "strong forces of the MUP," began immediately after the fighting broke out, first with hidden enemies, and then with increasingly aggressive ones. At the beginning of the war, the police, as the only organized combat force defending the homeland, provided the first experts, commanders, know-how, arms, and equipment. In time, the National Guard Corps [ZNG] was formed, and then the professional brigades--or the Croatian Armed Forces [HV]--as well. "The police were the first to oppose the forces of subversive disorder, attempting to establish Croatian authority in areas where there was rebellion. The internal police organization of units distinguished itself in complex war operations, but there was obviously also a need to create military formations. The dynamics of events in the field forced the police, and later the military as well, to seek out new tactical solutions more appropriate to the imposed manner of warfare," Markac says, explaining the sometimes incredible events of the war. With the founding of the armed forces, the police reserves went over to the ZNG en masse, together with their equipment, and the police were again reduced to the ATJ [Antiterrorism Unit]. Terrorism spread throughout rear-echelon regions of Croatia. But the police quickly created new special units in the police administrations, with the average strength of one company. They were the best-armed and best-prepared units and became the spearhead of the Croatian defense forces, participating on equal footing with the HV in carrying out minor tactical missions as well as more complex military operations in crisis regions. "We always acted professionally, effectively, and in accordance with international conventions. The secrecy of the work was to the specialists' disadvantage, so to speak, because people were not aware of the many missions that they successfully completed. But because of that the enemy became quite familiar with the effectiveness of our forces," Markac says. They established Croatian authority in the Velebit and Papuk regions, saw action in Pakrac and Dubrovnik, marched into Cavtat and Prevlaka, fought in Glina.... Where all were they not present!? Field, Leave, Training But the police also had to do their own basic job, and the units changed their name to special units of the Croatian Police, so that the ATJ, because of the specific nature of its duties, remained as a unit on the state level, while the rest are in the regular structure linked to the police administrations and taking action in their region. Because of the extraordinary conditions under which they worked, the specialists' course of development went in the opposite direction--quickly thrown into war operations and combat, it was only later that they created a more refined structure and underwent training, but in that case with a certain amount of experience already under their belt. They had to adapt their manner of operation to domestic conditions, the imposed war. "Fifteen days in the field, two days of leave, 12 days of training... and this for two to three years. It is inevitable that the regular rhythm of life is lost, but it is the specialist's duty to be at the state's disposal 24 hours a day, day in and day out. The specialist is a top-notch policeman, trained in skills that allow him to perform missions by the special police, but according to the strictly prescribed rules of the profession." In short, this is only a suggestion of the working rhythm of members of the special units of the police, who over the past three years have created universal specialists, only for them to now specialize. What does that mean exactly? "For three years, we did not train top-notch specialists for individual tasks; everyone did everything, but now we are working intensively on that very thing. In the beginning there were 2,200 policemen, recruited from the ranks of volunteers; 250 were selected as the best, and they underwent an accelerated program. The one who distinguished himself as a leader in his group through his natural abilities, standing out physically, intellectually, and organizationally, became the commander," Markac says, explaining how the specialist is now schooled, for which four to five years are necessary. Chooses This Job Himself Cooperative arrangements have been established with the School of Physical Culture and the School of Criminology, which train cadre, instructors for the police. After testing and selection upon acceptance into the police, the school determines whether the men selected also meet their strict criteria--whether their super quality makes them stand out. They then undergo further training, specializing as skin divers, mountain climbers, spelunkers, or pyrotechnicians, and resolving hostage situations is the top specialization but also the most dangerous situation. ``The specialist has dual responsibilities in his job: professionally, because he must perform his duty, and morally because he has the legal authority, for example, to kill someone who is holding hostages. But no matter what kind of criminal it is that he shoots, even the most hardened one, that has an effect on the policeman. That is why it is extremely necessary to work on psychologically preparing each specialist, so that he can physically and mentally bear the burden of the most demanding tasks. "Moreover, the specialist must choose this job himself, and from day one a feeling of belonging to a group must be developed in him, the sense that an action is being conducted by a group," says Markac, who judging from our conversation with him brings together knowledge, police and athletic experience, and psychological toughness and tenacity, which have helped him in his four years commanding the special police forces. Deeds Make a Specialist In what other areas are specialists trained? As they say in their own jargon, it is extremely important that they master "the qualified application of force--that it be applied in the most humane manner, with the fewest possible consequences," aiming at targets selectively, because in a hostage situation, to use that example once again, "there is a small region of the body that you can hit" since the hostage is the one that covers and protects almost all of the abductor. But a master marksman will do his duty as it should be done. They are not trained in diving for the purpose of recreation, but rather to pursue thieves of coral and other riches of the sea, for sunken ships and to rescue people and cargos, and so forth. The specialist does not scale peaks and crags for the sake of mountaineering success; he scales them under the load of equipment and the mission that he is carrying out--a military one now at Velebit, and in other situations capturing a fleeing criminal, across mountains buried beneath snow, lost in the mountains' traps.... Finally, Markac emphasizes this: It is not uniforms, medals, or ranks that make a specialist, it is his deeds and effectiveness in performing his duties. But under wartime conditions, the special police has been unable to take advantage of anyone's experience; the experience gained along the way in our region has been "unique" and inestimable. [Box, p 5] Mladen Markac, Policeman With Rank of Brigadier General Until recently the chief of the Special Police Sector, a former deputy minister of internal affairs, Mladen Markac is a policeman with the military rank of brigadier general. An athlete who completed studies in physical culture and a topnotch judo wrestler with international medals, he began working for the police in 1981. He started as an operative for general crime and later moved to preparing special-purpose units. And that is where the war found him. During the war, he was awarded the military rank of brigadier general, and the only people outside the military to gain military ranks were members of the Antiterrorist Unit of the MUP, because they participated in all the most important military operations from the beginning of the war. After the Croatian armed forces were created, specialists and soldiers fought shoulder to shoulder, at the highest police-military level of cooperation. Indeed, the special police is almost autonomous in performing these tasks, as well as in logistics, with the exception of heavy weaponry, of which they have none. On the other hand, many HV officers acquired their first knowledge and experience in the police. Markac says this, among other things, about the police: Terrorism was an extended arm of the war, and it was necessary to create a solid and strong police force. Moreover, under conditions of war, crime flares up as well. That can be countered only with a well-structured police force, to which all operative branches lend strength. The state has entrusted to the police duties set out by the Constitution and by law, Markac explains, but the state need not fear a strong police, because the police is only an adjunct of the civilian authorities. Moreover, the state controls the strength and power of the police through its mechanisms. Indeed, the basic work of the special police is this: fighting saboteur-terrorist groups, preventing kidnappings and hijackings, freeing hostages, establishing public order and peace to a greater extent, preventing ecological catastrophes, accompanying and ensuring the undisturbed transport of special cargo, detaining persons whose activities are exceptionally dangerous, and so forth. Operation "Ring," better known as the resolution of the "Pintaric case," was a textbook example of a hostage situation, Markac said, and one that he commanded.
