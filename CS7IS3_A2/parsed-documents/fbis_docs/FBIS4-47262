The traditional methods for preparing alloyed ultra-fine (micron and sub-micron) powders by reduction of oxalates and decomposition of carbonyls are both cumbersome and laborious. In a previous work an attempt was made to prepare ultra-fine iron-nickel powders by electrolysis in a double layered bath. However, the formation conditions and the properties of the resulting powders were not well studied. In the present work a study was made of the effects of the electrolysis conditions on the rate of formation, the yield according to current, the chemical and dispersed composition, the specific surface, and the magnetic properties of iron-nickel powders as prepared by electrolysis. Analysis of the resulting data demonstrates that by correct selection of the electrolysis conditions it is possible to prepare iron-nickel powders having the required particle size and the desired nickel content.
