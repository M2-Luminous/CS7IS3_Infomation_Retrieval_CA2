Today the United Nations and the troika of observers presented a new document on national reconciliation to the sides. The contents of the document are not known, but it is known that it is the result of points of view presented by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the government. The two sides held meetings with the mediators this morning and once again this afternoon. Although no diplomat has made statements to the press, the countenance of the negotiators was described as encouraging. Observers have said the issue of national reconciliation in Angola, a country at war for more than 30 years, is not an ease issue to deal with. However, UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye still believes in a solution for this delicate point. UNITA also believes in this and hopes that Luanda, which has not yet made concessions, may do so to achieve peace and democracy in Angola. Thus, the ball is on the side of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party.
