Suphachai quoted the white paper as saying that China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Korea are Thailand's major trade competitors. Thailand has not yet lost its market share to these countries, however, but certainly will in the future if it remains idle and makes no further improvement. The meeting also discussed potential markets for Thai products and Thailand's dominance in different markets. Suphachai talked about his recent visit to Israel and several issues that were discussed, particularly bilateral cooperation in third country markets. At present, Israel is the only country which has received trade privileges from the United States, the European Union, and NAFTA. Suphachai said: "Israel can send its goods to these markets without having to comply with the quota system or facing tax barriers. For this reason, Thailand will try to send its goods to those markets through Israel. By so doing, the prices of Thai exports will have to be increased by 35 percent."
