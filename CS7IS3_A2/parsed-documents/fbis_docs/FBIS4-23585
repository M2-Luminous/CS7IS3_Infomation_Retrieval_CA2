Councillor Kpomakpor accused the multinational peacekeeping force of failing to take instruction from the transitional government and said the force was being indecisive in pushing the disarmament of the former warring factions. Councillor Kpomakpor squarely blamed the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia and ECOMOG for the stalemate in the disarming of fighters because orders were not being taken from government. The blame comes following warnings from the visiting U. S. State Department official, Prudence Bushnell, that the United States Government will reconsider its position on Liberia by the end of the month if up to about 50 percent of the arms are not taken away from the fighting groups in Liberia. Councillor Kpomakpor, as an individual member of the State Council, has also registered his opposition to the formation of a national army by all parties to the Liberian conflict. Reports said NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Africa] representations on the State Council are in favor of the formation of the national army and that pronouncement by Councillor Kpomakpor does not represent a consensus view of the State Council as called for by the Cotonou Accord regarding decision-making.
