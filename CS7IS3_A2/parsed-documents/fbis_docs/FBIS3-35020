Minister Yosi Sarid told our correspondent Yo'el Nir that this is a standard ritual we go through whenever there are problems in the opposition or one of its factions. Our correspondent notes that according to one of the clauses in the coalition agreement, Meretz is entitled to veto the admission of any faction into the government. SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] leader Arye Der'i says he will examine whether the possibility of Tzomet's and the NRP's joining the government is serious in order to determine whether it is time for SHAS to rejoin the coalition.
