FBIS4-30096 "dreas121_c_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-121 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 North Korea Japanese Remarks on Past Nuclear Activities Noted Japanese Remarks on Past Nuclear Activities Noted SK2306102094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1007 GMT 23 Jun 94 SK2306102094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Bad Habit of Finding Fault With Others Must Be Discarded" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are alleging that there is a possibility for the DPRK "to develop nuclear weapons in the future" and the South Korean puppets are blabbing that the North "will stockpile 200 kg of plutonium every year" in the future and "export nuclear weapons", making a fuss over its "nuclear issue". Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: To call in question the past of the DPRK's nuclear activities is a deliberate move of those who dislike a smooth solution to the nuclear issue to complicate the situation. For the Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets to make much ado about the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK is a sinister act to lay an obstacle in the way of a smooth solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the United States and deliberately aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula. Lurking behind it is the intention to divert elsewhere the cautious eyes and criticism of the world directed to them, accelerate nuclear arms development by gaining time and justify their nuclear armament. In actuality, the nuclear armament of Japan has reached the danger line. The South Korean puppets also have long since been stockpiling plutonium and stepping up the development of nuclear weapons. The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets are raising a futile row over the DPRK's "nuclear issue", afraid that they shall lose the pretext for their nuclear armament, if the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is fundamentally solved through dialogue. They must renounce the bad habit of finding fault with others, give up the nuclear design and stop the futile act of putting a spoke in the wheel of a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.
