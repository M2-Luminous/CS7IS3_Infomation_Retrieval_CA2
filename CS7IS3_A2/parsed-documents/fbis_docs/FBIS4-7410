FBIS4-7410 "dreas083_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 South Korea IAEA Proposes Fuel Rod Change Observation IAEA Proposes Fuel Rod Change Observation SK2904004794 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 2200 GMT 28 Apr 94 SK2904004794 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [By correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has sent a telegram to North Korea and urged North Korea to allow inspection when it replaces nuclear fuel rods under the condition that the IAEA conducts sample-taking and surveys gamma rays later. The IAEA proposed that it will send a five-member team to North Korea early next week. IAEA spokesman David Kyd said that although the IAEA sent this message to the North Korean side, there is no change in the IAEA's basic position to conduct essential inspection activities pertaining to the replacement of the nuclear fuel rods. It appears that the IAEA, changing its previous policy, intends to conduct inspections in a flexible manner because it expects that there will be a change in the North Korean position according to the results of U.S.-North Korea contacts to be held in the future.
