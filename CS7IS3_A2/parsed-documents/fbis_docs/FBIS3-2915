During the banquet he said the principle of "one country, two systems" will surely bear fruit in Hong Kong; all the targets set by the Hong Kong Basic Law will be realized; and Hong Kong will become more prosperous after 1997. Qian Qichen said it was a great pleasure for him to have the opportunity to get together with NPC deputies and CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macao. He said: Over last several days, you have displayed patriotic enthusiasm and glowingly expressed your views in discussing state affairs, despite travel fatigue. In particular, you have put forward very good opinions and suggestions on the Hong Kong question. We attach great importance to those opinions and suggestions. On behalf of Premier Li Peng and the State Council, I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks and respects to you. At the same time, I wish the NPC and CPPCC sessions complete success. He said: The NPC and CPPCC sessions this year are being held in an harmonious atmosphere in which China has made great achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization; and enjoys steady economic development and social stability, and the public is reassured. They are being held at a crucial moment when our country is in an unprecedented period of development and economic restructuring has entered a new stage characterized by overall progress and breakthroughs in selected fields. Under such a situation, NPC deputies and CPPCC members present at the two sessions are taking the 20-character principle -- the principle of seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability -- as a basis in studying problems emerging during the course of advance, and discussing major policies and strategies for reform and economic construction. I believe the NPC and CPPCC sessions this year will certainly yield a positive and far-reaching impact on China's reform and modernization drive. Qian Qichen said: On the eve of the current Second Session of the Eighth NPC, the British Hong Kong authorities tabled the remaining parts of Chris Patten's "political reform bill" to the Hong Kong Legislative Council [LEGCO] for discussion. This is another unilateral act to sabotage Sino-British cooperation by the British side after LEGCO passed Chris Patten's partial political reform bill, and the British side first publicized the contents of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political structure in a White Book. Though the British side talked loudly about cooperation with China, its acts and deeds on the Hong Kong issue in recent years have shown the very opposite. We cannot hold any illusion on this issue any longer. He said: Before the Sino-British talks began, we made some predictions. In New York in October 1993, I said to British Foreign Secretary Hurd that there were only two possible outcomes of the Sino-British talks -- one, an agreement would be reached during the talks and the political structure elected in the 1994-1995 elections would be extended beyond 1997; and the other was that no agreement would be reached and the political structure unilaterally elected by the British Hong Kong authorities would remain valid up to 30 June 1997 only. We are now going to join the Hong Kong compatriots who love the motherland and Hong Kong, and rely on our own efforts to ensure the smooth transition of power and long-term prosperity of Hong Kong. Mr. Deng Xiaoping said as early as 10 years ago: "We must believe the Hong Kong Chinese have the ability to administer Hong Kong well. Any disbelief in their ability is a remnant mentality of old colonialism." China today is not what it was in the 1840's. The day when Chinese people were subordinated to the oppression and humiliation of foreign colonists has gone forever. The elaboration on the Hong Kong issue in Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report is the solemn declaration of the firm stand of the Chinese Government and people. Qian Qichen said: The Chinese Government has the determination, confidence, and ability to realize the smooth transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and to maintain the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong because "Hong Kong's prosperity in the past was created by Hong Kong people mainly consisting of Chinese" and "Hong Kong people can administer Hong Kong well." At the same time, the determination and confidence rest with "our policy which precedes from the reality of Hong Kong, and with the fact that the mainland's reform and opening up policies are producing a positive influence on Hong Kong's economic development." I firmly believe that, with the backing of our great motherland and the concerted efforts made by the vast number of Hong Kong compatriots, the principle of "one country, two systems" will surely bear fruit in Hong Kong, all the targets set by the Hong Kong Basic Law will be realized, and Hong Kong will become more prosperous after 1997. In conclusion, Qian Qichen said: As the day of the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland draws nearer and nearer, a new epoch full of brightness and hope will arrive soon and the responsibility on our shoulders is becoming even more important and glorious. I cordially hope you will continue to carry forward the fine traditions of "loving the motherland, Hong Kong, and Macao" and use your experience, wisdom, and influence to make new, greater contributions during the crucial stage of the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland.
