Recently, a manager in charge of Shanghai's industrial administrative department was interviewed by this reporter, and he disclosed that Shanghai's plans will focus on the need to change the management mechanisms to set up a modern enterprise system. In deepening enterprise reform, different types of enterprises will adopt different measures, so that big enterprises are strengthened, the small ones become more versatile, the good ones are organized, and the bad ones are eliminated. This reform measure of providing different guidance will be implemented in conjunction with the continued implementation of the "Provision" in enterprises and as they change their management mechanisms. Upon organizing and perfecting some enterprise groups, mainstay industries and key trades and industries and large enterprises that have attained economies of scale to some extent and whose products have already captured fairly large market shares will be the first to be empowered to manage state-owned assets; the holding company pilot projects will be expanded. The management format of smaller state-owned enterprises that are not large in scale but have a good future will become even more versatile. Some can be reorganized into shareholding cooperative enterprises; some can adopt the method of leasing and become state-owned, civilian-operated enterprises; some may try transferring their property rights to the collectives or individuals in a step-by-step process. Emphasis will be put on state-owned enterprises that are relatively profitable and have had clear success in changing their mechanisms; they will be turned into corporations. A set of scientific and standardized organizational system and management system pertaining to decisionmaking, implementation, and supervision will be set up so that enterprises truly have property rights in assets as legal persons. Enterprises that are inefficient, that are poorly managed, that have no hopes of turning around, and cannot be turned into corporations, should be merged, drastic restructured, auctioned off, or declare bankruptcy, or be leased out or reorganized in order to optimize the composition of the stock of state-owned assets and preserve and propagate their value. Reportedly, thorough reform of Shanghai's industrial enterprises produced new results last year. Various pilot reform projects, with a heavy emphasis on yang (imitations of the three kinds of wholly and partially foreign-owned enterprises), gu (the shareholding system), and bao (the contract system), were installed in the state-owned industrial enterprises. Almost all enterprises have begun reforming their labor, personnel, and allocation systems. Enterprise management autonomy as stipulated in the "Provisions" has been handed down in most cases. However development is uneven, and good enterprises are covering up for the bad ones and good businesses are covering up for bad businesses. For this reason, Shanghai's industrial management department has taken initial steps to set new goals to put more force on reform this year. Municipality-wide, around 600 state-owned enterprises will basically change their management mechanisms and begin to take inventory to determine fund sources. Ten enterprise groups will be selected to serve as experimental points and will be empowered to manage state-owned properties. Ten will pilot the modern enterprise system, and another ten will pilot the directional capital-raising shareholding system. In addition, 10 larger-scale enterprises with sound foundations will be nominated to be among the 100 national enterprises to pilot the modern enterprise system. To realize this year's new enterprise reform goal, the pilot enterprises will comply with the needs of standardization and implement a series of reform with respect to the organizational system, management system, and labor, personnel, and distribution systems, so that gradually property rights are clearly delineated, government and enterprises are separated, and enterprises will have management autonomy, be able to take care of their own profits and losses, initiate their own development, and discipline their own behavior. Other enterprises will also actively create conditions to accelerate the change in mechanisms, set up a modern enterprise system that meets the demands of the market economy, and strive for new breakthroughs in the enterprise system. Reportedly, many enterprises have contacted the relevant departments to volunteer their services.
