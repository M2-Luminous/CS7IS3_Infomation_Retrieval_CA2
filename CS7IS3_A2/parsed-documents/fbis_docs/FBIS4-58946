He said that achieving a reasonable and correct size relying on modern and advanced armament is better than keeping "outdated" weapons that require expensive maintenance and many troops, which is a burden and does not achieve the required benefit. He said this is why the Egyptian Armed Forces are constantly working to develop and modernize their weapons. In a statement, Field Marshal Tantawi said there is constant action within the framework of military cooperation between Egypt and the United States to agree on the new weapons that the Egyptian forces need. He noted that this will be one of the main issues that he will discuss with U.S. officials during his current visit to the United States. He also said that current cooperation between Egypt and the United States covers three main fields: training, armament, and maintenance. The defense minister stressed that Egypt has its own concept of its Armed Forces' size and armament. He said that this "precise formula" needs careful study because an increase in the size of the Armed Forces will make them "overmanned." He added that the difficult point in the formula lies in a reduction in size requiring to be offset by advanced armaments that will replace the outdated weapons. Field Marshal Tantawi regretted the fighting in Yemen. Answering a question, he said that no party can achieve real gains or emerge victorious from this fighting. The Yemeni people will be the loser.
