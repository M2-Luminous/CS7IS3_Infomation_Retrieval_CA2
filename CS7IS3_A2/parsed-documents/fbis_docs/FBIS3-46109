During the conference Geriletu, member of the autonomous regional party standing committee and secretary of the autonomous regional discipline inspection commission, delivered a speech in which he said: Since September 1993, the regional level units as well as various leagues and cities have generally conducted various work set in the struggle against corruption under the conditions of short time limit, of heavy tasks, and of that the struggle involves in a large range of things. Most localities and departments have earnestly and actively launched the struggle against corruption and scored certain achievements in the three tasks of the struggle. Negative and corrupt phenomena have somewhat disappeared and the people's confidence in the struggle has been somewhat enhanced. The development of the work as a whole has been healthy. During the struggle against corruption, party committees and governments at all levels have paid attention to it and established the responsibility system at all levels for the struggle. They have effectively conducted supervision and inspection over the struggle work. Various localities and departments have steadily upgraded their ideology and understanding by urging their personnel to steadily enhance their study while waging the struggle. Many localities have vigorously grasped the implementation of the work by persistently proceeding from reality and emphatically dealt with their own prominent problems. Geriletu pointed out: In reviewing the work done over the past four months, we must note while acknowledging the achievements that there still is a large gap between the effects scored in the struggle as well as the demands set forth by the CPC Central Committee and the autonomous regional party committee and the people's expectation. Things that have been done in the struggle work still cannot satisfy the people's feeling. We should fully discern the importance, emergency, and arduousness of the struggle; overcome the thinking of adopting a wait and see attitude, implicating others, and fearing difficulties; and further enhance the leadership over the struggle and vigorously grasp the implementation of the struggle's tasks. In citing the struggle around the Spring Festival, Geriletu said: Efforts should be made to further enhance the study, to continuously upgrade the ideology and understanding of cadres at all levels and the vast number of people, to unswervingly and successfully grasp the three tasks for the recent period. In organizing leading personnel, it is imperative to enhance the unified leadership between party committees and governments and to uphold and implement the work-division responsibility system among leading personnel for the struggle. In encouraging leading cadres to perform their official duties honestly and to conduct self discipline, we should vigorously handle various problems discovered from their self examinations. In investigating and handling serious and appalling cases, we should accelerate the pace of handling the exposed important cases and further rely on the mass to actively report the corrupt phenomena through letters or visits. We should achieve in having every report offered through letters or visits be accepted seriously. In correcting malpractice, the cases of making overseas travels with public funds and illegally purchasing imported sedans should be totally handled before the Spring Festival. Efforts should be made to step up the work of checking the illegal business and enterprises run by the party and government organs, of correcting the arbitrary collections, and of clarifying the two line of revenue and spending. The key departments of banking, electric power, railways, and post and telecommunication should continuously and vigorously grasp the consolidation in their specialized working projects. Geriletu urged various localities and departments to earnestly summarize the work done in the struggle for this period, put forward work arrangements for next period, and to take the struggle for promoting the establishment of socialist market economic systems by proceeding from the whole situation. Localities should strictly implement the spirit of circulars issued the general offices of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, the autonomous regional party committee, and the autonomous regional people's government so as to have a happy Spring Festival with an honest and peaceful atmosphere. Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the autonomous regional people's government, presided over the television conference and also delivered a speech.
