Kooijmans reported his government has an ambitious development assistance programme in place for its former colony which includes assistance with the rehabilitation of the country's infrastructure and strengthening of state institutions. Kooijmans met Wednesday [5 January] with Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) Baena Soares at OAS headquarters in Washington, D.C. "We came to the conclusion that democracy seems to be re-established in Suriname but that the economic situation calls for strong measures on the part of the government," he said. He reported that his government's economic development programme with Suriname was already being implemented "with particular emphasis being put on the rehabilitation of infrastructure and the strengthening of state institutions such as the judiciary and the police." There were problems, he admitted, with the provision of balance of payments support to Suriname because there was no monitoring of the economy by international institution such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). "The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has to make sure that the support which we give is effective and we are now discussing with the Government of Suriname a way acceptable to both of us to ensure that such support is effective," the foreign minister remarked. He said he hoped the discussions would result "very soon" in the resumption of balance of payments support to Suriname. Turning to the Netherlands Antilles, Dr Kooijmans said he briefed the OAS secretary general on recent developments there, including the results of a referendum in Curacao where the people voted in favour of the maintenance of the Antilles as a unit of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. "This led to the resignation of the government and so there should be new elections in the Netherlands Antilles in February," the foreign minister said in an interview. On the situation in Haiti, Dr Kooijmans said what was most important "is that democracy be restored."
