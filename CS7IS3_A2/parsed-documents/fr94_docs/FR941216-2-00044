Applications and Required Documents Delivered by Hand. An institutional participation application and required documents delivered by hand must be taken to the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Postsecondary Education, Institutional Participation Division, 7th & D Streets, S.W., GSA Building, Room 3532, Washington, D.C. 20407.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the three campus-based programs, the Secretary allocates funds to eligible institutions of higher education. The Secretary will not allocate funds under the campus-based programs for award year 1995&hyph;96 to any currently ineligible institution unless the institution files its ``Application for Institutional Participation'' and other required documents by the closing date. If the institution submits its institutional participation application or other required documents after the closing date, the Secretary will use this application in determining the institution's eligibility to participate in the campus-based programs beginning with the 1996&hyph;97 award year. For purposes of this notice, ineligible institutions only include: (1) An institution that has not been designated as an eligible institution by the Secretary but has previously filed a FISAP; or (2) An additional location of an eligible institution that is currently not included in the Department's eligibility certification for that eligible institution but has been included in the institution's 1995&hyph;96 FISAP. The Secretary wishes to advise institutions that the institutional eligibility form, ``Application for Institutional Participation,'' should not be confused with the FISAP form that institutions were required to submit electronically by October 1, 1994, in order to be considered for funds under the campus-based programs for the 1995&hyph;96 award year.
