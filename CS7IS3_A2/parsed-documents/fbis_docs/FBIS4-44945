FBIS4-44945 "jpnea029___94025" JPRS-NEA-94-029 JPRS Near East & South Asia 23 April 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Border Forces Said To Fire on Unarmed Civilians Border Forces Said To Fire on Unarmed Civilians 94AS0284G Calcutta THE STATESMAN in English 23 Apr 94 p 1 94AS0284G Calcutta THE STATESMAN English CSO [Text] New Delhi, April 22--In a significant development, the NHRC [National Human Rights Commission] has held the Border Security Force [BSF] personnel responsible for firing live ammunition at an unarmed crowd at Bijbehara in Kashmir on October 22. The firing had killed 37 and injured 73. In its report, the NHRC recommended immediate proceedings for the prosecution of the 14 "guilty" officials identified by the Magisterial Inquiry. The NHRC asked the Centre to undertake a thorough review of the circumstances and conditions in which BSF units were deployed to operate in situations involving solely civilian populations. Also, it sought payment of Rs 50,000 [rupees], as compensation, to the next of kin of those killed; Rs 25,000 to those injured by bullets and Rs 10,000 to those who sustained other injuries. The report was accepted by the Centre and an "action-taken report" tabled simultaneously. The commission's report said that the evidence collected in the inquiry under the BSF Act, shows, prima facie, that a sizeable group of local residents had gathered after prayers at the Jama Masjid and had later moved to the national highway. There they were accosted by a BSF unit. "The evidence provided to the Staff Court of Inquiry by those in the procession," the report pointed out, "states that there were no armed militants in the crowd, the members of which were shouting political slogans and slogans against the siege of the Hazratbal shrine by the Defence forces." The NHRC report added that with the exception of one witness--from the six whose evidence was recorded--none of the others referred to any altercations between the people in the crowd and the BSF personnel. In fact, the witnesses stated that the people in the crowd were unarmed and that the firing by the BSF on the crowd was "without warning." The NHRC noted that although the situation in the Valley called for firm measures, the firing of live ammunition into a crowd of unarmed civilians could not be condoned. The commission told the Centre to keep it informed of the action--taken on its recommendations--and also of any measures being contemplated against those identified in the Magisterial Inquiry and Staff Court of Inquiry. The Ministry of Home Affairs, which released the "action-taken" report, stated that Record of Evidence proceedings had already been initiated against 14 BSF personnel. It said that the BSF authorities had been instructed to complete the proceedings expeditiously. Investigations into a case, registered in the local police station, had reportedly been completed and steps had been initiated to file a chargesheet against the indicted personnel. The Ministry claimed that the following steps had been undertaken by the BSF to ensure proper safety of civilians: - The training syllabus emphasized respect for human rights and ways to deal with the public, particularly with the elderly, women and children. - Wherever searches were conducted, the services of the Magistrate, Civil Police and women police were requisitioned.
