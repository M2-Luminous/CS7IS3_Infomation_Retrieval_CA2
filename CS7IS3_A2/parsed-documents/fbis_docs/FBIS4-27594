In a statement issued in observance of the "month of veterans and fallen patriots" in June, President Kim said today's world situation following the demise of the Cold War expressly shows that "our belief in liberal democracy has been right." He said the strength with which the precious value can be upheld would spring only from burning patriotism and firm senses of national security on the part of each people. "It is thanks entirely to the sacrificial dedication made by our fallen patriots and veterans that we today enjoy peace and prosperity in a free and democratic country," Kim said. Also in an exclusive interview with the NAEWAY ECONOMIC DAILY [name of daily as received], President Kim said he would see to it that some public enterprises would be privatized in a just manner without any tint of suspicion. Denouncing some industries for unfoundedly accusing rival firms in bids to grab public enterprises being privatized, the president said relevant offices are now working out a plan to forestall any by-products that may pop up in the course of privatization. He said the government would enforce a plan to sharply improve the environment for foreigners investment within the first half of this year. The plan, he said, would involve all areas related to foreigners direct investment such as financing, taxation, labor and land use. Touching on his upcoming official visit to Russia, President Kim said he hopes the tour would serve as an opportunity to further expand bilateral economic cooperative relations between the two countries. "During my visit, we will in particular try to remove various obstacles to free trade and investment and enhance practical cooperation in all areas," he said.
