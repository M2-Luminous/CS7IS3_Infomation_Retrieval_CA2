The officers took as a basis a resolution where they stated their complete lack of confidence in the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and personally Ukrainian Naval Forces Commander Rear Admiral Vladimir Bezkorovainy. The officers hoped that the Ukrainian president would not approve the actions by the Ukrainian servicemen who attacked Black Sea Fleet units in Odessa and would take corresponding measures against the organizers of the large-scale provocation in Odessa. The officers said the conflict was "pushing them to respond in kind." They recalled that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's unilateral attempts to seize a fireboat in May 1993 triggered off an outbreak of indignation in the entire fleet which resulted in hoisting historical St.Andrew's crosses on 226 vessels. The officers were quoted as saying that "there were neither common sense in the actions by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, nor reasons that would prevent Black Sea Fleet from voicing their protest in this way," i.e. hoist Russian St. Andrew's crosses once again. The chairman of the committee coordinating the activities of officers' assemblies in the entire Black Sea Fleet, Valeriy Volodin, told the meeting that there had been no contact with the fleet's units stationed in Odessa for five days. The Army telephone exchange is at a standstill. The wives of Odessa navymen had been calling via public telephone networks to say the Ukrainian command was still applying pressure upon the personnel of the vessel conservation group and the hydrographic unit. Representatives of the Russian command and the Black Sea Fleet had not been admitted to the territory of the unit. Interfax learned that many of the officers supported a proposal to withdraw Ukrainian troops from Crimea. In addition, some proposed not to admit the Ukrainian vessel Slavutich to the main base of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol until the issue was solved.
