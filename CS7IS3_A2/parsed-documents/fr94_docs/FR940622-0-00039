FR940622-0-00039 FR940622-0-00011 Comment: Two commenters stated that a hospital should not be required to designate in its by-laws which personnel are qualified to perform the initial medical screening examination because it is unreasonable to require a hospital to amend its by-laws. A recommendation was made that those personnel qualified to perform screening examinations be approved by the medical director of the emergency department. Another recommendation was made that those personnel qualified to perform screening examinations be set forth in the rules and regulations governing the medical staff and not the by-laws. Response: It is important to require the hospital to determine formally what type of personnel is qualified to perform the initial medical screening examinations because such a formal determination will insure that the hospital's governing body recognizes the ``capability of the hospital'' and is properly accountable for this function. For this reason, we believe that the delegation should be set forth in a document that is approved by the governing body of the hospital, rather than merely allowing the medical director of the emergency department to make what may be informal delegations that could frequently change. If the rules and regulations are approved by the board of trustees or other governing body, we agree that those personnel qualified to perform these examinations may be set forth in the rules and regulations, instead of placing this information in the hospital by-laws. We are amending ยง489.24(a) to reflect this change. Although we are requiring the hospital to specify in its by-laws or its rules and regulations who is a ``qualified medical person'' for purposes of providing an appropriate medical screening examination, this does not mean that HHS must accept the hospital's specification when determining whether an appropriate medical screening examination was done. So, for example, if a hospital specifies that a nurse is always the ``qualified medical person'' who should do the medical screening examination, HHS may, in some instances, determine that there was not an appropriate medical screening examination because the condition of the individual required the expertise of a physician to determine whether that individual had an emergency medical condition. Comment: Several commenters suggested that the regulations require hospitals to perform the medical screening examination without first inquiring about an individual's ability to pay because such inquiries may encourage patients to refuse treatment or request transfer, even when it is not in the best interests of the patient's health. Response: We agree with the commenter, as did Congress as evidenced by the provisions added to section 1867(h) of the Act by section 6211(f) of OBRA 89: A participating hospital may not delay provision of an appropriate medical screening examination required under subsection (a) or further medical examination and treatment required under subsection (b) in order to inquire about the individual's method of payment or insurance status. We have included this language in the regulations at ยง489.24(c)(3). However, we note that we believe that it means hospitals may continue to follow reasonable registration processes for emergency room individuals, including requesting information about insurance, as long as these procedures do not impede provision of necessary treatment and as long as all individuals to whom the procedures apply are treated similarly. That is, all individuals who have an emergency medical condition are served regardless of the answers they may give to insurance questions asked during routine admissions screening. A hospital should not delay treatment to any individual while it verifies information provided. Comment: Three commenters recommended that the regulations affirmatively state that every patient, regardless of ability to pay, should receive a medical screening examination performed by a physician. Response: Section 1867(a) of the Act provides that a hospital must give an appropriate medical screening examination to all individuals who come to the emergency department and request examination or treatment. While it may be prudent for a hospital to require a physician to conduct this screening examination in every instance, there may be hospitals, especially rural primary care hospitals, in which a physician is not available to provide a medical screening examination. Even when physicians are present in the hospital, there may be circumstances that are so clearly not emergency medical conditions that other qualified medical personnel may conduct the initial screening examination. However, although it is up to the hospital to determine under what circumstances a physician is required to perform an appropriate medical screening examination, that does not mean that HHS must accept the hospital's determination of what circumstances require that the screening exam be performed by a physician. Comment: Several commenters asked us to define ``appropriate medical screening examination,'' so that hospitals and physicians are subject to unambiguous requirements for carrying out the statutory mandate. Response: It is impossible to define in advance all of the circumstances in which an individual may come to a hospital emergency department. What constitutes an appropriate medical screening examination will vary according to the condition and past history of the individual and the capabilities of the hospital's emergency department_both its facilities and available personnel. Within those capabilities, the examination must be sufficient to permit the hospital to decide whether or not the individual has an emergency medical condition. Because the law does not require hospitals, among which there are variations in staffing and procedures, to adopt standard procedures or use standard staffing to meet these requirements, determinations about whether a hospital is in compliance with these regulations must be based on the facts in each individual case. Comment: One commenter stated that the regulations should permit other qualified medical personnel to perform an initial medical screening examination if a physician is not available in the emergency department. Another asked if hospitals could use labor and delivery nurses, in consultation by phone with an obstetrician, to examine emergency obstetric patients to determine whether they are in labor. Response: The regulations presently allow a hospital to delegate its responsibility to perform initial medical screening examinations to qualified medical personnel if it does so in its by-laws or in its rules and regulations. Such a delegation must also be consistent with the provisions of ยง482.55 with respect to emergency services personnel. Obviously, the Department cannot anticipate every situation in which an individual with an emergency medical condition may come to an emergency department. Hence, we cannot state unequivocally that an examination by a nurse or other non-physician medical personnel will be appropriate under all circumstances.
