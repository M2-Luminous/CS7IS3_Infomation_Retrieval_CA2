FR940105-0-00018 FR940105-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;68&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8786; AD 94&hyph;01&hyph;04] Airworthiness Directives; Honeywell Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II Computer Units, as Installed on Various Transport Category Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Honeywell Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) computer units installed on various transport category airplanes, that requires replacing certain TCAS II computer units with new units that incorporate updated collision avoidance system (CAS) logic, and modifying the computer surveillance logic. This amendment is prompted by the development of candidate enhancements to TCAS II logic that will improve its utility and increase its overall operational acceptance. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility between the TCAS II processors and the current air traffic control system. DATES: Effective February 4, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of February 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Honeywell Inc., Commercial Flight Systems Group, Air Transport Systems Division, P.O. Box 21111, Phoenix, Arizona 85036. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Abby Malmir, Aerospace Engineer, Systems and Equipment Branch, ANM&hyph;132L, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806&hyph;2425; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5351; fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Honeywell Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) computer units installed on various transport category airplanes was published in the Federal Register on September 9, 1993 (58 FR 47407). That action proposed to require replacing certain TCAS II computer units with new units that incorporate updated collision avoidance system (CAS) logic, and modifying the computer surveillance logic. Since the issuance of the notice, an additional change to Version 6.04A collision avoidance system (CAS) logic was recommended at a meeting held to discuss the progress made in implementing logic modification 6.04A. Meeting attendees included representatives from the FAA and European civil aviation authorities, U.S. and European aviation industry, and U.S. operators. The logic change that was recommended involves reducing unnecessary crossing resolution advisories (RA). That change is included in a new enhanced software package (identified as Version 6.04A), specified in Mitre letter F046&hyph;L&hyph;0069, dated September 21, 1993.
