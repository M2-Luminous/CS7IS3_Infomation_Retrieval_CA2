Vice Chairman Nuzum and Commissioners Crawford and Bragg dissenting. 3 Chairman Watson, Vice Chairman Nuzum, and Commissioner Bragg determine that an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury, and Commissioners Rohr and Newquist determine that an industry in the United States is materially injured, by reason of LTFV imports of silicomanganese from the People's Republic of China. Commissioner Crawford dissenting. 4 Commissioners Rohr and Newquist determine that an industry in the United States is materially injured, and Vice Chairman Nuzum determines that an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury, by reason of LTFV imports of silicomanganese from Ukraine. Chairman Watson and Commissioners Crawford and Bragg dissenting. 5 Commissioners Rohr and Newquist dissenting. 6 At the Commission's briefing and vote on these investigations, Commissioner Rohr and Commissioner Newquist each announced an affirmative finding pursuant to 19 U.S.C. ยง1673d(b)(4)(A) with respect to LTFV imports from Ukraine. The affirmative findings were based on information that certain imports would be encompassed in the period of retroactive application of antidumping duties, subsequently found to be erroneous due to an incorrect calculation of such period. Commissioner Rohr and Commissioner Newquist therefore make a negative finding pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)(4)(A) with respect to imports from Ukraine. Background The Commission instituted these investigations effective June 16, 1994, following preliminary determinations by the Department of Commerce that imports of silicomanganese from Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Ukraine, and Venezuela were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the Federal Register of July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36212). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on November 3, 1994, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. On November 30, 1994, the Department of Commerce notified the Commission that it had suspended its investigation on silicomanganese from Ukraine, and on December 2, 1994, the Department of Commerce notified the Commission that it had continued its investigation on silicomanganese from Ukraine. Accordingly, pursuant to section 207.42 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 C.F.R. 207.42), the Commission continued its investigation on silicomanganese from Ukraine. The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on December 14, 1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2836 (December 1994), entitled Silicomanganese from Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Ukraine, and Venezuela: Investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;671&hyph;674 (Final). Issued: December 16, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31353 Filed 12&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
