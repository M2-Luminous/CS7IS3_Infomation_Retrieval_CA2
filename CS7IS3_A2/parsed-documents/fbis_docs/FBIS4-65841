During his party's European festival in Dortmund, the candidate for the chancellor's office stated today that, in view of the economic situation, Germany is paying too much for the European Union. "We have fallen back to seventh place in the European prosperity scale. For this reason, the return of European funds to Germany must increase," Scharping stressed on the sidelines of the SPD rally on the occasion of the European elections, which was attended by approximately 300,000 people, according to the police. During his speech, Scharping advocated a stronger role of the European Parliament and rejected a "European central state with excessive bureaucracy." The identity of the regions must be preserved. With a view to European financial policies, the SPD chairman pointed out that he prefers a stable German mark to an unstable European currency that is introduced too early. [passage omitted]
