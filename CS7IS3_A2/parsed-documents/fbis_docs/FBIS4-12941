Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the Movement's leaders in the Gaza Strip, told a Quds Press correspondent that the Palestinian leaderships must hold a dialogue in order to avoid any conflicts that could arise among the Palestinians after the implementation of the agreement on self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the town of Jericho. However, he denied reports that coordination between Hamas and the PLO leadership had begun. He accused what he called "some parties to the Oslo agreement" of trying to give the impression through press statements on these [coordination] meetings that there was some sort of political flirtation going on between parties that support and parties that oppose the present settlement. The Palestinian spokesman said that the Hamas Movement will not at all take part in the elections of a self-rule authority or in the self-rule parliament and administration. However, he explained that the Movement will take part in all the popular elections which serve the masses such as municipalities and professional unions.
