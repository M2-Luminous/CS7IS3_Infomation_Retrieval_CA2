FR941230-2-00090 FR941230-2-00051 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,180] Magnetek; Huntington, Indiana, Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration By an application dated November 4, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance (TAA). The notice of determinations was issued on October 28, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on November 16, 1994 (59 FR 59253). Investigation findings show that the workers producing magnetic components met all the worker group eligibility requirements for certification. Workers producing electronic ballasts did not meet the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Trade Act. New findings show corporate imports of electronic ballasts from Mexico. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to jusitify reconsideration of the prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 16th day of December, 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Remployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
