FR940826-0-00011 FR940826-0-00005 The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of cranberries. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The recommended budget and rate of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its expenses. The Committee conducted a mail vote and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing order expenses of $164,690 and an assessment rate of $0.03 per 100-pound barrel of cranberries. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 budgeted expenses were $155,000, with an approved assessment rate of $0.03 per 100-pound barrel of cranberries. This represents an increase of $9,690 in expenses recommended for this fiscal year, with the assessment rate remaining unchanged. Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $122,580 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments of 4,086,000 barrels of cranberries. The assessment income, plus $3,750 in interest income and a withdrawal of $38,360 from the Committee's authorized reserve fund will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year are estimated to be $150,000. The reserve fund will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $70,110 for operating expenses, $40,500 for travel expenses, and $33,241 for administrative expenses. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year begins September 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable cranberries handled during the fiscal year; and (3) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
