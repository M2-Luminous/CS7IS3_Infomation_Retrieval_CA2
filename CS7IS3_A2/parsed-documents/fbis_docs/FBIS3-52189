Gasanov told IRNA at the airport that the objective of his visit was to exchange views with Iranian officials on holy places in Karabakh demolished by Armenian forces. Gasanov noted that the Armenian forces have strenghtened their positions in Karabakh and rejected Azeri proposals to evacuate the occupied areas. "We are confident that the Armenians are not willing to solve the dispute through peaceful means," said the Azeri minister. Regretting the demolition of holy places, including several mosques in the occupied territories, Gasanov urged Iran to join his country in following up the matter in the next summit meet of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Velayati said the commonalities between Iran and Azerbaijan required exchange of higher level visits at closer intervals. The belligerent sides as well as the neighboring countries should take measures to end the regretful war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Velayati said. Following up the letters of understanding signed between the two sides during President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's trip to Baku, regional cooperation especially at Caspian Sea as well as economic coopevation are among topics discussed between Gasanov and Iranian officials.
