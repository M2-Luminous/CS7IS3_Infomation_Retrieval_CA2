Things Seem To Be Moving That Way"] [Text] It has transpired that Yevgeniy Primakov, director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) has ordered that the financing of foreign offices of a number of Russian publications used by FIS officers as journalistic cover be stopped. Inside the FIS, however, they see nothing sensational about this. Yevgeniy Primakov arrived at the conclusion as early as two years ago that the Russian intelligence service had more than enough journalist "cover." Chiefs of many Russian mass media had long been convinced of that. Thus a decision has been made to phase out journalist cover until none remains. In the United States, for example, there has long been an act prohibiting intelligence officers from working under the guise of journalists. In all fairness, far from all professional Russian spies subscribe to their superiors' decision. "While journalist status is not diplomatic immunity, of course, it is still a useful thing," one of them argued.
