It appears as though U.S. trade pressure will be amplified since the Super 301 provision was revived on 3 March. Accordingly, the government is taking pains to prepare countermeasures against the U.S. trade pressure. At present, the United States is interested, most of all, in opening the auto market wider and hastening the opening of the services sector. On 7 March, the United States dispatched Peter Collins, U.S. deputy assistant trade representative in charge of Asia and Pacific affairs, to the ROK to make a full-scale demand for the ROK to open its auto market. The United States believes that the 120 to 1, car imports to exports ratio is in a state of great imbalance because of tariff and non-tariff barriers in the ROK, and are strongly demanding that the ROK adjust this. First complaining of the ROK's 10 percent tariff on passenger cars compared to its 2.5 percent tariff, the United States said that because the special excise tax is imposed according to differential tariff rates, the competitive strength of large U.S. cars is diminished. Tax probes of buyers of foreign cars, and the inability of U.S. car makers to secure broadcast advertisement time were cited as additional barriers to the advance of U.S. cars in the ROK market. Apparently, U.S. Deputy Assistant Trade Representative Collins will also discuss the issue of intellectual property rights with ROK Government officials. The United States placed the ROK on its list of countries subject to priority surveillance. Although the ROK has strengthened the protection of intellectual property rights over the past several years, illegal duplication of software programs and trademark infringements by enterprises have yet to be rooted out. This is another source of U.S. complaints. In connection with this, the government will notify the United States of our policy of strongly cracking down on infringements of intellectual property rights, and at the same time will ask the United States to exclude the ROK from its list of countries subject to priority surveillance. The government feels that we do not have to unconditionally meet the U.S. demand for market opening, but that we can cope according to our own plan. In other words, because our government has already begun to open up each field according to its policy of openness, it simply plans to seek the full understanding of the United States by explaining the situation. The government will also convey its concern over the revival of the Super 301 provision to the United States, pointing out that the provision runs counter to the spirit of forming the World Trade Organization, which is to be inaugurated next year with the conclusion of Uruguay Round negotiations. Government officials explain that trade issues recently raised by the United States differ in character from those of the past, and that our government is not being unilaterally pressured. A Foreign Ministry official said: "That fact that the United States is still interested in our country in its demand for further opening of our markets, is a positive sign." He continued: "A bigger problem is that people in the United States are now talking of giving up on the ROK market to focus on Japan and China instead."
