The members said the state finds itself in a dangerous situation because of the spreading famous trio: unemployment, corruption, and terrorism. The members noted the very high prices of all basic commodities and services, demanded a fixed, standard price for bread, and cautioned against the continuing rise in water, electricity, and medicine prices. They called for social justice in the government's measures and for protecting and securing free medicine for students and workers. Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi leveled sharp criticism at some newspapers and described what they publish about the officials' corruption as "coffee shop and street talk."
