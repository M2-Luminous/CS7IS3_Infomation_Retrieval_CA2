Mamduh Nawfal, security adviser to President 'Arafat, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from his residence in Tunis: The Israelis have been notified of the date set for the Palestinian leadership's return to the homeland. It is the end of the month or the beginning of next month. But the Israeli side is still refusing to respond to a number of Palestinian requests, first and foremost the evacuation of the Israeli Army from the crossing points to be used by the president's motorcade, not subjecting any of the leaders accompanying him to inspection, and lifting the ban on the completion of the small airfield in Jericho. The second point concerns approving the list of the 1,000 leadership and administration personnel making up the main bulk of the national administration's institutions, and the president's advisers and their offices. As for the third point representing an obstacle, that is that Israeli leaders are refusing to open up the Gaza and Jericho areas to the residents of the occupied West Bank to express their happiness and celebrate the entry of their historic leadership. Nawfal pointed out that Israel has not changed many of the ways in which it deals with the Palestinians, and there is a delay in implementing the agreements concerning the release of the other prisoners and detainees, alleviating the hardship of residents of the other occupied towns and villages, and reducing the Army's and settlers' close contact with local residents. Nawfal denied Israeli reports that he has entered the Gaza Strip to prepare a security plan for President 'Arafat's protection during his entry into his homeland. He said: "There are various agencies currently carrying out this task in Gaza and Jericho. When these procedures are completed, in addition to the removal of the Israeli obstacles I mentioned, we will all leave Tunisian territory with the president." On filling the six seats in the Palestinian Authority Council, Nawfal said: "Consultations have reached their final stages, and all the names of the council's members will be announced 72 hours before the president's and leadership's return to the homeland." Nawfal said that the delay in announcing the full list of the council is not an obstacle to or a cause of the postponement of the Palestinian leadership's return to the self-rule area.
