Accompanied by regional and church authorities, the head of state visited several rural settlements in northern Paraguay on 5 June for first-hand knowledge of the most pressing problems confronting the region's farmers. It was precisely there that several peasants organizations staged protest rallies and blocked highways to demand better prices for their produce, greater financial and technical assistance from the government, and the implementation of education and health care programs. The president said military personnel and Agrarian Reform Institute officials surveyed several plots of land in rural areas of several colonies located in that region. This will contribute to expediting steps to grant property deeds to farmers, an essential requirement to ask for agricultural credits. [passage omitted] During the CCDS session, Interior Minister Carlos Podesta said the government already has granted some 2,000 property deeds in several colonies so far. He added that a national survey on rural needs conducted by the departmental councils of each governorship in the country's 17 departments and 214 districts will be submitted at the next CCDS meeting. This survey will serve as input for the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to put together a project devised by Wasmosy--the Paraguayan Program on Social Investment--that seeks to obtain a $100 million loan for rural development projects.
