O free brother citizens in the brave city of Aden. Your Armed Forces, who are defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy, are advancing, with firmness and faithfulness, to pound at the fortifications of the forces of apostasy and secession and to save brave, steadfast Aden from the remnant soldiers of treason, terrorism, and agentry, so beloved Aden can return to the smiling face of the one united Yemen and resume its appropriate position as the trade and economic capital of the Republic of Yemen, in which goodness, security, peace, and stability will prevail under the banner of unity, democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy. O free brother citizens in the brave city of Aden: Your national, unionist leadership under the zealous national leader, Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, is very concerned about the security and peace of all the sons of the homeland, particularly the citizens in brave, lofty Aden. They are waiting with patience for the moment of great salvation at the hands of the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy. These brave lofty forces continued their sacred march toward brave Aden to save it from the pros of terrorism, crime, and bloody liquidation, the forces of apostasy and secession. This is the last chance for all those who are misled by the forces of apostasy and secession to join the ranks of their brothers defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy, to declare their loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity, and to step with all bravery and courage on the stupidity of the forces of apostasy and secession. These forces, who are taking their last gasp, want to set Aden on fire and destroy it, as an expression of their grudge, stupidity, cowardice, and meanness. The danger facing our people in brave Aden comes from the professionals of terrorism, crime, and destruction, the gang of apostasy and secession, not from their unionist Armed Forces, who are defending the dignity, life, stability, and security of the people, protecting their unity, safeguarding Constitutional legitimacy, and preserving blood, money, honor, and property from the danger of the forces of apostasy and secessions, who are using the bodies of our men, women, old men, and children in the brave and heroic city of Aden -- through force, coercion, threats, and violence -- as a human shield to protect themselves, now that they have lost all their losing cards and grown afraid of their future. They have only this rancorous, barbaric, terrorist method that shows their disregard for the lives of innocent people and their thirst to shed more chaste blood, thereby recording a new chapter in their bloody ill-omened history, which is already full of tragedies, massacres, and bloody liquidation in which tens of thousands of our innocent people were killed. The forces of apostasy and secession know full well that the moment of the fall of their criminal and terrorist scheme is approaching and that the inevitable downfall of the symbols of apostasy and secession in the quagmire of treason and crime is imminent. Therefore, these forces will not hesitate to commit rancorous acts of revenge while they are dying. Hence, the sons of our people, particularly our free, faithful brothers in brave Aden, must be fully alert and vigilant to foil the last chapters of the treasonous and secessionist conspiracy. They must be fully confident that the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy are very concerned about the citizens' life, property, security, and stability. In fact, this concern is greater than their concern about the lives of their brave soldiers, equipment, and weapons. They are the forces of the people who protect the people, their achievements, security, stability, and Constitutional legitimacy. These forces are for the people, not for an individual party, faction, or separatist clique to protect their individual narrow interests. They are the forces of revolution, unity, and democracy which only aim their guns at traitors, rebels against Constitutional legitimacy, and violators of people's options. Therefore, the sons of our honest and unionist people in brave Aden need to be aware of this important fact and to be very confident and reassured that their brothers, the sons of the Armed Forces -- the forces of unity, Constitutional legitimacy, and democracy -- endeavor, with all honesty, love, faithfulness, and concern, to save them from the tyranny of the terror traitors, the advocates of apostasy, separation, agentry, and treason. All honest civilians and military in brave, unionist Aden should join the ranks of unity and Constitutional legitimacy with all faithfulness, bravery, courage, and heroism in order to write, together with their courageous brothers in the Yemeni Armed Forces -- the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy -- the chapter of freedom from the nightmare of the forces of apostasy, separation, terrorism, and treason, and to champion the will of their lofty, faithful, and great people. Victory comes only from God.
