FR940817-2-00144 FR940817-2-00080 It is represented that at present the vast majority of Plans for which the Bank acts as a fiduciary do not pay any separate Plan-level investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees with respect to the assets of such Plans invested in shares of the Funds. A few Plans, however, continue to pay Plan-level investment management, investment advisory, and similar fees and receive credits which represent each of the Plans pro rata share of investment advisory fees paid to the Bank by the Funds. The Bank represents that Plan-level fees currently charged are paid monthly and are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets of a Plan with respect to which the Bank provides services. It is represented that Plan-level investment management, investment advisory or similar fees for all of the services provided by the Bank, including services in connection with the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement, are charged in the form of a single asset-based fee. It is represented that Plan-level fees are subject to annual minimums for administration and management expressed as flat dollar amounts and are subject to the application of certain ``break points.'' In addition to the Plan-level fees for investment management, investment advisory, or similar services, a one-time fee (also a flat dollar amount) may be charged in connection with the establishment of an account for a Plan, and separate transaction fees may be charged for various administrative transactions, such as for example, a participant loan. It is represented that depending on the terms of the governing documents of the Plan, Plan-level fees are paid to the Bank either by the sponsor of the Plan or from the assets of the Plan. As mentioned above, the Bank also receives Fund-level fees. Such Fund-level fees can be divided into: (1) fees paid to the Bank by a Fund for investment management, investment advisory, or similar services provided to such Fund, and (2) fees paid to the Bank for administrative, custodial, transfer, accounting, and other Secondary Services provided either to such Fund or to the distributor of shares of such Funds and its affiliates. For example, with respect to investment management/advisory services and Secondary Services, the current fee arrangements between the Bank and HighMark provide for: (1) MERUS, a division of the Bank, to receive fees from HighMark for acting as investment advisor, (2) the Bank to receive custodian fees from HighMark, (3) the Bank to receive fees from Winsbury for serving as sub-administrator to HighMark, and (4) the Bank to receive fees from Winsbury Services for services as sub-accountant and sub-transfer agent provided to HighMark. It is represented that this compensation paid to the Bank for investment advisory services and Secondary Services is in accordance with various agreements between Winsbury, Winsbury Service, HighMark, and the Bank. In this regard, it is represented that the HighMark Trustees and the shareholders of HighMark approve the compensation that the Bank receives from HighMark. Also, the HighMark Trustees approve any changes in the compensation paid to the Bank for services rendered to HighMark. It is represented that the Fund-level fees from HighMark are computed daily and billed monthly. The Bank represents that at the end of each month and promptly upon receipt of the Fund-level fees from HighMark, for those Plans which pay to the Bank Plan-level investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees, the Bank currently credits to each Plan its pro rata share of all investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees charged by the Bank to HighMark. 9. Under the fee structure proposed in this exemption, it is represented that the arrangement for Plan-level fees where assets of the Plans managed by the Bank are invested in the Funds is different in several respects from that described in paragraph 8 above. In this regard, a separate Plan-level fee will be charged to the Plans for basic administrative services not including investment management. 10 Such administrative services would include, among others, the Bank's acting as custodian of the assets of a Plan, maintaining the records of a Plan, preparing periodic reports concerning the status of the Plan and its assets, and accounting for contributions, benefit distributions, and other receipts and disbursements. It is represented that these functions performed by the Bank on the Plan-level are separate and distinct from those performed on the Fund-level by the Bank, by Winsbury, and by Winsbury Services. 10 The fact that certain transactions and fee arrangements are the subject of an administrative exemption does not relieve the fiduciaries of the Plans from the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act. Thus, the Department cautions the fiduciaries of the Plans investing in the Funds that they have an ongoing duty under section 404 of the Act to monitor the services provided to the Plans to assure that the fees paid by the Plans for such services are reasonable in relation to the value of the services provided. Such responsibilities would include determinations that the services provided are not duplicative and that the fees are reasonable in light of the level of services provided. In addition, the Department notes that the combined total of all fees received by the Bank directly or indirectly from the Plan for the provision of services to the Plan and/or to the Fund should not be in excess of ``reasonable compensation'' within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act. It is represented that the Bank will continue to receive compensation from the Plans for investment management services provided with respect to assets of the Plans not invested in shares of any of the Funds. However, under the proposed fee structure, the Bank will no longer credit to any of the Plans their pro rata share of the investment advisory fees, as described in paragraph 8 above, because the Plans will no longer pay Plan-level fees to the Bank for investment advisory services with respect to any of the assets of the Plans invested in shares of any of the Funds. Instead, the compensation received by the Bank for investment advisory services will be that which is paid by the Funds to the Bank for such services rendered to such Funds. In addition, the Bank will continue to retain fees for providing Secondary Services to the Funds.
