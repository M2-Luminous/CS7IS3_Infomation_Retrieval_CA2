What is the present situation in Gorazde? A. It is tragic. The aggressors are committing crimes using their full military strength. Fortunately the Muslims and the Bosnian forces are defending the city. But if no step is taken Gorazde will certainly fall and the lives of 65,000 to 70,000 inhabitants of the city will be at stake. We should not forget that Gorazde is only one example of the Serb crimes and aggression. There are other places in Bosnia which are currently under the boots of the Serbs. A fresh force of 10,000 has just been dispatched to areas around Gorazde from Serbia. Some other Serbian troops who have evacuated areas near Sarajevo, have come to Gorazde. And despite all the crimes they are committing, the Serbs are constantly receiving oil and food in violation of the UN economic sanctions. This is under conditions that the UN forces would not allow Muslims to receive even a single bullet. The main responsibility of the UN is to defend Bosnia but the organization has failed even to stop the aggressor Serbs to the extent that we can claim the UN itself is an accomplice in this aggression and is helping the Serbs to violate the rights of the Bosnian people. Q. What is your opinion about NATO? A. At the outset it seemed that they wanted to help, but later it became clear that they have no intention to defend the wronged party. NATO is not an independent force, it carries out the instructions it receives from the UN and its Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Q. What is the current situation in Sarajevo? What about the people's demonstration in the city? A. It is getting worse and worse every day. The enemy is sniping at the city and in some cases they even launch artillery attacks. The UN forces have returned the heavy arms and artilleries collected from the Serbs earlier. Concerning the demonstration, the people suddenly poured into the streets and voiced their hatred of international organizations and called for assistance. The Serbs are being allowed to commit more and more crimes and this has made the situation very critical. Q. Would you comment on the use of chemical weapons by the Serbs? A. The aggressors used chemical weapons in their first attacks on the bunkers of the Bosnian forces outside the city (Gorazde) and thus succeeded in breaking the defense line of the city. I am not sure about the precise number of the martyrs and wounded of the chemical attacks. Military sources have put the number of the casualties after the Serbs broke into the city, at 400 killed and 1000 wounded. But the point is that the populated villages near Gorazde are also under the control of the Serbs and it is not known how many people have been killed and wounded there. In view of the fact that there is no link between Gorazde and outside, it is very difficult to have an exact number of casualties at this time. Q. What do you think about the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina? A. It is very hard to say. As we know the war is going on. Our enemies are determined to exterminate the Muslims in this region and it is very difficult to counter them with empty hands. Q. Following the letter sent to Butrus-Ghali by Mr. Izetbegovic, is there any hope that the UN would help? A. The UN and the Security Council exist only in appearance but the decisions are made behind the curtain and by the superpowers. The UN has in fact no role in the decision-making process. Furthermore, Mr. Butrus-Ghali has proved that he has no determination of his own and has failed even to fulfill the simplest obligations of his organization. He is only waiting for the big powers to instruct him what to do, acting like, a slave. But we remember that the previous chief of the UN stood against Russia and the U.S. several times and carried out what it wished to do. Q. What are your expectations from the Islamic Republic of Iran [IRI]? A. The IRI, its government and people have been on our side from the beginning of the war and helped us as far as they could. We think them all and we are confident that they will continue to be with us in the future.
