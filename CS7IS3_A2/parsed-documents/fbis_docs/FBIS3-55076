Head of the Democratic Party, People's Deputy V. Yavorivskiy says that now Ukraine has Zhirinovskiy's Russia, not Yeltsin's Russia, as a neighbor. He says that this should be a serious lesson to Ukraine. He then says that even though he believes that there are no forces similar to Zhirinovskiy's forces in Ukraine, all the Ukrainian forces should ask the people of Ukraine to elect sensible people to the Parliament. People's Deputy B. Oleynik stresses the point that Yeltsin himself and his forces brought Zhirinovskiy to victory, just like Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to victory. People's Deputy Yu. Gnatkevich says that lesson no. 1 is that the Ukraine should implement reforms rather than mark time, otherwise the people will vote for any dictator or a demagogue. Lesson no. 2 is that exhaustive information about elections should be provided, because people are confused and can elect someone who simply gives good promises. Lesson no. 3 is that democrats should unite on the basis of a common platform and should form a single bloc that would unite all those who support reforms, private property, and denationalization. Another lesson is that elections in Russia showed that people can access power in Russia on the basis of slogans proclaiming restoration of the foundations of a great imperial power. This is followed by a commentary over visuals by Yu. Gorovoy on the same subject. Reporter comments on territorial claims made by Zhirinovskiy in the course of his election campaign, noting that he already refers to Ukraine as "small Russia" and does not hide his intention to restore Russia within the boundaries of the former empire. Reporter then says that Ukraine should remember the "mistakes of its great neighbor", which are as follows. The central bodies of power were completely detached from provinces. The economic program has proved itself only in theory. As for the population, it could not endure social problems associated with transition from a planned economy to a market economy. The main reason for the success of the Reds and the Brownshirts is lack of unity between democratic parties, which failed to recognize a common enemy due to internal discord. If Ukraine wants to preserve its independence, it should recognize this enemy, evaluate it, and develop a process to ensure formation of a strong and healthy Parliament and the government.
