FR941011-0-00040 FR941011-0-00011 ( ii ) The cumulative amounts of gain previously recognized as ordinary income under either paragraph (e)(2) of this section or section 1245 (or section 1250). (B) Qualifying dispositions. A qualifying disposition is a disposition that does not involve all the assets, or the last asset, remaining in a general asset account and that is_ ( 1 ) A direct result of a fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft; ( 2 ) A charitable contribution for which a deduction is allowable under section 170; ( 3 ) A direct result of a cessation, termination, or disposition of a business, manufacturing or other income producing process, operation, facility, plant, or other unit (other than by transfer to a supplies, scrap, or similar account); or ( 4 ) A transaction, other than a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section (pertaining to transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), to which a nonrecognition section of the Code applies (determined without regard to this section), such as section 1031 or 1033. (C) Effect of a qualifying disposition on a general asset account. If the taxpayer applies this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) to a qualifying disposition of an asset, then_ (1) The asset is removed from the general asset account as of the first day of the taxable year in which the qualifying disposition occurs; ( 2 ) The unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account is reduced by the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset as of the first day of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs; ( 3 ) The depreciation reserve of the general asset account is reduced by the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset as of the end of the taxable year immediately preceding the year of disposition, computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the asset was included; and ( 4 ) For purposes of determining the amount of gain realized on subsequent dispositions that is subject to ordinary income treatment under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of any expensed cost with respect to the asset is disregarded. (D) Example. The provisions of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) are illustrated by the following example. Example. (i) Z , a calendar-year corporation, maintains one general asset account for 12 machines. Each machine costs $15,000 and was placed in service in 1995. Of the 12 machines, nine machines that cost a total of $135,000 are used in Z's Kentucky plant, and three machines that cost a total of $45,000 are used in Z's Ohio plant. Assume this general asset account has a depreciation method of 200 percent declining balance, a recovery period of 5 years, and a half-year convention. Z does not make a section 179 election for any of the machines. As of January 1, 1997, the depreciation reserve for the account is $93,600.
