FR940630-2-00061 FR940630-2-00044 Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review June 23, 1994. The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. For further information on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632&hyph;0276. Persons wishing to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 3221 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0188. Title: Section 73.3550, Requests for new or modified call sign assignments. Action: Revision of a currently approved collection. Respondents: State or local governments, non-profit institutions, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 2,600 responses; .667 hours average burden per response; 1,734 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: Section 73.3550 requires that a licensee, permittee, assignee or transferee of a broadcast station file a letter with the Commission when requesting a new or modified call sign. On 5/19/94, the Commission adopted a First Report and Order (R&O) in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;114, Review of the Commission's Rules Governing the Low Power Television Service. In this First R&O the Commission has, among other things, amended §73.3550 to permit any low power television (LPTV) station to request a four-letter call sign after receiving its construction permit. All initial LPTV construction permits will continue to be issued a five-character LPTV call sign. In addition to the letter request, a LPTV must submit a certification under §74.783 which was submitted to OMB separately. We estimate that we will receive 800 requests for a four-letter call sign in FY 1995. The data are used by FCC staff to ensure that the call requested is not already in use by another station and that the proper ``K'' or ``W'' designation is used in accordance with the station location (east or west of the Mississippi River). OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0414. Title: Terrain Shielding Policy. Action: Revision of a currently approved collection. Respondents: State or local governments, non-profit institutions, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 150 responses; 10 hours average burden per response; 1,500 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: On 5/19/94, the Commission adopted a First Report and Order (R&O) in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;114, Review of the Commission's Rules Governing the Low Power Television Service. In the First R&O the Commission has, among other things, broadened the circumstances in which terrain shielding waivers can be used in this authorization of LPTV service. This action will cause an additional 50 terrain shielding waivers to be filed with the Commission. The terrain shielding policy would require respondents to submit either a detailed terrain study, or to submit letters of assent from all potentially affected parties and graphic depiction of the terrain. The data is used by FCC staff to determine if adequate interference protection can be provided by terrain shielding and if a waiver of §§74.705 and 74.707 of the Rules is warranted. OMB Number: None. Title: Section 74.783, Station identification. Action: New collection. Respondents: State or local governments, businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 950 responses; .166 hours average burden per response; 158 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: Section 74.783(b) requires television translator stations, whose station identification is made by the television station whose signals are being rebroadcast by the translator, to furnish current information with regard to the translator's call letters and location, and the name, address and telephone number of the licensee to be contacted in the event of malfunction of the translator. The certification requirement will effectively enable Commission staff to award four-letter call signs to those permittees most likely to be constructed and operated. The furnishing of current information is used by the primary station licensee and/or FCC staff in field investigations to contact the translator licensee in the event of malfunction of the translator.
