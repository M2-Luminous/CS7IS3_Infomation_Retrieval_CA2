But Europe seems to be distracted, concerned solely with its many various forms of selfishness. A strong right-wing tide exists in many countries. In Italy there has been talk about changing, shifting our country's borders eastward. What would you like to say to the Italian people now, in this situation? [Djilas] I said there is a typically Balkan kind of fascism that I consider worse than the Mediterranean fascism, because it is full of racist elements. And it is racism not against colored people but against neighbors, similar people. More precisely, they do not embrace fascist ideology, but they use fascist methods. Of course, the protracted war in Bosnia and the existence of the methods I mentioned encourage the Right throughout Europe. Today the Right is enjoying a definite recovery almost everywhere, and especially in central Europe, France, and Germany. With regard to the question of borders, though I do not presume to give any advice or issue any messages, I would tell the Italian people that any change in this regard could have unimaginable and even catastrophic consequences for Italy. [Curzi] In the former Soviet empire people seem already tired of post-communism -- especially in Poland and Hungary. The leader of the Right, a member of the Hungarian parliament, told me that there is no longer any fear of communism. What do you think motivates those people? What options will be taken in the years ahead? [Djilas] There are many factors that influenced those elections. The countries that experienced the socialist revolution, such as Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, now have the greatest difficulties -- more so than the countries that were under the domination of the Soviet Union itself. These difficulties are due above all to these countries' ethnic structure; and let us not forget that the Soviet Union, now Russia, had strong imperialist tendencies. It will take a long time to overcome these tendencies; there must be a different kind of society that does not need imperialism. Russian society has not yet reached this stage of development; it is still a bureaucratic society with major problems regarding social changes. As for Hungary and Poland, the Left was victorious, but they are not Stalinist communists. The victory was won by reformist communists and young people who want freedom and social justice. Communism is a great movement that has always embodied different currents, but with the victory of Stalinism all these currents were eliminated, destroyed. We can say that Lenin's communism will never return, or will only return with minority groups. These groups exist in Serbia too, but they do not have a major political role. So the victory in Hungary and Poland can be explained in terms of those peoples' desire to salvage and develop certain values that existed during the communist era and that could be destroyed by a sudden transition to capitalism. This is the most important reason. Also, the parties of the Right and center have not proposed anything new; indeed, their ideas date back to the period before World War II. However, new ideas have been put forward by the Polish and Hungarian socialists. I believe that what happened in Hungary and Poland is a good thing because it tends toward democracy and free trade. [Curzi] I would like to ask you another question, concerning ideology. Is it possible, on the eve of the year 2000, to still have hope in your ideals, the ideals of a socialism with a human face that will truly bring democracy throughout Europe and throughout the world? [Djilas] The ideals of democratic socialism have never been formulated in a determined manner. I spoke in general terms, that is, I am in favor of democracy -- but the kind in which social problems are resolved. I believe that in Scandinavia they have been fairly successful in this, but we must not underestimate what has been done in the past 50 years in Germany, France, and Italy in the field of social affairs -- health, the right to education, and so forth. We live in Europe or, rather, "you" live in Europe, and I live here in Yugoslavia, where there is war; whereas in Europe nobody's life is in danger, nobody dies of starvation, and nobody is homeless or unable to study. Europe today is ideologically almost entirely social democratic, which means that the threat from the Right is even greater and that, unless we halt it, the consequences could be tragic. It is necessary to halt the right-wing extremists, who are opposed to the parliamentary system or in favor of limiting social rights. [Curzi] With regard to the terrible war that is devastating the former Yugoslavia, what responsibilities does the West bear; what should Europe and the United Nations in particular do to resolve the problem and to initiate a peace that will be truly honored by the tormented peoples of the former Yugoslavia? [Djilas] The war in Bosnia has prompted -- or, rather, revealed an internal crisis that already existed. The West's failure to respond brought about an extraordinary situation: After Bosnia anything goes. It is enough to be strong and to have a little political circumspection, and anything is possible. The international laws that govern conflicts and relations between states and peoples no longer apply. So unless order, by which I mean international order, is restored, the entire system on which all the Western values were built will continue to crumble. Nobody wants to do anything concrete. [Curzi] I would like to ask you a personal question. Could you tell me a happy memory and a sad memory from your life? Let us start with the sad one, so that we can end this interview on a hopeful note. [Djilas] My most tragic memory -- not even bad, but tragic -- was the death of my wife last summer. Throughout the years of persecution, isolation, and my son's exile, we became a single person. That was the most difficult moment in my whole life. My worst memory concerns my conduct when my case was discussed by the Central Committee. Indeed, it was very different from how I would have liked. I recovered very quickly, but I had to pay for my mistake. That is how it is. If you are consistent and believe -- and I have always believed in communism -- you have to first throw yourself into the mire and then if you can, you stand up again and continue. As for my fondest memory, it is difficult to say. I think it has to do with my son, who spent 10 years in exile -- our meetings and then at last his return to Yugoslavia. I really think those were the most beautiful moments of my life. But I do not think that my life has been difficult or tragic. I chose my destiny. I decided everything, or almost everything. Of course, nobody can decide everything: I was also subject to conditions. Be that as it may, I made my decisions, and when you decide on your own, it is not easy.
