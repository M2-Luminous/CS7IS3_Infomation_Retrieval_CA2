Whatever I do is in the name of the Royal Government. There have been cases when it was said that problems could not be solved; yet the Royal Government solved them without any demonstrations occurring. But there is no need to praise Ranariddh or say that he is a hero. There are still many problems to be solved, such as the schools lacking textbooks and teachers, poverty in rural areas, insecurity, and so forth. We should not focus exclusively on the problems with the Olympic Market. The problem will be solved without putting Cambodia's interests at risk. This should be done properly. I am very concerned about unauthorized checkpoints. This is a problem we must solve. I urge all of you to be considerate and sympathetic to the Royal Government. Show the international community that Cambodia has no problems; that we have social and political stability.
