He added that during his one-year term in office he has also managed to put an end to the controversy regarding the presidential seat. Demirel noted that Turkey will definitely surmount the current difficulties within the framework of democracy and freedom, pointing out that the reconstruction of the country will continue. He added: No one should cast aside daily problems to engage in discussions concerning the regime. Demirel expressed his views on various issues at a news conference he held at the Cankaya Mansion on the first anniversary of his presidency. [passage omitted] [Begin Demirel recording] Terror is one of Turkey's primary problems. Turkey's second problem is the current situation which started as a monetary crisis on 16 January and is gradually showing a tendency to become an economic crisis. There is the problem of inflation which we are trying to reduce, but we have not been able to succeed despite all efforts. On the one hand there is growing unemployment for various reasons and on the other the need for infrastructure. There is a need for reform. There is the problem of insufficient resources for investments. There is the problem of expanding the social security umbrella. There is the problem of distribution income and the problem of equalizing the development levels among various regions. There is also the problem of making the state function better. There is the problem of speeding up the judicial system. There is the problem of consolidating the democratization process. Then there is the problem of making the market economy function better. Finally, there is the issue of waging a struggle against irregularities and corruption. [end recording] Demirel said that there are many pluses in the country together with the problems and cited the functioning democratic regime, the free parliamentary and judicial systems, the government which has received a vote of confidence, and the political parties as among the country's major assets. [passage omitted] [Begin Demirel recording] When we begin to discuss the institutions instead of the issues, when we begin to discuss the political system instead of the economic problems, when we again begin to discuss the political system instead of the security issues, we destroy our trust in that political system. We then weaken the political system which is supposed to help us. Whatever the discussion it should remain within the boundaries of that particular issue. Of course economizing is a most important issue. I would like to state, however, that bringing the state to a standstill for the sake of economizing is not a feasible measure. In other words, we may cause psychological damage. If the trust in the state is shaken then it would take much more than what has been economized to repair the damage. The trust in the state should, therefore, continue. The current situation in various parts of the country can be understandable for a while but this period should not continue for long. Investments have almost come to a standstill. A project such as the Southeastern Anatolian Project cannot come to a standstill. The same goes for similar big projects. [end recording] Demirel later replied to reporters' questions on various issues. [passage omitted] [Begin Demirel recording] The jump in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar from 16,000 Turkish Lira [TL] to over TL20,000 on 16 January 1994 cannot be explained away with what happened in the years 1993, 1992, and 1991. The Turkish currency is convertible. It has to be linked to something. There must be an explanation. There is a free market economy in Turkey. There is a free and fluctuating currency exchange rate within this system. There is a banking institution. We are experiencing inflation which is affecting the exchange rates, which in turn affect the interest rates. If one fails to regulate the association among the rate of inflation, the exchange rate, and the interest rates, then certain difficulties might arise. Now you ask if this is the reason? Yes it is. [end recording] Demirel recalled that Turkey's budget deficit has been an issue for each government and said: If those who prepared the 1994 budget thought that it could be prepared without first estimating the budget deficit and that their economic measure would be to assess the deficit within three to five months, then they should have done so within that time. Demirel further pointed out the burden of the interest rate was present in both the 1992 and 1993 budgets. [Begin Demirel recording] If, after seven months -- that is, today -- or after eight, nine, 10, or 11 months, a government says that current difficulties are the result of the situation two or three years ago, this raises questions. If you claim that today's situation results from the fact that the necessary measures were not taken three years ago, then you should have done what is necessary the day after you established the government. Of course, that is only if these are the real reasons. I think this argument is meaningless. I have to clearly state that the government [word indistinct] [end recording] Demirel said he has no arguments with anybody, is not responding to anybody, but is acting only in self-defense. Demirel stated that during their meetings with him, the political party leaders had communicated their distrust of the existing political and bureaucratic cadres and that he, in turn, had communicated these views to the prime minister and to the deputy prime minister. [Begin Demirel recording] Let us assume that the opposition, by virtue of being in the opposition, can only condemn the present government -- that is, oppose whatever government is in power. Yes, but it has a voice. What am I to do with this voice? Now I want to make my point: Government issues are not Cankaya's concern. Anybody who wants to establish a government or has complaints about the present government should address the Assembly. Let everybody know his place, speak correctly, and not try to implicate me in all kinds of things. [end recording] In answer to a question on whether it had occurred to him that today's situation would be better if he were leader or prime minister, Demirel said that events propel him forward and not backward. Stressing that the presidency is a very honorable and important position, Demirel stated that he is happy with his post and is exerting every effort necessary to be of better service. Demirel said: If you believe that I left a void when I took this office, then you assume that I am indispensable. I am not indispensable. Answering another question, which recalled the article in the Constitution that grants the Council of Ministers, headed by the president, the power to declare a state of emergency during difficult economic conditions and asked whether he would use this power, Demirel said: There are no hardships in the country despite the fact that a state of emergency has not been declared. If a law must be adopted, the Turkish Grand National Assembly adopts it. I do not think it necessary to declare a state of emergency, Demirel said. In answer to another question, Demirel said that he has no disputes with the government or with its leader, but added that he cannot be indifferent to criticism of his term as prime minister. Demirel said: A charge was made. Whoever presents this charge will receive this reaction from me. I have also conveyed this to Mrs. Ciller. I presented an account of my 500-day term in office in a news conference, such as this, in the presence of Mrs. Ciller. The account I submitted then was a good account, Demirel said. Demirel noted that it is everybody's right to ask what economic measures were proposed and rejected during his term as prime minister. [Begin Demirel recording] I have communicated these measures to the parties concerned on various occasions. I have told them that they were also members of the 500-day cabinet they are criticizing. I ask those who claim that they did not have the necessary authority during those 500 days whether they participated in that government unwillingly and also whether they were not aware of the word resignation. [end recording] Demirel noted that joint responsibility is essential for a government.
