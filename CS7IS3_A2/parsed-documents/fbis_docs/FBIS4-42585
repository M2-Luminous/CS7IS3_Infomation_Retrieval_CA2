He explained that the state and security forces are very successful against separatist terrorism. The regional people agree with us, he said, and they come and thank us. Mentese chaired a meeting of the Prime Minister's State of Emergency Coordination Council in Ankara today. In an opening speech, Mentese denied the claims that the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] is fighting for the Kurdish identity or for the freedom of the Kurdish people. He said that the press and the citizens of Kurdish origin living in southeastern Anatolia are being misled about this issue. Certain circles are trying to spread the rumor that there is a Kurdish problem, he said, adding that the PKK is merely a terrorist organization that sheds blood mercilessly. He asked: How can one say that this organization fights for the freedom of the Kurdish people? The interior minister said the council will review the short-, medium-, and long-term measures to be taken regarding this issue.
