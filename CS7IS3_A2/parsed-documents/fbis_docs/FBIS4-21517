As a result, all Britain's military and civil nuclear waste will be buried on land. Most of it is destined for the proposed repository under British Nuclear Fuel's Sellafield complex in Cumbria. Planning permission for the preliminary phase of a repository, a 700 metre-deep rock laboratory, will be sought next month by Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste disposal company. This plan involves sinking two shafts and building galleries to test whether the geology under Sellafield is suitable for construction of full-scale repository. Even on the most optimistic forecast, this would not be ready before 2010. The Government's decision to abandon sea dumping, announced by Gillian Shephard, the Agriculture and Fisheries Minister, was rather reluctant. She said it remained the Government's view was that decisions on disposal of waste should be taken on economic and scientific grounds and in both areas there were good arguments for disposal at sea. However, the Government "recognises that the weight of international opinion on the matter means that such dumping is not, in any event, a practical proposition." The Ministry of Defence has seven redundant nuclear submarines waiting for disposal, three at Devonport and four at Rosyth. The original plan was to scrap the uncontaminated parts and fill the reactor compartments with concrete ready to sink them at sea. Although they are now destined for years of "floating storage", the reactors will eventually have to be cut up and placed in concrete containers for disposal in the civil repository. The same is true of the concrete shields of civil reactors. The Nirex rock repository plan is running into opposition from some local people in Cumbria and environmental groups. The nuclear industry hopes to avoid a public inquiry at this stage and hold one in five years, when it has proved that the area is right geologically for a full-blown repository. Objectors will demand a public inquiry immediately, because they believe the rock laboratory is a pilot project for the full repository. The proposed rock laboratory, should it prove suitable, would be adapted to be part of the repository. Three thousand jobs will be created for eight to 10 years in the construction phase, which would be as large a job as the Channel tunnel. Only 300 people would be needed to run the repository itself, which is expected to take all Britain's intermediate and low level waste to the year 2050.
