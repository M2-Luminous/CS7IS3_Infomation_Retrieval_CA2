[Sha'th] Good evening. [Mu'addi] Dr. Sha'th, what is your initial reaction to the government's decision to release approximately 1,000 detainees and prisoners from the West Bank and Gaza Strip? [Sha'th] Naturally, one wants freedom for all his fellow citizens and people. We have worked determinedly at the table of negotiations to secure the release of all Palestinian detainees and not to keep any of our children in prisons and detention camps. This is a duty that we must pursue. When any citizen is released, this means that freedom has been restored to a human being who has suffered gravely. However, as you know, this move is one of the results of this horrendous massacre which claimed many lives in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. I believe that besides releasing those detainees, many things must be done in order to safeguard our people and prevent the recurrence of such dreadful massacres. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, you are taking part in the PLO leadership's consultations. Are there final decisions? [Sha'th] The meetings are continuing tonight. They have been going on for two days. This is because the incident was so grave and the responsibility is so heavy. We should continue work to provide protection for our Palestinian people. Therefore, the final results of these meetings will not appear before the end of tonight. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what is the PLO leadership's trend regarding the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? [Sha'th] This is one of the important questions which we must decide tonight. Russian President Yeltsin has sent a high-level envoy. He asked us to await his arrival before arriving at our final decision. We will respect this wish. We are waiting to meet with this envoy before we arrive at results, especially with regard to the negotiations. Naturally, we do not want to halt the peace process, which will eventually bring about Israeli withdrawal and freedom for our people. However, we are fully aware that important, sufficient, and necessary guarantees must be provided for the peace process. We are responsible for our people and for their freedom, security, and protection. This makes the decision difficult and guarantees necessary. [Mu'addi] When will the Palestinian delegation leave for Washington for talks with the U.S. Administration on the resumption of the negotiations? [Sha'th] Soon. I believe that what is required now is to hold consultations with the U.S. Administration to provide these guarantees. As I have already mentioned, there will also be consultations with the Russian Government. There are other consultations with the Arab, European, and other world governments. What is required, effectively, is to have the international community assume its responsibility and to agree on measures for the protection of the peace process through providing security for our people. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one last question. Israel has agreed in principle on the presence of international observers in Jericho and Gaza. What is your comment? [Sha'th] This is an important move. It is referred to in the Declaration of Principles [DOP], which we signed in Washington. The DOP provides for a temporary international presence. Naturally, we want any international presence to be only temporary; that is, until withdrawal is completed, the Palestinian police assume their responsibilities, and until we reach a solution that ensures security and peace for all sons of our people. Therefore, this move is necessary and important. It must provide the minimum level of protection. The other point, which is equally important, is the removal of the causes which led to this odious crime, primarily those settlers who carry weapons and open fire wherever they go. These are two very important conditions for providing protection and for the prevalence of security and stability so that the peace process can maintained. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, currently in Tunis, thank you very much. [Sha'th] Thank you, brother. Thank you.
