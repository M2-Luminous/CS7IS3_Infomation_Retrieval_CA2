Let us listen now to the prime minister's first reaction after the first projections last night. He was speaking on the phone to RAI Uno. [Begin Berlusconi recording] I think the victory will encourage all cabinet members to continue in the same direction in which we started. As far as I am concerned, I must say that it will encourage me to try as hard as I can and to work with enthusiasm and absolute commitment, since I have been rewarded with the approval of so many citizens. As for the situation in the Senate, I hope the opposition will learn from what happened and that they will want to be in opposition in a positive way. The opposition is comprised of several groups today -- I clearly mean the Italian Popular Party -- which should think about these results and about their behavior. This would lead them, I believe, to get more in touch with their electorate, that is, people who want to remain among the moderates and want to support the government. [end recording]
