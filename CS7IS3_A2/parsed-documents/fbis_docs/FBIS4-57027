Those statements, in particular, are not simple opinions but, taken jointly, clear indicators of concerted objectives to negatively affect the negotiation process. Cease-Fire, Reality, and Perspective It is truly worrisome to see a recalcitrant sector of private initiative, which has taken upon itself to represent all Guatemalan businessmen, and hoist old banners in new times. It is especially troublesome when this sector attempts to actualize positions that have not only been defeated in national and international arenas, but are totally against the spirit and the letter of a previously agreed negotiation, which was held with UN participation. To propose, as the CACIF [Coordinating Committee for Agriculture, Commercial, Financial, and Industrial Associations] board has done, that first there must be a cease-fire so that we can later negotiate what is "pending" is nothing more than a clear indication that they do not want the peace negotiations to have any political, economic, or social content. The negotiations are only intended to get the URNG to give up its weapons, without solving any of the problems that caused and maintain the armed conflict. The current CACIF board's reasoning is not naive. It attempts to have an emotional impact on the population. This old and out-of-place concept has been, precisely, one of the causes of the long and hard war we have endured. The persistance of this reasoning is a serious and hazardous obstacle to the attainment of peace. To achieve peace it is imperative that the previously agreed upon fundamental issues be seriously and thouroughly discussed, agreed upon, and complied with. After we reach agreements on the fundamental issues on the agenda, using CACIF's words, the "pending" issue would then be the cease-fire. In this case, changing the order of the factors completely alters the product. Anybody knows and the current CACIF board is especially aware that nobody is going to negotiate the causes of a conflict when it has already ended. If, as they proclaim, they want peace, they must actively and assertively participate, with a positive attitude and social sensitivity, to find solutions for the country's major problems. They should also propose initiatives that will contribute to the advancement of negotiations. This is the point of definition: Take advantage of the present opportunity to rectify their position, join society, and stop going against the people's interests. The same can be said about the defense minister's position. He knows perfectly well that this topic unavoidably leads to an interruption in negotiations. It is contradictory that he carries out sensationalist publicity stunts in an attempt to take by surprise the good faith of nationals and foreigners. The national and international public are aware that most of the problems and sufferings of people in the conflict area are caused by the Army's houndings, persecution, and military actions against the civilian population, especially in the areas where Communities of Resistant People and programs for returning refugees exist. It is not with a cease-fire declaration that we will resolve our problems. The effective and proper way is to zealously and thoroughly comply with the Global Human Rights Agreement. In the end, the current propaganda and sensationalist measures attempt to diminish the Global Human Rights Agreement will not guarantee the people's rights nor lead the country anywhere. We, thus, call for reflection. We ask and demand coherence. Anything else is diversion and disinformation to avoid compliance with obligations and the verification process. They are an obstacle to continuing on the set path. Commission for the Establishment of Human Rights Violations We consider it positive that the commission's debate on the issue is being endorsed by Army members, and that the need for its establishment is becoming increasingly evident. The URNG is compelled to state its position on concepts that provoke confusion. Since the beginning, the URNG has considered that the establishment of such a commission was, and is, not only essential but also not postponable because it is a significant commitment to eradicate impunity, guarantee democratization, and eradicate forever terrible events which tarnished and darkened our history. The truth is essential for all this; it is not vengeance, as some have depicted it. This commission's functions must center on the issue of human rights violations so no one may misconstrue its purposes and goals. This must be an essential starting point. Events determine history. An investigation commission must start with incidents of human rights violations and issue a statement concerning this. Statements Which Obstruct A Process President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has repeated, in an inexplicable and absurd way, the speech given by former President Serrano on the negotiation issue. This is reprehensible, above all because it counters agreements that were signed and ratified after 10 January. To proclaim nonexistent military victories and to proclaim the URNG's alleged defeat at the political and international level, casts doubts on the government's willingness to negotiate, gives evidence of profound contradictions and divisions, and represents obstacles to the peace process. The current administration's only achievement is the signing of agreements on the negotiation process. The president and his government must be aware of this. His prestige as human rights ombudsman has been criticized all over the world. His only alternative is to comply with, and implement, the human rights agreement. He must also give specific proof that he intends to continue with the negotiation process. If the president wants to fulfill his role, and if he wants this role recognized at the national and the international level, he must avoid traditional and recalcitrant speeches. It is incongruent and detrimental to repeat them.
