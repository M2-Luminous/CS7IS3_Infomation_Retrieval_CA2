It has been learned that the IAEA will closely review the inspection results as soon as the inspection team returns early this week to decide whether or not to call a special Board of Governors meeting. According to information from a well-informed IAEA source obtained today, during the 10-day inspection, which began on 3 March, North Korea did not allow the checking of the points for the full-scope inspection required by the IAEA and only allowed limited inspections, including the replacement of surveillance devices. The source said North Korea only allowed limited inspections, including the replacement of surveillance devices, and that inspections on North Korean facilities did not go smoothly from the beginning. It seemed that the inspection team and the North Korean authorities had considerable disagreement regarding the broken seals in the radioactive chemical laboratory, in particular. The source said the inspection team considered returning earlier than the original two-week schedule because North Korea did not immediately allow follow-up steps for the confirmation of the contents resulted from the broken seals in the radioactive chemical laboratory. The inspection team finished their preparations to leave on 11 and 12 March and will return early this week. The IAEA established a policy to call an emergency special Board of Governors meeting if it comes to a conclusion that the inspections required by the IAEA were not conducted after receiving a more accurate inspection report from the inspection team.
