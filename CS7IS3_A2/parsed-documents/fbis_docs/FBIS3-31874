He accused the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] of attacking convoys near Gornji Vakuf. On both occasions British troops escorting the convoys returned fire on the HVO positions, silencing the attackers. No casualties or serious damage was inflicted on the convoys. The UN soldiers could not say with certainty who attacked the convoy on the Kiseljak-Visoko road, so they did not return fire, Colonel Aikman said.
