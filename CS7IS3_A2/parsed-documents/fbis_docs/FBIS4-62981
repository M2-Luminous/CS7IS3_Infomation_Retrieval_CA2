The government is given 10 days in which to amend the paper before it goes to parliament. In an interview with INTERFAX, Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli was speaking about the main guidelines of the country's social and economic reforms. IF: What exactly are the Moldovan Government's priorities? SANGHELI: Well, these include the consolidation of the country's statehood, its political and economic independence and creation of an effective advanced economy. We will be seeking to the Republic's incorporation in the world economy, ensure decent living standards and protect more vulnerable sections. IF: Is it possible to say that the government is firmly committed to a market-led economy? SANGHELI: Yes. At the same time, we are working on a premise that market economy should not be an end in itself, but a means of improving production efficiency and living standards. The planned reforms and transition to market relations combined with government regulation will be carried out with an eye on the country's traditions and specifics, the structure and distribution of the workforce, cultural and social factors. The government is seeking to enlarge the social basis of reforms by swaying support from broader sections of the population. I do not think the state and government must be perceived as forces acting against the public. That is why we intend to pursue a coherent and economically measured social policy. Although international aid, investment, credits, technologies and expertise are only too welcome, Moldova must rely only on its own potential. IF: The economic situation in Moldova remains unstable. Since early 1990's, its GDP and national income has fallen by 46.5 and 44.7 percent respectively with industrial and farm output dropping by 30.3 and 29.8 percent. True, there are also positive trends, but these are not too many. How is the country going to reverse those negative trends? SANHGELI: Nothing short of effective economic reform measures, stimulation of production and social security safeguards can help to do so. Last year, the government launched a nationwide privatization program including stock taking and evaluation of the state property. Bonds (similar to Russia's privatization vouchers -- IF) were distributed among Moldovan citizens. By now, more than 300 state enterprises have been turned into stock holding companies. The process of demonopolization is now under way in retail trade, catering and services. With the first stage of land reform now completed, a total of 284,000 ha of land has fallen into private hands. The second stage will allow rural residents to share in the land or assets of state farm producers. IF Note: The country's privatization land fund runs at about two million ha or 62 percent of the country's total. By now, 60 percent of those entitled to land ownership have received appropriate land titles. The process is under way of transforming state or collective farms into stock holding companies, farm cooperatives or firms and private farms. The number of farmsteads runs at nearly 10,000. To promote entrepreneurial business, a support fund was set up to help promote private enterprise and small-size business. Similar government programs are to be approved soon. The private sector units about 34,000 economic entities, with more than 15,000 of them emerging last year. IF: What sort of financial, taxation and crediting policy is the government planning to pursue in the next few years? SANGHELI: We will embark on a moderately tight financial and crediting policies. This provides for an increase in government revenues by improving taxation and financial discipline and combatting tax evasion. We also plan to raise revenues at the cost of state, lease and stock holding companies as well as proceeds from the sale of state property, utilization of natural resources and land rent. Plans are also in progress to issue short-term bonds and securities at attractive conditions in an effort to achieve a a deficit-free budget. The government sets great store by the decentralization of the budgetary system which will create a real economic basis for local self-management. It is planned that individual, corporate, property and local taxes and duties will be levied to help form local budgets. Decentralization of the budget and greater economic independence by the regions can help defuse tension between the center and local government bodies, including Transdniestria [Transdniester] and Gagauzia.
