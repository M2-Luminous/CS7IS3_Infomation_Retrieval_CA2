There are fears that PARENA (Party for National Reconstruction) [Parti pour la Reconstruction Nationale] will become a sanctuary for all extremist and discontented Tutsis. The party aims to get involved in the fight to succeed President Cyprien Ntaryamira, who died in a plane crash, and that could well turn out to be dynamite. Moreover, he will take an anti-Belgian stance. [passage omitted]
