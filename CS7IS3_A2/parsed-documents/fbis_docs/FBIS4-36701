As you know, there are many concerns in the Palestinian arena. The implementation of the agreement that was signed by Israel and the PLO faces many obstacles. There is the problem of the Palestinian detainees, who Israel has set free in accordance with unfair conditions, including the condition of keeping these freed detainees in the Jericho area to prevent them from returning to their homes. What can you tell us about these obstacles and their dimensions? [Sha'th] Negotiations for the release of the Palestinian detainees continued until the last moment, just before the conclusion of the agreement in Cairo on 4 May. The Palestinian side insisted -- I reiterate that we concluded an agreement that gives all the Palestinian detainees now in Israeli prisons the opportunity to be set free. This is what we want implemented: First, the immediate release of the 5,000 detainees who, according to our agreement, should be released from Israeli jails within a period of five weeks from the date the agreement was signed. This means this is the last week for the release of these 5,000 detainees. We agreed to continue negotiations for the release of the others within the next three months. There is a clear agreement on what should be done with this group that has been sent to Jericho. Only those who were imprisoned for civilian crimes such as those who killed persons for nonpolitical reasons, drug smugglers, and thieves should be handed over to the PNA, which in turn will either keep them in prison or release them. Whatever the category under which they fall, they remain within the jurisdiction of the PNA in Gaza and Jericho until this authority starts exercising Palestinian authority throughout the West Bank. This will take three months at the most. As for the other political detainees, they should immediately be released in the West bank and Gaza and they should return home. If the Israeli authorities prevent them from enjoying their right to return to their homes, this will constitute a violation of the agreement. We communicated this to the Israeli delegation which was present at the donor countries conference here in Paris. General Rotschild promised to solve this problem within 48 hours. [passage omitted] [Salamah] Dr. Sha'th, as part of the Israeli attempt to judaize Jerusalem, the Israeli government says it is determined to move the Palestinian national institutions from Jerusalem to the autonomy areas. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin recently said that this has been agreed upon with the PLO and it is mentioned in the Oslo agreement. What is the truth about this point? [Sha'th] The Declaration of Principles [DOP] and the Gaza- Jericho agreement clearly mention that only the institutions whose activity is restricted to Jericho and Gaza should be in Gaza and Jericho. But, all the Palestinian institutions which serve the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Jerusalem remain where they are. The Arab institutions in Jerusalem were there before the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and they will continue their activities after the PNA extends its jurisdiction beyond Gaza and Jericho. The agreement that was signed in Washington says that within a period of nine months from the date of the conclusion of that agreement -- that is on 13 July -- the PNA must extend its authority over all the West Bank. Any postponement of the discussion of the final status of Jerusalem does not affect the Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem. I believe that the paper that was signed by Foreign Minister Peres and sent to late Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst is very explicit. The Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem will remain there. These institutions began their activities during the Likud and Shamir's rule. They precede the Labor Party's government and the agreement we signed. These institutions should remain to serve the Palestinian people in Jerusalem and the other areas of the Palestinian territories. They have nothing to do with the Gaza-Jericho agreement. When we discuss the final status of Jerusalem, the explicit Palestinian stand will emphasize that Jerusalem is a city that was occupied in 1967 and should be liberated when a definitive solution is reached so that it may be the Palestinian capital of the independent Palestinian state. This is very clear and represents the sound implementation of UN Security Council resolution 242 and the DOP. [passage omitted]
