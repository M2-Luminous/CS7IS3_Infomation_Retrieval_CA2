Maastricht was already a wakeup call for nearly half the French people; many others voted in favor of the treaty not out of the conviction that it was a good one, but because they were reluctant to delay what was described as a step toward building a united Europe. Maastricht has since died--not, unfortunately, in terms of its practical consequences, each of which is more loathsome than the next, but in the minds of virtually the entire French population. The European elections will at least partly shape the fate of the European Union for the next five years. The French must take advantage of the opportunity to rise up together and deliver a resounding "no" to the current Europe of confusion, abandoned principles, incompetence, and absurdity. How can Europe get along as Twelve--soon to be sixteen--after the curious about-face of the French president in Vienna a few months ago? In Austria Mitterrand abandoned the notion of deepening the Community and revamping its institutions before widening it. Meanwhile, the Twelve still do not know what sort of common future they would like to have. How can a family, company, association, political party, or church establish itself before it has ensured that its members adhere to a certain number of shared goals? What is the joint position of the Twelve with respect to the United States of America or Japan on foreign--or more important--trade policy? What is its shared vision of European monetary or social policy, from which Great Britain and Denmark have been allowed to withdraw? What is the Twelve's common assessment of the Community's institutions, executive branch (legally, the Council of Ministers; actually the Commission, or more accurately the technocrats that sit on it), legislature, powers, and sense of responsibilities? What attitude do the Twelve share on the serious problem of the need for equality among the four biggest countries, Germany, France, Great Britain, and Italy? The French head of state abandoned this principle of equal weight--to Germany's benefit--during discussion of the Maastricht treaty, first when determining future European monetary institutions, then the composition of the European Parliament. The European Commission has just negotiated with Japan's MITI [Ministry of International Trade and Industry] the implementation--beginning in 1994--of the 31 July 1991 agreement on the sale of Japanese cars in the EC. It is just one of many examples that could be cited. I protested this accord as soon as it was signed on 31 July 1991. I underscored the responsibility of its negotiators--notably Mr. Mitterrand and European Affairs Minister Elisabeth Guigou--for the inevitable rise in unemployment and deterioration in living standards that would result. The agreement was drafted by the president of the European Commission, Mr. Delors, and the commissioner concerned, Mr. Bangemann. Unfortunately, everything is happening just as I predicted. Year after year, the terms of the accord are flouted; Japan is not shouldering its fair share of the slump in the European market relative to the Commission's original, too-rosy predictions; cars produced in Japanese factories in Europe are not counted in the official total of Japanese sales in the European Union; and the Japanese market is still virtually closed to European car exports. The False God of Monetary Management Despite the best efforts of the present government, particularly Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, the Socialist government got off to too bad a start in Paris and Brussels for any easy fixes. All we can do now is challenge the present Europe of abandoned principles, and define at last a common trade policy based on reciprocity rather than wide-eyed free-tradism. Europe practices free trade, while the United States of America in recent times--and Japan for as long as anyone can remember--merely talk about it, while scrupulously rejecting it in practice. Automobiles can travel freely on public roads, but traffic is organized through systems of right-of-way and stoplights. Why not apply a modicum of rationality to international trade, which, while free, would be based on reciprocal and symmetrical rights and responsibilities for all parties involved? Monetary management is the last of the false gods: though the practical and psychological consequences of joblessness can tear a society apart, the extent of unemployment in France and Europe alike is underestimated. For advocates of monetary policy, the only thing that counts is a rising or falling money supply, "M3" in specialists' jargon. And when the money supply does not evolve as expected--that is, when it does not expand enough to meet objectives--it is interpreted in ways that defy common sense to justify a restrictive monetary policy. The Maastricht-stipulated independence of the Bank of France, which even authorities are beginning to realize is noxious, has been another damper on hopes for an economic recovery in France. What kind of an orchestra would have one conductor for the brass section and another for strings? What kind of soccer team would have one tactical coach for forwards and another for defense? The previous government debased itself when it abandoned some of its prerogatives together with its legitimate responsibilities. As for the Bank of France, it tails after Germany's Bundesbank like a puppy, despite the fact that the economic situations of Germany and France require different monetary policies. In other words, our monetary policy is no longer either European or French, but purely a product of Germany's. A String of Concessions Mitterrand takes great delight in talking about our social safety net, at the risk of sowing dissension and disorder in French society. But the role of a president of the Republic is to bring parties together, not divide them. How can Mitterrand imagine for one second that we will be able to maintain the current standard of living in France and the EC, when he has conceded one principle after another in building Europe, and has failed to extract a real, jointly-defined trade policy from some of our partners? Without monetary and social safeguards, competition between the developing countries of southeast Asia, including the highly managed economy of Japan, and European countries more attentive to the fate of individuals, that is, to their real social responsibilities, can only lead to increased unemployment and a drop in European living standards. If, as Mitterand claims, we need to define a social policy for Europe, we must first found it on a policy that protects Europe's economic and trade interests vis-a-vis the rest of the world. Staunch European though I am, Europe in its present form must be rejected. And if France truly cannot persuade its partners to construct a real Europe within the current framework, better to abandon what will have been only a dream before it becomes a nightmare. We will then have to rebuild our country's future in Europe in a precise, courageous, competent, and logical fashion, with whatever partners choose to join us.
