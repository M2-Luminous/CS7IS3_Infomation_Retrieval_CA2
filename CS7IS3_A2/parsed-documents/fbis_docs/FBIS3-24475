From a tectonic standpoint, the new deposits are all part of the Kum upheaval zone. Commercial oil deposits have been discovered in the sediments of the Lower Triassic Kum suite. The newly discovered oils were characterized as light, high-viscosity, high-congealing, low-sulfur, high-paraffin oils. The Nazakukhskaya oil was determined to be resinous and to have a higher coking capacity than the Kulinskaya or Rifovaya oils. Its yield of gasoline fractions up to 200�C is low (12.7 to 16.9 weight percent), and its yield of light fractions at temperatures up to 350�C ranges from 37.3 to 44.8 weight percent. The new oils' 120-230�C fractions fail to meet the requirements stipulated in State Standard [GOST] 10227-86 for jet fuels for a number of reasons, including density at 20�C, viscosity at 20�C (with the exception of the Kulinskaya oil), temperature of onset of crystallization, flash point, and acidity. Their sulfur and aromatic contents are quite acceptable from a jet fuel standpoint, however. The heavy kerosene fractions (150-280�C) of the Nazakukhskaya and Kulinskaya oils meet the requirements set in branch standard OST 3801407-80 for type KO-20 burning kerosene; the Rifovaya oil is too acidic but may be used after being made more alkaline. The diesel fractions (140-320�C) of the Nazakukhskaya and Kulinskaya oils meet the requirements set in GOST 305-82 for L-0.2-40 summer diesel fuel in all respects expect for viscosity at 20�C. Rifovaya oil meets the said requirements in all ways except for viscosity at 20�C and flash point. The 180-350 and 200-320�C fractions of Nazakukhskaya oil are a good raw material for producing L-0.2-40 low-sulfur, low-congealing diesel fuel. All of the diesel fractions have a high cetane rating (58-69) thanks to their elevated n-alkane content, and the 200-320�C fraction appears to be a good raw material for producing liquid paraffins thanks to its high n-alkane content (27-47 weight percent). As a raw material for catalytic cracking, the 350-450�C fractions are characterized by a low sulfur content (0.05-0.11 weight percent) and low coking capacity (0.15-0.38 weight percent) and by a virtual absence of metals. The new oils have also been deemed valuable raw materials for obtaining base-stock oils and solid paraffins with high indicators. In accordance with branch standard OST 38.011.97-80, the three new oils have all been given the identical index 1.3.3.1.3. Figure 1, tables 4.
