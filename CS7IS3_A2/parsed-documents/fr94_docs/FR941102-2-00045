This program has ended. (Libby Pemberton) EPA has denied a specific exemption request from the: 1. Georgia Department of Agriculture for the use of Pirate insecticide on cotton to control the sweet potato whitefly. A notice of receipt published in the Federal Register of June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32207). The exemption was denied because the proposed use poses a risk of unreasonable adverse effects on nontarget birds and aquatic organisms, including endangered species.
