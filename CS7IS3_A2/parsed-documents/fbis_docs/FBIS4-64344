Does this still make sense? [Nehm] We are currently investigating the cases of some 800 "Western German" suspects. This is not just a matter of criminal investigations, but we also have to be aware that spies who have not yet been unmasked can easily be blackmailed by foreign intelligence services, especially in the long run. We have to prevent them from becoming spies again. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Are you still investigating the case of Karl Wienand, former group manager of the Social Democratic Party of Germany? [Nehm] With the investigations now mostly completed, we will decide in the near future whether we will have to bring charges against him. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Following events in Bad Kleinen, do you fear fresh terror attacks by the RAF [Red Army Faction]? [Nehm] At the moment there are intense discussions going on within the RAF on whether they should change their objectives and renounce violence. If the "hardliners" get their way over the next few weeks, attacks cannot be ruled out. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you have any hot leads in the arson attack on the Luebeck synagogue? [Nehm] We are currently investigating some 250 leads. If we persevere, I expect that we will be able to clarify the matter and bring those guilty of the Luebeck attack to trial. [BILD AM SONNTAG] More severe laws are frequently being called for, both for political extremism and for ordinary crimes. Do we need these? [Nehm] In some fields we would need clearer laws rather than more severe ones -- laws that the judiciary can handle more easily. Let me give you an example from the narcotics law. In this context it is important whether a suspect possesses a "larger amount" of drugs. The practical interpretion of this term inevitably causes problems. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you want to allow this "great bugging campaign" so that the police can listen in to new crimes being discussed? [Nehm] That is a matter on which the politicians will have to decide. People tend to expect too much from the great bugging campaign. The chances of success are frequently overestimated. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Many people feel that they are no longer safe in this country. Especially in the cities, many old people and women no longer dare go out at night. Burglaries and thefts are hardly ever solved.... [Nehm] You have to differentiate between the number of crimes actually committed and the rather subjective feeling of safety. Of course, it is bad if there is a general feeling of threat. The police have to counteract this by showing their presence. They have to be more visible in public. There should, for instance, be more police patrols on foot. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Does this mean more policemen? [Nehm] It is not necessarily the number that counts, but their training. Also, routine and administrative jobs must be taken away from the police. But the citizens must also do their share. Many burglaries could be prevented if apartments were better protected. People should carefully list and photograph valuable items to make searching for stolen goods easier for the police. I am in favor of establishing a criminal proceedings register. Every criminal offense would have to be listed centrally, and we would no longer investigate each individual burglary by itself, but we would see whether there is a series of offences and whether suspects are operating on a supra-regional basis. This would make criminal investigations much more efficient. [BILD AM SONNTAG] What do you think of the suggestion of using the Bundeswehr for internal security? [Nehm] This is not possible under existing laws. But I do not see any danger to the existence and security of the FRG that would make an amendment to the constitution necessary. Crime prevention does not require this either. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Should blackmail be a punishable offense for politicians as it is for civil servants? [Nehm] It would make sense if blackmail were punishable in the case of politicians. This would help the population's sense of justice, and also the reputation of parliaments. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Is the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA], your most important investigating authority, fully operational again after the slip-ups of Bad Kleinen? [Nehm] There has certainly been some irritation. The BKA has grown quite fast in terms of staffing. This must necessarily result in problems. I think that the office could be streamlined in many areas. Basically, we have complete trust in the BKA, which is indeed our most important investigating authority. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Before being appointed public prosecutor you were a judge in the 4th Senate at the Federal High Court of Justice. This court is also in charge of the road traffic law, and you are considered an expert in this field. Are you in favor of changing the blood alcohol limit and of a general speed limit? [Nehm] Introducing a 0.5 per mille alcohol limit throughout Germany would have been the right compromise after unification. The higher the alcohol content, the lower the rate of reaction. This has not only been scientifically proven, but it also makes sense to any nonspecialist. That is why I consider the introduction of a 0.5 per mille limit to be necessary and sensible in the interest of all road users. As far as the speed limit is concerned, there is no doubt: A general speed limit would increase the capacity of our roads and make traffic run more smoothly.
