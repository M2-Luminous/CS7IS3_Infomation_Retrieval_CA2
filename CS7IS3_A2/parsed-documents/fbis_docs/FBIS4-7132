FBIS4-7132 "dreas082_c_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 North Korea Anniversary of Pyongyang Declaration Marked Anniversary of Pyongyang Declaration Marked NODONG SINMUN Comments SK2204110794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1055 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204110794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- The Korean people extend militant greetings and solidarity to all the revolutionary people of the world, renewing their revolutionary resolution to steadily defend the cause of socialism, the human cause of independence, from the counterrevolutionary offensive of the international reactionaries, develop it and remain loyal to it, on the lapse of two years since the historical Pyongyang declaration "Let Us Defend and Advance the Cause of Socialism" was published on April 20, 1992, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed article today. The article notes: The Pyongyang declaration was signed by 70 political parties of the world at the time of its adoption but, in two years, the number of the signers has reached 213. As this figure shows, the declaration has evoked warm support and deep sympathy among the world's revolutionary people to be accepted as an action programme for the cause of socialism, the human cause of independence. Touching on its great attraction and invincible vitality, the paper says: A dynamic movement is going on in all parts of the world at present to defend and advance the cause of socialism in the spirit and idea of the Pyongyang declaration. The propaganda of the imperialists and bourgeois restorationists about the mistaken socialist idea and "collapse" of socialism is a sheer sophism and it is nothing but a trick to embellish reactionary capitalism which has no future and maintain the old order of domination and subjugation. It is not socialism but imperialism and revived capitalism which are nearing their downfall in a grave crisis. As socialism has to cover an untrodden path hewn by mankind, there may be turns and twists and trials in the course of its advancement, but it is a historical necessity that it emerges victorious for its truth, validity and vitality. The victory of the cause of socialism can not be expected without a common struggle of the world's revolutionary people. What is important here is that the revolutionary parties and people should keep to independence and strengthen the driving forces. As socialism is pioneered and built by the national state as a unit, the cause of socialism in each country should be undertaken and carried out by its party and people, being the masters of it. To keep faith in and principle of socialism is an essential condition and an important guarantee for defending and developing the cause of socialism. Today when the international reactionaries are challenging socialism with an allied force, it is more necessary for all the forces aspiring after socialism to firmly unite and cooperate with each other. The Korean people will fight vehemently to smash the anti- socialist offensive of the international reactionary forces and achieve the progress and final victory of the cause of socialism, in close solidarity with the world's revolutionary people.
