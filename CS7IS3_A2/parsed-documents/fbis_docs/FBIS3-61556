Some of the main problems are the high activity of the working solutions, and the possibility of the formation of a second organic phase during extraction reprocessing due to the high concentrations of plutonium against a background of significant quantities of uranyl nitrate. A previously presented process is unique in that it combines uranium-plutonium extraction at a high temperature (55ï¿½ C) and up to 2 grams/liter and 20 mg/liter, respectively, of uranium and plutonium throw off. Full saturation of the extractant and a high temperature provide high efficiency in separation from splintered elements. However, the process was presented as a general plan only and a technological layout and working conditions are lacking. In the present work results are presented on the mathematical modeling of a single cycle scheme for extraction refining of spent nuclear fuel from fast neutron reactors with simultaneous extraction of uranium and plutonium at high temperature. An optimum configuration with stable operating conditions was found. The possibility of automating the process was demonstrated. Figure 1; references 5: 2 Russian, 3 Western.
