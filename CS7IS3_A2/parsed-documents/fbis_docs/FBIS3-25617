Most of the injured had been struck with pangas (machetes) or sticks, they said. After its first peaceful night this week, Kigali was "halfway back to normal," residents said, as traffic picked up, stores reopened and people gradually went back to work. The unrest delayed yet again the swearing-in of a new transitional government in which former rebels of the largely Tutsi Patriotic Front are to have portfolios. Several political parties boycotted the ceremony scheduled for Wednesday, complaining that President Juvenal Habyarimana had been arbitrary in his choice of ministers. Public Works Minister Felicien Gatabazi was gunned down here on Monday. An angry mob in his home district of Butare in the south lynched fellow Hutu Martin Bucyana the next day, blaming the hardline politician's movement for the minister's assassination.
