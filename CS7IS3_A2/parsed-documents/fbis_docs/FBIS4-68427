Processes are manageable, but we are still a long way from complete stabilization," Minister of State Givi Lominadze said recently at a session of Parliament; he is chairman of the Temporary Committee on Emergency Situations in Georgia's Western Zone. And no wonder: as long as the front line runs along the Inguri, the process of reconciliation of supporters of the former government has not been completed (by no means have all the opponents of the present government extended the hand of friendship to us), and they have yet to be disarmed, it's still a long way to complete calm. Recently the Georgian Parliament's Juridical Commission and the Justice Ministry drafted a statute "On Temporary Commissions for the Reconciliation of Supporters of the Government of the Ex-President, Attached to Local Administrative Bodies in the Emergency Situation Zone of Western Georgia," stipulating the creation, organization, and operational procedures and jurisdiction of the Reconciliation Commission (that is what it is called for short). As we know, Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze last year, in October, called upon all fighters in the Gamsakhurdia-Kobalia ranks to turn in their weapons and give themselves up. At the same time, a guarantee of immunity was given to anyone who had not committed a grave crime. The task of studying the cases of those who turned themselves in was turned over to the Procuracy. Why, then, has it become necessary to set up reconciliation commissions? We asked Givi Lominadze to answer this question and explain the statute. Districts of Mingrelia, unfortunately, are suffering from an information famine. Owing to the particular urgency of this article, therefore, we asked Communications Minister Pridon Indzhia to do everything possible to see that this edition makes it into Mingrelia. "When chaos reigns in the country," Batoni Givi said, "when illegal armed units are roaming in rather large areas--and not just units but criminal armed gangs which, by their treacherous actions, basically caused the loss of the war in Abkhazia--at a time when weapons and medicine were supposed to be sent to the front but never got there, and a hostile force was formed in our rear and not only betrayed us but worked in harmony with the enemy, openly joined forces with outside mercenaries and Abkhazian separatists, and almost got as far as Kutaisi, the government had no choice but to use force. The government was also aware that those forces also included numerous persons who had gone astray and lost their way. This is what impelled the Head of State to make his appeal, in which he showed clearly that the government was not interested in reprisals. The Procuracy's agencies would run a check of all adversaries who had turned in their weapons voluntarily, and anyone not guilty of war crimes, anyone who had made a mistake and been deceived, would be granted clemency by the Georgian government and Eduard Shevardnadze personally as the Head of State, in accordance with legislation in force; such persons would be treated humanely and helped to return to their homes in safety. Many heeded this call, many didn't. There was some misunderstanding in the law enforcement agencies as well. Persons who came over to the present government's side were supposed to be investigated only by the Procuracy's agencies, yet that work was undertaken by the Internal Affairs Ministry and the Security Ministry, structures of the Defense Ministry, and a number of officials having the right qualifications but not the jurisdiction; this resulted in provocative rumors as well as unlawful actions on the part of some law enforcement structures and, in many cases, specific subjects. This is what necessitated the creation of an institution designed to detect organized groups and armed formations supporting the ex-president in the emergency zones of western Georgia, as well as persons acting against the Georgian government in other ways, and examine their actions in a collegial manner, taking account of public opinion. "Let me say also that any affirmative decision by the Commission does not have the force of law; it is not the final authority in the matter. It is supposed to study public opinion in particular rayons and cities, relay it to Procuracy agencies, and they, in turn, are to take account of it in making their decision, if the investigation has not revealed any grave crime committed by the specific person. The reconciliation commissions are set up under regional and rayon-level administrative bodies in western Georgia's emergency zone. [Lordkipanidze] Who are the members of the commissions? [Lominadze] Officials of regional (rayon-level) administrative bodies, members of Parliament elected from the relevant electoral districts, deputies to the local agencies of authority, and representatives of the public--all with an equal vote, of course. [Lordkipanidze] Could you say a couple of words about the rights and duties of the Reconciliation Commission? [Lominadze] To coordinate the activity of law enforcement and other state and civic bodies to detect and reconcile persons, groups of persons, and armed units in opposition to the government of Georgia, if, as I mentioned, they have not committed a grave crime; within its jurisdiction, to coordinate the activity of local law enforcement agencies in order to prevent the punishment of persons who oppose the government but have not committed a grave crime, who have turned in their weapons and ammunition, and have sincerely repented of their actions; to create all the conditions necessary to see that such persons are returned to their place of work and residence; to give them guarantees of a peaceful life; and many other things.... [Lordkipanidze] What are the procedures of the Commission's work? [Lominadze] Basically it will work on the basis of citizens' individual or group statements, also petitions coming in from enterprises, organizations, and establishments, and representations from law enforcement agencies. The materials are to be examined in 10 days and a well-motivated decision made. [Lordkipanidze] What happens if it is found that the actions of a person or group of persons are criminal? [Lominadze] The material is turned over to investigative agencies. [Lordkipanidze] Is it possible to appeal a decision of the Reconciliation Commission or an action taken by it in connection with the examination of a case? [Lominadze] It can be done in the Temporary Committee of the Emergency Zone, which has the right to overturn the Commission's decision. [Lordkipanidze] I understand that such commissions have been set up under all the city and rayon administrations in the emergency zone. When are they to take action on the statute? [Lominadze] The statute has been sent out and has been in force since 10 March. [end of Q and A] One more cause for hope on the way to stabilization, perhaps not in vain.
