The "decision by the U.S. President is one of the consequences of our own decision (to extend a moratorium on French testing)," the spokesman said. "We are happy to see that this decision is confirmed." "All this moves in a desirable direction at a time when we are preparing to discuss the extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1995 and when we have begun talks in Geneva on banning nuclear weapons," the source said. The current U.S. moratorium was to run out at the end of this September.
