Taking part in it were Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of the FCS, and Yuriy Baturin, assistant to the president of the Russian Federation for national security. Henceforth the FCS, in terms of both its structure and its purpose, will be a special service which will in no way mirror the former Ministry of Security. In Sergey Stepashin's opinion, "all prerequisites for the revival of political surveillance have been destroyed." The new service is intended only to expose and terminate operations by foreign special services against the Russian Federation and "to acquire information about threats to our country's security." It is also tasked with waging a struggle against terrorism, the imports of weapons and drugs, and the struggle against illegal armed formations. Despite the fact that the Border Guard Troops have evolved into an autonomous service, the FCS will continue to provide counterintelligence backup for the effective protection of Russia's state borders. Although the FCS is the successor of the former Ministry of Security, it will henceforth be subordinate only to the president. The service has parted with its Investigations Directorate, having transferred its establishment to the General Prosecutor's Office. And the notorious Lefortovo prison has been transferred to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. Nonetheless, the former Ministry of Security's operational and technical services remain under the FCS. The question about transferring the "Alpha" and "Vimpel" special subunits to the FCS has not been raised yet. According to Stepashin, the FCS's creation became necessary in light of the growing corruption within power structures, the stepped up activity of foreign special services from both nearby and distant foreign countries, and the attempts to recruit state apparatus officials. Last year alone, 20 persons were sentenced for espionage against Russia. The press conference participants also dwelled on the problems of social protection for FCS military personnel. Former Ministry of Security staffers who have failed the certification process can either transfer to other state structures or take retirement with all statutory benefits. Cutbacks in the FCS's numerical strength have affected primarily the central apparatus. Whereas the service as a whole will be 46 percent smaller than the former Russian Federation Ministry of Security, the center will employ only 1,500 instead of 3,500 staffers. Cutbacks apply primarily to backup and management structures, rather than to operational structures.
