FBIS4-1271 "drafr080_e_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia ECOMOG: Po River Bridge Not Under ULIMO Control ECOMOG: Po River Bridge Not Under ULIMO Control AB2604110994 Monrovia Radio ELBC in English 0900 GMT 26 Apr 94 AB2604110994 Monrovia Radio ELBC English BFN [Text] The attention of the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] High Command has been drawn to a front-page publication of the 25 April edition of the INQUIRER newspaper, reporting that ULIMO fighters loyal to General Roosevelt Johnson have taken over the Po River Bridge. ECOMOG says the publication was not only false but also misleading and is capable of causing panic and giving the general public a wrong impression of the [word indistinct] situation at Po River Bridge. According to the release, ECOMOG has been in control of the Po River Bridge and is still in proper control of it. It is obvious therefore that the INQUIRER reporter was not physically present at the bridge to ascertain the full position of things there. Also on the observation of the ECOMOG High Command was a BBC Focus on Africa news item aired recently, which alleged that an ECOMOG tank was hit by a ULIMO RPG. The release also noted that none of ECOMOG vehicles was hit by a shot from an RPG and is therefore reiterating the need for constant consultation from ECOMOG High Command on matters affecting its operations, especially at this stage of the Liberian peace process.
