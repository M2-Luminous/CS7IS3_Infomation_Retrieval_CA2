In a letter addressed to his Belgian counterpart, Willy Claes, the Rwandan foreign minister states that elements of the Belgian military contingent are actively taking part in the Rwanda Patriotic Front offensive, using the equipment which was supposedly destined for the evacuation of Belgian nationals. The Rwandan foreign minister also writes that his government has information at its disposal which proves that the RPF is receiving similar support from the Belgian Blue Helmets in UNAMIR [United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda]. The Rwandan foreign minister also raised the issue of the stringently anti-Belgian broadcasts of RTLM -- Radio Mille Collines. The Rwandan minister writes that the burgeoning of the democratic process in Rwanda was accompanied by the birth of private media organizations, which by definition are beyond the government's control. This reality is as much a fact in Rwanda as it is in Belgium, he writes, adding that the Belgian Government is quite free to intervene on Radio des Mille Collines, either by issuing denials or by making use of its right of reply, end quote.
