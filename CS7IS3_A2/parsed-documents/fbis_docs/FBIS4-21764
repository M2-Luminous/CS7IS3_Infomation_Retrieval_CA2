'Abd-al-Hafiz 'Abd-al-Na'im, 35, died on the way to hospital. The officials said the outlawed Moslem fundamentalist organisation al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) suspected 'Abd-al-Na'im of informing police about its operations. 'Abd-al-Na'im's death raised to 53 the number of civilians killed since Islamic militants launched their violent anti-government campaign two years ago. The campaign has claimed a total of more than 300 lives.
