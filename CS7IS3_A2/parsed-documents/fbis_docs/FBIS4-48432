Both sides and Aldo Ajello, UN secretary general special representative in Mozambique, have already signed the scheme. The document has already been referred six times to the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] for ratification, but Renamo refuses to sign it, citing its war crippled as the reason. It is a document in terms of which the international community assists in the reintegration of demobilized troops. At the 5 May session of the CSC, Renamo specifically linked the ratification of the document to the solution of its war crippled. The government's position on this issue is that Renamo's crippled will eventually have to find a solution with the support of the international community, though the problem should not prevent the ratification of the general scheme for demobilized troops which has already been approved. A Renamo source says Afonso Dhlakama's movement wants its crippled to be covered by the country's pension scheme. The problem is that the pension scheme operates on the basis of deductions from the salaries of civil servants and soldiers. That makes it impossible to apply the scheme to the crippled. The government argues that it is necessary to discuss and find a solution other than the pension scheme "because it completely violates the legal standing of how a pension scheme operates." The government also argues that the problem of the crippled is not included in the document dealing with assistance to demobilized troops, which is largely financed by the international community and was approved at a Core meeting. Renamo, the government, and the UN Operations in Mozambique attended the meeting and signed the document. [passage omitted]
