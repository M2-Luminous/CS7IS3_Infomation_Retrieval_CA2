Israel will propose that, in the future, the Palestinians make monthly payments of approximately 6-8 million shekels for their electricity consumption, and if they should be unable to pay, the sums will be deducted from other budgets earmarked for the autonomy. In the wake of this decision, the Electricity Corporation has announced that it will not disconnect the power supply to the Gaza Strip as planned. This was reported by our correspondents Shlomo Raz and Shulamit Schmerling. Under the Israel-PLO agreement, the Gaza Strip is to receive electricity from Israel on an economic-commercial basis whose details will be finalized in negotiations.
