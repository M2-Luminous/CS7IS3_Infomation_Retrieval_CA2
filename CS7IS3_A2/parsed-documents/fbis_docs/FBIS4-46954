This is happening under conditions where the development of the CIS is being determined by two trends. On the one hand the continued formation of national statehood is taking place, on the other, a trend toward the integration of the CIS countries is being observed. The CIS, as an interstate association, is performing a positive role in the legal structuring of the interstate relations of its constituent countries. CIS potential is not exhausted. Nonetheless, the structure of CIS organs that exists at the present time is preventing the realization to the full extent of the available integration potential. Not only the leaders of the CIS countries, but also a large part of the population of these states are calling attention to this. The experience of CIS functioning in past years shows the need for a transition to a new level of integration that would guarantee observance of the jointly adopted commitments by all the participating states. International practice shows that any interstate association goes through different stages in its development and is supplemented by new forms of cooperation. The CIS has appreciable advantages--the high degree of integration of the economy and similar sociopolitical structures and mentality of the population and also the multinational composition of the majority of the republics and common historical traditions. All this testifies to the need for a combination of the process of national-state building and the preservation and development on this basis of interstate integration processes. The logic of history is such that integration in the world community is possible only by the joint efforts of all CIS countries taking advantage of the powerful integration potential that has taken shape over decades. The actual conditions show that while perfecting the mechanisms of the CIS, we should not regard it as the sole form of association. As practice has shown, the further development of the CIS countries is being held back by the insufficiency of the intrinsic potential of each of them. The development of the latter is possible only with the economic integration of the countries of the post-Soviet space on a new, market basis. The inherited structures of the single national economic complex are continuing to corrode. Outmoded forms of economic relations are objectively dying away. At the same time perfected production engineering relations corresponding to the economic interests of our countries in the near and distant future are being disrupted. Market reformations have universal regularities. No country can ignore them without succumbing here to economic romanticism. It would be expedient to combine the efforts geared to market reform of the economies of the countries of the former USSR on the basis of the close business relations that have already taken shape over the course of decades. As world practice shows, only with collective efforts are transitional societies in a position to undertake successful modernization. At the same time, on the other hand, we see that the continuing attempts to tackle this task by individual countries of the CIS alone are, as before, proving unsuccessful. They will remain such until the realization of economic integration on new conditions. On the other hand, the unrealistic nature of the attempts at a reorientation toward some regional economic associations in the far abroad is obvious. The lack of coordination in price policy in respect to exported raw material, which is having a negative effect on the states' economic position, has become a serious problem for them. On the other hand, this is introducing an element of instability to the settled world economic relations and forcing third countries to adopt strict sanctions. Exports of raw material and energy resources are our states' most important revenue item. There is an urgent need in this connection for a unified export policy system within the CIS countries in the interest of all the participants with the adoption of serious measures in the event of some country's failure to observe the quotas and prices agreed upon. An important component of the successful implementation of market reforms is an improvement in the national legislative bodies of the CIS countries. Further modernization is impossible without the rapprochement of the legislative foundations of economic activity, inasmuch as the current differences between them are becoming a serious obstacle to integrative processes in the economy. Considering the differences among the countries in levels of development of the market economy and the democratization of political processes, we propose the formation of an additional integration structure--a Eurasian Union--in harmony with the activity of the CIS. Account is taken here of the polyvariant nature of the integration and the different pace and the heterogeneousness and varying vectors in the development of the CIS states. This is reason to speak of the urgent need for the formation of a new economic order in the CIS. The purpose is the harmonization of economic policy and the adoption of joint programs of economic reforms binding on the participating states. The socioeconomic and political crisis is occurring against the background of the multinational composition of the population of practically all the CIS states. As a consequence, interethnic tension leading not only to intrastate tension but also, in a number of cases, growing into interstate conflicts is on the rise. This situation is undermining the very institution of the CIS. Consequently, it is essential by joint efforts to devise mechanisms for deterring, localizing, and extinguishing various types of conflicts. At the present time all CIS countries are searching for forms of constitutional arrangement appropriate for the internal conditions. But, as practice shows, neither the unitary nor the federative CIS states can be considered completely stable. A solution to the questions of economic integration dictates the need for the creation of political institutions possessing a sufficient volume of authority. They must incorporate within themselves the regulatory functions of states' mutual relations in the economic, political, legal, environmental, cultural, and educational spheres proper. Thus the time has come for the removal of the obstacles to interaction at the highest level and the simultaneous creation of the instruments for this. A process of disintegration in the sphere of science, culture, and education is taking place at this time. The once unified cultural and educational space is becoming disconnected. The claim under these conditions that "science has no borders" is proving to be simply unfounded. Against the background of the intensifying socioeconomic difficulties the drain of specialists from the sphere of science, culture, and education, the decline in intellectual potential, and the fall in the standard and quality of education are increasing. These processes are leading not only to the rupture of the once unified system, but also to isolation from the cultural and scientific achievements of world civilization. At the same time, on the other hand, the aspiration to intensify integration processes in the economy and policy should be based on the preservation and development of a concerted policy in the sphere of culture, education, and science. It is essential to preserve and augment the internationalization of the processes of the acquisition and practical use of new knowledge. The integration of R&D in the S&T sphere has become an inalienable part of the globalization of industrial activity in general. The isolation of the post-Soviet space from the world cultural and scientific community is fraught with the danger of a new stage in the lag of the technological sphere. A key task for the new states is the assurance of territorial integrity and security. At the present time the post-Soviet space is a zone of instability and the combination of various types of conflicts and is also experiencing the impact of centers of tension outside of the CIS. The guarding of the exterior borders and the stabilization of the situation in the conflict regions may be accomplished only by the joint efforts of all the states concerned and requires the concerted approach of the participants to a range of questions of a defense nature. The problem of environmental safety remains one of the most painful and unresolved problems in the CIS countries. The environmental tension has been caused by a number of factors. The consequences of the testing of nuclear weapons and the activity of the nuclear power stations, the contamination of the environment with industrial waste, and the degradation of the natural environment as a result of man's economic activity (the running dry of water basins, deforestation, soil erosion, and so forth) may be attributed to these. These problems are urgent for practically all CIS countries, especially since the main zones of ecological disaster are located in border areas, as a rule. They have been caused by the community of the evolved production engineering base and the methods of economic activity, the basis of which was the extensive focus. Not one of these problems can be resolved today by the independent efforts of one, even the biggest, state. Environmental preservation is a global task requiring large-scale capital investments and a combination of the efforts of all states. The draft of the creation of a new integrative association, provisionally entitled the Eurasian Union, is offered for discussion. Eurasian Union The Eurasian Union is a union of equal independent states that is geared to the realization of the national-state interests of each participant and that has an aggregate integration potential. The Eurasian Union is a form of the integration of sovereign states aimed at a strengthening of stability and security and socioeconomic modernization in the post-Soviet space. Economic interests determine the bases of the convergence of the independent states. The political institutions of the Eurasian Union should adequately reflect these interests and contribute to economic integration. I. Principles of Association The following principles and mechanism for the formation of the Eurasian Union are proposed: national referenda or parliamentary decisions on states' membership in the Eurasian Union; participant signing of a treaty on creation of the Eurasian Union based on principles of equality, noninterference in one another's internal affairs, and respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the sanctity of borders. The treaty shall contain the legal and organizational prerequisites for an extension of integration in the direction of the formation of an economic, currency, and political union; associate membership in the Eurasian Union is not permitted; decisions shall be adopted in the Eurasian Union on the basis of the principle of a necessary majority of four-fifths of the total number of participants. Independent states shall be members of the Eurasian Union given fulfillment of the following preliminary conditions: obligatory observance of adopted interstate agreements; mutual recognition of the evolved state and political institutions of Eurasian Union participants; recognition of territorial integrity and sanctity of borders; renunciation of economic, political, and other forms of pressure in interstate relations; termination of mutual hostilities. New countries shall be admitted to the Eurasian Union following the presentation of expert findings concerning their readiness to join the Eurasian Union by the unanimous vote of all members of the Eurasian Union. The expert findings shall be produced by a body formed on a parity basis by the states that have expressed consent to become members of the Eurasian Union. Eurasian Union states may participate in other integration associations, including the CIS, on the basis of associate or permanent membership, or they may have observer status. Each participant may withdraw from the Eurasian Union, having given the other states advance notice no later than six months prior to the adoption of the decision. The formation of the following supranational bodies is proposed: A Council of Heads of State and Heads of Government of the Eurasian Union--the supreme organ of political leadership of the Eurasian Union. Each participant shall preside in the Eurasian Union for six months at a time in Russian alphabetical order. The supreme consultative-deliberative body is the Eurasian Union Parliament. The parliament shall be formed by way of the delegation of deputies of the parliaments of the participants on the basis of equal representation from each participant or by way of direct elections. Decisions by the Eurasian Union Parliament shall take effect following their ratification by the Eurasian Union state parliaments. The question of ratification must be considered within one month. The main area of Eurasian Union parliamentary activity shall be to coordinate the legislating bodies of the participants to ensure the development of a single economic space and the accomplishment of tasks pertaining to the protection of the social rights and interests of individuals and mutual respect for state sovereignty and the rights of citizens in Eurasian Union states. A common legal base regulating the mutual relations of the economic transactors of the participants shall be created via the Eurasian Union Parliament. A Eurasian Union Foreign Ministers Council for the purpose of the coordination of foreign policy activity. The Eurasian Union Interstate Executive Committee--the permanent executive and control body. The leader of the Executive Committee shall be appointed in turn from representatives of the participants by the heads of state of the Eurasian Union for a time that they determine. The structures of the Executive Committee shall be formed from representatives of all the participants. The Eurasian Union, in the shape of its Executive Committee, should acquire the status of observer in a number of important international organizations. The Eurasian Union Executive Committee Information Bureau. The adoption of a special commitment or law by the participants to prevent unfriendly words about the parties to the treaty that could damage relations between them. An Education, Culture, and Science Council. The shaping of a concerted educational policy and cultural and scientific cooperation and exchange and joint activity in the creation of textbooks and aids. For the more in-depth coordination and efficiency of the activity of the Eurasian Union countries, the creation in each of them of a state committee (ministry) for Eurasian Union affairs would be expedient. At the level of ministers of Eurasian Union countries the holding of regular meetings and consultations on questions of health care, education, labor and employment, the environment, culture, the fight against crime, and so forth. Encouragement of the activity of nongovernment organizations in various spheres of cooperation in accordance with the national legislation of the Eurasian Union participants. The official language of the Eurasian Union, together with the functioning of the national bodies of language legislation, shall be Russian. Citizenship. The unrestricted movement of citizens within the Eurasian Union will require the coordination of external--in relation to third countries--visa policy. Upon a change in the country of residence within the Eurasian Union, an individual shall, if he so wishes, automatically acquire the citizenship of the other country. A city at the intersection of Europe and Asia, Kazan or Samara, for example, could be proposed as the capital of the Eurasian Union. II. The Economy For the purpose of creating a single economic space, it is proposed to form within the framework of the Eurasian Union a number of supranational coordinating structures: a commission for economics under the auspices of the Eurasian Union Council of the Heads of State elaborating the main directions of economic reforms within the framework of the Eurasian Union with regard to the interests of the national states and presenting them for confirmation to the Eurasian Union Council of Heads of State; a commission for raw material resources of Eurasian Union exporting countries for the harmonization and confirmation of prices and quotas for exported raw material resources and energy and the signing of the corresponding interstate agreement. Coordination of policy in the sphere of the mining and sale of gold and other precious metals; a fund for economic and technical cooperation formed from contributions of the Eurasian Union countries. The fund would finance promising, research-intensive economic and S&T programs and assist in the accomplishment of a wide range of tasks, including legal, tax, financial, environmental, and so forth; a commission for interstate financial and industrial groups and joint ventures; an Eurasian Union international investment bank; an Eurasian Union interstate arbitration tribunal for economic matters legally ruling on contentious issues and imposing penal sanctions; a commission for the introduction of a monetary unit of settlement (transferable ruble). III. Science, Culture, Education It is proposed to implement a number of measures to preserve the potential achieved in previous decades and increase integration in this sphere: to create Eurasian Union common research centers for basic research in the sphere of modern learning; to create a Eurasian Union fund for the development of scientific research uniting the research outfits of various countries; to create a committee for relations in the sphere of culture, science, and education under the auspices of the Eurasian Union Council of Heads of Government; IV. Defense The conclusion within the Eurasian Union framework of the following accords is proposed: a treaty on joint actions to strengthen the national armed forces of Eurasian Union members and to protect the exterior borders of the Eurasian Union. The Eurasian Union proposes the creation of a common defense space for the coordination of defense activity: the formation of a collective Eurasian Union peacekeeping force for maintaining stability and extinguishing conflicts in the participating countries and between them. With the consent of Eurasian Union participants, in accordance with international rules of law, the dispatch of the peacekeeping force to conflict zones on the territory of the Eurasian Union; the presentation of a collective appeal of Eurasian Union countries to international organizations, including the UN Security Council, for conferring the status of peacekeeping force on the joint contingent; the creation of an interstate center for problems of nuclear disarmament with the participation of representatives of international organizations. All states of the Eurasian Union, aside from Russia, shall maintain their nuclear-free status. V. The Environment The formation as soon as possible of the following mechanisms is essential: an environment fund under the auspices of the Eurasian Union Council of Heads of State realizing within the framework of the Eurasian Union environmental programs and financed by all the participating states; the coordination of operations with international organizations to reduce the degree of environmental pollution; the adoption of short-term and long-term programs on major problems of environmental restoration and the elimination of the consequences of ecological catastrophes (the Aral, Chernobyl, the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Range); the adoption of a Eurasian Union interstate treaty on the storage of nuclear waste. History is affording us an opportunity to enter the 21st Century by the civilized path. One method, in our view, is the realization of the integration potential of the initiative pertaining to the creation of a Eurasian Union reflecting the objective logic of the development of the post-Soviet space and the will of the peoples of the former USSR to integration.
