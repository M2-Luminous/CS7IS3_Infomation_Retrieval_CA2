At the same time, due to the uncertain domestic situation in Russia, officials in Paks began preparations for the construction of a temporary storage facility, to make sure that there will be no need to stop the power station in case of obstacles in the transportation of spent fuel. Although environmental protection experts in Moscow argue about the agreement to transport the spent fuel rods to Russia, Paks officials hope that the Russian side would abide by the agreement after all. At the same time, Balazs Kovacs, head of the information office of the nuclear power station in Paks, told us that, due to the uncertain situation, they are already prepared for the construction of a temporary storage facility. The fuel rods must be placed to lie dormant for five years in Paks prior to transportation to Russia. If they only keep adding spent fuel to the storage facility, it will become full by 1995, and if there are no other possibilities of storage, the nuclear power station will have to be shut down, a power station which supplies almost half of Hungary's need for electric power. It is not expedient to take such a risk and, therefore, preparations are under way in Paks to build a temporary storage facility. As is well known, the joint English-French consortium Alsthom, a firm that has gained considerable experience in the construction of such facilities, won the right to construct the storage. The necessary environmental study has been done, and its evaluation is currently under way. Power station experts expect an answer in about one month. The technical plans are also being drawn now, but construction has not yet been started because there is no authorization yet. Only the land is being prepared for construction. The experts are also conducting information activity among the people living in 12 settlements around the facility. Several people oppose the storage, and a civil movement against the storage has been formed. However, officials in Paks hope that they will succeed in convincing the opponents of the project that the facility is not dangerous. The hearing of the population is still pending, something required by law; no power station in Hungary can be built without this.
