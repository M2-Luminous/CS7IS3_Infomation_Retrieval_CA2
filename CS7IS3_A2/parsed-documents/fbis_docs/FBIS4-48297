This is the opinion of Conservative Party [CP] and Afrikaner National Front leader Ferdi Hartzenberg. Dr. Hartzenberg said in Pretoria that the role of the CP had not come to an end. In fact, the real struggle for self-determination has only just begun and the CP will have to take the lead in this struggle. Today the Afrikaners are standing where they stood on 31 May 1902, when they were also not represented in Parliament. Within eight years they had attained self-government as a result of work accomplished by parties outside Parliament. A party inside Parliament has only a certain power base, which in some cases can be restrictive. A party's support is measured by the number of votes during the last election. Its power base can therefore not really be expanded since it is pinned down to the representation which it has inside Parliament. An extra-Parliamentary party, on the contrary, is not subject to this limitation. Dr. Hartzenberg added that once again the CP will strive for Afrikaner unity and that it would resume contact with nations that are striving for self-determination. What is important, however, is that the structures of the CP, in view of its new, challenging role, should be brought to preparedness within the shortest possible time. A campaign of reorganization will be initiated, while the CP's Executive Committee will have to discuss certain technical modifications. In this context, Dr. Hartzenberg made a very serious appeal to all CP members to throw in their support to make the party structure more streamlined and effective than ever before.
