This transportation and exchange service was previously certificated on November 15, 1994, under Docket No. CP84&hyph;248&hyph;000 (29 FERC ¶61,184) and, according to Tennessee and Arkla, has been inactive and is no longer necessary. No facilities will be abandoned as a result of the abandonment of this service. Any person desiring to be heard or to make protest with reference to said application should, on or before May 12, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirement of the Commission's Rules or Practices and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file in motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Lois D.
