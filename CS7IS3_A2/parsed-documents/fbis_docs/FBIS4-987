FBIS4-987 "drafr075_d_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique UN's Ajello Unaware $17 Million Earmarked for Fund UN's Ajello Unaware $17 Million Earmarked for Fund MB1504163794 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1030 GMT 15 Apr 94 MB1504163794 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network Portuguese BFN [Text] Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN secretary general in Mozambique, says he was not aware that $17 million had been earmarked for the Trust Fund [preceding two words in English] for political parties, including the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], as was reported in today's NOTICIAS. The newspaper was citing a source from the United Nations in New York. The top UN official in Mozambique said he doubts whether the source can make available $17 million, when [words indistinct] requires such assistance. Ajello said the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] had a draft document drawn up in New York, which has taken into account Unomoz's recommendations in Maputo. Ajello said this document cannot fix the value of the Trust Fund because it is established on the basis of voluntary contributions from donor countries. Aldo Ajello said on the basis of information collected by Unomoz, a minimum amount of $2.8 million has been established for the Trust Fund. The UN representative in Maputo also spoke about the return of the Italian contingent. He said that these troops were expected to return by the end of this month. [Begin Ajello recording, in English fading into Portuguese translation] We expect that this operation will be completed by the end of this month. Regarding the Beira Corridor's security, we are deploying other available forces along the corridor and a new plan has almost been concluded. The withdrawal of the Italian contingent was announced a long time ago, and, unfortunately, it cannot be renegotiated because there is no government in Italy. Thus, the battalion has begun its withdrawal in phases. Ajello said a plan has already been drawn up to face the situation, because the UN Security Council had already requested that the UN reduce its forces in Mozambique. So, it is not the only contingent that will leave Mozambique. Other forces to be withdrawn from Mozambique will be announced in due time. The reduction of military contingents will not, however, affect Unomoz's operational capacity. Some forces will be reduced, but the country will not receive new UN battalions [words indistinct]. [end recording] Regarding the confinement and demobilization of government and Renamo forces, Ajello said the numbers are encouraging. On the government side, only 55 percent of troops have been confined, while Renamo has already confined 80 percent of its troops. The government has, however, promised to confine 100 percent of its troops by next week. Regarding the demobilization process, the opposite is true. The government is demobilizing a greater percentage of troops than Renamo.
