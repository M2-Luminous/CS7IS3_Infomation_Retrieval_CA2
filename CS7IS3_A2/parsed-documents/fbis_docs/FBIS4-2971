Having no power to alter British Government policy, and with no influence over China (except perhaps in provoking further outbursts of venom over British perfidy), the committee has largely confined itself to voicing support for the Governor's political reform proposals. It endorses Chris Patten's handling of the reform package and the thinking behind it - even though it warns that the Government will have to weigh up how far China will be prepared to use economic weapons as a reprisal for democratic changes here and admits that Britain will be powerless to prevent China disbanding the Legislative Council elected in 1995. Given the all-party support the Governor's policies have enjoyed to date, any different conclusion would have been astonishing. The Governor need not fear his stance will be undermined by Parliament in such a public manner, whatever may happen behind the scenes at the Foreign Office. But in areas where it has gone out on a limb, the committee deserves a serious hearing. On matters of citizenship, it recommends that both the wives and widows of ex-servicemen and the non-Chinese ethnic minority population should be given full British citizenship. It also has come out in support of proposals for a statutory Human Rights Commission, despite the negative attitude of the Hong Kong Government, and the Governor's assumption that this would antagonise China. The committee has been more outspoken on China's human rights record than anyone in the British or Hong Kong governments, and is scornful of those who claim to detect "significant progress" on this front. Sadly, the ruling Conservative Party is too bound up in its own internal problems at present to heed the awkward suggestions of an all-party foreign affairs watchdog. Nevertheless, other Members of Parliament will take note. There is still hope the committee's positions will prompt some tough questioning of Government policy in future debates on Hong Kong, immigration and human rights.
