N. Belov, Department of Meteorology and Climatology, Moscow State University; UDC 551.510.42] [Abstract] This article evaluates the concentration of various harmful substances in the air using a trajectory model based on a theoretical model of impurities transfer. Concentrations of impurities were calculated at various distances from Norilsk. Relief, vegetation, snow cover, the season, and meteorological conditions were considered. Tables present concentrations of various harmful substances in Norilsk in adverse meteorological conditions during summer and winter and the maximum one-time and average daily maximum permissible concentrations of these substances and corresponding warning levels. Figure 1; tables 4; references 13 (Russian).
