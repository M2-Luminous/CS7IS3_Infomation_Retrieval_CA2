ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: By this document, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) establishes a new chapter in the Code of Federal Regulations for publication of its rules, regulations, and policy statements. Along with the establishment of the chapter, OFHEO adopts final regulations containing a description of its organization and a description of its seal and logo. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne E. Dewey, General Counsel, Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, 1700 G Street NW, 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20552, (202) 414&hyph;3800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title XIII of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, known as the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, 12 U.S.C. 4501 et seq., established the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) as an independent office within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The primary function of OFHEO is to ensure the financial safety and soundness and the capital adequacy of the nation's two largest housing finance institutions_the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. This document establishes the regulations of OFHEO in title 12, chapter XVII of the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations delineate the origination of OFHEO, the duties and functions of its Director, and the organization and functions of OFHEO's various offices. Regulatory Impact Administrative Procedure Act In acting on the regulations, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight finds that notice and public comment are unnecessary. Section 553(b)(A) of title 5, United States Code, provides that when regulations involve matters of agency organization, procedure or practice, the agency may publish regulations in final form. In addition, OFHEO finds, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d), that a delayed effective date is unnecessary. Accordingly, these regulations are effective upon publication. Regulatory Flexibility Act Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this regulation, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) do not apply. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The final rule applies only to agency internal organization and functions. It will not affect the states, the relationship between the national government and the states, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule will not have federalism implications that warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Executive Order 12606, the Family The final rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and thus, is not subject to review under Executive Order 12606. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review OFHEO has determined that this final rule relating to internal organization is not a regulatory action that is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12866. Paperwork Reduction Act The final rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ).
