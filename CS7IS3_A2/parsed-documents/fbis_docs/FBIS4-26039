From that outstanding premier and foreign minister, Zhou Enlai, and the learned foreign minister, Marshal Chen Yi -- both of the first generation -- to the present moderate and skilled foreign minister, Qian Qichen, whose style embodies a vast country in the international arena. Qian Qichen is not tall or big, but a bit short. He does not look serious, but always has a smile on his face. When attending meetings with leaders and diplomats of American, European, Asian, and African countries, however, he appears outstanding and attractive. In addition to the factor -- as he put it -- "I have a big and powerful China behind me," one very important point for his attractiveness is that his qualities and poise make up his personal charisma. Secret Diplomatic Principle In an interview with TA KUNG PAO, he said: "As foreign minister, it is important for me to reflect the position and principles of my country. If you echo other people's views in everything, you will not be respected. The reason China is thought important by the world is that it has it own views. It is not all right if you play the yes-man in everything and if you do not have your own characteristics or qualities." True, China's many views and positions have been expressed through the important role of the foreign minister. However, when he declares and elaborates on a view, position, or principle -- however strong and solemn it is -- it remains solemn and yet does not give an impression of stiffness or rigidity. What is the reason? The secret principle is that the pleasant and moderately broad smiles on his face makes China's views appear strong inside and soft outside. He also said: The key to some skills is to create -- to the extent possible -- a lively and vivid atmosphere within the scope allowed by the diplomatic field. Do not repeat the same words too many times. There should be some new words and new meanings. The coexistence of principle and flexibility embodied in Qian Qichen not only has enabled China -- despite difficulties in the wake of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and East Europe, and of "4 June" -- to open up the diplomatic field and establish its weight, but also has won Qian himself such titles as "diplomatic ballet star" and "super diplomatic artist" given by Western media. Qian Qichen was born in Tianjin in January 1928. At the age of nine, he and his family moved to Shanghai. He joined the student movement under the CPC's leadership when he was studying at a middle school affiliated to Shanghai's Datong University. As a middle-school student at the age of 14, he joined the CPC. He engaged in underground work under the leadership of Qiao Shi and Wu Xueqian. In 1945, at 17, he assumed a post in Shanghai's DAGONG BAO. DAGONG BAO's managerial department, where he worked, was located on Nanjing Road, near the Bund. It was the busiest district in Shanghai: People came and went; business was very brisk. Using this as a shield, he took part in the underground student movement for the party. The colleagues who worked with him in those days recalled that he was kind and gentle, very capable, easy to talk to, and on very good terms with colleagues, and that he led a thrifty life and wore simple clothes. In a photo album of old DAGONG BAO people, there is a photo of Qian Qichen and several other DAGONG BAO people in a garden. In it, Qian Qichen is wearing a long robe and a scarf; he looks smart. Rigorous Test Since the founding of New China in 1949, he worked for the Youth League at one time. In 1954, he went to study in the former Soviet Union and later went to work in the Foreign Ministry as second secretary at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution, as the vice head of the foreign affairs department of the Ministry of Higher Learning, he was accused of being a "capitalist roader" and was sent to work in the 7 May Cadre School. In 1972, he was transferred to the Soviet Union again as counselor. In 1974, he became ambassador to an African country. In 1977, he frequently appeared in public as the head of the Information Department of the Foreign Ministry and as the Foreign Ministry spokesman. In 1982, he acted as vice minister of the Foreign Ministry. In 1988, he became the seventh foreign minister of new China. At the NPC session in 1991, he was named state councilor and foreign minister. In the 1993 NPC elections, he was named vice premier of the State Council and foreign minister. The shakeup of the socialist camps in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 1989, and the "4 June turmoil" in Beijing cast a dark cloud over China's diplomatic sky. The foreign minister, who had acted in that capacity for only one year, met with a rigorous test. Faced with political isolation and economic sanctions by the major Western powers, he continued his fairly penetrating smiles, skillfully used China's huge market as an attraction, and carried on dialogue with and contested with the Western powers over "human rights" tenaciously and flexibly. Bit by bit, he made them break the barriers -- willingly or unwillingly -- and face the facts. During this period, his diplomatic skills were brought to light and since have attracted worldwide attention. In an article entitled "1993: The World Comes to a New Understanding of China," he wrote: "In disturbances, the true qualities of heroes are demonstrated. Over the past few years, China has withstood the test of changes around the world and has traveled a bumpy road. China has not been overwhelmed; rather, it has become more stable, more developed, and more prosperous. These past two years have been a period in which China's economy has developed most rapidly, and a period of diplomatic expansion and development. Given the continued economic recession of the West, China's large market is becoming a reality. Its great attraction means that no country will give up the opportunity to enter China's market. Facts have proved that there are extensive common interests between China and the West." Basic Qualities A clear and analytical mind, quick and relaxed responses, appropriately tense and relaxed manners in dealings with others -- these are the basic qualities of Qian Qichen, the foreign minister of a large country. With these, he shuttles in the midst of rain and storms, and wages battles of wits. Following the rise and strengthening of China's economy and other aspects, China's diplomacy is no longer Third World diplomacy. China's role as a major diplomatic power already has been established with worldwide recognition. In March and April this year alone, many important heads of state visited China. The U.S. secretary of state, the Japanese prime minister, the Korean president, the French premier, the Portuguese premier, the Australian governor..... The new "China craze" has begun. Naturally, Qian Qichen is extremely busy at home and abroad. The abovementioned visits in March and April by the heads of major countries, plus the visits by the heads of small countries and the foreign ministers of various countries made a very long list. From this, we can imagine how busy Qian Qichen is, but he laughed it off and described in a light way his "activity," which reporters asked about. However, his secretary and the personnel who are around him frequently told the truth. They said that he begins reading a large volume of information at six o'clock in the morning. During the day, he has to receive and meet with guests, hold talks, and have meetings. At night, he has to review and approve documents and revise manuscripts. Even on Sundays, he can hardly rest. He has to read books and do the office work -- or the additional lessons, as he calls them -- he has left undone. Whenever he is out on visits, he always works 18 hours without stop. He works from 0600 through 2400. His secretary, Mr. Lian, said: We all feel very tired! Yet he rises early in the morning feeling refreshed and full of vigor. He is already 66 years old now, and his vigor, enthusiasm, and unusual memory are all admirable. His Hobbies Qian Qichen does not smoke cigarettes or drink. He loves vegetarian food. His biggest hobbies are reading and walking. He has a good command of Russian and English. Outdoor walking, of course, is good for the health, but since he is so busy and has no spare time for walking, he can only use the indoor bicycle in his home for exercise. He considers reading a kind of spiritual walking. He reportedly very much likes reading politics, history, biographies, commentaries on current affairs, and some other essays. As he is so busy with his work, he has had to give up his other hobbies, such as photography, calligraphy, stamp collecting, and swimming. Moreover, Qian Qichen has more concern for and a better understanding of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong issue than ordinary people. This is naturally related to his positions as foreign minister and chairman of the Preliminary Work Committee. Speaking on the Hong Kong issue, he appears to have a good knowledge of many people and things. He appears to have more concern for and a better knowledge of Hong Kong media particularly. He summed up the characteristics of Hong Kong media with rather humorous and popular phrases, making it easy for us to discern his special qualities as one who once worked for the press. Qian Qichen has given us consistently good impressions. His diplomatic capability has been recognized unanimously the world over. His personal character wins good appraisals both at home and abroad. He behaves in a moderate and appropriate manner on diplomatic occasions. He is neither haughty nor humble. Even when dealing with his diplomatic counterparts, he talks cheerfully and calmly, making them convinced. On 29 September 1993, after delivering a general speech in a UN General Assembly debate, the representatives of a dozen countries or more went before the seat of the Chinese representative and shook hands with him and sent him congratulations in violation of the chairman's earlier request that they must not send congratulations in the session hall. On public occasions at home, he appears amiable and kind, and does not put on airs, thus winning the respect of ordinary people from the bottom of their hearts. Last year, this author participated in a celebration to mark the 10th anniversary of the publication of SHIJIE ZHISHI, a magazine run by the foreign ministry. He learned beforehand that Qian Qichen had asked that no gifts or certificates be sent to the celebration. When Qian Qichen arrived, he apologized to the large number of reporters present at the celebration and said smilingly: "Today, I have kept you busy. All I can do is to invite all of you to some tea...." We should know that it was popular to send gifts to news briefings in those days. For this reason, the reporters did not grumble against him, but appraised him in a praising tone. In the NPC elections in 1993, Qian Qichen again was nominated as vice premier and foreign minister, and was elected with the most votes. This became good talk at home and abroad for some time. It is not difficult, therefore, to see on what Qian Qichen relies for the high appraisal and the many votes. Qian Qichen has a happy and harmonious family. He married Zhou Hanqiong on 31 December 1952. They have one son and one daughter. Zhou also works in the Foreign Ministry. Their children are grown up and have their own children, as well. Nothing is more pleasant to Qian Qichen than playing with his grandchildren in his leisure time.
