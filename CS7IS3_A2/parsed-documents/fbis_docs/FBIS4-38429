"It has thereby violated the basic principles of social partnership," Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR], believes. At the same time the leader of Russia's trade unions mentioned the decree "On Measures To Ensure Employment for the Population in the Event of Crisis Situations in the Labor Market in Various Regions of the Russian Federation," the proposed measures to freeze wages, and so forth; these have not been published anywhere, but they have nevertheless been cited in a number of mass media and speeches by officials, including Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan. Shmakov stressed that both the trilateral general agreement between the government, employers, and trade unions and the Treaty on Social Accord envisage preliminary discussions and coordination with trade unions regarding any legislation that affects social and economic issues. This was why the trilateral commission on regulating social and labor relations was established. But this, according to M. Shmakov, has been standing idle recently. Attempts by representatives of trade unions and employers to familiarize themselves with the drafts of these documents have proved unsuccessful. The FITUR leadership believes that the predictions made by opponents of signing the Treaty on Social Accord are being borne out; they warned that "the government will take no account of the `signatories'." In conclusion, M. Shmakov stated that, in the situation as it stands, any discussion by trade unions of documents of a socioeconomic orientation will only be possible once the government has met the following conditions: An increase in the minimum wage to 40,000 rubles and provision of state guarantees that the Law on the Indexation of the Minimum Wage will be implemented.
