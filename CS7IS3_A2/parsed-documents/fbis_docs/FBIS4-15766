In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX, Osmochescu said the two leaders had also dealt with a set of economic and financial problems, such as reviving ties between enterprises in Moldova and Dniester and restoring destroyed communications. Osmochescu said Snegur and Smirnov had agreed that the talks should be based on a report by a mission of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which proposes extensive autonomy for Dniester, implying the separation of powers between central authority in Kishinyov [Chisanau] and the Dniester government, Dniester's exclusive jurisdiction over certain matters and joint jurisdiction over others. The adviser said Snegur and Smirnov had decided that all future negotiations would be mediated by the CSCE mission and Russian representatives. They also agreed that, at the next meeting, Moldova and Dniester should be represented by delegations rather than by their two leaders and that teams of experts should be formed to draw up a package of accords, mainly an agreement on Dniester's legal status. Smirnov congratulated Snegur on the ratification by the Moldovan Parliament of Moldova's membership in the CIS and in the Commonwealth Economic Union, Osmochescu said. IF Note: The ratification was welcomed both by Dniester and by Gagauzia, another independent-minded region in Moldova. Dniester State Secretary Valeriy Litskay told INTERFAX it made possible a new dialogue between Moldova and Dniester, and at a new level too. The leaders of Gagauzia, where the majority of the population speaks Gagauz, a Turkic language, take the same view. According to its president, Stepan Topal, Gagauzia, which unilaterally proclaimed itself a republic, has been pressing for the ratification of Moldova's membership in the CIS and its economic union for the last two years. Topal told INTERFAX he expected the policy of the Agrarian Democratic and Socialist Parties, which the last general elections brought into power, to provide a good basis for resuming Gagauz-Moldovan talks and putting it at a new level. Osmochescu said the meeting between Snegur and Smirnov had been held in "favorable and constructive atmosphere" and had been marked by "both sides' desire to throw off the old burden of mutual resentment and base their decisions on today's reality." The meeting broke the deadlock in the talks between Moldova and Dniester, Osmochescu believes. "Now everything depends on the level of the teams formed to draw up the package of documents. It is important that the people who are included in them should also wish to break the impasse. The delegations appointed by Dniester in the past were doing their best to obstruct the negotiations by casuistical disputes," Osmochescu said. He said the Dniester side agreed that the teams should include new, realistically-minded politicians ready for "reasonable compromise." Provided Dniester was willing to cooperate, the talks could be completed within the next six months, Osmochescu said. "I see two alternative solutions to the problem. The first one is to pass a law on the legal status of Dniester before the Moldovan constitution is adopted. Then the law would be incorporated into the constitution. The other is to formalize a special status for Dniester in the constitution," Osmochescu said, adding that he favored the former option.
