FR940613-0-00008 FR940613-0-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;233&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8929; AD 94&hyph;12&hyph;02] Airworthiness Directives; Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes, that requires an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves, and further inspections and repair, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by a report of delamination between the composite structure and the aluminum foil on the elevator cove on a Model SAAB SF340B series airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent jamming of the aileron or elevator. DATES: Effective July 13, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Saab Aircraft AB, SAAB Aircraft Product Support, S&hyph;581.88, Link√∂ping, Sweden. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Quam, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2145; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5361). That action proposed to require an inspection of the elevator and aileron coves to verify the type of antistatic protection applied to the coves. For coves that are found without conductive paint or expanded aluminum foil, that action proposed to require a detailed visual inspection and delamination tap test to detect aluminum foil delamination on the coves; and either a temporary repair and repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests of the coves, or a permanent repair of the coves. Accomplishment of the permanent repair terminates the repetitive detailed visual inspections and delamination tap tests. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 152 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 20 work hours per airplane to accomplish the inspection, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $167,200, or $1,000 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
