The approval of these taxes and laws complete the package of new fiscal mechanisms proposed by Caldera. Part of these mechanisms had been approved earlier -- a tax on bank debits (0.75 percent) and new laws for the concession of public works and for a budget. Caldera received special powers from Congress approximately one month ago for the implementation of this series of taxes and tax laws. The powers are valid through today and they authorize him to issue a decree approving these laws instead of submitting them for parliamentary discussions. Upon reporting the approval of these new taxes, with which the government expects to overcome this year's fiscal gap -- calculated at approximately $6 billion -- Finance Minister Julio Sosa said the Venezuelan economy is leaning toward stabilization. Sosa also said that the currency could be revalued in about two weeks. The bolivar, whose exchange rate has dropped considerably for a month, has been devalued 30.93 percent, and its parity with the dollar is currently 182 bolivares. Nevertheless, Sosa said that parity could rise to 150 bolivares in approximately 15 days.
