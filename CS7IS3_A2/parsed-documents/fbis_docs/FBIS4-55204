It also became clear why it was so important for the late Jozsef Antall to destroy the Smallholders Party and to separate the national wing from the core of the MDF. National radicalism and national thought suffered a serious defeat because the broad strata of the society voted in favor of the "gulyas communism." Istvan Csurka already saw it in 1992, something that the MDF was still unable to see, namely that Antall's policy aims at breaking the national right wing. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is expected to have such a big number of mandates in the new parliament that it will also be able to legislate the two-thirds majority laws alone and it will not need the SZDSZ as the advanced bastion. If they accept the SZDSZ in the government, they will only do so in order to maintain the appearance of a coalition. They will allow a few liberal victories in some places in individual election districts, but a national party will only be able to make it into Parliament from list elections. The national parties together will not reach the number of votes given to the MSZP. The law on former policemen [active during the repression following the uprising of 1956] came too late, and so did the uncovering of some irregularities by the television; these things could no longer influence the public mood. Power over the press should have been instituted long before the elections, in 1990, and the press has now proved what kind of destruction it is capable of carrying out. With constant pessimistic anti-national manifestations and in the spirit of Aczel's continuity, the press succeeded in contaminating the people's mood with the idea that today it is much worse than it used to be in the old regime, and there is a lot of truth in this. However, in this country, people who are living better are also complaining. The MSZP-government will try to avoid street demonstrations and, therefore, it will consume and distribute the hard currency reserves and will temporarily restore the sham-prosperity of the "gulyas- communism" by carrying out a pseudo improvement in the standard of living, and when it finally destroyed the Hungarian national wing and consolidated its power, the MSZP could also give the impression of democratic elections. Hungary is becoming similar to the South-American countries, and the nomenclature-careerists have taken over the entire economy, they are the big capitalists, they control the press, and now they have also obtained political power. It will be easy for them to put up a show of democratic elections every four years, because they control everything, including the banks, the army, and the police. A few economic trials disguised as criminal trials will come now, with the toughest and most radical opposition members as victims. We can expect the leadership of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] to be among the first victims, but many more people will celebrate the MSZP power in prison. Aware of the results, it is clear that the government has three weeks more to turn something in its favor, and if they fail to do this, the national forces will be left with a single choice in this country, namely the street. Aware of the events, there is only one way of halting the victory of the MSZP, namely if the second round of elections is unsuccessful for them everywhere. Therefore, I call upon the national forces and parties, including the MDF, the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], and the Smallholders Party, to boycott the votes and make a second round impossible. Only people who want the return of the old regime should go to vote in the second round.
