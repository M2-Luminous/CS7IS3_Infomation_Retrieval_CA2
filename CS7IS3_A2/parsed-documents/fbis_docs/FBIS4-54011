FBIS4-54011 "dreas101__a94019" FBIS-EAS-94-101-A Daily Report 16 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Party Officials Interviewed on Political Issues Party Officials Interviewed on Political Issues Mirai Party Head on Party Role OW2105011494 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 16 May 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2105011494 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Interview with New Party Mirai (Future) representative Michihiko Kano by unidentified MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter: place and date not given -- from "Listening Without Reservation" column] [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] You and your colleagues broke away from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Was there not a mistake in the timing of your breakaway from the LDP? [Kano] I believe that we quit the LDP at the right time. We do not repent of our break from the LDP. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Why has your party not joined the new parliamentary group "Kaishin"? [Kano] We do not know at all how or why the parliamentary group was formed. We just quit the LDP when the parliamentary group was formed and we heard nothing from other political parties about forming the parliamentary group. Our party could not draw a conclusion on whether to join the parliamentary group because our party values the process of making decisions through discussion. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What sort of political tactic do you think Prime Minister Hata should adopt? [Kano] In my meeting with Prime Minister Hata, I proposed that parties and parliamentary groups that voted for Mr. Hata in the prime ministerial election at a Diet plenary session assemble to discuss issues, and asked the prime minister to tell the assembly what he thinks. However, the prime minister did not accept my requests. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] With a minority in the Diet, the Hata government is expected to have difficulty implementing policies after a budget bill for fiscal 1994 is enacted in the Diet. What is your opinion? [Kano] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is sharing a common perception with other parties on the nine-point policy agreement. If the Hata government holds talks with the SDPJ to discuss policy matters forthrightly, the SDPJ would understand. If both ruling and opposition parties hold frank debates on how the current tax system should be reformed to turn Japan around, it would be possible to reach an agreement. Both ruling and opposition parties should make concerted efforts to grapple with the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What sort of role does the "New Party Mirai" intend to play in the future? [Kano] As for reforming the current tax system, our party plans to set forth a concrete vision that aims to improve the quality of life for the people through tax system reform. Regarding the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear arms, our party intends to plead with that country to remain a nuclear-free nation. Our party also intends to make efforts to keep that country from being isolated from the rest of the world through diplomatic channels. Our party will advocate the need to keep all of Asia nuclear-free. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are you going to increase your party's membership? [Kano] Now that the Diet has enacted the political reform bill, the next task will be a realignment of the political parties. For our party to function properly in this drastically changing political situation, our party needs to reorganize itself on the basis of policies and political beliefs. Our party should set forth a set of new policies while pushing for reforms. Many people agree with our party's plans. There are many legislators in the LDP with whom I worked for the political reform. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that you and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] representative secretary Ichiro Ozawa are of the same political beliefs? [Kano] I do not know all of what Mr. Ozawa thinks. We do not share the same views on handling the reforms, but we may share views that things must not be deferred until later. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the possibility of dissolving the House of Representatives? [Kano] Our party resolutely opposes holding the next general elections under the current multiseat constituency system. What is important for us at the moment is to move things forward. Why did we spend seven years working for political reform? We should not set back political reform. To keep political reform on track, we have to speedily draft a bill on the demarcation of single-seat constituencies.
