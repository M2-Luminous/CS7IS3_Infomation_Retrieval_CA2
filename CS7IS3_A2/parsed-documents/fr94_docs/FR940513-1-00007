FR940513-1-00007 FR940513-1-00002 Draft Risk Assessment Regarding Cold Treatment This proposal to allow cold treatment of fruit under certain conditions at the port of Wilmington, NC, is based, in part, on a draft document, prepared by APHIS, assessing the pest risks associated with allowing cold treatment of tropical fruit fly host materials at certain United States ports. Some of the risk mitigation measures discussed in the draft are included in this proposal as requirements for the port of Wilmington, NC. Copies of this draft document may be obtained from Mr. Victor Harabin at the address listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Treatment Manual We would revise the PPQ Treatment Manual, which has been incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations at 7 CFR 300.1, to reflect the addition of Wilmington, NC, to the list of ports where cold treatment of imported fruits can be conducted, under certain conditions, upon arrival. Miscellaneous We are also proposing to replace the four cold treatment schedules currently listed in ยง319.56&hyph;2d(a) with a single reference to the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Treatment Manual, which is incorporated by reference at 7 CFR 300.1. The cold treatments listed in the PPQ treatment manual are applicable for any fruit required to be cold treated under ยง319.56&hyph;2d of the regulations. Also as a nonsubstantive editorial change, we are proposing to remove and reserve the regulations under ยง319.56&hyph;2q, regarding conditions governing the entry into the United States of pummelo from Israel, and to add pummelo from Israel to the list, under ยง319.56&hyph;2x, of fruits and vegetables requiring treatment as a condition of entry into the United States. This change would simplify the regulations by placing pummelo from Israel on a list of commodities with similar entry requirements, but would not revise current requirements concerning the entry into the United States of pummelo from Israel. We are also proposing to make other nonsubstantive changes to the regulations for the sake of clarity. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. We are proposing to allow, under certain conditions, cold treatment of imported fruit upon arrival at the port of Wilmington, NC. As a result of this proposal, a number of different fruits could be imported into Wilmington, NC. Specifically, officials of the North Carolina State Ports Authority in Wilmington, NC, anticipate that apples, grapes, and pears from Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa would be imported and cold treated at the port of Wilmington, NC. Approximately 20 million pounds of each fruit could be imported annually into Wilmington, NC, as a result of this rule, though we anticipate the amount would be much smaller. While some of the fruit arriving at Wilmington, NC, would be imported in addition to the present volume of annual imports into the United States, some merely would be shipments diverted from other ports also approved to conduct cold treatment on arrival. In the following analysis of the potential impact of this action on domestic producers of apples, grapes and pears, in order to demonstrate the greatest possible economic impact, we have assumed that the maximum amount of fruit would be imported into Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment, and further, that those commodities would be imported in addition to the present volume of annual imports into the United States. Also in the following analysis, we have used published price flexibilities to estimate the potential economic effects of allowing apples, grapes, and pears to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC; flexibilities are used to estimate relationships between changes in supply and subsequent changes in price. Apples In 1987, 36,718 farms in the United States, of which 1,186 were in North Carolina, harvested apples. Although it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less, according to Small Business Administration (SBA) size standards), it is likely that most would. In 1992, domestic farms produced almost 5.78 billion pounds of apples for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $1.13 billion. If the volume of apples imported into Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 7.5 percent of current total imports into the United States, about 0.35 percent of current domestic production and about 0.33 percent of the current total apple supply in the United States (domestic and imports). Assuming that a 0.33 percent increase in the supply of apples would lead to a decrease of about 0.20 percent in the domestic price of apples (using a price flexibility for apples of ^0.590, based on all Eastern States' sales of North Carolina apples), we estimate that this increase in supply would result in a price decrease of about $0.038 per hundredweight (cwt), or $0.00038 per pound, from an original price of $0.195 per pound. As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. apple producers of about $2.20 million, which is roughly 0.20 percent of the original total revenue of $1.13 billion. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing apples to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC, would not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers. Grapes In 1987, 23,236 farms in the United States, of which 286 were in North Carolina, harvested apples. In 1992 domestic farms produced about 1.54 billion pounds of grapes for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $327 million. Although it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less, according to SBA size standards), it is likely that most would. If the volume of grapes to be imported were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 2.9 percent of current total imports to the United States, about 1.3 percent of current domestic production and about 0.89 percent of the current total grape supply in the United States (domestic and imports).
