Because the Slovene authorities did not allow him entry into the country, he spent the night at the airport, together with his three companions. He was visited by Yuri Girenko, charge d'affaires of the Russian Federation Embassy in Ljubljana. The Slovene Foreign Ministry has reported that it did not allow entry to Zhirinovskiy because of violations of public law and order during his visit in Slovenia at the end of January. On that occasion the Foreign Ministry merely advised him to leave the territory of the Republic of Slovenia as soon as possible.
