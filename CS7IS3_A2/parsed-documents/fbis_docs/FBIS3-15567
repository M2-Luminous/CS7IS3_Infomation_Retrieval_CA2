The operation of Tbilisi regional state power station has been relatively stable. Due to the rise of the water level in rivers, the efficiency of hydroelectric stations has increased almost by the factor of two and reached five million kilowatt/hours. Apart from this, the republic gets almost two million kilowatt/hours of electric power from Azerbaijan. Thus, as for today, the total power available reaches 18 million kilowatt/hours. The shortage is still large but it can be presumed that hydroelectric power stations will show a further significant increase in efficiency after 15 or 20 March.
