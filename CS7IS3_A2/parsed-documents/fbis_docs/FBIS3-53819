In an interview with Egyptian television on the "Good Morning Egypt" program today, Dr. al-Baz said that President Mubarak had a role in convening this meeting and in pushing matters forward. The meeting was held without delay because Egypt realized that such a meeting could produce positive results. He added that Egypt is working toward one comprehensive agreement and not just agreements on some fronts. He stressed that Syria is one of the important parties in the peace process and that without movement on the Syrian track progress on the other tracks could be slow. Dr. al-Baz said that the al-Asad-Clinton summit has had a positive impact, but this does not mean that an agreement was reached on specific issues to which Israel and Syria would be committed. The overall atmosphere and the assurances that could have been made in this meeting will, in our view, result in progress on the Syrian track. Dr. al-Baz expressed the hope that progress will be made on the Syrian track in the next few months. Regarding Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Cairo tomorrow, Thursday, Dr. al-Baz said that this meeting is also important because, despite the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, first in Oslo on 20 August and then in Washington on 13 September, the declaration is general and negotiations are needed to ensure its implementation. These negotiations are extremely important. [passage omitted] Dr. al-Baz also discussed the domestic situation. He emphasized that among President Mubarak's priorities is finding solutions to economic problems, particularly unemployment and price increases. Plans to upgrade education are also at the top of his priorities. Concluding his interview, Dr. al-Baz said that attention is now being focused on internal and external issues to improve the internal situation.
