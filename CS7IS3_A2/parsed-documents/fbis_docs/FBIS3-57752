Representatives of Russia differed greatly in their views on the situation. Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of the economy, was optimistic on the whole. He cited his ministry's forecast, according to which the situation will be held under control in the months to come provided the tough economic policy is maintained, the state budget revenue strengthened and institutional transformations and the privatisation drive continued. This will slow down the slump in 1994, and the gross national product will dwindle by eight per cent as against 12 per cent last year. Urinson spoke in favour of supporting specific groups of population in the hope that stabilisation of social life will be possible this year, as well as an increase in the labour and business activity of the middle class. There are no political forces in Russia capable of stopping privatisation, the seminar was told by Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays, who is chairman of the State Privatisation Committee. According to Chubays, 70 per cent of shops, stores, restaurants and other enterprises in the same sphere had been privatised by January 1, 1994. He stressed the need for dialogue with the parliament concerning further privatisation. "The bulk of the population supports reforms, and this is the source of my optimism," Chubays stressed. Although the political situation in Russia in 1993 was very complicated, the market reforms continued, according to ex-finance minister and parliament member Boris Fedorov. He said he viewed as a success the continued deregulation of prices, an end to import subsidies and financial infusions in the Commonwealth member-countries, and the struggle against the budget deficit. "Without these measures the inflation rate could have been much higher," he said. Fedorov announced that the rouble exchange potential against the dollar increased three-fold last year, but this increase was too slow and too painful. The reform objectives were not made quite clear to the people, he said. For all that, he stressed that the term "shock therapy" is not fully applicable to Russia's economic policy. As concerns the short-term perspectives, Fedorov said that recent changes in the policy and playing up to the public were fraught with an economic disaster in the next few months. But in the mid-term, one may reasonably be more optimistic. According to economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, one of the high- priority tasks is the toughening of control over the inflation rate. He spoke against soft credits and stressed the need for further privatisation, particularly in agriculture. He recommended Western investors to concentrate on Russia's regions. "I am optimistic about the future, but not about this year," Yavlinskiy said.
