Two of them were lying on the ground with the barrel of a loaded gun pressed against their heads." That is what Defense Minister Leo Delcroix said in an exclusive interview with this newspaper. "Anyone else would have done the same thing if their colleagues' lives were threatened in this way." "In the future, whenever we are asked to undertake UN missions, we will first lay down a number of conditions." Before things get to that stage, however, Delcroix wants a period for all the parties involved to reflect on things. "I am not, however, one of those people who says that it would be better for us to stop all UN operations." "For the time being, I am suggesting that we calm things down. In the fall we can once again consider the situation. Our military personnel really need this rest period, both physically and emotionally, and to see their families." [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] In terms of their morale, are the Blue Helmets fully prepared for their mission? [Delcroix] Naturally it is hard for one to be prepared for things such as what recently happened. Who could be prepared for that kind of massacre? Generally speaking, our people have the right preparation. That is also one of the reasons why our military personnel are so often asked [to participate]. Psychological support improves every year. Of course, it is not yet at its optimal level. A lot can still be done, but compared to many other countries, our people are well prepared. [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Yet, some people are saying that only highly specialized military personnel should be called in for UN operations. [Delcroix] I do not oppose looking into that kind of project, or having our country join in eventually. It is somewhat easier in theory than in practice. I am indeed prepared to look into it, as long as a concrete project can be put proposed. Personally, I think it is better to draw on all of our manpower in accordance with the situation when it comes to deploying military personnel. To date, some 12,000 Belgian military personnel have taken part in UN operations. The experience they have gained is of inestimable value. This is a lot more than "joy-riding in Leopoldsburg," where you know the scenery. I do not wish to ridicule the existing exercises, but there is an enormous gap between them and practical experience as a Blue Helmet. In recent weeks, some people have advocated putting a number of military personnel on standby at a base somewhere in Africa. I definitely want to look into this, but account must be taken of the budgetary consequences. We are not France. I shy away from overly theoretical approaches. [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Does the rigid UN decisionmaking structure fit in with the flexible approach expected of the military? [Delcroix] Security from one area to the next cannot be judged from New York. This calls for a more flexible mandate with greater powers for the military commander on site. In addition, the military logistics in New York must be reinforced. I am not calling for a top-heavy structure, but there must be a little military planning. At present, too much of this is left up to civilians. With all due respect to the diplomats, when military operations are involved, then it is the military men who must make the decisions and draw up the plans. For example, after Yugoslavia, we ourselves had to drag along a lot of equipment. For the first half of the year, we just sat in the open air. This clearly demonstrated to me that the diplomats are not the most appropriate people for organizing these kinds of military operations. Major influence from the military apparatus in New York is essential. [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Is everyone at the United Nations ready to learn lessons from previous operations? [Delcroix] We will have to wait and see. But it is clear that any further UN participation by us is only possible subject to strict conditions. After the events in Rwanda and the heroism shown by our soldiers there, we are obliged to state that the United Nations must learn lessons from these experiences. I believe that people will listen to us, not the least because we have shown in the past our own readiness to listen to others. [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] You attach strict conditions to any future UN participation. Does this also mean changes for the Blue Helmets at present in the former Yugoslavia? [Delcroix] We certainly do not want any abrupt change. The view I have just presented must, however, gradually be applied there too. A few months ago, we substantially increased our arms there at our own initiative. We informed the United Nations that we would be bringing in these heavier weapons. I also added that if the United Nations refused to allow this, it would pose a problem for us. The United Nations, no doubt reluctantly, accepted this. [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] What do you think about Professor Suy's remark that the Blue Helmets should not have handed over their weapons? [Delcroix] Such a statement is hasty and unprofessional. Let the military make the judgment. I first want to read the military reports of what exactly happened. Only then can you judge in what circumstances the Blue Helmets handed over their weapons. If, as I have been told, they stood there with rifles aimed at the heads of two of their colleagues, I do not know what else they could have done. People should be careful about what they say about it now. I first want to know the exact circumstances. My initial impression is that the 10 soldiers and the military commander acted correctly, both in military and in human terms. [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Yet again the Belgian Army has had to evacuate compatriots from Africa. Do you find it responsible, once things calm down a little in Rwanda, for Belgians who are perfectly aware of the dangers to return? [Delcroix] Wherever there is a high concentration of compatriots who are in need, then even if the Belgian Army has been there 17 times before, it will still go back an 18th time. I feel that something snapped with this event. What is happening now is not an "everyday" evacuation exercise. This is not just one of many. Over the coming weeks and months there is also a need to reflect on our future policy, including cooperation policy. We cannot now say: The incident is over and we will start again where we left off. That is no good. It is not only at the military level that we must learn from experience, but also at the level of cooperation and foreign policy. We cannot simply continue as if nothing had happened. It has also shaken some of my own beliefs. But we have put a lot of money and effort into setting up this cooperation. When you now see what it has brought, it is not so easy to swallow. Furthermore, over recent years in parliament we had succeeded in bringing a different attitude with respect to military cooperation. Five or 10 years ago, this cooperation was still seen as something exceptional. Now even the Greens see the virtues of this cooperation. A different mentality had grown up. After what has happened over recent days you cannot fail, however, to ask questions, even if it is with pain in your heart. In this area too, reflection is necessary. I do not want to choose in the short term between two extremes. Before taking any far-reaching decisions about African policy as a whole, we must see of what we are capable. That will ensure that we do not take on more than we can handle.
