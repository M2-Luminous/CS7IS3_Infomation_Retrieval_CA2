He emphasized: Reform is the only way out. We must take reform as a driving force; add impetus to enterprise reform, to the work to end deficit and increase profit, and to the effort to do practical work for enterprises; mobilize and rely on the vast number of staff members and workers to participate in and carry out reform successfully; improve enterprises' economic efficiency; and facilitate faster and better economic development in Tianjin. In the morning, Gao Dezhan, secretary; and Zheng Zhiying, standing committee member and secretary general of the municipal party committee, arrived at the kinescope plant, a state second-level enterprise established 20 years ago. Gao Dezhan and others inspected production lines at workshops and talked cordially with workers at their posts to learn about the situation. They also held a discussion with members of the plant's leading body to hear reports on relevant conditions. The Tianjin Municipal Kinescope Plant is a large state-owned enterprise, which used to be a large tax payer and whose products have been named as quality products of the state and the ministry on many occasions. Due to the failure in timely transformation of its internal mechanisms and other reasons, the plant began to experience a decline in economic efficiency and suffer losses ever since 1990 and became a large loss maker of Tianjin. Since June last year when the newly adjusted leading body assumed office, it extensively mobilized staff members and workers of the entire plant to offer suggestions to rationalize production and adopted a series of reform measures to pull the enterprise out of the predicament, thus enabling it to reduce its losses by 50 percent in the same year. In the first five months of this year, an increase of over 30 percent was registered in the output, output value, sales income of its products when compared with the same period last year. The plant ended deficit and made a profit of over 1 million yuan in May. By deepening reform, it has regained vigor. Gao Dezhan affirmed the plant's achievements in deepening reform, ending deficit, and increasing profit. He said: The kinescope plant achieved marked results in ending deficit and increasing profit thanks to deepened reform. This proved that reform is the only way out and the driving force. The key to deepening reform lies in determination, boldness, and earnest effort in performing work. Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have made great contributions to the state, and their quality if good. There are many factors for their current difficulties. As has been proven in practice, enterprises can be invigorated and can stimulate the enthusiasm of its staff members and workers as long as they pay close attention to enterprise reform, their own mechanisms, and the market; decentralize the accounting procedures; establish the market mechanism within their plants; and successfully conduct the reform of the three systems. The very reason for the kinescope plant to achieve substantial results within a short time is its effort to add impetus to reform and to the work of ending deficit and increasing profit. Gao Dezhan said: To succeed in the internal reform of enterprises, a good leading body is needed, which is diligent and honest in performing duties and brave in pioneering new causes, and which wholeheartedly rely on the working class and give full play to its role as the major force. Gao Dezhan said: As an old industrial base, Tianjin will have no hope if it fails to improve enterprises. Only when enterprises are improved and invigorated can Tianjin become prosperous. In doing practical work to benefit the masses, we should not only address current problems, but we should also keep the fundamental interest of the masses in mind, which, in the final analysis, means to promote the economy. To be specific, we should enhance Tianjin's economic strength, improve the efficiency of enterprises, increase the revenues of the municipality as well as districts and counties, increase the income of urban and rural staff members and workers, and continuously upgrade the living standard. As far as enterprises are concerned, they should achieve success in deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, adjusting the structure, conducting technical transformation, strengthening management, developing new products, improving leading bodies, training staff members and workers, improving work teams, and building the spiritual civilization, which should all be focused on reform. Enterprises must make arduous efforts to improve their skills, and other units must provide favorable conditions to improve service. Through the concerted efforts of all fields, we should make good enterprises more prosperous and help difficult enterprises seize the opportunity quickly to resolve the difficulties of their staff members and workers, increase their income, and stimulate their enthusiasm. Gao Dezhan emphasized: It is no easy task for enterprises to achieve good results in reform and in ending deficit and increasing profit. Such good results must be consolidated and developed. Pertinent municipal departments should earnestly summarize and disseminate the good typical examples in deepening enterprise reform, ending deficit, and increasing profit so that greater breakthrough can be made throughout the municipality.
