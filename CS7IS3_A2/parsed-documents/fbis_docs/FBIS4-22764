For this purpose a decree is being prepared, to create a special Duma television company, and a law that requires the state SMI [mass media] to publish the "acts" enacted by that house is already practically finished. The need for the law is obvious: the Duma enacted a decree on amnesty, but it proved to be unable legally to implement it, that is, to promulgate it. This time Speaker Rybkin proved to be in luck. The execution of his desire depended not upon an honest procurator, but upon the lady who manages a newspaper that does not belong to the Duma. In general, the little problem was worked out and the little matter was settled. (On the eve of the amnesty, true, V. Isakov, a farsighted strategist in the opposition, attempted to push through a piece of paper to the effect that the Duma was authorizing itself to promulgate its own decisions in state newspapers.) In one way or another, the Duma is preparing a federal law to assure the prompt promulgation of its statements. But, pending the approval of that law by the Security Council and the president, there remains the danger that one of the editors in chief might refuse to publish the Duma's opinions in his newspaper. As for television, the situation is even more interesting. On the one hand, the state does not have any money for broadcasting, and, on the other hand, it is proposed that the Duma television and radio company will be given air time every day (that's right, every day!) up to 45 minutes of prime time. Obviously at the expense of the state television and radio companies. Why should the taxpayer have to spend money? Well, because the journalists, in the deputies' opinion, just as they did during the Khasbulatov days, came to an understanding, are expressing "incorrect" opinions, and are asking questions not of those who have accumulated a greater number of them. Obviously, no consideration is being taken of the fact that the Duma deputies, even without decrees, appear regularly on television. The citizens can have absolutely no desire to see their deputies and faction leaders on the screen (although they are paying for this!), but the election is almost upon us and, under the sauce of Duma news, political associations can carry out their campaigns at no cost to themselves. Can anyone refuse that? The question of who will manage the Duma's television service would seem to be unessential if the person who was accepted promptly into the Duma's press center in the position of the head of the television and radio sector had not been Yuriy Marechenkov, who had been the manager of Khasbulatov's press service and whose television creation "Parliamentary Hour" is still alive in the memory of television viewers. This is, however, only one side of the problem. The other side -- how the Duma can make itself safe against criticism -- also has not failed to attract attention. A Duma decree on how the mass media are supposed to illumine its activities has already been enacted. Soon there will be a federal law, entitled "Procedure for Illumining the Activities of State Agencies of Authority in the State Mass Media," and a new wording of the law entitled "Television and Radio Broadcasting" (the law will be reviewed in the Duma in late April). The only thing that is completely unclear for the time being is how the Duma plans to conceal these charms behind such a big smoke screen.
