We spoke with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek just one hour after he finally signed the wage policy agreement and thus also formally concluded the social pact that his government had been advocating ever since its inauguration. The first question is therefore understandable: [Sostaric] What are the guarantees that the documents you have signed will also be carried out? [Drnovsek] The signatures themselves are a considerable guarantee that they will be carried out. Furthermore, the trade unions and the Chamber of Commerce agree that the government will ensure instruments for implementing those agreements, and the law can also be such an instrument. Pensions Also Regulated [Sostaric] Are pensions the next challenge now? Retirees are protesting against any sort of changes, since they do not want to give up the relatively favorable position that they have now. [Drnovsek] There is always a lot of fuss over pensions. We in the government are constantly under pressure from assessments by economists that pensions consume relatively too large a part of the social product. That is a burden on the economy, which is also consequently not competitive enough. With the retirees' protests, however, it is necessary to find some middle course. That is why I also think now that it is necessary to withdraw the interventionary law, study once again what has been proposed, and settle it in agreement with the retirees. We have submitted a bill to amend the law for legislative proceedings, and it is to be adopted through normal proceedings, which makes it possible for us to verify it with the retirees. They want changes in pensions to be coordinated with changes in wages. Now we can withdraw that interventionary law, because the social agreement on wage policy will contribute to bearable changes in wages, and thus pensions should not deviate from that either. Assuming that we have regulated wages, we can claim that we have also regulated pensions. [Sostaric] Wages have been regulated, but what is the next challenge? [Drnovsek] I hope that with the social agreement we have at least reduced the tension, if we have not yet eliminated it. That should ensure social peace. Now it is time for the final adoption of the budget by the State Assembly, which should happen in May. The procedure for adoption of the budget has been going on for more than half a year now, which in my opinion is extremely irrational, although the State Assembly's rules of procedure specify that procedure. We are now actually adopting the budget at least twice. The adjustments are very dramatic, and then we have to start it all over again. Normal countries adopt budgets once; they are coordinated and adopted. In our case as well the process should be simplified and shortened. I hope, however, that we will adopt the budget next week, after all the possible adjustments. The government insisted on the original figures offered; there were only minimal deviations, which are not fundamental. If that kind of budget is adopted, it will be quite rational and frugal, the most that we can afford now. Reducing Interest Further [Sostaric] We adopt a budget every year, and we are interested in all sorts of other more long-term economic policy issues that would have to be resolved. [Drnovsek] Recently economic trends have been favorable, production has kept growing, and inflation is still declining, since the average monthly inflation during the first three months was 1.3 percent, which means annual inflation between 15 and 18 percent, and perhaps we will achieve another percent or so less. Unemployment has also started to decline, and if we also add to that the encouraging foreign trade trends, we can say that the economic results are encouraging. With the new budget, we will regulate the total level of public and budgetary spending, but in any case interest rates are one of the fundamental issues of economic policy. The government has already achieved something in that area, and with the measures coordinated with the Bank of Slovenia, there has been a partial reduction in interest rates. They are still too high, however. I expect that we will also reduce them somewhat further during the coming period. That can be achieved primarily by monetary policy measures, because it is within the purview of the Bank of Slovenia, and on the other hand, the finance minister can influence the interbank interest rate primarily by loaning out and guiding state money. [Sostaric] But the chronic shortage of money in general affects the level of interest rates. [Drnovsek] And also the incomplete rehabilitation of the banking system. It is taking place, to be sure, but it is not yet finished and consequently loopholes from the past are still influencing interest rates. We will review bank rehabilitation once again and try to determine what else can be done. [Sostaric] Dr. Mencinger, however, thinks that last year Slovenia showed successes because of mistakes in economic policy. You yourself, at a meeting of the government's economic council, stated that some economists were advising you to restrict wages, and others to free them. With such different opinions, what is the truth? [Drnovsek] The opinions are very different. When we froze wages last year, everyone criticized us, including economists, and then the same people complained that the freeze did not last longer. It is a really delicate area, and that is why I am glad that we reached an agreement. If it goes into effect as we agreed, it will undoubtedly be better than a law freezing wages. If that agreement is in effect over the long term, it will be extremely important for the economy, since it is very difficult for us to adjust public spending, pensions, and wages. The government itself has very limited instruments to do so. [Sostaric] We expect a great deal from privatization, but it is proceeding more slowly now than we anticipated. Will the government speed it up? [Drnovsek] We are speeding it up as much as we can. We are monitoring the activity of the Privatization Agency, and we are trying to help solve the problems. In any case, I think that privatization is taking place rather intensively. A lot of programs have already been approved, and I think that there are two reasons for the delays: the audits done by the SDK [Public Auditing Service], since many enterprises have applied, and the SDK has a limited number of trained personnel. The rest of the delays are due to the denationalization proceedings, which hinder enterprises from more rapid privatization. At any rate, we will try to speed up the proceedings even more and make them more efficient, but we do not anticipate any general changes in the privatization process. [Sostaric] There are two options in denationalization: restoration of the nationalized property through compensation, or the return of that property in kind. What is your position? [Drnovsek] We have to act in accordance with the valid law, which also allows returning it in kind. Many people consider that a controversial solution, which other countries do not have, but our parliament passed the law a while ago. Changing that law would also be extremely sensitive politically. We therefore did not try to undertake it, and we as a government are trying to do everything possible within the framework of that law. At any rate, that law contains the brakes on the privatization process. The Fatal Year 2001? [Sostaric] Slovenia is a country that has to join the world. If we look at the free trade zone agreements and Slovenia's intention of joining the European Union, we note that 2001 will be the year when the protective barriers to foreign competition will fall to the minimum. In just seven years, therefore, the Slovene economy will have to prepare for full foreign competition. Isn't that too soon? [Drnovsek] We have already had to adjust quickly to very difficult conditions. The shock that our economy experienced after independence and the loss of its markets was much worse than the further adjustment to world competition and developed Europe will be. It is true that after independence we had many bankruptcies, and that the number of people unemployed grew drastically, but at the same time, what happened strengthened the enterprises that survived, and that means that they will also continue to endure. I think that we will adjust to the new requirements, and the present relatively liberal policy that is trying to open Slovenia up as much as possible is also contributing to that. [Sostaric] In a way, Slovenia's future position in Europe will also be decided by our group negotiating with the European Union. Do we have enough competent experts for Slovenia, as a future member of the European Union, to secure the best possible starting position? [Drnovsek] There are never enough experts, and we are short of them as well. In any case, we will have to obtain them, since joining Europe is a serious issue. All our legislation, standards, and other regulations will have to be adapted to the European Union, which will be extremely extensive work. Of course, we are counting on the cooperation of experts from the European Union. Sometimes it seems that we have many experts on everything else, on beating a dead horse, but there is a shortage of them when serious work has to be done. Caught Between the Great Powers [Sostaric] That has probably also been shown by the negotiations with GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], when we were quite optimistic, but to this very day we are not yet members of that organization. [Drnovsek] As far as GATT is concerned, I still think that we will succeed in becoming a member by the end of the year, before the establishment of the World Trade Organization, in which we could become founding members. The reason why it has not happened yet is that we were caught between the interests of the United States and the European Union. In their trade war, both of them are putting pressure on little countries like Slovenia, which have to adjust to one side or the other. If we come closer to the European Union and its regulations and standards, the Americans make problems for us, and vice versa. We are in the middle, and we are trying to get out of it. [Sostaric] With all of this, the issue of Slovenia's promotion abroad has been raised for a long time. The fact is that we are doing a poor job of promoting Slovenia, and to the best of our knowledge, some government office ought to take over that business. [Drnovsek] A lot is said about promotions, and everyone would like to be involved in them, so that sometimes the problem is how to coordinate various promoters or various ministries. That is why there is a proposal in progress for the establishment of some body that will coordinate those responsible for promotions and make them more efficient. Relations With Neighbors [Sostaric] The Foreign Ministry has issued an analytical document that talks about how we are in a semi-colonial position with respect to Austria. The question that arises is whether Slovenia, in regulating its economic relations with Austria, will wait for the latter to become a member of the European Union, or seek a different path to regulate mutual relations? [Drnovsek] Slovenia does not have any sort of semi-colonial relationship with Austria. We have good-neighborly relations with Austria, and a completely independent policy. Austria will probably become a member of the European Union in a very short time, and we consequently have to count on it primarily as a member of the European Union and measure our subsequent steps in accordance with that fact. So far we really have sought possibilities for cooperation within the framework of EFTA [European Free Trade Association], but the fact is that all the Scandinavian countries and Austria are going into the European Union, and consequently EFTA no longer interests them. To be sure, we are still trying to keep EFTA involved, but it is obvious that a relationship with the European Union is greatly preferable. [Sostaric] There have been significant political changes in Italy. It may happen that relations between Italy and Slovenia will not be pleasant. Is Slovenia as a country prepared for those changes? [Drnovsek] What Italy's actual policy will be like has yet to be seen. To be sure, there is a great deal of shouting now, there is still no government, and this is consequently a sort of transition period, which should not be perceived as appropriate for judging Italian policy toward Slovenia. When a government is put together and it has to try to solve problems constructively, I can hardly imagine that Italy will resort to a different policy than the usual one in the European Union, since Italy itself would therefore end up in serious difficulties within the European Union, and Europe also would not tolerate it, especially if there came to be such an aggressive Italian policy that it would threaten Italy's neighbors. It is something that is unacceptable by European standards. If it does happen, we will have problems, of course, but in that case Italy will also have difficulties with democratic Europe, and therefore we will not be isolated in defending our interests. We are now just waiting for Italian policy to settle down somehow and start to function normally. [Sostaric] What about the present Istrian campaign for some sort of union of the Croatian, Slovene, and Italian municipalities in Istria? [Drnovsek] We do not intend to change the state system. Normal With Croatia [Sostaric] As far as Croatia is concerned, the data indicate that bilateral trade is declining every month, and political relations themselves are stagnating. [Drnovsek] Trade is declining with all the former Yugoslav republics, including Macedonia. In Croatia's case, that trend has existed since the end of the free trade relations between the two countries. In any case, this February we achieved progress in our mutual relations, when we signed several agreements with Croatia, so now I can say that relations are normal. Obviously there is also less and less tension in the media, and the fact is that Croatia has other problems that it has to solve. There are a few individual issues that are hindering more rapid clarification of our mutual relations. In addition to the problem of the borders, which is slowly being solved by the joint commission, we also have the issue of Ljubljanska Banka in Zagreb, which is a serious problem in our mutual relations, and the issue of the nuclear power plant. We are talking with the Croats about those issues and preparing solutions. We have already proposed some of them, and we have yet to propose others, so I hope for progress if we maintain the present level of bilateral relations. [Sostaric] Of course, the Slovene economic delegation's visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina showed that Slovenia is still interested in economic cooperation with the southern republics. [Drnovsek] Enterprises and the economy are always interested in business deals. If there is a market there that they can work with, Slovene enterprises will cooperate in it just like all other foreign enterprises. Of course, because of their familiarity with that market our enterprises have some advantages, and thus when the situation settles down there will be normal bilateral economic relations. [Sostaric] Even with Serbia? [Drnovsek] When the sanctions are lifted, when the international community normalizes relations with Serbia, Slovenia will do so as well. I Support the Status Quo [Sostaric] A question about the coalition--the present big coalition of three parties is now functioning fairly well, but there is talk about a new coalition of the LDS [Liberal Democratic Party] and the SKD [Slovene Christian Democrats]. [Drnovsek] The coalition is functioning, and the agreements that I have with both the partners, the SKD and the United List, are in effect; the LDS is prepared to continue working in that coalition, since it now has enough parliamentary support to guarantee the operation of the state, the government, and the whole system. As long as it works, we will try to keep the trilateral coalition. The problem is that the SKD no longer wants to cooperate with the ZL [United List] in the government, and thus the two other partners cannot manage with each other. The LDS's position is that it is no longer possible to act within a trilateral coalition, we will have to decide and determine which bilateral coalition and possibly which group of deputies could allow establishing a stable government. At this time that still does not mean an a priori decision in favor of one party or the other, but rather a thorough study of the situation and then a very firm agreement with the coalition partner. The government needs strong parliamentary support, so that by the end of our term we can carry out everything that we planned at the start. That is why I am not in a hurry to change the coalition. The pressure will come from elsewhere, and we have yet to see when and how we will reach an agreement. [Sostaric] Nevertheless, if that trilateral coalition actually does collapse now, no alliance would have a majority: You need the help of the small parties in parliament. Which ones? Perhaps Jelincic's? [Drnovsek] That is still an open question. We still have democrats here who have not joined the LDS, and are still independent deputies. Thus, in both options, either with the Christian Democrats or the United List, we could achieve the necessary majority in parliament. [Sostaric] You would obviously prefer the status quo? [Drnovsek] From the standpoint of consolidating the state, that would be best. Most Progress Last Year [Sostaric] It was recently determined that Slovenia's standing in the world had declined. [Drnovsek] According to the latest international assessments, it has risen. The last such assessment comes from the INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR magazine, which is highly esteemed in the banking world. It thought that Slovenia was last year's winner. Of all the countries in the world, it made the most progress in one year. On the scale of the top 10 winners of the year, Slovenia is in first place according to the criteria of which country, according to a world standard, gained the most in one year. At all sorts of international meetings and at institutions, Slovenia is receiving good assessments, and in a way we are being treated like a country that has succeeded considerably faster than the world expected. I must say that Slovenia is viewed considerably better abroad than it is at home. [Sostaric] In spite of that pleasant circumstance, we are having difficulties over the unallocated Yugoslav debts, and there are problems with succession. [Drnovsek] We are still negotiating with a consortium of banks about the debts. There will be more negotiations again soon. It is hard to predict the outcome of the negotiations, since we are negotiating quite hard, but we will try to settle the matter. It is important for us, since that is precisely what is keeping us down in the international ratings; the "Yugo risk" is still in our financial credit rating. I am a moderate optimist about this, in spite of our domestic financial disagreements, which have also politicized that issue. Actually we are now making use of the domestic tension over the foreign debt, which some people brought to light as--I don't know--some sort of discovery, although we have all known about it for 10 years now. We are telling our credit partners, the commercial banks, that we also have populist policies that present matters in radical terms. We are thus trying to induce them to accept our proposals and not some subsequent alternatives that would seriously hurt them and Slovenia. Fortunately our negotiating partners are not interested in anything like that, since they would obviously put a solution of the problem off until the future. [Sostaric] In view of what has been said, is the story about Slovenia as a winner still relevant? [Drnovsek] For anyone who is familiar with the situation and knows the kind of circumstances with which Slovenia had to cope, what it means to lose 40 percent of the markets overnight, as Slovenia did, and had to compensate for them during a period of world recession, and at the same time carry out changes in the economic system at home, all without outside financial assistance, our achievements are convincingly good. That is not understood by those who are not familiar with world realities, who think that it is enough that you are a Slovene and then everything will work out by itself, and that just changing the signs and the name of the country is enough and then everything will be better--those who do not know that you have to win everything yourself, that in this world one has to survive a very hard struggle. People have to know that. [Sostaric] Then the so-called UDBA [State Security Administration] mafia is not to blame for everything? [Drnovsek] We witnessed such phenomena after World War I, when the economy, objectively, collapsed. At that time people also invented a culprit who was to blame for everything and exploited others, who therefore lived poorly. At that time it was the Jews. That is an extreme example, of course, but it is a good illustration of where that sort of simplification and demagogy can lead.
