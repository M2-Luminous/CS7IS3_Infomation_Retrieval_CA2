Yang Song [2799 2646], vice chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Government, attended and spoke at the meeting. Characteristics of this year's regional planning meeting are that the meeting touched on both the intangibles and tangibles. It was different from previous meetings both in form and content. When holding the meeting, we changed our normal practice that stressed investment allocation, project formulation, and continued fulfillment of incomplete targets. Instead, we concentrated our energies to analyze Tibet's current economic situation and to predict changes in various factors that will affect Tibet's future economic progress. We also studied ways and means to resolve problems in accordance with the tasks and objectives laid down by the regional economic work meeting. Attending the meeting were more than 170 people, including commissioners and mayors from various prefectures and cities; chairmen of planning and economic commissions; directors of commodity price and labor bureaus; and responsible comrades of Tibet's various commissions, offices, departments, and bureaus. Wu Shunxiang [0702 7311 4382] and Ciren Doje [2945 0088 1122 0679], vice chairmen of the regional planning and economic commission, respectively relayed the guidelines of the national planning meeting and the national economic and trade meeting. Sun Qiwen [1327 1477 2429], chairman of the planning and economic commission, delivered a report entitled "Further Liberate the Mind, Deepen Reform, and Open Wider to the Outside World So As To Strive To Facilitate Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy National Economic Development." He made arrangements to implement the tasks laid down by the regional economic work meeting. Meanwhile, he also proposed to further transform the functions of planned administration so that planning tasks can more effectively fulfill the requirements resulting from changes in the new situation in an effort to enhance the establishment of a new market economy. Additionally, attending comrades discussed concepts and issues concerning Tibet's long-term development programs by the year 2010. At the end of the meeting, Xiang Yang [0686 2799], secretary of the regional planning and economic commission party committee, gave a speech entitled "Liberate the Mind and Change Concepts So As To Make Fresh Contributions to Tibet's Reform and Progress." The meeting pointed out: In accordance with the basic requirements for establishing a socialist market economy, the party Central Committee, the State Council, and Tibet have formulated a series of important general and specific policies and reform measures, and we are shouldering the important historic mission of implementing them. While carrying out reform and opening up, how to link up with other localities of China and gear Tibet's economy toward the market are important issues facing us as Tibet's economy is very backward. The regional economic work meeting proposed that we should make new progress and breakthroughs in enhancing Tibet's economic development, in raising the per capita income of peasants and herdsmen, and in building more markets. We should also make major progress in village and town enterprises. All these tasks are arduous. We are facing the formidable reality that the work is new with tough requirements and that the mission is demanding and difficult. Xiang Yang, secretary of the regional planning and economic commission party committee, proposed that our most important task is to study. First, we should study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinsee characteristics. We should also study the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Moreover, we should integrate our thinking and understanding with the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the Fifth (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional Party Committee. Additionally, we should adhere to the party's basic line, strictly concentrate our efforts on the central task of economic construction, strive to develop the socialist market economy, and further pursue Tibet's policy of reform and opening up. Second, we should further study and properly implement various general and specific policies that have been newly formulated by the state and Tibet so that these policies can effectively enhance Tibet's reform and progress. Third, we should intensify our study of professional knowledge, which offers many topics. We should study matters that we do not understand. If we are in the dark, we should not guide others; otherwise, we cannot handle our work competently. To further cultivate the contingent of cadres and raise their professional skills, the Regional Cadre Training Center plans to hold different study and research classes on various vocations in 1994, and to engage some experts and comrades with practical experiences from Tibet and other localities to lecture in the classes so that our professional skills can be considerably raised. These efforts aim to fulfill the requirements for carrying out reform and opening up and for establishing a new economic system in Tibet.
