Macao's Governor, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, was reported to have insisted that the Portuguese law be enforced in Macao. According to the law, "documents and pieces of information whose knowledge by non-authorised persons is susceptible to putting at risk or causing harm to the national independence, unity and integrity of the (Portuguese) State and its internal and external security" fall under the state secret category. For the first time in Portugal's legal history, the Macao Governor as well as the head of state, parliamentary Speaker and Prime Minister, has the power to classify on his own initiative certain documents and information as state secrets. Civil servants and military personnel in Portugal and Macao contravening the state secret law face criminal and disciplinary proceedings. The law states that the "protection of classified documents" was directed against "acts of sabotage and spying and leaking of information". A special parliamentary committee of the Assembly of the Republic in Lisbon is to oversee its implementation. Portuguese media reports said Vieira asked last year for the right to classify documents in view of the enclave's transition towards Chinese rule from 1999. The reports maintained there was a need to protect Portuguese "state secrets" in negotiations with China over Macao "directly by the Macao Governor and not just through Lisbon".
