Demirel also revealed that he informed Greek President Karamanlis in a message that Turkey is disturbed about PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] activities in Athens. Demirel replied to reporters' questions on various issues in Afyon today. Asked by a journalist to comment on the extension of the landing strip at Gokceada Airport, Demirel recalled that various problems were related to him during his visit to the island. Pointing out that access to Gokceada is a problem, and it takes two to three hours to go and come back from the island, the president remarked that the extension of the landing strip on the island is necessary for transportation. Demirel said: The extension is not aimed at adopting a stand against Greece. After all, the island is ours. It is our affair how we will serve the island. Therefore, do not interpret the matter as a stand adopted against Greece. This is not correct. Soon, we are planning to lay the cornerstone of the Bodrum Airport. Will this constitute a stand against someone? An airport is a means of transportation to a corner of the country. It does not have other motives. There is no need to adopt a stand against anyone. For the moment, there is no such need. Commenting on a remark that his message to Karamanlis was published by the Greek side, Demirel said that Karamanlis is an old friend and this friendship is over 30 years old. He added: Turkey and Greece have bilateral problems, but these problems are not new. They have been inherited from the past. We want them to be resolved peacefully. Our policy is not one of hostility.
