FBIS4-6754 "dreas078_d_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 South Korea Reporter Punished for Protection Law Violation Reporter Punished for Protection Law Violation SK2204101294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0808 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204101294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul high court on Friday handed down two years in jail with a three-year stay of execution to Shinohara Masato, the Seoul correspondent of Japan's Fuji Television convicted of violating the military secret protection law. Shinohara, 41, was sentenced earlier to a two-year prison term in a lower court and appealed his case to the high court. In his decision, Judge Min Su-myong said, "the defendant rightly deserves the punishment as he violated this country's military secret protection law when he spied to obtain military secrets for three years and gave them to military attaches at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul." The court believes, however, that he was interested in military secrets more as a journalist and analyst for his articles than as a spy, the judge said. Moreover, this incident does not appear to have had a decisive adverse effect on the country's security, the judge said. Besides, he noted that Shinohara confessed before authorities began questioning him. Considering all the extenuating circumstances, the judge said he decided to give Shinohara a lenient sentence. Shinohara was indicted last July on charges of receiving 27 military secrets from former Major Ko Yong-chol, who was working in the intelligence headquarters of the Defense Ministry, turning them over to Japanese military attaches on a regular basis between 1989 and 1990.
