FR941007-1-00069 FR941007-1-00009 Data Collection and Reporting The December proposal would have required institutions that were not eligible for the small institution streamlined assessment method to collect and report to the agencies data showing the geographic distribution of written applications, application denials, originations and purchases for home mortgage, small business and small farm, and consumer loans. Home mortgage loans would have included all mortgage loans reportable under HMDA and its implementing regulations. The proposal would have required institutions to report separately information covering loans for home purchase, home improvement, multifamily dwellings, and refinancings. Small business loans would have included all loans to private, for-profit organizations that in the fiscal year preceding the making of the loan had gross receipts of less than $10 million (for a firm providing services), or up to 500 employees (for a manufacturing firm). As proposed, institutions would have had to separate such loans into in four categories based on the sales volume of the business. Small farm loans would have been defined to include all loans to private organizations engaged in farming operations with gross receipts of less than $500,000 in the fiscal year preceding the making of the loan. Consumer loans would have been defined to include all closed-end loans, secured and unsecured, extended to a natural person primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, except for credit card loans and motorized vehicle loans and those loans included in the definition of home mortgage loans. The December proposal would also have required institutions to report data in summary form by geography for each of the three major loan categories_mortgages, small businesses and small farms, and consumer_by January 31 of each calendar year. The data would have covered the related lending activity that took place in the preceding calendar year. Some commenters raised general concerns regarding the data collection requirements in the December proposal. As discussed later in this preamble, the agencies have streamlined requirements to reduce burden. In addition, the agencies plan to make software available to institutions to facilitate compliance with the proposed requirements. The agencies have proposed the data collection and reporting requirements in this revised proposal as a means for permitting the agencies to fulfill their responsibilities under the CRA of assessing each institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the community. This proposal has also been made to permit the agencies to discuss the facts supporting the agencies' conclusions regarding the institution's record of lending. The comments on the proposed data collection raised five principal concerns, all of which have been addressed in the revised proposal. First, many commenters indicated that the proposed rules would be overly burdensome and, in the case of home mortgage loans, would have required duplicative tracking of data. Under the revised proposal, the agencies would base their analysis of mortgage lending on the data already reported pursuant to HMDA. To acquire more geographic detail on home mortgage lending, the agencies propose to amend the HMDA regulation to require that institutions other than small banks and thrifts report the geography of applications, approvals, and denials for loans secured by properties outside the institution's MSA, data that is already reported on a voluntary basis. Second, some commenters questioned whether the need for consumer loan data justified the burden of mandatory reporting. However, many of the same commenters suggested that if consumer loan data were to be required, the data should include all consumer loans, including credit card loans and motor vehicle loans, which were not included in the collection and reporting requirements of the December proposal. Some institutions indicated that consumer lending was an important aspect of their CRA performance that should be considered by the agencies. The revised proposal would offer institutions the option of collecting data on the amount outstanding, the location of the borrower, and the income of the borrower for each open-end and closed-end consumer loan outstanding as of the end of the calendar year. Such data is typically required by all institutions as an integral part of their loan underwriting procedures. If an institution selected this option, the foregoing data would be reviewed during the institution's CRA examination but would not be reported to the agencies. Third, many lenders criticized the December proposal's inclusion of information on small business applications and application denials. Those commenters indicated that reporting should be limited to loan outstandings or loan originations. The revised proposal would simplify the definition of small business and small farm loans, by adopting the definition of those terms now used by institutions for purposes of completing, in the case of banks, their Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports), and in the case of thrifts, the Thrift Financial Report (TFR). Under the revised proposal, institutions would collect and report data on a loan-by-loan basis for all loans included in the aggregate small business and small farm loan figures on the institution's Call Report or TFR, which includes business loans with original amounts under $1 million and farm loans with original amounts under $500,000. These data would include the outstanding balance as of December 31 of each year, the location of the business or farm or the location where the loan proceeds would be applied (as indicated by the borrower), an indication of whether the borrower has annual revenues of less than or equal to $1 million, and an indication of whether the borrower (if not publicly traded) is more than 50 percent owned by one or more minority individuals or by one or more women. The loan register information would be required to be submitted at the same time and in accordance with the provisions for submitting HMDA data as provided in 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). In addition, the revised proposal would change the date on which Call Report or TFR data on small business and small farms loans would be required to be submitted from June 30 to December 31 of each year to coincide with the calendar year reporting requirements of HMDA.
