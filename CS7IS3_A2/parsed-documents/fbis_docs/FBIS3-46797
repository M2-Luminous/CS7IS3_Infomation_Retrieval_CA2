Relations between the two countries have been based on the principles of respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, nonviolation and noninterference in each other's internal affairs for mutual equality and peaceful coexistence. Progresses have been achieved in many fields since the normalization of relations between Vietnam and China. High-level meetings and exchanges of delegations from different branches and levels were organized. The official visit to China of Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh in last November marks a new step in the neighborly friendship relations and cooperation between the two countries. This visit was of great significance in strengthening the mutual understanding and reliability as well as in consolidating the time-honored Sino-Vietnamese friendship and cooperation. Up until now, 50 agreements have been signed in order to resume and step by step develop economy, commerce, science and technology, culture, education, aviation, maritime, and post. Basing on the Sino-Vietnamese joint communiques in November 1991 and December 1992, the two sides held negotiations at experts and state-levels. It was worthy of note that in October last, the two countries signed an agreement on main principles for the settlement of territorial issue, to accelerate negotiations for the early conclusion of basic treaties on territorial border, on land, and sea between the two countries. Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong held that the signing of this agreement was an ensuring step in solving the border issue between the two countries and in contributing to promoting the friendship relations and cooperation between the two countries in the interest of the two peoples as well as of peace, stability, and cooperation in the region. For his part, Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister (Hang Jiazuan) noted that this was an important step creating conditions for the settlement of pending territorial border between Vietnam and China and for the further development of bilateral relations. Reality has shown that the two peoples of Vietnam and China want to build the Sino-Vietnamese border into one of peace, stability, and friendship. Now the two countries are implementing the already signed agreement. China promised to help Vietnam build a factory to produce chemical fertilzer and small and medium-size hydroelectric power plants. In trading, China wanted to buy Vietnam's coal, crude oil, rubber, and sea products and to export to Vietnam its equipment and other commodity goods. Vietnam and China have carried out an agreement on aviation and promoted an agreement on investment protection. Though relations between the two countries have been restored and developed, thus bringing about the benefit for both sides and contributing to peace, stability and cooperation in the region, the two countries recongized that some agreements have been carried out very slowly. Vietnam and China understood that economic and trade relations between the two countries have not yet been developed according to each other's potentials as well as their peoples' will. Both Vietnamese and Chinese peoples want to further promote stable, long-term, and effective friendship and cooperation and good neighborliness. Over the past years, the two sides also saw those issues left behind by history and newly-appeared issues must be settled by peaceful means. The two sides agreed neither to use force nor threaten to use force or any actions to make the situation more complicated. Peoples of both China and Vietnam hope that with their time-honored traditional friendship and cooperation and the developments in the past year, the Sino-Vietnamese relations will further be upgraded effectively in many fields.
