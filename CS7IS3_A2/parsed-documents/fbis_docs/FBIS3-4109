China hopes to see a 9 to 10 percent economic growth rate in 1994 and an inflation rate of less than 10 percent. Can these targets be reached? How does the political and economic development look like in China this year? Various sides have expressed great interest. This will be a year of great reform in China. Will the reform bring risks and problems? Judged from China's actual conditions at this time, the risks will not come from the reform itself but from the following several aspects: 1. The scale of fixed assets investment is too large; last year it reached 1182.9 billion yuan, a 50 percent increase over 1992. This trend is still strong this year and passing the point of what the country can bear. If it is not brought under effective control the consequences will be huge. 2. The agricultural problem is still pronounced, and although last year's farm products harvest was a record and the increased value of agriculture for the whole year was 665 billion yuan, the overall future situation does not allow for optimism. 3. Some localities have differing opinions from the leading departments: "When the upper level has a measure, the lower level has a countermeasure," actions are not coordinated, and a "local lord economy" has emerged. Quite a number of officials, enterprises, and commercial and trading departments compare speed, talk about layout, and opt for high consumption, paying no attention to efficiency, cost cutting, and stopping losses. They are not interested in strengthening management nor have they adequate concern for the people's sufferings. 4. The anticorruption drive and reform of the public service system are also problems. Just as Jiang Zemin said, the anticorruption drive must be a persistent battle and must be supported by the system, whereas when reforms of several systems are carried out simultaneously, the conflicts become more pronounced. Deng Xiaoping Supports Jiang Zemin in Personally Formulating the 1994 Reform Plan However, Zhu Rongji said: Reform certainly is risky but not carrying out reform carries an even bigger risk. Deng Xiaoping expressed great support when Jiang Zemin personally formulated the 1994 reform plan, and Deng said: "Do not be afraid to take risks, be bolder. If one fears the wolves in front and the tigers behind, then one cannot walk." Reform Is Risky But Not Carrying Out Reform Is More Risky At present, some localities are indeed very rich, while the central authorities have experienced a serious revenue drain and the state has not been able to settle the deficit for many years. If changes are not made, then things will be more difficult. In the past two years, China's foreign trade deficit has rapidly soared while its exports have decreased. In January this year, imports surpassed exports by $900 million; according to a calculation based on this figure, the unfavorable trade balance will reach $10.8 billion for the whole year. Because the unfavorable trade balance will continuously expand every year, the state will have less income from foreign exchange, capital will drain, and if China does not seriously carry out reform of the foreign exchange system, things cannot go on like this. Over the past many years, in the tradition of the planned economy, the "symptom of being thirsty for investment," which was characterized by mutual comparison and ceaseless expansion of the investment scale, was banned by repeated orders but it was not cured for a long time. It became even more prominent and rampant when more efforts were made to tackle it, to the extent that output was superficially large, the investment scale was even larger, but most projects had poor returns, low quality, many loopholes, and shortages of funds. This phenomenon was particularly prominent in local provinces, cities, counties, towns, and enterprise development zones. If control is still not realized in the areas of finance and the financial system, it will disrupt China's economic development. Deng Says: Make Some Adjustments When Problems Are Found For this reason, Deng Xiaoping demanded they "be bold and careful, promptly sum up experiences, make some adjustments when problems are found to enable things to accord with reality." Responding to the situation, Deng Xiaoping also pointed out recently that: "To make the reform a success, it has to be carried out in an orderly manner and with guidance; without this condition, things become chaotic and people go their own ways. Thus, how can things be done?" Deng also said: "The CPC Central Committee and the State Council should have authority; without authority they cannot control the situation." Deng Xiaoping Says: "Macromanagement Must Be Embodied in the Central Leadership's Ability To Keep Promises" At the same time as China pursues a market economy, it must continue to carry out macroregulation and control; according to an estimate by the senior level in China, macroregulation and control must be continuously carried out for 10 or 20 years. Deng Xiaoping said that the most crucial thing is that "macromanagement must be embodied in the central leadership's ability to keep promises." Where Does Enterprise Reform Go From Here? This year, China will implement the "10,000, 1,000, 100, and 10" "mechanism-changing and system-building" plan. This means: Granting 14 kinds of decisionmaking power to 13,000 state-owned large and medium enterprises to enable them to really change their operational mechanisms and accomplish the work of sorting out assets and auditing capital; send supervisory committees to 1,000 key and backbone enterprises which have a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood, to supervise state-owned assets batch by batch; select 100 state-owned large and medium enterprises to try out a modern enterprise system; and choose 10 cities to carry out a pilot program to reduce unreasonable burdens in enterprises and increase their self-owned circulation funds. Li Peng said that at present the first thing to do is to organize 100 state-owned large and medium enterprises to try things out. The reform of state-owned enterprises is to, first, make it conducive to enhancing vitality among state-owned enterprises; second, to enable state-owned enterprises to preserve their value and increase output value; and third, to make it conducive to maintaining social stability. In order to promote technological progress among enterprises, this year, China will allocate 250 billion yuan for investment in technological transformation, to mainly support 100 capable and large enterprise groups to establish technology centers; and to organize 100 important state technological development and industrial experimental projects, 100 key locations for promoting and demonstrating new technology, and 10 high-tech industrial projects "combining production, study, and research." The State Council will also abolish its "Important Technology and Equipment Leadership Group," handing its business to the State Economic Commission. In future, state-owned enterprises will become independent "tax payers" who have rights over property as a legal person and who make own decisions on operation and take sole responsibility for gains and losses, while the state, as a capital contributor, will only enjoy ownership rights proportional to the funds it contributes to the enterprises and will shoulder limited liabilities. The unitary ownership system among state-owned enterprises will be changed and, except for some state-owned enterprises, other state-owned enterprises will be allowed to absorb nonstate-owned funds as shares, whereas the enterprises solely funded by the state or with an absolute majority of shares held by the state are considered state-owned enterprises. The market law of survival of the fittest will be implemented. Enterprises which make losses over a long period of time and which have capital smaller than their debts must be declared bankrupt according to law.
