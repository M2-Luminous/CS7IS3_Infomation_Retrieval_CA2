Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres will leave for Cairo tomorrow to meet with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports from Cairo: [Begin recording] [Segal] The negotiations between the PLO and Israeli delegations in Cairo will continue unabated until the Gaza-Jericho First agreement is signed. This piece of news was revealed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short while ago. Sha'th said that the negotiations were making rapid progress. A written document noting down all the agreements on civilian issues was presented for the first time today. Work continues on the documents, or rather on the thick pamphlets, pertaining to security and legal issues. The main differences still revolve around issues of jurisdiction. As for the issue of Palestinian prisoners, Dr. Nabil Sha'th asserted that progress had been made, noting that in general, he could no longer describe any issues as problematic. Sha'th sketched out the problems the delegations would have to confront in future. [Sha'th, in English] The Israeli delegation for the first time will remain here all through this weekend. We are also going to remain here. We are at the stage of final drafting and final redrafting, therefore it is difficult to say when. We are working every day till the day of signing from now on. [Segal translates above remarks and continues] When the correspondents became insistent, Sha'th smiled apologetically and said that since he had come under criticism for being overly optimistic, he would not specify a date for signing the agreement until the actual invitations to the signing ceremony had been printed. Sha'th also confirmed that Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres would arrive in Cairo tomorrow morning. Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources said that Peres would meet tomorrow afternoon with President Husni Mubarak, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who is arriving in Egypt this evening. Minister Shulamit Aloni is also in Cairo and receives occasional updates on the negotiations. Minister Aloni said the agreement would probably be signed next week and called on Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to show greater flexibility with regard to the Palestinian demands for their own postage stamp, passport, and telephone area code. [Aloni] I think that the agreement can be signed next week. The problem is whether or not the Palestinians raise new issues and whether or not we show narrow-mindedness. As soon as the security problems are resolved we should move forward and try to make things easier, bearing in mind that we control them and are thus the last country in the world dominating another people. We should start easing things for them. I think that today the prime minister holds the key to most of the decisions and I hope that he brings the issues before the cabinet. All these ostensible symbols of sovereignty that scare some people so much should not be so terrifying. Palestine was a British colony for 30 years and had its own stamps. That did not make Palestine independent and we needed a War of Independence before we became a sovereign country. [end recording]
