They have martyred 13 more Kashmiris in the Bandipura, Baliha, Punch and Keran areas. The occupation forces also shot at a passenger bus at Keralahar near Baramula, injuring 17 people. The Indian forces cordoned off 12 villages in the Uri sector and arrested several persons during a house-to-house search. The freedom fighters hurled hand grenades at the Indian troops in Srinagar, injuring two soldiers. Meanwhile, protest demonstrations were held in several areas of Srinagar yesterday against the killing of innocent people at the hands of the Indian forces. The demonstrators raised slogans against India and shops were closed in many areas. Pakistan Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan says Islamabad remains committed to continuing the dialogue with India for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue and other problems. However, in view of the fact that the brutal repression in occupied Kashmir is at its height and human rights continue to be violated, Pakistan will not schedule any talks with India at the foreign secretary or any other level until there is a visible improvement in the situation in occupied Kashmir.
