If nuclear program is frustrated, a revolt is possible within a year" View of Park Gab-dong of "National Salvation Front," organization of defectors from North Korea. "It is the Army that Kim Il-song of North Korea fears the most. The army of North Korea, much dissatisfied with Kim Il-song's system, they even exchanged fire with each other in front of Kim Il-song's official hall in the spring of last year. After that, by the demand of Kim Il-song, the ammunition of the army around Pyongyang were confiscated. Temporarily returned to South Korea after taking part in the "Rally for Democratization and Recovery of Human Rights of North Korea," held under the auspices of "National Salvation Front for Democratic Unification of Korea" (National Salvation Front is short for it) in Washington D.C. last October 22, Mr. Park Gab-dong (74), the standing chairman of National Salvation Front, said that he had heard that "the Army of North Korea was very agitated." He thought that an internal coup could possibly dismantle Kim Il-song's system within two years." Mr. Park said that he had heard the following from the members of the Front who participated in the Washington Rally as well as its members living in exile in Russia and China, etc. If a coup occurs in North Korea, the new military authorities, officers who are higher in rank than the colonel who had studied in the old Soviet Union, will become the main power in place of Kim Il-song Faction. The National Salvation Front, whose standing chairman is Mr. Park, is an anti-Kim Il-song organization which was formed in Moscow in January, 1992 by the defectors from North Korea. Its executives are made up of Mr. Lee Sang-jo, ex-North Korean ambassador to USSR (a lieutenant general of the People's Army); Mr. Suh Hui, ex-chairman of Pyongyang Special City Party Chapter of Korean Workers Party; and Mr. Park. The Central Standing Committee are made up of 15 members, who have all served as ranking executive members in the Korean Workers Party and People's Army. It includes Kang Sang-ho (ex-Vice Minister of Home Affairs), Chung Sang-jin (ex-Vice Minister of Culture and Art), Park Byong-yul (ex-Director of Kang Dong Political School), Yu Song-chul (ex-Chief of Operation Bureau of Supreme Headquarters of the People's Army), Chang Hak-bong (ex-Head of the Military Academy), Shim Su-chol (ex-Assistant Chief of Bureau of Ministry of People's Armed Forces), Yu Song-gol (ex-Head of the Air Force Academy), etc. The Front has a membership of about 300. Its branches are set up in the USA, China, Japan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan Republics of Russia, among others. The National Salvation Front, through "National Salvation" published in three languages, Korean, English, and Japanese, is pushing for recovery of human rights of North Korea's 23 million people who are dying of hunger, cold, and physical beatings. Its supreme task is "to drive out Kim Il-song and his son." The Front, in the Declaration of the Washington Rally, demanded eight items. These are: 1) Eviction of "Human slaughterer Kim Il-song and his son from office at once!" 2) release of political prisoners, 3) freedom of the press, 4) freedom of assembly and association, 5) freedom of residence, 6) right to choose occupation, 7) guarantee of the reunion of separated families, 8) guarantee of free hometown visits. Appealing to President Kim Young-sam to "keep an eye on the terrible scenes of North Korea's 23 million people who are forced to live like slaves, groaning under the tyranny of Kim Il-song and his son," the Front emphasized that "harmonizing with and helping Kim Il-song were quite the same as massacring the North Korean population." The writer asked the Standing Committee Chairman of the Front, Park Gab-dong, who temporarily returned to South Korea, about the activities of the Front and the unrest of the North Korea's army as well as that of the population of which the Front knows. To what extent is North Korea's army agitated? "According to the information we obtained, North Korea, after the Gulf War, had officers higher in rank than regimental commanders watch the videotape of the Gulf War to let them know the American tactics of war. But it brought about a contrary effect. The commanders who watched the videotape realized that the outcome of modern war depends on up-to-date weapons. They are therefore infected with defeatism, saying that if North Korea with conventional weapons brought about a war, it would be defeated. The enlisted are in a very bad state of health due to long underground life and extremely demoralized due to long-term services." Through what channels do you obtain information from the closed society of North Korea? "We obtain information from Russia, China, Japan, etc. The details of the channels should not be disclosed for their personal safety." (According to the first issue of "National Salvation," the Front is working in cooperation with an anti-Kim Il-song organization in North Korea.) You said that there was a gun battle in Pyongyang City, didn't you? "To construct apartment buildings of 50,000 families in Pyongyang City in the spring of last year, North Korea enforced the construction, mobilizing a corps of military force in a district. The soldiers from the country, seeing that the soldiers serving in the Capitol were treated much better than themselves, forced their way to Kim Il-song's official hall to protest. As the Presidential Security Guards fired upon the soldiers to hold back, a gun battle broke out. After that, Kim Il-song ordered the troops around Pyongyang to surrender their ammunition." If a gun battle had broken out, it must have been a big problem. "Responsible persons were rebuked. But the corps commander of the troops mobilized from the country, lieutenant general Kim Song-il received immunity from responsibility, because he was the son of Kim Il-song and Mun Song-ja." I haven't heard that there was a son called Kim Song-il among Kim Il-song's sons. "That is because Kim Il-song's relations with women were not exposed. It is a widely known fact that Kim Song-il is Kim Il-song's son. According to the information we obtained, there is a fierce power struggle between the group of Kim Chong-il who is Kim Il-song's son and the other group of Kim Song-ae who is Kim Il-song's wife. Kim Song-il takes the neutral attitude. Kim Yong-sun, Kim Tal-hyon and Chang Song-taek (husband of Kim Kyong-hi, Kim Il-song's daughter) belong to Kim Chong-il's group. Kim Yong-ju, Kim Il-song's brother, and Kim Pyong-il, Kim Il-song's son, belong to Kim Song-ae's group." It is said that a military coup was carried out and that the persons connected with it were executed in North Korea. "Although we also heard of this, we were not able to confirm it. According to the information we obtained, a coup was carried out last July and some rebel army escaping from North Korea were besieged by North Korea's troops at a mountain near the border. At that time the Chinese Army moved in, which once took a stand against the North Korea's army. At about that time, North Korea limited entry of the pro-North Korean residents in Japan into the country. Such a measure has been very rare. The rumor of a coup circulated around this time." Is there the possibility of a military coup in North Korea? "Yes, as I said before, North Korea's military authorities are in much discontent and are infected with defeatism. If they were provided with ammunition, they will point their guns at Pyongyang. They are the most threatening power of and the only substitute power for Kim Il-song's system. Split into the old and new generations, the military authorities unitedly will seize power. Thereafter, the new generation will gain supremacy over the old generation, I expect." What power do you mean by "the new generation of the military authorities" exactly? "Ranking officers higher in rank than colonel, most of whom studied in the USSR, are the new military authorities. Because they served under the members of the Front in the past, they and the Front will, I think, understand each other. To restrain the new military authorities, Kim Il-song replaced company officers with those who did not study abroad, I heard." When do you expect the coup by the new military authorities to break out? "If the North Korea's nuclear program is sanctioned immediately by the U.N., a coup will break out within the year. If North Korea enters into diplomatic relations with the U.S. or Japan, it will endure another two years before collapsing. Even if the new military authorities seize power, the unification of North and South Koreas will be possible only after five to six years from that point," I suppose. Will it be possible for North Korea to bring about a war? "A rumor of an outbreak of a war is nothing but Kim Il-song's threat. How can he bring about a war with such out-of-date weapons and demoralized soldiers? Because South Korea's government does not react strongly to North Korea's threat, North Korea is spreading such a rumor." How much information about North Korea's nuclear program do you have? "We once obtained information that North Korea had requested a testing ground of nuclear bombs from the USSR under Brezhnev. Judging from this information, the nuclear weapons development of North Korea seems to have been ripe for testing. I also, during my stay in North Korea in 1956, heard a member of the South Korean Workers Party speak about the construction of nuclear weapons underground works. But nuclear weapons are merely a threat to South Korea and Japan, and can never be used." Is there any power collaborating with the Front in North Korea? "Two hundred thousand political prisoners detained in the prison camps and 3 million nonsupporters, who are permanently detained in the collective farms in the mountains near the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, are opponents of Kim Il-song. They have the same opinion as we. Twenty thousand North Koreans who defected to China, now known to have been collectively housed in Inner Mongolian regions, may also be collaborators with us." To contact those people, what measures is the Front taking? "Although the Front is planning a variety of measures such as running broadcasting stations, etc. to let the population of North Korea know the truth about the outside world, it is in trouble for lack of funds. At present it concentrates its efforts on publicizing of what the Front really is." By what methods do you raise funds? "Those who defected to Japan while being active members of the South Korean Workers Party in the past total about 30,000. Many of them are rich. The Front manages to keep going with their help."
