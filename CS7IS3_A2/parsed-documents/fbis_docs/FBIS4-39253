The document assesses the socio-economic position of Novosibirsk Oblast. In it, Moscow-based experts write: "Income levels of Novosibirsk Oblast residents have dropped to 37.4 percent of Moscow levels, while per capita budget provisions in the oblast amount to 46 percent of the average figure for Western Siberia". Excessive militarization of the area's economy has been singled out as being among the causes of this disastrous showing. Having relaxed the reins in the running of the economy, the state has left Novosibirsk Oblast residents outside the scope of reforms: Neither military production nor defense-oriented science can adjust to the new conditions.
