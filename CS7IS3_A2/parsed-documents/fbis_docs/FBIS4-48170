The chief executive of the Development Bank of Southern Africa, Mr. Andre le Grange, said at a seminar in Nairobi, Kenya, that South Africa was perturbed by all these institutions, and that it would pursue bilateral agreements with states. Before the elections, the 22 member states of the PTA expressed the hope that South Africa would play a major role in the area devastated by civil wars and famine. However, the Central Bank of Kenya and other business leaders have labelled regional integration as a dream.
