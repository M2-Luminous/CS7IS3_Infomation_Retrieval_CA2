Mr de Klerk was reacting to a SUNDAY TRIBUNE article claiming that he had granted indemnity to former Civil Co-operation Bureau [CCB] member Maj-Gen Eddie Webb and three men implicated in an ambush in which seven people were killed near KwaMashu in 1990. In a statement, Mr de Klerk said: "There was no political advantage to be gained for me or my party from any of these decisions". The decision was made in terms of an agreement reached with major political parties that Mr de Klerk should continue governing South Africa until a formal transfer of power. "A large majority of the applicants were African National Congress and Inkatha Freedom Party members. They also included an application from Maj-Gen Webb. As with other applications I was bound to grant indemnity to those who could comply with the criteria set out in the (Further Indemnity) Act. This I did without favour or prejudice," Mr de Klerk said. It was not necessary to consult the Transitional Executive Council on this matter as it did not affect the outcome of the electoral process. The SUNDAY TRIBUNE quoted "reliable sources in the new government" saying the new administration was furious, but Justice Minister Dullah Omar did not want to comment. Lawyers for Human Rights Director Brian Currin said the recent indemnities could be illegal.
