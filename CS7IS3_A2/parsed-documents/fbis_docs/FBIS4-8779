A spokesman for the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in the Bosnian capital told Reuters the man, who was believed to be in civilian clothing, was killed at a checkpoint manned by the mainly Muslim Bosnian government army. The incident, which happened early today, is being investigated by UNPROFOR and the Bosnian military police. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said they were seeking further details. According to a BBC report, Bosnian forces manning the checkpoint opened fire after the soldier failed to stop. He reportedly started to run and was hit in the head. He is the fourth British soldier to die while serving with the UN in Bosnia.
