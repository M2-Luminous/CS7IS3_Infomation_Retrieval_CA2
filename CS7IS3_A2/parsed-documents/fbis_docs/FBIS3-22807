A high-ranking government official said on 8 March, "North Korea is objecting to some of the IAEA's inspection activities. Particularly, it is rejecting the extraction of samples from a radioactive chemistry laboratory in Yongbyon which is estimated to be a nuclear reprocessing facility." The official continued, "North Korea and the IAEA agreed in Vienna to the extraction of samples from the radioactive chemistry laboratory although the extraction of samples from the five-megawatt reactor is not possible because it is not a replacement of a fuel rod. There can be no concession because this is the core of the IAEA inspection." The government authority added, "However, we have to wait and see to judge whether the IAEA inspection team's activities are successfully concluded. That will be around this weekend or early next week."
