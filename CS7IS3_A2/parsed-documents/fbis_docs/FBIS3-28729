In the talks, the U.S. side has stuck to its demand for setting "numerical targets" designed to gain access to the Japanese market. This approach has come under attack in the United States. Being inspired by the attack in the United States, the Japanese side therefore has gotten tough increasingly at the talks. The thinking of bureaucrats in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], the Foreign Ministry, and the Finance Ministry at the talks has changed greatly. Will the transformation of Kasumigaseki [government district in Tokyo], which has begun to speak out with a "no" [to U.S. trade demands], result in the construction of an "equal Japanese-U.S. partnership," which has never gotten off the ground, or result in the further deepening of the United States' distrust in Japan? Japanese-U.S. relations now stand at a crossroads. An official at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo disclosed that apprehension spread within the U.S. Government late last year when Masahisa Naito, director general of MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau, resigned. At the time, a U.S. Government official asked, "Is MITI really going to sack a pro-American official?" Mr. Naito was in fact dismissed, and he was one of the Japanese Government officials who knew the United States well and who had broad personal ties with U.S. Government officials. Dependence on Personal Ties Becomes Less Important Mr. Naito resigned because of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which aimed to subordinate the bureaucracy to politicians, and because of a factional struggle within MITI. Some officials in MITI said in unison, "The U.S. Government's apprehensions missed the point." The dependence on personal ties in the conduct of diplomacy with the United States has certainly become less important. The chief of the Americas Division of MITI's International Trade Policy Bureau is a working-level official in charge of trade negotiations with the United States. Many of the successive division chiefs have served in the New York office of the Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro), which is called "MITI's hidden channel to the United States." Mr. Masakazu Toyoda, who became the chief of the Americas Division last July, has not served in the United States. He is the first division chief who has written an article in the "Report on Unfair Trade" compiled by the Industry Structure Council that was critical of the United States' protectionist trade policy. A senior MITI official says that Toyoda was appointed division chief under "MITI's personnel management policy of giving important posts to officials who are able to analyze the United States in a unbiased way." In the Finance Ministry, which has maintained its own negotiating channel with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Deputy Finance Minister Matoko Uchinai, a typical pro-American official, resigned in 1991. The channel is now close to breaking. The Emergence of Officials With a Diversified Awareness The Finance Ministry asked the Foreign Ministry to arrange a meeting between Prime Minister Hosokawa and U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen when the latter visited Japan in late January. This became a topic among government officials. The "practice" under which "the Finance Ministry is exclusively in charge of arranging all itineraries in Japan for high-ranking officials from the U.S. Treasury Department, and that the Foreign Ministry cannot touch these itineraries, has broken down." While the diplomacy-through-personal-ties is receding, an assertion of "multilateralism" is emerging in Kasumigaseki. This multilateralism has emerged from the "multilateral trade system," a doctrine of GATT. Some government officials are asserting that Japan's trade policy, which has so far focused on trade relations with the United States, should transform itself into one that conforms to GATT rules and focuses on trade relations with other nations. In taking advantage of the Uruguay Round (the multilateral trade negotiations), each ministry has staffed its bureau in charge of GATT affairs with capable officials. GATT is set to be transformed into the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will have a powerful say on world trade matters. Yoshihiro Sakamoto, director general of MITI's Trade Policy Bureau, says, "We want to foster an awareness among our officials that they need to hold trade talks with U.S. negotiators with a multilateral perspective." The officials with a multilateral perspective are already claiming: "If the United States slaps sanctions on Japan, Japan will take its case to GATT. If Japan compromises with the United States on numerical targets, this would lead to a loss of Japan's credibility in Asia and Europe." What should not be overlooked is their experience with the Uruguay Round. The United States Is More Pusillanimous Than Thought A junior MITI official who saw the United States make large concessions in 11th-hour negotiations with the European Union (EU) says, "I think that although the United States talks tough, it is more pusillanimous than I had thought." Multilateral negotiations are "open negotiations" in which negotiators exchange their assertions according to rules and are a power game in which the interests of nations clash. In previous Japanese-U.S. negotiations, attention has focused on how far Japan will go in making concessions to the United States. Now, however, a group of bureaucrats with a sense of the game, and who are eager to hold trade talks with U.S. negotiators on an equal basis, is emerging. The Concessive Thinking Is Losing Weight Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama, who recently returned to Japan, told Prime Minister Hosokawa, "Although the United States has a good impression of the Hosokawa government, it is tough in trade negotiations." In response, a senior Foreign Ministry official said coolly, "Almost no Foreign Ministry officials believe that Japan must concede as much as possible to the United States to keep its relations with that country in place." According to the same senior Foreign Ministry official, the keywords of Japan's diplomacy toward the United States are "broad and in the medium-term." The idea is that "Japan aims to build a friendly medium-term relationship between Japan and the United States while pointing out to the U.S. Government, which is focusing on economic issues, the importance of maintaining security and politically cooperative relations between the two countries." This concept implicitly indicates that Japan does not care about the occurrence of temporary discord in its relations with the United States. In fact, no tensions are evident in government offices despite rough sailing in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. With the collapse of the cold war structure, the importance of security issues in Japanese-U.S. relations has decreased. Another senior Foreign Ministry official said, "The Foreign Ministry is no longer in an obsessive mood to recheck Japan's relations with the United States whenever Japanese-U.S. summit talks are held." There is another reason why Japanese bureaucrats feel relaxed: the decrease in the competitiveness of Japan's economy. The Japanese-U.S. semiconductor agreement, which the U.S. Government intends to use as a model for "numerical targets," was concluded in 1986; plans for the expansion of Japan's purchase of U.S.-made auto parts were announced in early 1992. At the time of concluding the semiconductor agreement, Japanese chip makers were in a dominant position, and some Japanese chip makers even said, "Our cornering the U.S. chip market is just a matter of time." At that time, the share of Japanese-built cars in the U.S. market was on the increase. Now the situation has been reversed. U.S. chip and automobile makers have outstripped their Japanese counterparts after catching up with them. Japan's current-accounts surplus posted a record high in 1993. It is apparent that the surplus is on the decline after peaking that year. A senior MITI official involved in semiconductor negotiations with the United States said: "We felt guilty in our minds that Japan was disrupting the economies of the United States and the world. Now, we have no such guilty conscience." A cynical structure has been built wherein the "weakness of one's economy" leads to strength in negotiations. Danger Leading to a Change in Attitude Perhaps the new thinking of bureaucrats is a first step toward transforming the psychologically warped Japanese-U.S. relations into "ordinary bilateral relations." In their being transformed, however, there is a danger that this could lead to a "change in the attitude of each toward the other." At a recent seminar, junior MITI officials snarled at a U.S. official well versed in Japan-U.S. negotiations: "The Japanese market is open, and there is no problem with the market. The United States is heading toward managed trade." The U.S. official responded to their criticism, saying: "We believe that Japanese businessmen and scholars do not disagree at all on the point that the Japanese economy is managed to a substantial extent. If Japanese bureaucrats are only criticizing the United States for pursuing `managed trade' instead of themselves addressing Japan's problems, the United States will point out their hypocrisy."
