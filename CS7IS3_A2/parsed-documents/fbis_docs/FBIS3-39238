"However nice the 10-percent wage cut suggested by the metal employers would be for companies costwise, the effects on demand would be catastrophic," the Rhineland-Palatinate minister president said in an interview with the German Press Agency (DPA) on Tuesday [8 February] evening. Such wage cuts "would kill off the economic cycle." Cost cuts will have to be discussed, he said. "This is a political task, especially with ancillary wage costs." In the metalworkers' conflict a solution must be found at the negotiating table, Scharping pointed out. "I do not think that a strike would really help us now." But the appeal must first be directed at employers, "because the trade unions have stated very clearly that they are prepared to cut back a great deal in wage demands, if jobs are secured," he said. He said he was also moved by the terrible pictures from Sarajevo, "but the latest figures by the Federal Employment Office, with 4 million unemployed, stir me as well." This "record high in unemployment in Germany's history is a worrying signal," he stressed. Internal peace in Germany is also endangered by the existing social contrasts. What is also required now, Scharping said, is "the example from the elites." This could very well mean higher burdens on those earning higher incomes. In Bonn, an SPD government would also set examples by cutting down on the number of ministries and "especially the number of parliamentary state secretaries, whose jobs have become mere maintenance posts." It is high time that the social problems in Germany, where as many as 10 million people live close to the subsistence level, are moved to the center of political debate. "We talk far too much about foreign policy, missions in war zones, or people's weariness of politics. People no longer concentrate on the essentials. With politicians permanently talking about old files and other marginal affairs, one must not be surprised that people are weary of politics." In foreign policy there is no big difference of opinion between Helmut Kohl's government and the SPD, Scharping said. The only exception is the issue of Bundeswehr peacekeeping missions abroad. "There is no way the SPD will agree to such missions." The SPD chairman was also skeptical about a military intervention in former Yugoslavia. "I do not think much of military intervention, this would only make the bloodshed worse. I consider a real enforcement of the economic blockade against Serbia to be the instrument that could still help today," Scharping said. Regarding military interventions, the SPD feels more close to the United States' policy, "which is more cautious today than many a German Conservative." He said, "wanting to send troops to all parts of the world and wage war is dangerous talk." The latest developments in former Yugoslavia do not change the government's and laender's intention to send Croat refugees back to their country, he said. "But this must go hand in hand with a reintegration program. Repatriation was intended from the beginning, why should it not take place?" the SPD Chairman said.
