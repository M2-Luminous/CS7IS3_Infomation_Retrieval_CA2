The further training or retraining of specialists, in cases where they are assigned to higher positions or in a case of changes in military hardware, will take place in the officers' classes and courses. The operational-tactical department will begin training the flag officer specialists so necessary to the Navy today. This will provide an opportunity to combine under one roof the whole process of the selection, training and upbringing of specialists of all levels not only for the Navy, but for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Minatomenergo [Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering] as well. The availability of the material and technical base and professorial and instructor personnel will make it possible to achieve this in the shortest possible time periods, and without substantial financial expenditures. As concerns the first-year class of the Naval Institute--which was selected last year, proceeding from the Yalta agreements between the presidents of Russia and Ukraine on the Black Sea Fleet, on the basis of which the start of the creation of fleets of the two great Slavic nations was proposed--it will be cut back by roughly half. The best youth will be selected to continue their studies within the walls of the institute according to their rankings, which are affected by the level of success, discipline, health and physical training of the first-year cadets. The rest of the cadets will be offered studies at other military educational institutions of Ukraine. If they do not want that, they will finish the first year, receive academic certificates and be able to continue their studies at civilian higher educational institutions. The new academic system is not only a self-contained cycle for the training of specialists, but will also provide an opportunity to preserve the material and technical base and the best personnel among the instructors.
