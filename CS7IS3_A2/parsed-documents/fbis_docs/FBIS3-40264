I remember that within the framework of your seminar regarding the history of banking you presented a work entitled "The Post Bank -- A Young Bank With a Dynamic Evolution." For our readers, would you, please, review its path since its creation? [Petculescu] In fact, the Post Bank is a young bank, one created by government decree on 1 July 1991. We are a state institution having received an initial level of social capital of 450 million lei, of which 226 million lei had been obligated at that time. Not long after our establishment, the National Bank set the minimum level of capital at 700 million lei and we, therefore, also had to increase our capital to 900 million lei, otherwise it would have been impossible to operate. With these actions we began, and we have the full amount of capital required. But, we have problems once again, since the central bank has once again increased the minimum level of capital to 2 billion lei, and once more we need to find new sources of capitalization. In order to achieve this, I have gone to our current owners, the State Property Fund and the Private Property Fund, so as to give us the opportunity to increase our capital. I want to mention that last year's dividends were paid in full to these funds. With regards to our network of banks, we have 41 branches throughout the country, aligned with the administrative-territorial districting, in each of the judet capitals. In addition to this, there are 10 offices and the central headquarters. Beyond our own network, we also work through the more than 3,000 post offices on the basis of an agreement reached with the Romanian Postal System. [ROMANIA LIBERA] I would like, nonetheless, to return to the issue of capitalization, a problem confronting the majority of banks operating on state capital. In the wake of the latest news conference organized by the BNR [Romanian National Bank], an agreement was mentioned, one signed by the central bank with EBRD [European Bank of Reconstruction and Development] precisely for the capitalization of these banks. What is the status of implementing this agreement? [Petculescu] To date, nothing has been finalized, with there being the intention of both the World Bank and EBRD of being involved in this capitalization process. But, in order to do this certain conditions were imposed, such as the privatization of the banks. In this regard, each commercial bank funded by state capital was given a document, and was even invited to a discussion with these two organizations on this theme. In principal, no one is saying that they do not want privatization, but also no one is stating that this must take place. In my opinion, those who are our owners must give their opinion. I am referring to the appropriate moment for privatization, and also to the conditions for such an action. [ROMANIA LIBERA] Is it true that by taking advantage of the services of the more than 3,000 post offices you have exceeded the CEC [Savings and Loan Bank] network, which had been recognized as having the largest number of units in the country? [Petculescu] I want to be very clear: We were not created to break the CEC monopoly, as one newspaper noted. We were established as a full-service bank, and we carry out all the operations of a commercial bank. Furthermore, we aim at attracting the people's savings. If the banking services that we offer and will continue to offer are more attractive, with more flexible rates, with certain services, then it is normal for competition to exist. [ROMANIA LIBERA] Would you like to refer to these banking services? [Petculescu] We have created certain savings programs. Some are passbook accounts, with the depositor being able to make a deposit without selecting a specific period of time, for which the interest rate is 35 percent. We also have, however, term savings accounts for periods of three, six, and 12 months, with rates of 45, 55 and 70 percent, respectively. The advantage of these accounts, I would say, is not just the fact that our potential client can make a deposit for a shorter period of time for which he can get interest, but, first of all, that we have not required a very large minimum deposit. The minimum deposit is not 100,000 lei, but rather 5,000 lei. On one hand, if the depositor goes to his account and withdraws a certain amount of money, he will receive interest on his passbook account and, on the other hand, the party has the opportunity to benefit from credit in the amount of 80 percent of the amount on deposit. Thus, if he has an account balance of 100,000 lei, he could get 80,000 lei in credit and the cost would be the difference between the interest rate on the account and the interest rate of the loan. Ultimately, it would cost him about 10 percent. We also have a fixed-amount passbook account (25,000 lei) and interest rate, which is like a type of value book. The depositor can hold onto it and he will be paid interest or he can purchase goods instead. But, the most important payment instruments are the checks that belong to the holder of a personal account. In this way, we offer the possibility to any citizen to open a personal account on the basis of which he becomes the holder of a checking account. With this account, upon acceptance, he can pay for certain services that are offered. We have already concluded agreements with 15 commercial agencies, including gas supply companies, Romtelecom, and telephone service payments, with the idea of paying with these checks rather than cash. [ROMANIA LIBERA] Can you tell us something about your loan policy? [Petculescu] With regards to credit, I would like to tell you that in January 1992, through April 1993, we were not in a position to grant loans to commercial agencies except for a 30-day loan period. For the people, we issued short-, medium-, and long-term loans. Certainly, this was a safeguard since we were required to be prudent and not make any mistakes. Despite all this, our results were very good. Under conditions where we had to operate with restrictions, the Post Bank profits in the first year were 500 million lei, while, today, in just 10 months our profit is 4.4 billion lei. We started to issue loans for a maximum term of one year and to give them to commercial agencies. Currently, about 20-25 percent of our loans go to the people and the remainder are for commercial entities. We have reached a volume of 22 billion lei for companies and 3.9 billion for the people. And, in conditions where funding sources have become very expensive, the loans for the population have become unprofitable. A recent calculation showed that if we continue to give loans to the people we will record losses of approximately 55 million lei per month. [ROMANIA LIBERA] Given that you are a still-developing bank, what seems to you to be the most important project in the future? [Petculescu] Right from the beginning we wanted to have an information system, which, currently, is being implemented, one requiring us to move through a number of stages. We are in the first stage, the creation of a prototype facility, after which we need to connect eight branches (located throughout the country), then to expand the network of all the branches to the information branch, which will be located in Bucharest. Similarly, I would stress the cooperation with the Post Bank in Holland for introducing the "Gyro" payment system, where cash payments are replaced with electronic payments. [ROMANIA LIBERA] As you well know, since the beginning of this month the National Bank increased the interest rate on overdraft loans, as well as the level of required minimum reserves. What do you think the bank was pursuing by these decisions and what are their effects? [Petculescu] According to the legal regulations, the National Bank, as the central bank, is empowered to establish and direct monetary, hard currency, and loan policy. Through the measures you mentioned, the National Bank is pursuing the avoidance of making loans without sufficient reserve funds, the restriction of loans generated by inflation, and the reduction of the amount of money in circulation.
