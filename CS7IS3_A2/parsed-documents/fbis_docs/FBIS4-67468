Simon Reddy, 27, an ecologist, will work to save threatened birds, fish and animals along one of Britain's wildest and most beautiful shorelines. Environmentalists say the quantity and range of sea life in the region makes it one of the most important marine habitats in Europe. Mr Reddy's area of responsibility includes the whole of Cardigan Bay, home to a family of about 100 bottle-nosed dolphins and one of only two permanent locations the sea mammal populates in the Europe's northern waters. Killer whales can frequently be seen basking in the bay on their way to and from their breeding grounds. Naturalists also have evidence that larger whales are arriving in the area, with one confirmed sighting of a fin whale which can grow to 80 ft long and weigh up to 80 tons. Other breeds of dolphin and porpoise also use the bay as well as the occasional pilot whale and basking shark. Seals are a common sight around the rocky shores of the mainland and islands where the bird life includes puffins, gannets, guillemots and razor-bills. The sheltered nature of the Cardigan and Carmarthen bays means wildlife is threatened by pollution. Only three beaches along the whole of the Welsh coast -- at Cefn Sidan, near Llanelli, Whitesands, at St Davids, and the North Beach in Tenby, Dyfed -- carry European "blue flag" status for cleanliness. The environment is also under threat from noise pollution from jet skis and boats. According to the Dyfed Wildlife Trust many of the wild dolphins they have photographed have scars caused by the propellors of speeding boats they try to race. Mr Reddy, who was educated at Aberdeen University and has worked for Greenpeace on its campaign ship, Solo, said: "It is a wonderful stretch of coastline but it is obviously in need of our help to address the various problems it now faces." His work is aimed at helping the long-term objective of having the coastal waters designated a Marine Protected Area. His appointment and associated work is initially funded for two years through Â£50,000 raised by the Dyfed Wildlife Trust and the same amount of EC grant money. It is hoped the post will become permanent.
