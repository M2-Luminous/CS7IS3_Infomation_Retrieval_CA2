Hata will meet president and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin on Sunday before returning home later in the day, the officials said. The China visit will be the first by Hata since he became foreign minister and concurrently deputy prime minister in the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last August. Hata and Qian met three times last year. North Korea's refusal of international inspections of its suspected nuclear facilities may be high on the agenda for talks between Hata and Qian, government sources said.
