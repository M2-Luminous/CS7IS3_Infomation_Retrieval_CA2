Mr. Gogov's [former deputy head of the Interior Ministry Operative Department] press conference clearly showed police leaders Frckovski [minister of internal affairs], Bogoevski [undersecretary in the intelligence service], and Gjurev must leave immediately. Fabricating political processes against innocent people was a feature of totalitarian Stalinist-communist regimes, but Macedonia is obviously not immune to this. Democracy and human rights are continually being narrowed by the current true dictatorship, the announcement says. The party demands that the Interior Ministry officially explain the role of the recently killed high inspector Dimce Ristovski in revealing a crime including over a million German marks, with a presumable involvement of the minister of health, Jovan Tofovski. The party also appealed to Pavle Trajanov, in the name of democracy and the future of the Macedonian state, to publicly reveal government's attempts to discredit him in the eyes of the public, and state other fabricated cases, as well as the government involvement in organized crime in the country.
