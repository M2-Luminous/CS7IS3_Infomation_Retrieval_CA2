FR940506-0-00027 FR940506-0-00012 The revised data sets submitted by Working Groups 1 & 2, and adopted by the Commission have accommodated KGPC's concern. The operationally available capacity data set includes fields permitting pipelines to post unsubscribed capacity available at receipt and delivery points, as KGPC states it does now. Once a potential shipper submits a request for a capacity path that is available, the pipeline would then post the offer for that path in the offer data set. C. Information on Firm and Interruptible Flowing Volume NGSA and NGC contend the Commission needs to require additional information to satisfy the pipelines' obligations to post available firm and interruptible service. 21 NGSA asserts the firm capacity available through capacity release is only a piece of the total picture of firm capacity needed by potential shippers. NGSA contends the Commission also should require pipelines to post the total amount of unscheduled (potentially available) firm capacity. NGC contends potential shippers cannot make reasonable pricing decisions unless they know flowing primary firm volumes, flowing secondary firm volumes, flowing interruptible volumes, and unscheduled volumes. KGPC, on the other hand, maintains that the Commission should not require the posting of any information in addition to the unscheduled capacity already required. 21 18 CFR 284.8(b)(3). Working Groups 1 & 2 were unable to reach consensus on whether to require additional information about firm and interruptible volumes or nominations at each point. Their February 24, 1994 report contained papers from three groups on this issue. One group 22 supported the arguments of NGSA and NGC that detailed information about flowing firm and interruptible volumes is needed for shippers to make informed decisions about the capacity to purchase. 22 Ad hoc Group of Power Generators, American Iron & Steel Institute, Amoco Production Company, Baltimore Gas & Electric, Chevron U.S.A. Production Company, Conoco, Inc., Destec Energy, Edison Electric Institute, Fuel Manager's Association, Gaslantic Corporation, GPM Gas Corporation, Marathon Oil Company, Natural Gas Clearinghouse, New England Power Company, O & R Energy Inc., Oryx Gas Marketing Company, Oryx Energy Company, Phillips Gas Marketing Company, Phillips Petroleum, Company, Process Gas Consumers, Texaco Gas Marketing, Inc., Vastar Gas Marketing, Inc., Virginia Power Company. A second group 23 opposes providing any additional data. They contend the information is not readily available, the costs of providing it would be high, and the information is not related to capacity release. They also assert the information would tilt the capacity release market to favor capacity seekers at the expense of capacity holders. Whenever the information showed that significant interruptible volumes are scheduled to flow, they maintain the value of released firm capacity would be devalued. They further contend the now devalued released capacity will displace interruptible pipeline capacity, thereby reducing the interruptible revenue credits provided to firm shippers. 23 ANR Pipeline Company, Brooklyn Union Gas Company, Colorado Interstate Gas Company, Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership, Koch Gateway, Natural Gas Pipeline Company, Transco Gas Pipeline, Williston Basin. A third group 24 submitted a compromise seeking to balance the need for information about flowing volumes with the costs of providing that information. Under their proposal, the pipelines would provide a ``flag'' indicating that interruptible volumes are flowing at a point which would otherwise have no operationally available capacity. They assert that this flag would alert both buyers and sellers that firm capacity at the point is available and could be valuable: if interruptible volumes are flowing at a point that is operationally full, a purchaser of firm capacity could bump the interruptible shippers. 25 They assert the cost of providing this flag is less than the cost of providing the estimated quantities. 24 Algonquin Gas Transmission, Consolidated Natural Gas, East Tennessee Natural Gas, Enron Corp., Kern River Gas Transmission, Midcon, Midwestern Gas Transmission, National Registry, Natural Gas Pipe Line, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Producer-Marketer-Transportation Group, Southern California Edison, Southern California Gas, Tennessee Gas Pipeline, Texas Eastern Transmission, Trunkline Gas Company, Washington Gas, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline. 25 If the shipper sought to use interruptible transportation, it might not be able to receive service if the point was constrained. Its ability to receive service would depend on the pipeline's tariff mechanism for allocating interruptible capacity when requests exceed demand. Public notice of these filings was given on March 3, 1994, and the PEC Pipeline Group submitted a comment supporting the interruptible flag proposal. It contends the flag provides a reliable indicator of the availability of firm capacity (by showing that interruptible gas is flowing), but at a fraction of the cost of the proposal to post flowing volumes.
