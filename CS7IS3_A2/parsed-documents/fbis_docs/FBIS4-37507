But this crisis has an Israeli angle no matter what happens. Even if we assume that a solution would be found to the crisis, and Pyongyang renounces nuclear weapons and meets the terms for outside supervision, for Israel it would mean that the time is approaching when the international community would insist that it join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). The club of states suspected of developing nuclear weapons will be reduced, and it is only natural that there will be an effort to cut it back even further prior to the treaty's renewal in 1995. Israel is unlike North Korea in every way, but on that issue it might look like an obstacle to an improved world order, and that would make it more difficult for Israel to explain why the time has still not come to join the treaty when it is renewed next year. The Korean crisis must teach Israel one other thing: That small states cannot cut themselves off from the NPT as they please even if they have good reasons for doing so. The current treaty says that each signatory state has the right to pull out after giving three-months notice of its intention, which is what North Korea did. Yet North Korea found that it had joined a club that includes ties to a Catholic marriage, which does not recognize divorce. An attempt to withdraw from the treaty for any reason could bring sanctions and even a military confrontation with the international community. There is a difference between somebody suspected of possessing nuclear weapons, but is not a signatory to the treaty, and somebody suspected of violating the treaty, the policy toward the latter being much tougher. A North Korean victory in the current struggle would complicate matters greatly for the international community, but for Israel it could end with a direct threat. The threat does not come directly from North Korea. The immediate circle affected would be the Far East. North Korea's neighbors would find it hard to go on with normal business while its radical neighbor arms itself with nuclear weapons. In Japan, which has large quantities of plutonium, the demand to develop nuclear weapons despite its troubled past would swell. The same is true for South Korea and Taiwan. Regional stability would be undermined, something China also fears. The second circle to be affected is made up of states like Iran and Iraq, and perhaps also Algeria in the future. If Washington fails in its stand off with Pyongyang, why should Tehran be put off developing nuclear weapons, and why should Saddam Husayn not go back to his old plan after sanctions are lifted on Iraq? It is only natural that Tehran and Baghdad have a direct interest in what is currently happening in the Korean peninsula. Washington therefore views the conflict as a confrontation over world order and not only as an attempt to restrain the North Korean regime. The danger to Israel also derives from the possibility of Korean aid to others developing nuclear weapons and the sale of vital components. There can always be a negative precedent, especially when so much money is involved. There is no need to sell a nuclear bomb, it is sufficient merely to accelerate the development stage, and there is surely somebody prepared to pay huge amounts for that. North Korea has already made a major breakthrough in the field of surface-to-surface missiles (in Syria, Iran, and previously in Egypt) and we should not rule out the possibility that could also take place in the nuclear field. There is an impression that none of the players, direct or indirect, in the Korean crisis want war. They all want to achieve their aims without using force, and this includes North Korea. South Korea is in a very sensitive position. If war breaks out it would be conducted on its soil. The capital Seoul is located some 32 km from the border. Some 16 million South Koreans live in the northern part of the country and if North Korean divisions invade there would be huge damage, and from their viewpoint, it does not matter if the North is finally defeated. Japan and China also do not want a military solution to the crisis. South Korean intelligence says that the Pyongyang regime is expected to collapse sooner or later due to the economic crisis and the north's isolation from the international community. The Americans respond by saying: What would happen if North Korea manages to produce nuclear weapons before the downfall of its ruler? Will it then be possible to return the nuclear genie back into the bottle? It seems that U.S. intelligence nevertheless lacks complete information on what the North Koreans have already achieved. What they have is the report that the north has a certain quantity of plutonium and that tests have already been conducted on detonators for nuclear weapons. From Washington's point of view, it is a race against time and its tactics toward the crisis are largely derived from that. The goal is to achieve the aims as soon as possible without sparking a general conflagration. It is clear that North Korea is trying to gain time thereby increasing the suspicion that it wants to be armed with nuclear weapons should war break out; or, it hopes to manage to satisfactorily hide such weapons before it is forced to sign the NPT and accept international supervision.
