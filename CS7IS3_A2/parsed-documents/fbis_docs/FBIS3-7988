This is revealed by the party's foreign policy program, even though, formally, this issue only occupies the second place after its Europe policy. However, the program accepted by the MDF's national meeting last weekend -- which, after finalization, arrived at MAGYAR HIRLAP on 24 February -- advocates foreign policy with a national basis in almost all its paragraphs, and some kind of intention to achieve a regional leading role can also be detected in it. Contrary to the big opposition parties (the Alliance of Free Democrats, the Federation of Young Democrats, and the Hungarian Socialist Party) whose program documents are scientifically based, were made with foreign affairs professional methods, and which also clarify theoretical issues, the MDF's foreign policy program is structured around election slogans ("We Have Preserved and Will Keep Our Country's Stability" or "Let the Hungarians Be the Motor of Development," "Let the National Minorities of Europe Have a Fair Future," and so on) and it does not deal with theoretical issues. The MDF program names two major foreign political goals. The first one is full engagement in the life of developed Europe, and the second one is "establishing good relations with the neighboring countries such a way that this is concomitant with the lasting settlement of the situation of minority Hungarian national communities." This hierarchy of goals does not essentially differ from the priorities of the major opposition parties but almost all paragraphs of the MDF's program are permeated with the fact that the Hungarians beyond the border nevertheless have priority. All the MDF program says about the issue of joining the European organizations is that "Hungary cannot be left out," but it does not talk about the necessary preparations. About NATO membership, it says that "the possibility of a full NATO membership has opened before us" but it does not deal with the problems posed by a possible NATO membership (the ones that can be raised, for example, if Hungary and its neighbors are not accepted into NATO at the same time). The intention to acquire a regional leading role is the other important characteristic of the program. "It is the MDF's goal that, with the help of its policies and in accordance with our central position, Hungarians become an organizing force in Central Europe's economy through the abilities and industrious nature of our people." In other places, the program allows it to be felt that the MDF sees Hungary as an example to be followed by the neighboring countries. The notion that was also part of the government program four years ago can again be seen: Relations with non-neighboring countries should be subordinated to politics relating to the Hungarians beyond the border. The MDF again declares that such relations have to be formed with the more distant countries which serve the interests relating to the Hungarians living beyond the border. According to the MDF, the improvement of the Hungarian minorities's situation beyond the border is a task of the Hungarian Government's foreign policy. The program states that the national minorities have the right to self-determination, including territorial autonomy; it emphasizes that the application of collective national minority rights has to be urged at all international forums (which, however, is usually received with suspicion at the moment in Europe). The program devotes much space to praising the achievements, and it attributes certain facts to the MDF's merit which did not have much to do with the MDF (for example, Hungary's acceptance to the Council of Europe in 1990, a few months after the establishment of the MDF government).
