The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] Party has been complaining about an alleged presence of Tanzanian citizens in Matibane and Cabeceira posts in Mossuril District, as well as at Mozambique Isle. A communique issued by the Renamo provincial branch in Nampula accuses the Mossuril district government of interfering with the voter registration process by illegally establishing mobile voter registration centers in the district when, according to it, there should only be fixed centers. The Renamo political leadership in Nampula says the acting Mossuril district administrator has been diverting the attention of people by announcing the distribution of food in voter registration centers, allegedly to prevent them from registering as voters. The Renamo communique sent to our news desk says government officials have been exacting taxes from civilians in voter registration centers. It cited as examples the areas of Gelo, Larde, and Gaone, in the districts of Angoche, Moma, and Rapale, respectively. In Rapale, these alleged tax collectors were deployed by the Rapale town council mayor. Renamo also says in its communique that two men belonging to the State Information and Security Service [SISE], carrying pistols and bayonets, were recently beaten up by civilians when they tried to kill two Renamo election monitors. Renamo also says that voter registration teams at Mapipine Ward, on the outskirts of Rapale city, have not been registering Renamo members. The Renamo communique also says that at voter registration centers in Anchilo, also in the city of Nampula, voter registration photographers have been repeatedly and without controls photographing some people, particularly the head of the administrative post and the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party representative. Renamo cited photographer Jose Lopes Sumbana as having said that the pictures were just a remembrance. With regard to the uncontrolled taking of pictures, Renamo has warned that there should be no uncontrolled distribution of voter registration cards, since photographers say the uncontrolled taking of pictures has no particular purpose. In the communique, Renamo says the presence of Frelimo Party secretaries and other government elements in voter registration posts are a clear violation of the electoral law. In conclusion, Renamo calls on the Nampula Provincial Elections Commission to take necessary measures with regard to these issues. Our reporting team contacted Aurelio Monteiro das Neves, chairman of the Nampula Provincial Elections Commission, who said there is no evidence of the presence of Tanzanians in voter registration centers, despite the presence of large number of foreigners in the province. Monteiro das Neves said Renamo should come up with at least one case where a Tanzanian citizen has been registered. On other complaints in Mossuril, Moma, and Angoche, our source said it has sent a team to Mossuril District to investigate Renamo's complaints. On the alleged presence of SISE men beaten up by civilians in Rapale, the chairman of the Nampula Provincial Elections Commission, said he received information that the two were just drunks and were not even armed. On the alleged presence of ruling party members in voter registration posts, Aurelino Monteiro das Neves cited Article 50 of the electoral law which says that any legal political party can cooperate with voter registration teams, although it is up to the latter to define, without discrimination, the need for and the sphere of that cooperation. The provincial elections commission chairman said he was not informed about the issue of photographs in Anchilo, but promised to bring up the case with election officials in that administrative post. This is the second time here in Nampula that Renamo has been complaining about an alleged presence of Tanzanian citizens in the province, connected with the electoral process in Mozambique.
