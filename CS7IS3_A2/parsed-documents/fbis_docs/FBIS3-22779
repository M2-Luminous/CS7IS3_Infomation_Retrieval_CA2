Director of the research institute of nuclear reactors in the city of Dmitrovgrad on the Volga Valentin Ivanov told TASS that this is the usual way his institute transports radioactive sources to Moscow. "We usually transport to the capital similar radioactive sources in ordinary passenger trains and we had never received any complaints because they pose no danger to human health", he said. "Today the usual way of deliveries of sources of isotopes was disurpted for unknown reasons and was proclaimed criminal. This is an unpleasant misunderstanding", the director said hoping that his courier would be allowed to continue the trip.
