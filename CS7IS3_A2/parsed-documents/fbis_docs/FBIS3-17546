According to Petrov, the United States was still waiting to meet its pledges under the Russian-US-Ukrainian memorandum which was signed early this year, during President Clinton's visit to Moscow. The United States pledged to foot bills for the production of nuclear fuel in Russia whereas Russia pledged to deliver the fuel to Ukraine. The absence of the promised money could put off the delivery of fuel to Ukraine. The transfer of the nuclear ammunition from Ukraine to Russia, where it is to be turned into fuel, would take fairly long. Earlier this week Ukrainian officials, including Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy indicated that Kiev could reconsider the schedule of the transfer of the nuclear ammunition to Russia if Moscow failed to deliver fuel to the Ukrainian power plants. In Petrov's view, procrastination, on the part of the United States, could provoke a new crisis in Russian-Ukrainian relations. The United States would meet its pledges. So would Russia. But it remained unclear, said Petrov, why Kiev was apt to offer highly emotional response to purely technical problems.
