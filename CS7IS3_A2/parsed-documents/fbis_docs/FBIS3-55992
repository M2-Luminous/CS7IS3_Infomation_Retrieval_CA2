Indeed, three security agencies are ready to guard American President Bill Clinton during his visit to Russia: the Chief Security Department of the Russian Federation, the Russian Presidential Security Team, and the United States presidential Guard. The number of people who are going to be directly involved in the protection of Clinton, who arrives late Wednesday evening, will exceed several hundred, according to First Deputy Director of the Russian Security Department Yuriy Krapivin. If one counted up the number of auxiliary people somehow involved in the massive security effort, the numbers would run into the thousands. According to Krapivin, the Russian Interior Ministry will secure the U.S. President's travel routes and the sites which are included in the programme of his visit. The interior troops will also protect the "Radisson Slawjanskaja" hotel where President Clinton is scheduled to stay. The Russian Federal Counter-Espionage Service is responsible for up-to-the-minute information, including reports about possible extremist conspiracies and criminal activity in Moscow. Even the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service took part in preliminary steps to guarantee Clinton's complete security. Krapivin said that an advance group from Clinton's personal guard, which arrived with their armored cars and weapons a week ago, worked out a plan of cooperation with their Russian colleagues. The group thoroughly scouted out the president's hotel and the sites of his visits.
