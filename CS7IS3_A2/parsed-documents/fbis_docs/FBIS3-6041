The officials said the decision was made in a revision of the Securities and Exchange Law, which was made public in the official gazette. They said the new law makes it mandatory for companies listed on the market to disclose information related to forward exchange contracts. It will mean revealing the outstanding amount of contracts and their value in yen terms at the time the contracts were signed and at the end of their business terms. The officials said the decision was in line with recommendations made last June by an advisory panel for the finance and trade ministers. Investors have raised demands for the disclosure of such information since last year after Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. suffered a loss of more than 100 billion yen in forward exchange contracts.
