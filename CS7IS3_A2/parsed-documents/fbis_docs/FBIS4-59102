Citizens in all governorates of the republic were happy to meet the officers and soldiers who joined the forces of legitimacy, as well as those who have given themselves up to these forces, which are heroically and faithfully waging the battles of honor to protect unity and defend constitutional legitimacy. It goes without saying that the sons of our people are confident and certain that the end of the gang of apostasy and secession is close. While we say this, we expect the citizens in Aden not only to help the forces of unity, which are on the verge of entering Aden, but to prevent the gang of apostasy and secession from escaping and to arrest it so that it will receive the punishment it deserves. We urge the citizens in Aden to arrest the gang of apostasy and secession, which has sowed corruption and exterminated defenseless people and from whose repression and injustice thousands have suffered over many decades, because we are confident that the inhabitants of Aden yearn for salvation from those who have transformed their lives into an inferno of misery, forcing the people into deprivation and poverty. We do not doubt for one moment that the unionists within the YSP, who have experienced persecution and oppression at the hands of a handful whose code of conduct consists of physical liquidation of those who protest or criticize, will also seriously participate in pursuing the gang of apostasy and corruption, and will exert the utmost effort to arrest them, given that this is a national duty dictated by genuine citizenship, and the affiliation to the Arab and Muslim Yemeni people who are committed to unity and democracy, and whose sons are bound together by the strongest bonds since early history. We thank God for the successes of the Armed Forces defending unity and we wish them success in their military operations to bring down the strongholds of the units taking orders from the gang of apostasy and secession. We also express appreciation to the officers and soldiers who continue to join the ranks of their brothers who defend unity and constitutional legitimacy for their concern to stand where the people want them to stand. National duty dictates that they carry arms for the sake of unity, to protect democracy, and impose the respect of constitutional legitimacy. All the citizens in Aden, whose outskirts have been reached by the forces defending unity and constitutional legitimacy, are dutybound to prevent the escape of the gang of apostasy and secession, which has rebelled against constitutional legitimacy and which has ignited an all-out war to drown the sons of the one homeland in blood and to sow destruction and death in all its parts. But God has frustrated their hopes. This gang has only a few hours left before it faces the shameful fate it deserves.
