Dublin and London, presenting a united front, are seeking to induce Sinn Fein to attend all-party talks. The carrot is to be implicit acknowledgement of Sinn Fein's legitimacy. The stick is the implicit threat to Sinn Fein of a permanent future in outer darkness, if the party and its IRA terrorist arm refuse to renounce violence. For weeks now, Mr Adams has been prevaricating over a decision on whether Sinn Fein will accept the terms for talks; meanwhile IRA violence has continued. It remains highly uncertain whether, in the end, the terrorists will come to the conference table. Yet, even while the outcome is in suspense, the Washington Administration has accorded Sinn Fein's president a visa. The American Government was never in any doubt that the British were strongly opposed to such a concession at this stage. It is difficult, therefore, not to interpret Washington's action as a snub to the British Government, at a time when Anglo-American relations are already poor -- as Anne Applebaum argues on this page. Many Americans, along with British opponents of the Downing Street Declaration, argue that since the Westminster Government has shown its willingness to traffic with IRA spokesmen, the American Government can scarcely be blamed for granting Sinn Fein's leader temporary house-room. But the consequence, in any event, is to give some comfort to Sinn Fein, while emphasizing the current divide between Westminster and Washington. The British Government is left to try to divine some possible benefit from Mr Adams's trip. It is plain that labyrinthine discussions are taking place within the IRA about the Downing Street Declaration and the case for joining talks. Sinn Fein's leader continues to profess his own desire to "bring an end to the IRA and take the gun out of Irish politics." Optimists suggest that his American visit might strengthen his hand within his own movement, to win the argument for laying down arms. It will be important to watch both how Mr Adams conducts himself in the United States, and how the American Government and the Irish-American lobby handle him. The hope must be that they will encourage him towards the conference table, if only to gain some political kudos for doing so. We, like the British Government, would have much preferred that Washington had not granted Mr Adams his visa; and that the United States should have made common cause with Dublin and Westminster in maintaining pressure on Sinn Fein unless or until the IRA declares an unconditional cease-fire. The Clinton Administration's fumbles and stumbles in foreign policy make it difficult to regard any American initiative over Ireland with enthusiasm. But the decision to admit Gerry Adams sends a more significant signal about the current state of Anglo-American relations than about the prospects for the Northern Irish peace process.
