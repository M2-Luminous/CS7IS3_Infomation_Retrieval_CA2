After the meeting, Papoulias told correspondents that the president has a personal interest in the issues they discussed. Furthermore, Papoulias said the latest scenarios about a double or triple name for Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] are not realistic. He added that the Greek side does not have any particular expectations from the visit of U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz. The U.S. President's special envoy, Papoulias said, came to Greece to sound out the Greek Government and relay its views on the national issue to Skopje. On Nimetz's visit, Papoulias said: When there is a negotiation on some ideas, there should be an effort by the negotiators. This is logical. If this effort were at a standstill, then Nimetz would not have come to Athens. Papoulias concluded by saying that he will be holding a news conference after his meeting with Nimetz to provide more details on the issue.
