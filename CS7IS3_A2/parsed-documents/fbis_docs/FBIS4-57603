In a communique, the ruling party said that from now on, Balaguer's followers are declaring themselves "on permanent vigil to defend Joaquin Balaguer's triumph." Based on provisional results announced by the Central Electoral Board, JCE, Balaguer is reportedly the virtual winner of the 16 May elections. Opposition candidate Francisco Pena Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) has contested the results. The most recent results released by the JCE showed Balaguer leading with a margin of 1.01 percent over Pena Gomez. The JCE, however, has yet to review the irregularities reported by Pena Gomez, who claims that approximately 200,000 opposition militants were not in the electoral registry. The charges made by the Social Democratic candidate were supported by international observers who supervised the elections. Representatives from the business sector, the Catholic Church, and the media have issued a call to the JCE to seek a solution to the postelectoral crisis and prevent possible street riots. Although there have been no acts of disorder so far, the authorities decided to deploy Army and National Police troops in Santo Domingo and along roads leading to the capital. The troops have been confiscating small arms from the civilian population.
