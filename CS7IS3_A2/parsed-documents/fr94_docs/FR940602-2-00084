FR940602-2-00084 FR940602-2-00046 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Land Management [NM&hyph;030&hyph;7122&hyph;03&hyph;8532] Proposed Reestablishment of the Copper Flat Mine in Sierra County, NM AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Notice of Scoping Meetings. . SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Las Cruces District Office, will be directing the preparation of an EIS to be prepared by a third party contractor. The EIS will describe the potential impacts of the proposed re-establishment of the Copper Flat open-pit copper mining project located approximately 5 miles northeast of Hillsboro in Sierra County, New Mexico. The proposed Copper Flat Project would re-establish an open-pit copper mining operation at a site that was developed and operated from April 1982 to July 1982. All surface facilities were removed from the site in 1986 and a BLM-approved reclamation plan was implemented. The proposed Copper Flat Project would resume mining operations at the site and would reconstruct the associated processing facilities. The proposed project would mine and process an average of 16,500 tons of ore per day over a projected operating life of at least 10 years. The public is invited to participate in the planning process. Public scoping meetings will be held at the following times and locations: Time/Date and Location 7 p.m. June 22, 1994: Truth or Consequences Civic Center, 400 West Forth Avenue, Truth or Consequences, New Mexico 7 p.m. June 23, 1994: Hillsboro Community Center (in the old High School Building), Hillsboro, New Mexico. DATES: Written comments on the scoping process will be accepted through July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Russell Jentgen, Bureau of Land Management, 1800 Marquess, Las Cruces, New Mexico 88005. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Russell Jentgen, BLM Las Cruces District Office, at (505) 525&hyph;4351. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Gold Express Corporation submitted a Plan of Operations to BLM proposing to re-establish the Copper Flat Project in 1991. As required by NEPA, an Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the proposed Plan of Operations. Based on comments received on the EA and BLM's evaluation of the environmental impacts described in the EA, BLM notified Gold Express Corporation by letter dated October 7, 1993, that an EIS would need to be prepared before the BLM could approve the proposed Plan of Operations. Alta Gold Co. (Alta) acquired an option to purchase the Copper Flat Project from Gold Express Corporation in July 1993 and has exercised the option.
