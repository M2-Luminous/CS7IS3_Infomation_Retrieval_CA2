For the daily of the Party for Progress and Socialism (PPS/leftist opposition) such a decision is a blatant evidence that Algeria is undermining the settlement process of the Sahara issue and the UN efforts as well. Referring to JEUNE AFRIQUE weekly which reported in its latest issue that Algeria had recently [resumed] supplying weapons and spare parts to the `Polisario', the daily noted that that news was circulated immediately after the statements of the Algerian ambassador to Madrid and the threat to resort again to armed struggle against Morocco voiced lately by [Polisario leader] Mohamed Abdelaziz.
