FBIS3-33510 "drlat037__a94004" FBIS-LAT-94-037-A Document Type:Daily Report 24 February 1994 ANNEX Argentina Targets of `Political Violence' Ranked 94SM0223C Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 24 Jan 94 p 14--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94SM0223C Buenos Aires LA NACION Language: Spanish Article Type:CSO [Text] As has been reflected in a poll recently devised by the Studies Center for the New Majority, during the past eight years the trade unions appear as the principal victims of the political violence in our country. The same survey shows that the trade unions are followed by the news media and the Armed Forces as the preferred targets of those attacks. The Fluctuations in Violence Within the aforementioned period, political violence increased significantly throughout the second part of ex-President Raul Alfonsin's administration, and declined appreciably in 1990, during the term of President Carlos Menem. It rose the following year, and declined again in both 1992 and 1993. Based on the type of act whereby the aggression materialized, out of a total of 2,033 cases, 1,100 (43 percent) involved physical attacks; 551 (22 percent), threats; 327 (23 percent), bombs exploding; 306 (12 percent), shootings; 129 (5 percent), bombs set that failed to explode; and 67 (3 percent), attacks of an incendiary type. The remaining 26 (1 percent) belong in the "others" category, since they cannot be ranked in the aforementioned categories. During 1993, there was an obvious heightening of sociopolitical violence in the months preceding the elections (July, August, and September). A significant decline occurred in the final quarter, during which only the incidents that occurred last December in Santiago del Estero Province demonstrated a rise in that type of violence. Violence, Not Terrorism The poll clearly indicates that the political violence in Argentina has occurred on a level of harassment and intimidation. It has not reached the level of terrorist acts, as has happened in other Latin Latin American countries, such as Peru and Colombia, or in Spain and Great Britain, on the European continent. From a geographical standpoint, it attests to the fact that the Federal Capital and Buenos Aires Province account for over 80 percent of this type of incident. Demographic concentration, added to the conglomerate of news media in that area, help to explain this phenomenon. bc/SIMMS/nls 22/1445Z Feb
