FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rosemary DeLeone or Harry-Todd Astrov of the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Income Tax and Accounting, (202) 622&hyph;4970 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 30, 1987, and August 7, 1987, temporary regulations under section 263A were published in the Federal Register (TD 8131, 52 FR 10052 and TD 8148, 52 FR 29375). A public hearing was held on December 7, 1987. On August 9, 1993, final regulations under section 263A were published in the Federal Register (TD 8482, 58 FR 42198). In addition, a notice of proposed rulemaking was published on August 9, 1993, (58 FR 42263) regarding certain provisions that were reserved in the final regulations. A public hearing was held on November 30, 1993, on these provisions. After consideration of the public comments regarding the proposed regulations, the regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. Explanation of Statutory Provisions Section 263A (the uniform capitalization rules) was enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99&hyph;514, 100 Stat. 2085, 1986&hyph;3 C.B. (Vol. 1) (the 1986 Act). The statute was amended as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100&hyph;203, 101 Stat. 1330, 1987&hyph;3 C.B. 1 (the 1987 Act), the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;647, 102 Stat. 3342, 1988&hyph;3 C.B. 1 (the 1988 Act), and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101&hyph;239, 103 Stat. 2106 (the 1989 Act), 1990&hyph;1 C.B. 210. Section 263A provides a uniform set of rules that govern the capitalization of direct and indirect costs associated with property produced and property acquired for resale. Specifically, section 263A requires taxpayers to capitalize the direct and indirect costs properly allocable to real property and tangible personal property that they produce. Section 263A also requires taxpayers to capitalize the direct and indirect costs (including purchasing, handling, and storage costs) properly allocable to real property and personal property acquired for resale. The final regulations under section 263A that were published on August 9, 1993, generally require handling costs to be capitalized. Handling costs include costs attributable to processing, assembling, repackaging, transporting, and other similar activities, provided these activities do not come within the meaning of the term ``produce'' as defined in ยง1.263A&hyph;2(a)(1). However, the final regulations under section 263A also provide that certain handling costs are not required to be capitalized. For instance, handling costs incurred at a retail sales facility with respect to property sold to retail customers at the facility are not required to be capitalized. In addition, handling costs incurred at a dual-function storage facility with respect to property sold to customers from the facility are not required to be capitalized to the extent that the costs are incurred with respect to property sold in on-site sales. The final regulations under section 263A that were published on August 9, 1993, reserve several provisions previously contained in the temporary regulations relating to certain other costs that were not considered handling costs. In particular, the regulations reserve provisions relating to distribution costs, custom-order delivery costs, and repackaging costs. After publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and considering public comments, these final regulations provide rules concerning such costs. In addition, these final regulations provide rules that permit the District Director to require appropriate adjustments to the valuation of inventories and other property subject to section 263A if a transfer of property is made to another person for a principal purpose of avoiding the application of section 263A. Public Comments The Scope of Distribution Costs The proposed regulations provide that distribution costs are not required to be capitalized. The proposed regulations define distribution costs as any transportation costs incurred outside a storage facility in delivering goods to an unrelated customer. For this purpose, the proposed regulations state that any costs incurred on a loading dock are treated as incurred outside a storage facility.
