FR940224-1-00054 FR940224-1-00011 A consultation was conducted by NMFS under the Endangered Species Act in 1993 to determine if the fishery, as it was being managed under the FMP at that time, would jeopardize the continued existence of sea turtles. A Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement were issued June 10, 1993, that indicated the fishery is not likely to adversely affect any endangered or threatened species of sea turtle, nor will it adversely affect any critical habitat of any listed sea turtle species during the 1-year term of the Opinion. An incidental take of 752 turtles was established. Several conservation recommendations and reasonable and prudent measures were included in the Opinion and Statement, which are in an Appendix to this Amendment 7. Through complementary actions, the Council has also concurred with establishment of a mandatory observer program and an electronic vessel monitoring system requirement for the longline fishery. These measures were included in the Opinion and Statement. The proposed amendment will be evaluated for compliance with the Biological Opinion during the public review process for Amendment 7. The conservation of sea turtles is a special concern. In the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement, NMFS included a conservation recommendation that the FMP be amended to preclude increases in longline effort until it is demonstrated that the take of turtles is being managed at a level that will not preclude recovery of the species. Amendment 7 would establish a cap on potential harvesting capacity by allowing vessel upgrades only to the size of the largest vessel active in the moratorium period. The amendment indicates that it is likely there will be some shift to larger vessels on average, and that larger vessels generally deploy fewer hooks per set than small vessels. Effort is not expected to increase above that which would have occurred if all the vessels in the fleet had been active in the moratorium. As noted, the amendment also proposes framework measures to allow rapid regulatory response to new information, including indications of need for management changes for protected resources. In separate actions, the Council has concurred with establishment of a mandatory observer program and a vessel monitoring system requirement. In the Council's view, these measures taken together are sufficient to control growth of the longline fishery and address future conservation problems with new actions, if necessary, and the amendment complies with the Biological Opinion and incidental take statement. NMFS specifically solicits comments on this issue. Classification Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary to publish regulations proposed by a Council within 15 days of receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time, the Secretary has not determined that Amendment 7 is consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. In making that determination, the Secretary will take into account the data, views, and comments received during the comment period. This action is not subject to review under E.O. 12866. The Council prepared a combined draft FMP amendment/Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) covering the impacts of the fishery as managed under this amendment and alternative approaches. The final amendment/final EIS satisfies NEPA requirements for documentation and analysis of the impacts of the fishery on the environment. A consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was conducted in 1993 and NMFS issued a Biological Opinion (Opinion) and Incidental Take Statement (Statement) in June 1993 concerning the take of sea turtles in the longline fishery. The Opinion concluded that the fishery, as managed by the FMP at that time, is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species during the one-year period of the Opinion. An incidental take of 752 turtles was set for the one year during which the Opinion is in effect. This rule, if adopted, is expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Hawaii longline vessel owners (approximately 166) will have more flexibility to buy and sell vessels and permits and to upgrade their fishing vessels to compete more effectively in the domestic longline fishery, as well as with foreign fleets. It is estimated that total revenue from longline landings would increase to $60 million per year from about $45 million in 1992. The final amendment/FEIS also is written to serve as an IRFA intended to satisfy the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This rule includes changes in an information collection previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB No. 0648&hyph;0204). A request for approval of these modifications and extension of the collections is included in a request submitted by the Southwest Region, NMFS, for approval of modification and extension of that collection that covers all Southwest Region fishery permit programs. The proposed program would require prospective participants in the Hawaii longline fishery to submit permit application forms and supporting information, including a current Certificate of Documentation from the U.S. Coast Guard, to obtain a permit under the new limited entry program. Landings records from the existing Hawaii longline logbook reporting requirement will be used to determine whether an individual has met any landings requirement to qualify for a permit. The estimated burden on the applicants is 30 minutes per application. This is less than the average of 1 hour or more that had been required for applications for permits in the moratorium period because those applications often involved documentation demonstrating intent to enter the longline fishery at a time when investment decisions were made. The documentation requirements under the new permit program will be simpler. This rule also restates requirements for the submission of logbooks and post-landing notifications. These requirements have already been approved by OMB under Control Number 0648&hyph;0214. The response times for these requirements were estimated to be 5 minutes per day for the logbook and 5 minutes per notification. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these collection-of-information requirements, including suggestions for reducing burden, to the Director of the Southwest Region, NMFS, and to OMB (see ADDRESSES ).
