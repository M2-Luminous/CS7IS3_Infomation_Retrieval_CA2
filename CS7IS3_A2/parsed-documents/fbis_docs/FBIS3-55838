As far as one can tell from what Russian diplomats are saying, Moscow is prepared to accept Latvia's story: The arrest of the two generals and seizure of the military facilities was the work of extremists operating without the republic leadership's knowledge. This was effectively admitted by Andrey Kozyrev as well. "A very crude provocation has occurred in Latvia," he said in a television interview. "It may be a provocation against the line of the Latvian authorities and president themselves." At the same time, according to the Russian minister, the generals' arrest was carried out by "armed territorial defense representatives, that is, government forces." A spokesman for the Latvian Embassy in Moscow described this information as not entirely accurate: "In fact, the action was carried out mainly by the municipal police; that is, forces indirectly subordinate to Andrejs Rucs -- head of Riga's Vidzeme Rayon. As for members of territorial defense subunits, they participated in the operation on their own initiative, without the approval of the republic authorities." According to information from embassy staff, Rucs was dismissed on 11 January. Criminal proceedings have now been instituted against him. He is accused of exceeding his official authority and of unlawful arrest. To all appearances, the explanations from the Latvian authorities satisfied the members of the Russian delegation who flew to Riga on Monday for a further round of consultations on the withdrawal of forces. On the morning of 11 January the Russian delegation head, special envoy Sergey Zotov, agreed to start the talks that had been called off the day before as a protest against the arrest of the generals. Diplomats in Riga and Moscow chose not to exaggerate the incident. Nonetheless it is clear to both sides that certain political forces are behind Andrejs Rucs, and further provocations, including armed provocations, against the Russian military cannnot be ruled out. The deadline for the final withdrawal of forces has not yet been agreed -- negotiations are continuing. The likelihood is that Riga will ultimately accept the schedule proposed by the Russians: The last soldier is to leave Latvian territory before 1 September 1994.
