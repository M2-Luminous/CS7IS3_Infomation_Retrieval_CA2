A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Kiev, Yevgeny Tyurin, told Interfax-Ukraine Thursday [17 March] that Smolyakov had drawn the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's attention to the "anti-Russian" lecture given by the Ukrainian ambassador to Canada, Viktor Batyuk, at the University of Ottawa. According to Russian sources, Batyuk described Russia's foreign policy as "undeclared cold war against Ukraine aimed at destabilizing its internal political situation" and that of Ukraine towards Russia as "anti-imperial." The Russian diplomat said "such statements and other unfriendly actions" of this kind do not contribute to the development of Russo-Ukrainian relations in the context of agreements reached by the two countries' presidents and do not strengthen their good-neighborly relations in accordance with the foreign policy guidelines passed by the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet.
