International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai made the pledge during his meeting with Syzdyk Abishev, Kazakhstan's deputy premier in charge of economic affairs, who is accompanying President Nursultan Nazarbayev on a four-day visit to Japan since Wednesday. Kazakhstan will become the first country among the five former Soviet republics in Central Asia to receive Japan's trade insurance coverage. As a first step, Japan will apply the insurance to two facility expansion projects for the Karaganda steel mill in line with a credit line of 300 million dollars established last year, a MITI official told a press conference. Kumagai also told Abishev that Japan is prepared to accept trade insurance for Kazakhstan's new oil pipeline project if certain conditions on loan repayments are met, the official said. Japan also decided to give technological assistance to Kazakhstan, including cooperation in a copper exploration project, while it will assist restructuring efforts at the Karaganda steel mill, the MITI official said. Abishev asked Japanese companies to redouble their investments in Kazakhstan, noting that only three Japanese firms are now involved in joint ventures with Kazakh companies. Kumagai said Japanese firms will probably respond favorably if investment conditions in the country improve.
