[passage omitted] This evening Prime Minister Lyuben Berov met the leaders of the Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR). Speaking on the behalf of the GOR, set up recently by defectors of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, Aleksandur Tomov told the prime minister the group will support the cabinet at the no-confidence vote. The GOR representatives voiced their concern over the fact that the government is subject to political pressure aimed at personnel changes in the Interior Ministry before the investigation has concluded.
