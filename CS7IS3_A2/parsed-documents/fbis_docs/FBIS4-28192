FBIS4-28192 "dreas110_c_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 North Korea Japanese Police `Crackdown' Criticized Japanese Police `Crackdown' Criticized SK0706060294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0447 GMT 7 Jun 94 SK0706060294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The Japanese police committed another fascist brutality through a wholesale crackdown on the Kyoto Prefectural headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) in broad daylight on Monday morning amidst the ever more intensifying hostile acts of the Japanese authorities against Chongnyon, Tokyo-based Korean News Service was quoted as saying. They mobilised in an attack on the headquarters more than 250 police on the false charge of the violation of the "land law", who also searched 27 places including houses of Chongnyon officials under the headquarters. This is another unpardonable fascist suppression by the Japanese police following its crackdown upon the Osaka Prefectural organisation of Chongnyon. The Japanese authorities are these days becoming all the more malicious in their attempt to stifle the DPRK through their conspiracy and tieup with the U.S. imperialists over the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, while intensifying suppression of Chongnyon. The Japanese authorities' acts of incriminating and suppressing the righteous activities of Chongnyon, a dignified organisation of overseas citizens of the DPRK, are an expression of their undisguised hostile policy towards the DPRK and Chongnyon and a grave challenge to them. The Chongnyon organisation and Koreans in Japan are turning out in a massive protest against the outrageous suppression by the Japanese police.
