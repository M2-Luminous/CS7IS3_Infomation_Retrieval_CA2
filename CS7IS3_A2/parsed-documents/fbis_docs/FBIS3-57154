This place has now become a magnet for journalists. The reason for this is not the smooth, romantic curve of the ancient boulevard covered with a Christmassy carpet, nor the monument to Nadezhda Krupskaya in a white cap pulled down over her eyes. The reason is an old building giving onto Sretenka or, rather, its inhabitants. The top two floors of the four-story building house the headquarters of LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, whom some people call a buffoon, others the new "fuehrer," and yet others the savior of Russia's national idea. ...I encountered the first cordon in the vestibule, right after the entrance doorway covered in posters bearing the leader's portrait. Two dashing guys dressed in army peacoats carefully examined my journalist's ID card. "Fourth floor. Do you have an appointment?" A broad marble staircase with broken edges to the steps and a gaping empty shaft in the middle (all that is left of the elevator). A guard outside the door. Through it I could see another checkpoint: a table, a chair, and a man approximately 50 years old. A not very affable welcome. "About 40 of you guys have already arrived. Go to the organization department." The department was in a muddle. "Have you spoken with Viktor Vasilyevich Kobelev?" "Yes." "Then go to him," a blond woman waved me away. The senior checkpoint man raised the "barrier," but, just in case, he gave me an escort. For your information. The Sretenka building has been leased by the LDPR for approximately two years. It mainly houses the party's apparatus, broken down into departments: organization, transport and economic, agitation and propaganda, youth, and others. In all, there are approximately 25-30 people on the staff. Here, too, are Zhirinovskiy's waiting room and office and the premises of the Moscow organization's leaders. Work with regional organizations is conducted from here. The higher council meets regularly -- once every two weeks -- in the Sretenka building. It is the team which decides political directions and the strategy and tactics of the struggle. "We are like the CPSU Central Committee Politburo," LDPR First Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Vengerovskiy explained to a journalist. The "LDPR Politburo" was reelected a year ago. To all appearances, the work of the special services is one of its chief spheres of interest. Thus, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy is in charge of the party's secret service and is drawing up a project for a "Russian Intelligence Service." Deputy director of a Moscow scientific research institute (and a graduate of Moscow Aviation Institute and the Foreign Trade Academy), he has made a careful study of the history of the MOSSAD -- Israeli intelligence. Sergey Abeltsev, another council member, is responsible for counterintelligence issues and the creation of defense structures. He is currently working as deputy chairman of a joint-stock company based on one of the largest collective farms in Moscow Oblast. He has had a military education. Despite the higher council members' fine-sounding titles and the garish publicity surrounding their spheres of activity, Zhirinovskiy's real right-hand man has the modest post of deputy chairman of the LDPR. Although also a member of the "Politburo," Viktor Kobelev keeps in the shadows. But he is the man who is "boss" of the headquarters, in charge of all its activity. It is Viktor Kobelev who tightly coordinates the activities of the party (approximately 120,000 members), as was clearly manifested during the election campaign. The original LDPR candidates' list contained 160 names, which were reduced to 147. The candidates' average age is 46. The list contains just nine women (the first of them occupies only the 32d position on the list). In terms of profession half of the first 60 names (the actual number of deputies' seats) are economists, jurists, entrepreneurs, or journalists. Persons engaged in physical labor make up no more than 10 percent. The LDPR's federal list includes representatives of half of the regions of Russia, although the regions' representation is patchy. Muscovites make up half the list (80 percent of the first 60 names). The following are represented by several candidates (in decreasing order): Vologda, St. Petersburg, Pskov, Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh, Krasnoyarsk, Komi, and Udmurtia. The LDPR has its strongest positions in northwest Russia, the Volga region, and central Russia. It is weak in the south, in the Urals, and beyond the Urals. A brief conversation with the building's "boss" proved profitable. He agreed to the idea of a reportage. Could I see Zhirinovskiy? He was leaving for the airport in an hour, and there were lots of journalists wishing to see him. Maybe I could go in for a few minutes with those who had been standing in line. "Viktor Vasilyevich, the boys and I have gotten hold of 30 tonnes of gasoline. You have to give a woman a little gift." "OK, go on. Then you go!" The presence of a journalist plainly did not fit in with the "nerve center's" operation. I was given to understand that it would be more convenient if I waited in the waiting room. Initially the youth policy department somehow won people over. Particularly as the "Zhirinovskiy Rock Store" was located behind the stairs between the building's first and second floors. The range included black "metal" jackets, T-shirts, posters of hard rock stars, LDPR symbols, and...a constant din from loudspeakers. But here, behind the office door, it is all quiet. The young men in the department obviously do not get their clothes from the "rock store" -- their clothes and their hairdos are neat and tidy. From their conversation: "I am working in the security service now. Here is my valid ID card." "That's OK, that's good. We will register you, and then we will be in touch." Obviously, people were not being received into the Young Pioneers or the Boy Scouts. A young man evidently wanted to join "Zhirinovskiy's falcons" and was demonstrating his professional suitability. From closed sources. For official use. The election results in the closed precincts of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Security showed that, on the whole, the mood of the power ministries' personnel is no different from the sympathies of the majority of Russia's population. Moreover, the overall voting results in the closed precincts are still more depressing for "Russia's Choice" than in the country as a whole. On average, in closed precincts in Defense Ministry subdivisions the LDPR got 34 percent of the votes, the Communists 9 percent, and "Russia's Choice" 11 percent respectively. It is characteristic that the opposition got the largest number of votes among servicemen serving in "hot spots" (the Dniester region, Tajikistan). The LDPR got the smallest number of votes (19 percent) among Black Sea Fleet personnel, and the largest number (49 percent) among personnel of the Northwest Group of Forces. At the same time the LDPR garnered 31 percent of the votes among Military Space Forces personnel and 32 percent among servicemen in Strategic Missile Forces units. "...Have you read my book `Push to the East'? Read it." Zhirinovskiy's office is very different from the other rooms. Here you will not see ill-assorted furniture or the worn oriental carpets laid in the waiting room. A plush sofa and chairs are ranged along the wall. Above them hang reproduction portraits of Suvorov, Kutuzov, Nakhimov, and Ushakov. An icon in the corner. Behind the chairman's chair is a picture depicting the outline of Russia with Alaska adjacent to it. Over all this hovers a falcon with a fluttering ribbon banner: "Freedom, LDPR, Law." The office's chief feature is an old-style T-shaped oak table in the middle of the room. It is surrounded by carved chairs covered in dark velvet with raised roses on it. The unusually tall and pompous chair backs are surmounted by heraldic triangular shields with a watchtower carved in the center. An oak bookcase is in the same style -- a stand with carved doors. (According to the bosses, all this was made by a party member, a master cabinet maker). The book "Through the Cordilleras" lies on the case. The overall picture is completed by a political map of the world. The LDPR leader is in his element. "We are against preserving the CIS, just as we are against recreating the USSR. If anybody wants to join Russia, they are welcome, only with the rights of a territorial unit: a province or oblast. No national-state formations. "In Europe we have an alliance with Germany, because it is a major country. But Poland lies between us, and there are problems there. I know the mood in Germany -- to get back eastern Prussia, but that is part of Poland.... These, however, are Polish-German problems. "We are pro-Europe. As regards India, for example, it is our strategic ally in the East. We must set up a new axis: Germany-Russia-India. We will resolve the question of the Kuril Islands jointly with the Japanese...." The conversation took place under specific conditions. Floodlights were suspended from above, behind the LDPR chairman's chair -- two on each side, directed at the visitor. The strong, concentrated light created the illusion of being either on the stage or in the office of a Lubyanka investigator in the thirties. [Zaripov] Are you worried about the problem of Zhirinovskiy's physical removal? [Zhirinovskiy] No, because there is no getting away from fate. Lincoln had to be killed, so they killed him. Kennedy -- they killed him. Palme -- they killed him.... [Zaripov] But you have guards. [Zhirinovskiy] O-o-oh! Twenty counterintelligence officers who have been through Afghanistan, Abkhazia, and the Dniester region. Excellent guys; they handle all types of weapons. (According to Vengerovskiy, men who once guarded Brezhnev are Zhirinovskiy's personal bodyguards -- R.Z.). Half the people in my office are guards. Even at night I have a guard by me. If necessary, they will blow up this entire building. [Zhirinovskiy ends] The conversation ended on this optimistic note. Zhirinovskiy broke off his "stream of consciousness," which is almost impossible to do from the outside. The silence which was on the point of ensuing was broken by the voice of his secretary, coming through the half-open office door: "Mind, you have to pay to speak with Vladimir Volfovich. Three minutes cost $100." A mental calculation left me in no doubt: The possible cost would easily pay for a ticket to, let us say, the Cape Verde Islands. It was high time to retire home, to the motherland.
