"The defensive weapon, Patriot missiles, will soon arrive in Korea," President Kim said. "We have notified (the United States) about the deployment of Patriot missiles across South Korea." "They will arrive within the shortest time possible, since President Clinton has immediately issued an instruction calling for an immediate order," Kim added. President Kim disclosed the deployment plan during a breakfast meeting with 11 ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) postholders including Chairman Kim Chong-pil and Vice Speaker of the National Assembly Hwang Nak-chu. "The Patriot missiles and Team Spirit (the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise) are both defensive in nature," said Kim. As for the timing of this year's Team Spirit war games, the president said he will decide after returning from visits to Japan and China next week. South Korea and the United States have already agreed in principle to resume the exercise, he noted. "War on the Korean peninsula has to be prevented at any cost," the president said. "But we can defend our country only when we are strong." The government is mapping out detailed measures to deal with any provocation by North Korea, Kim said. North Korea could not make any secret military movements, Kim said, hinting that a military surveillance system is already in place and functioning. Moreover, "the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has referred the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council," Kim said. Members of the council are giving serious consideration to the opinion of the country most directly concerned, South Korea, he said. Seoul plans to maintain a joint front with Washington and close consultations will be held to confront any new development, Kim said, adding that he will also have frank talks with the leaders of Japan and China during his upcoming visits. "Last Saturday, an unimaginable situation developed at the inter- Korean contact," Kim said, referring to the violent and aggressive remarks made by the chief North Korean delegate to the Panmunjom meeting. The president explained that he convened a meeting of security- related ministers Monday to allay the people's fears in the wake of the North Korean provocation. "My visits (to Japan and China) are coming at a very sensitive time," Kim said. "The main item of concern is the North Korean issue." The government is doing its utmost to handle the problem domestically as well as internationally by remaining in close contact with the United States and other concerned countries, he said. North Korea must adapt to the rest of the world, but the problem is that its leaders believe change means the collapse of their regime, Kim said.
