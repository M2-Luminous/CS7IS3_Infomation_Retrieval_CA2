The personification of the amendments to the Judiciary System Act as "anti-Tatarchev" and "anti-Grigorov," as well as the personification of the reaction to them, may prove harmful; the laws at least should not be used as a means of obtaining personal revenge. However, it will certainly open the hearts of the people at 134 Rakovski Street [headquarters of Union of Democratic Forces, SDS] to the head of state whom they rejected more than a year ago. If, after lengthy consultations with all the parties concerned, Dr. Zhelev nonetheless decides to return the law to parliament for further drafting in the plenary hall, this will undoubtedly also make him a hero in the eyes of Europe, where people already believe that our judiciary is being recommunized. Stopping the mass privatization act will also increase the president's rating abroad. Foreign investors are staying away from Bulgaria not only because, as a Balkan country, we are considered to be a high risk, but also due to the model for privatization that we have now been arguing over for three months. Although winning a few points abroad, Dr. Zhelev will nevertheless attract the wrath of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party]. The Socialists are already wondering whom to blame because their increasingly impoverished electorate has nothing to gain from taking part in the mass privatization. It will be a veritable feat of aerobatics if the head of state finds another form of veto that will allow him to make up with the SDS without provoking an almighty quarrel with the BSP, and at the same time avoid damaging his image abroad. This would certainly mean that, after almost four years in the supreme office, Dr. Zhelev refuses to walk any longer along the edge of the precipice and is looking to win the soft, velvety caresses of the electorate. If the president acts to set people's minds at rest, in contrast to the political storm that everyone expects, this may be interpreted as meaning that the head of state is already thinking about a second term.
