New orders for the Chinese press to avoid divulging state secrets and to steer clear of "sensitive" matters were given at an unpublicised conference on media discipline jointly held last month by the Communist Party's Propaganda Department and the State Bureau of Secrecy. Instructions have also been given to all ministries and departments to adopt precautionary measures in handling requests for information by media other than Xinhua (the New China News Agency). Informed sources said the conference on media discipline was called on the instructions of President and party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, who has for the past year taken a hard line on propaganda. Speaking at the conclave, Vice-Chief of Propaganda Gong Xinhan called upon all media professionals and cadres to "do well the work of keeping state secrets. News and publication departments must take secrecy as a major item of discipline," said Mr Gong, a former propaganda official in Shanghai who is considered a protege of Mr Jiang. "The important thing is to take preventive measures and to provide journalists with the proper education about keeping state secrets. They (media workers) must also thoroughly study the regulations on secrecy." Mr Gong repeated earlier instructions by the Propaganda Department that the press must do its bit for the reform enterprise, and must refrain from "making disturbing sounds and spreading chaos". Shen Hongying, director of the State Secrecy Bureau, exhorted journalists to strike a balance between normal news gathering and safeguarding state secrets. He called upon them to work together with their news sources, particularly government units, to observe laws and regulations on secrecy and to avoid disclosing state secrets through ignorance or negligence. "We must do a thorough self-examination concerning secrecy standards," sources quoted Mr Shen as saying. "Sample checks must be made (of the work of different media). No stone should be left unturned in efforts to plug leaks. Mistakes must be rectified as soon as they are discovered." In the past two years, Beijing has passed a State Secrecy Law as well as a series of Regulations on Safeguarding Secrets in News and Publications. It is understood that units including the Propaganda Department, the News and Publication Administration, and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television have conducted sessions of "criticism and self-criticism" on how well staff in media units have obeyed the strictures. At the same time, the party General Office and the Propaganda Department have recently sent directives to party and government units asking them to be careful when handling the domestic media. "As a general principle, government departments are discouraged from granting interviews or providing information to the media except Xinhua and, on specific occasions, senior media units such as the People's Daily" said a Beijing-based editor.
