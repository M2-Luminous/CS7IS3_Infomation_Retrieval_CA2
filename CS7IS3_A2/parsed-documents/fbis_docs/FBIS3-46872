The ordinance enclosed with Decision 228/QD-NH5 by the governor general of the Vietnam State Bank was signed to take effect from Dec. 2, 1993. Under this document, the state bank will allow any Vietnamese commercial stock bank which has had more than one year of profitable operation [to] establish external banking relations, and the governor general of the state bank will allow any commercial stock bank which has a prescribed capital of 50 billion VND [Vietnam dong] (5 million USD) or more to sell shares to foreign share-holders. Shares are payable by foreign share-holders with the US dollar or other convertible foreign currencies, but they must be converted into the Vietnamese dong at the buy rate announced by the state bank at the time they decide to buy shares. These shares will bear the names of the foreign share-holders and register the value contributed on Vietnamese dong. However, a legitimate foreign share-holder or his/her replacement is only allowed to hold at most 10 percent of the prescribed capital of a credit organisation, and the total share-holding of all foreigners in a credit organisation should not exceed 30 percent of its prescribed capital. Foreign share-holders can join the managing council in proportion to the value of the shares they hold, but they will not be allowed to become chairman of the managing council, and a foreign share-holder shall not take part simultaneously in the managing councils of two credit organizations. After holding the shares for five years foreign shareholders are allowed to transfer their shares to others. The transfer abroad of the annual dividend or of the property left after a Vietnamese credit organisation is dissolved must be made in accordance with the Law on Foreign Investment in Vietnam and with Vietnam's regulations on the control of foreign currencies.
