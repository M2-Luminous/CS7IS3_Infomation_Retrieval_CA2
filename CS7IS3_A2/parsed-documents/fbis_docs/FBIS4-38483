It claimed that the Georgian side had opened artillery fire on Abkhaz positions in the Dali Gorge and had even gone into attack. In reality, the Abkhaz separatists had subjected Georgian villages in the gorge to howitzer and mortar fire. In this connection, the Ministry of Defense of Georgia states that this is another attempt by the Abkhaz junta to falsify the truth, present itself as a victim of aggression and conceal its crimes against the local Georgian population. This method has always been used by the Abkhaz side as a means of avoiding responsibility for the escalation of military confrontation and the wrecking of peace talks. The Ardzinba regime has failed to reconcile itself to the idea that the signing of the agreement in Moscow may become the first stage in the restoration of the territorial integrity of Georgia and is using any means to prevent its implementation. The Georgian Ministry of Defense states that unless the self-styled regime in Abkhazia stops its provocations against Georgian civilians -- thereby thwarting all attempts by the Georgian Government to achieve stability in the region by peaceful means -- the Georgian Government will be left with no other way to solve the problem of Abkhazia but to take up arms to (defend) the country's territorial integrity.
