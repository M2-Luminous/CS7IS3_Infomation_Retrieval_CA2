The recommendations were submitted to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata by a special group on land and housing of the government's team, dubbed Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters, which is chaired by Hata himself. The task force team was launched by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The suggestions covered 40 points in five areas regarding housing and land use in Japan. The areas are reducing housing construction costs, easing rules on construction such as floor space of housing, increasing supply of housing land, reviewing restrictions on land and houses for lease, and rules on land deals. The special group of six academics and business leaders like Shigeru Ito, professor at Keio University, particularly stressed that the government should ease regulations on imported lumber and housing materials. For example, it said Japan should make freer lumber and housing materials imports, if those commodities meet industrial standards in original production countries. On land use, it suggested promotion of better use of idle agricultural land in large cities. However, in order to avoid inadequate land development, uniform deregulation is not recommended, it added. The suggestions will be examined by concerned authorities like the Construction Ministry and the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, and the government will include conclusions in its policy reform plan on external economic relations to be released at the end of June, government officials said.
