The authority calculates that to move water between river systems by pipeline would be cheaper than reservoirs. Thames Water has already put it's plan for a new reservoir in south Oxfordshire on hold. The NRA stressed yesterday that neither pipelines nor reservoirs were yet needed because water conservation would create savings to satisfy demand well into the next century. However, since schemes like transfers from Wales to London would take 2 years to complete consideration should begin now. Reservoirs have been constructed that turned out not to be needed, most notably the Kielder in Northumberland. The NRA has therefore worked on a cautious approach which suggests that in some circumstances no new strategic schemes will be needed. If metering were introduced and leakage from old mains cut substantially, future demand could be met from existing sources. If demand rises above this level, pipelines are cheaper than reservoirs. It would cost 57 million pounds less to build a pipeline from the Severn to the Thames than to build a reservoir in south Oxfordshire. Anglian, Thames and East Midlands areas may require new schemes. The East Midlands shortages are expected to be met by tapping-rising groundwater around Birmingham. In East Anglia a reservoir could be built or water transferred via pipelines and rivers from the Trent south-east to Essex, and in London water diverted from the rivers Wye and Severn. Lilli Matson, Council for the Protection of Rural England campaigns officer, welcomed the emphasis on saving resources. She said control of Ieakage from pipelines would be important. Thames loses 23 percent of water through leakage, compared with 10 percent for some German undertakings.
