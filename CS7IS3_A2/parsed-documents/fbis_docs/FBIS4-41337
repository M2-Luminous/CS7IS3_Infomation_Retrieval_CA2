The government commission headed by him met on Thursday to discuss deliveries of goods to the northern areas of the Russian far eastern Khabarovsk territory. More than two million tons of goods are to be delivered to the regions within a brief navigation period. The operation costs an estimated 624 billion rubles, according to the territorial leaders. Because of the appalling shortage of financial resources, the deliveries of goods are being conducted extremely unsatisfactorily. The main supplier enterprises have vast debts and are unable to pay off even last year's credits. There are no stocks of fuel, foodstuffs and other goods in ports. The Amur Shipping Line's ships lie idle in docks. This year, a new system of financing northern deliveries was introduced, a new 5.5 trillion-ruble federal fund was set up and regional funds are being established, according to Shakhray. Forty-five billion rubles were earmarked for the Khabarovsk territory from the federal fund and 47 billion rubles were given as credit resources. According to the governmental commission, Shakhray stressed, despite insufficient financing, this money is enough to pay for a more intensive delivery of goods to northern regions. The money goes first of all to pay for the deliveries of oil products, coal and foodstuffs. Members of the commission visited the Khabarovsk port, examined local power plants and other enterprises. A working protocol identifying tasks and priorities for ministries, departments and other structures for the next few months and for the perspective was signed. The government commission members are scheduled to leave Khabarovsk for Irkutsk on Thursday.
