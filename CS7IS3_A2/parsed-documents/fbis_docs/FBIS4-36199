They are shaken by the fact that they failed to make a dent in the Congress armour. Their frenzied rallies and nightmarish stories about MNCs [multinational corporations] invasion were conveniently forgotten. But it was an issue, says the Congress spokesman, Mr V N Gadgil, gleefully. He interprets the election results as vindication of his party's stand on GATT and the voters' rejection of the opposition propaganda. Considering the asinine way in which both sides presented the case for and against GATT in the rural areas, it would seem that they think voters are morons. The party strategists' confusion was ably summed up by the BJP's [Bharatiya Janata Party] general secretary, the 'whizchalak' [whiz kid] Govindacharya, when he said the elections were not contested on any specific issue like GATT and the agenda was dominated by local issues. In that statement lies a glimmer of political understanding. Except when there is a charismatic leader, elections tend to get fought on local issues. Like the politician, the voter wants to know what he or she will get out of the polls. Voters are willing to forgive a leader his corruption provided he can get things done for his constituency. Voters can be united on one issue only when there is a fear of a systemic breakdown, when the arrogance of power rides roughshod over citizens' basic rights or a weak central authority allows the emergence of local dons. Voters then demand a drastic change and vote with a vengeance to achieve their goal. Political skill lies in watching the swing of the pendulum -- the ruling party's task is to slow it down and the opposition's to accelerate it. Experience has made the Indian voter wary. He has noted that non-Congress governments do not impart a better direction. He then gives them a thump on the head, and the Congress soon restores the familiar status quo. And it's back to local issues again, at which Congress leaders have shown themselves more adept than the opposition ones who all vie for national glory right from the outset. The opposition would fare better if they borrowed President Clinton's slogan and put up a modification in all their party offices: "It's the local economy, stupid".
