Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' attended the meeting. Talks dealt with the situation in Yemen and its regrettable developments, as well as the current efforts to address it. The talks also dealt with the impact of this situation on sisterly Yemen and its future as well as on the pan-Arab interest of the Arab nation. The president emphasized to the Yemeni delegation that Syria is concerned about what is taking place in Yemen and is anxiously following the bloody developments that replaced brotherly dialogue in addressing differences. The president said fighting is not in the interest of the fraternal Yemeni people, the Arab nation, or the unionist aspirations of the Arab masses. The president said Syria renews its appeal to the Yemeni brothers to stop resorting to arms and blood, apply logic, observe national and pan-Arab interests, and return to constructive brotherly dialogue out of concern for Yemen and its unity -- land and people. The Yemeni delegation expressed its appreciation for Syria's pan-Arab position. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and his delegation left Damascus this evening following a two-day visit. Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' saw them off at Damascus International Airport. In a statement to the Syrian Arab News Agency, al-'Attas said: Today, we were honored to be received by President Hafiz al-Asad. We were pleased by the positive stand of sisterly Syria and by the accurate analysis of the current situation in Yemen. Viewpoints were completely identical on the danger posed by the continuation of war in Yemen. This war threatens Yemen as well as the Arab nation and the region with numerous dangers. Therefore, we agreed to exert efforts and work together to stop the war and deal with all differences peacefully. Asked about halting fighting and preserving Yemeni unity, he said: This is what we are working for. I think the mission on which we have to work, along with brothers in Syria and all brothers and friends, is that of stopping the war. By stopping the war, we can deal with all issues and preserve what remains of Yemen and safeguard its unionist march. Responding to a question on the presence of contacts between Aden and Sanaa, he said: There are no contacts at present, except for those held through brothers and friends and the Arab League. Al-'Attas described his visit to Damascus by saying: It was a visit we highly value because I sensed a positive stand of solidarity and an accurate analysis of the situation in our country as a result of the recently-declared war. Al-'Attas welcomed all mediation and efforts to stop the war and avert further Yemeni losses and address the situation peacefully. He said: We welcomed the Egyptian mediation and the Egyptian-Emirian mediation and we welcome every mediation.
