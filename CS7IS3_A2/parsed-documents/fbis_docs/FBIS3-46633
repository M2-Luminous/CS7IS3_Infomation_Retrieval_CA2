Chairman Ichiro Hino opened the meeting by saying: "The tax system has become more important than ever. The party should work out a thorough assessment." Discussions were quietly carried on for about 90 minutes, and the SDPJ adopted its tax reform policy for fiscal 1994. The SDPJ policy includes many points of interest to industrial circles, such as a review of consumption tax exemption for smaller businesses, maintenance of the land price tax, and heavier taxation on nonprofit foundations. However, no businessmen gathered around awaiting the results of the SDPJ policy meeting, unlike that of the former ruling party -- the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Even though the SDPJ is the largest party in the coalition, it is no more than one of the coalition parties. The coalition's tax reform policy is firmed up by the "tax reform working group." As the subgroup of the conference of secretaries of five floor groups, the working group is organized by five Dietmen specializing in tax issues. Everything Is Secret In principle, the membership and agenda of the five-man working group have been kept "secret." In fact, however, business circles sniffed out the existence of the group, and the members were chased around by a large number of petitioners. A member of the working group complained: "Even government officials from some ministries came to us to make petitions with business people. Nothing has changed after the LDP meltdown." The working group is charged with examining individual special tax laws, which stipulate favorable tax policies for specific industrial fields. The group examines every single special tax to determine whether it should be continued or scrapped. The final decisions, though, are sometimes left to a meeting of party secretaries when members cannot reach agreement, or when the tax under debate involves a huge amount of revenue. Business Leaders Wonder Who Makes the Decisions Business circles are perplexed by the coalition's new decisionmaking process because they have long been used to dealing with only the LDP tax board. Business leaders wonder "who is really in charge of compiling the coalition's tax reform guidelines, and where should we go to make petitions." Hajime Tsuboi, director of the National Association of Real Estate Agents and concurrently chairman of Mitsui Real Estate Sales Co., called on Secretary Kansei Nakano of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] on the morning of 20 December. Tsuboi asked Nakano to "scrap the heavy taxes on real estate transactions and on owners of real estate." This was the second time Tsuboi has petitioned Nakano, following their first meeting in September. Tsuboi also met Shinseito's Mamoru Nakajima and the SDPJ's Nobuyuki Sekiyama on 7 and 10 December, respectively. It appears Tsuboi has a strategy of meeting policymakers from all five floor groups as frequently as possible to present his opinions on the coalition's tax policy. However, he complained: "Everyone understands land transactions should be further liberalized to boost the economy, but all of them said, `the Finance Ministry is too stubborn to give up the tax revenues'." The association's secretariat has recently drawn up a list of the five party secretaries, the five members of the working group, and seven other political figures who accept petitions, with accompanying photographs and profiles of each. According to an association official, nobody was familiar with the names on the list, except for the party secretaries, until the people had been introduced in trade journals. In fact, most never came to public notice until the coalition took power. On the night of 17 December, the coalition gave up plans to submit the government's fiscal 1994 budget plan before the year-end. Nissan Motor Company Managing Director Heiichi Hamaoka, who is concurrently serving as the chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association [JAMA] Tax System Committee, responded in disgust: "I am really disappointed with the cease-fire announcement because JAMA is now ready to negotiate with the Finance Ministry." When the commodity tax was replaced by the consumption tax, which imposes a 3-percent tax on every purchase, the government left a higher tax rate of 4.5 percent only for automobiles as a tentative measure. The 4.5-percent tax on automobiles will expire the end of March 1994; however, the Finance Ministry has begun to hint at seeking an extension of the extra taxation on the pretext of revenue shortages. In reaction, JAMA leaders have been making positive contacts with senior leaders of the coalition parties since November, insisting that "the tax should be lowered to 3 percent because this is the way for the government to keep faith with industrial circles." Hamaoka has already met with all politicians concerned, including the five party secretaries in charge of tax issues. Yet, he said "I could not figure out who is the real decisionmaker." Shinseito has many industrial lobbyists, and the DSP is backed by the Federation of Japan Automobile Workers' Unions. The two parties stress "we would never submit a bill for extending the extra taxation even if we had a big fight with the Finance Ministry" (as noted by the DSP's Nakano). On the contrary, the SDPJ virtually supports the extension of the high consumption tax for automobiles. SDPJ Secretary Harumichi Hosoya said: "Scrapping the special tax when it expires is favorable from a political viewpoint. But we probably cannot afford to do that under the present financial situation." Also, Komeito shows understanding of the Finance Ministry position, noting that, "If the tax rate for automobiles is lowered to 3 percent, tax revenues would decline 100 billion yen." Taxation Is Politics Under the LDP ruling, the Finance Ministry has been leaving the decision on scrapping and continuing individual special taxes to the LDP tax board -- at least in its official posture. At that time, ministry opinions were conveyed to the LDP through the government's advisory Tax System Research Council. Unlike the preceding years, the fiscal 1994 budget is being compiled under the Finance Ministry Tax Bureau's direct control. The new "budget compilation system" estimates budget allotments at the Tax Bureau's initiative, while expectations of business circles are probed through the appropriate ministries. When coalition parties cannot agree with each other on specific issues, the Finance Ministry's judgment becomes heavier. Nevertheless, the Finance Ministry has its concerns. A middle-ranking Tax Bureau official noted: "Nobody complained about the LDP tax board's final decision. But we no longer have such a barrier. Since tax-related decisions involve much political judgment, I am not confident that bureaucrats are able to assume all the responsibilities for next year's taxation." The 1994 tax reform agenda was postponed when the coalition government gave up the completion of the fiscal 1994 budget plan before year-end. Both the coalition and the bureaucrats will have to keep groping in the dark.
