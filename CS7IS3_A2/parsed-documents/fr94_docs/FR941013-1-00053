The NESHAP would require air emission controls be implemented for tanks, containers, surface impoundments, land disposal units, and certain other operations used to manage, convey, or handle wastes or recoverable materials except when the HAP content of a waste or recoverable material meets conditions specified in the rule. DATES: Comments. The EPA will accept comments on the proposed rule until December 12, 1994. Public Hearing.
