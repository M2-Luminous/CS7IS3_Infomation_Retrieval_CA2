He explained that the center will serve the cause of arms control and regional security. At a news conference last night following the working group's five-day meetings, Fahmi said the meetings addressed several issues in an in-depth discussion to define the long-term goals involving all the parties concerned in the region. He noted that discussions will resume at subsequent meetings. He pointed out that the discussion touched on an attempt to launch a project concerning "a declaration on regional security and arms control in the Middle East," outlining the general principles that should govern security ties among regional states in time of peace. Fahmi added that the talks discussed specific principles concerning regional security arrangements, the rules that should govern arms control, and the objectives the parties concerned seek to achieve in the field of arms control. He added that the Cairo meetings achieved an initial success beyond that which the proposed working paper sought to achieve. But, he remarked, particular points need to be given form and the delegations need time to submit the working paper to their governments before the working group can publicize it. The chairman of the Egyptian delegation pointed out that the talks also discussed the necessary measures to verify military activities in their various aspects, since this verification is fundamental to build confidence and to reach an agreement on arms control. It is a means of ensuring that all the parties are honoring their commitments, he said. Fahmi said the working group discussed a Russian proposal to establish a data bank on regional security and arms control as well as another proposal to establish a regional crisis management center and a regional communications center. [passage omitted] Fahmi was asked about particular delegations' objections to the joint Russian-U.S. paper that was submitted during the meetings. He explained that the proposed paper was neither American nor Russian but a compilation of the views expressed by regional states at previous meetings. Naturally, some states suggested some amendments, he remarked, adding: Tangible progress was made on many aspects of the items included in the working paper. The United States and Russia put forward a joint working paper on arms control at the beginning of the meetings but the Palestinians objected to it, noting that it was an attempt to give new interpretations to established political principles. Ambassador Fahmi was asked about the Israeli concentration on the issue of regional security and its overlooking the arms control aspect. Fahmi replied that it is natural for each party to have its own priorities. What we saw at these meetings was a wide and exhaustive discussion of the various issues, including regional security arrangements and arms control arrangements, he said. He remarked that several delegations took part in the discussion in accordance with their stances. At the news conference, Fahmi pointed out that Israel took part in discussing every subject. We can say that the Israeli delegation demonstrated its readiness to discuss issues. We hope the coming meetings will procure a working paper that helps take real steps to curb armament, he said. Fahmi stated that the next working group meeting will be held in Turkey in March. But he added that it will be exclusive to regional states and that an expanded meeting will be held in the Qatari capital for both regional and nonregional states.
