Escobar Franco and Eduardo Franco] [Text] During his address on 14 June to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy demanded a more tolerant attitude toward Paraguay's position regarding its outlet to the sea. He appealed to Argentina and Uruguay for a smoother policy for Paraguayan access to the sea. He questioned the freight surcharges that make national products more expensive, and asked the Ibero-American community for forthright solidarity in facing unemployment and deprivation. He also called for "a more socially just, more economically free, and more politically democratic Ibero-America." Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera asked his colleagues to formulate more than a rhetorical condemnation of corruption and asked for exemplary punishment of those corrupt people who stuff their pockets with public money. Wasmosy maintained that it is of vital importance that Paraguay's products have an easy outlet to the sea. He pointed out that despite Paraguay's efforts to reach the sea "we run into difficulties in Argentina and Uruguay." In this respect he noted that such difficulties concern freight surcharges that make national products more expensive. Wasmosy insisted that the efforts being made by his government to improve the economic and social situation are being hampered by Paraguay's landlocked situation. "When using our outlets to the sea, whether by river or by land, we run into such difficulties as freight surcharges that make our products more expensive, and the same happens with the products that we import," he said. He added: "In this respect we appeal to the solidarity of the countries through which we must transit, and ask them to offer an easier policy. Often the maritime countries do not understand what it is to be a landlocked country, and what this implies." In another passage of his address, Wasmosy called for gradual integration "to unite a socially more just Ibero-America. [no closing quotation marks as published] He said that "under the banner of democracy the postponed needs of the people become very genuine demands that our mandates cannot ignore." He highlighted the fact that most of the American countries have democratic systems that must be strengthened. "We must debate the social problems during this summit, as it is a topic that concerns all of us who are participating in this forum, and we want to seek solutions so that our people can enjoy better welfare and better living conditions." Wasmosy stated that there are many needs that must be satisfied, such as health conditions, education, employment, housing, equal opportunities, and the pressing need for social justice. He indicated that in these new times significant problems have also emerged due to the increase in crime and drug trafficking, which result from economic and social difficulties and from the existing imbalances within societies. "In order to resolve these social and economic problems, within the framework of democracy, we must seek improved distribution of wealth while increasing resources on the basis of greater production and better quality for all agricultural and industrial products." The president asked "that a frontal attack be made on deprivation and misery with an accelerated increase in economic and social development, within the framework of inter-American solidarity, in order to overcome the deficiencies that show up on our social gauges." Wasmosy also indicated that through a social market economy, but always respecting individual freedom and through common efforts, an improvement in the conditions of life can be achieved. "In order to achieve this we must achieve a constant and firm economic integration, a goal that will be achieved gradually in several stages, including free trade zones." He maintained that the reform of the state demands much more economic support. "We need greater financial resources, the incorporation of new technologies and, I would even dare to say, greater international solidarity," he stressed. He emphasized that he will continue with the reform of the state. Wasmosy indicated that in seeking to change the structure of the state he has sent several bills to Congress with the objective of modifying the financial system, the business system, and others.
