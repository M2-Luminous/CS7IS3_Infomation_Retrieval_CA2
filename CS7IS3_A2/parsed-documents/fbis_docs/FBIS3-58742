However, the transport of 20 tonnes of donated foodstuffs, medicine, and winter clothing was halted at the Slovene border. Trade for Aid was not able to pay the 137,000 schillings Slovenia wanted for the 100-km passage. [passage omitted] The Salzburg relief organization had all the necessary documentation for the aid shipment to the refugee campaigns. International relief organizations such as the Red Cross or Caritas, and thus the Neighbor in Need campaign, are not affected by these Slovene charges.
