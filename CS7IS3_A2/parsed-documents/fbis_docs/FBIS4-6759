Jobs were in great demand and people who had them worked uncomplainingly. Labour unions existed, but they were never instruments of agitation unlike in the old days of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Industrial peace helped the government attract foreign investments, which in turn created economic growth and generated more jobs. The net effect was that workers in Indonesia gained from greater prosperity, which has been a hallmark of Mr. Suharto's rule, especially in the last 10 years. But prosperity leads to rising expectations and the mood of Indonesian labour has changed in recent years. Workers are increasingly aware of their rights. They demand better wages and are now less inhibited about agitating for better working conditions. Interestingly, the rising militancy of Indonesian workers coincides with a new United States policy this year to advance the cause of workers worldwide by insisting on minimum working conditions. Against Indonesia, the U.S. has threatened to suspend concessions under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) unless Jakarta improves working conditions for its 80-million workforce. As if in response to such pressure, the Indonesian Government announced that from Jan. 1 this year the legal minimum daily wage would be raised from 3,000 rupiah to 3,800 rupiah for Jakarta and its outskirts. Demanding better working conditions is legitimate for workers anywhere. But it becomes a problem when the demands are out of step with reality or are externally inspired with little regard for domestic conditions. Worse, it becomes tragic when frustrations arising from unfulfilled expectations turn political. Sadly, this appears to have been the case in Medan. Medan workers, at the prodding of the independent union, the SBSI [Serikat Buruh Setiakawan Indonesia or Indonesian Solidarity Trade Union], agitated for minimum daily wages to be raised by 100 percent from 3,100 rupiah to 7,000 rupiah -- twice the minimum daily wage in Jakarta. When the demand could not be met, the workers went on a rampage and turned it into an anti-Chinese riot. In Indonesia, it is easy to turn mob aggression into a protest with ethnic overtones. The authorities deserve credit for acting swiftly to contain the situation. Indonesia does not need troubles like this. Riots and protests drive businesses and investors away -- and this Jakarta simply cannot afford. Two million new workers join the labour force each year. For them to find jobs, entrepreneurs and businesses must feel comfortable about sinking their capital into Indonesian soil. It will be foolish to expect them to do so if the country lacks a sense of stability and security. And if they don't invest, there will be no economic growth and no job creation. As the Indonesian authorities act to stabilise the situation, it is crucial that the Medan incident be seen in perspective. Investors should feel assured that the protest was more a single incident of labour unrest, not a racial riot. Indonesian workers ought to realise that mindless rioting is not the way to solve their problems. In fact, it only makes things worse. Last but not least, the U.S. needs to see the danger of blindly imposing its labour standards on others. The Medan riot has shown just how explosive this can be.
