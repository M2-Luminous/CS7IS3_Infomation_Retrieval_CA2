Some believe political groups confronting one another in an internal power struggle are responsible. Others believe it is the guerrillas, while others blame paramilitary groups. Each and every one of these parties, however, has washed its hands of the affair. Following the massacre of 34 Hope, Peace, and Liberty -- EPL -- militants in Apartado in the Uraba region, the authorities directly accused the rebels of committing the crime. [Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman, identified by caption] "The National Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNG], and specifically the 5th Front of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] and its Bolivarian Militias, are the ones that are instigating bloodshed in Uraba." Meanwhile, the different political forces struggling for power in the region, aside from accusing one another, denounce the presence of paramilitary groups. The CNG, via a communique, has blamed the National Army and the paramilitary led by Fidel Castano for the events that have taken place in the Uraba region. Spokesmen for the Socialist Renewal Movement [CRS] assert the same. [CRS spokesman Luis Alberto Cabeza, identified by caption] "The violent situation is being created from all sides. Not only -- as the media has reported -- are insurgents involved, but also the paramilitary groups, as well as the Army itself." On the other hand, EPL reinsertados [guerrillas reintroduced into civilian life] believe those responsible for the violence unleashed in the Uraba region are members of the Patriotic Union [UP] and the Communist Party of Colombia, who -- according to the EPL reinsertados -- are bidding to maintain political hegemony over the region, no matter how high the cost. [EPL spokesman Alvaro Caceres, identified by caption] "At this moment, the four mayors of the Uraba region in Antioquia Department -- Apartado, Chigorodo, Carepa, and Turbo -- are UP members who refuse to guarantee free elections in the Uraba region of Antioquia Department." The UP, however, says this charge lacks political logic. UP representatives content paramilitary groups are responsible for the killings, and they question the Army's mission in the Uraba region. They assert that as more soldiers arrive, massacres will increase and impunity will abound.
