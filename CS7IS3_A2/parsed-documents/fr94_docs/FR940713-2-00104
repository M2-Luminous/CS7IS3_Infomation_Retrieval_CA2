FR940713-2-00104 FR940713-2-00061 IV Remedies Available to Private Litigants Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well as costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Entry of the proposed Final Consent Judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of such actions. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §16(a), the Judgment has no prima facie effect in any subsequent lawsuits that may be brought against Morton Plant or Mease in this matter. V Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Consent Judgment As provided by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, any person believing that the proposal Final Consent Judgment should be modified may submit written comments to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW, Room 9903, Washington, DC 20001, within the 60-day period provided by the Act. These comments, and the Department's responses, will be filed with the Court and published in the Federal Register . All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free, pursuant to a stipulation signed by the United States and Morton Plant and Mease, to withdraw its consent to the Judgment at any time prior to entry. Section X of the Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over this action, and the parties may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for modification, interpretation, or enforcement of the Judgment. VI Determinative Materials/Documents No materials or documents of the type described in Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. §16(b), were considered in formulating the proposed Final Consent Judgment. VII Alternative to the Proposed Final Consent Judgment The alternative to the proposed Judgment is a full trial on the merits. While the Department is confident of its ability to succeed in such a trial, the litigation involves difficult issues of law and fact. A favorable outcome is not a certainty. Had the Department won a litigated judgment, at most the Court would have barred the combination. The consent judgment agreed to by the parties achieves the same underlying objective_preserving the vigorous competitive rivalry between Morton Plant and Mease_by requiring them to continue competing for all general acute care services, including those consolidated through the Partnership. It has the additional advantage, which a litigated judgment in favor of plaintiffs would not, of allowing defendants to achieve potential efficiencies and cost savings. ␣␣␣Respectfully submitted, Anthony E.
