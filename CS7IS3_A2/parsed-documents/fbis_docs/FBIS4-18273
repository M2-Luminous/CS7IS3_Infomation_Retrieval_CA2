He does not yet have a list, of course, but the choice of names to submit for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's approval and signature, in accordance with the Constitution, is rapidly taking shape. One new factor emerging from yesterday afternoon's Berlusconi-Bossi [Northern League leader] meeting could affect Roberto Maroni, the League's lower house floor leader, whom the League leader has proposed for prime minister. Three possible posts await him, and he will of course gain one of them. The first (and most likely) is deputy prime minister, a post without any direct powers, but nevertheless symbolic of the League's influence over the next cabinet. The second is the very powerful position of interior minister -- a post that the DC [Christian Democratic Party] has held uninterruptedly since the beginning of its era. "I would gladly fill it in order to clean up the secret services and to take part directly in the federative reform," Maroni told his aides yesterday, and Clemente Mastella [Christian Democratic Center] has granted his approval to this possibility. The third post is that of minister for the regions and institutional reforms -- a position that seems bound to play a key role in the reform of local government that the League so keenly desires. If it does not go to the League, the Interior Ministry could go to the National Alliance's general, Luigi Ramponi. True, the police would not be overjoyed to see a former chief of the Finance Guard, but Ramponi's past in the senior leadership of Sismi would be enough to grant him the necessary authority. Gianfranco Fini [National Alliance leader] decided not to keep Berlusconi in suspense any longer when he told him that he does not want to stand as a candidate for the prime ministership, but nevertheless a party that commands 13.4 percent of the vote does demand some visibility in government. The most likely solution is that the ministers of the Right will be chosen from among National Alliance members rather than among MSI [Italian Social Movement] members. Thus, Pietro Armani, formerly of the IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction], could become foreign trade minister, while Publio Fiori could become labor or transport minister. The allies of the Christian Democratic Center do not yet know whether they should negotiate with Berlusconi as an autonomous parliamentary group (with their 34 deputies) or as a component of a unified Forza Italia group. In any case, their candidates are ready: Clemente Mastella, formerly in the running for the prime ministership, is a potential defense minister, while Pierferdinando Casini could secure the very delicate position of minister of posts, and Francesco D'Onofrio is being mentioned as the likely minister of institutional reforms, in view of his recent experience. Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli is being mentioned again as a likely justice minister, ever since both Fini and Mastella discreetly vetoed Tiziana Parenti ("It is better that a magistrate not fill that post"). The main stumbling block at the moment is the Foreign Ministry. Whoever fills that post must represent Italy abroad in the years ahead -- the center-right Italy that is already prompting debate in Europe and America. Someone well-known and reassuring is needed, a profile that does not exactly match that of [Radical leader] Marco Pannella, who according to some people is among the candidates for the post. Berlusconi seems more inclined to choose an "outsider," an expert diplomat such as former Ambassador to Moscow Sergio Romano, the commentator for LA STAMPA. The alternatives are General Luigi Caligaris (who could also become defense minister, by virtue of his experience), and the Liberals' Alfredo Biondi (who, however, seems likely to become speaker of the lower house). The lion's share will of course go to Forza Italia members, whom Berlusconi will make responsible for implementing the program on which he focused his election campaign: a reduction in income tax, a million new jobs, and the reorganization of the health sector. No one is likely to deprive Antonio Martino of the post of finance minister, while Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the LUISS [International Free University of Social Studies] and pioneer of privatization, seems the natural candidate for industry minister. Giugliano Urbani, Berlusconi's much heeded adviser, is expected to fill a leading ministerial position, though no one yet knows which -- perhaps at the Interior Ministry? As always, the greatest uncertainty concerns the economic ministries. For the Treasury and Budget Ministries, a number of names are being mentioned, including such illustrious experts as Lamberto Dini, President of the Bank of Italy; General State Accountant Andrea Monorchio; head of the Bocconi institute Mario Monti, and even economist Giulio Tremonti -- who, though a candidate on the Pact's lists, is nevertheless well regarded for his research on fiscal decentralization. The candidates for the economic ministries will probably also include the Northern League's top economic expert, Giancarlo Pagliarini, who was one of the founders of Arthur Andersen. Absolutely everything in government will change. But there is one minister who will remain in the government, perhaps returning to the Health Ministry: That is the Liberals' Raffaele Costa, the only outgoing minister who could get back in.
