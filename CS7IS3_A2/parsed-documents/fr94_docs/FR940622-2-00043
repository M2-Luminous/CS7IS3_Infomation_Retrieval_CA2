FR940622-2-00043 FR940622-2-00032 [OPP&hyph;180945; FRL 4873&hyph;1] Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to use Pirate Insecticide; Solicitation of Public Comment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1 H pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, to control beet armyworms (BAW) on up to 200,000 acres of cotton in Louisiana. In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of written comments, bearing the identification notation ``OPP&hyph;180945,'' should be submitted by mail to: Public Response and Human Resource Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain Confidential Business Information must be provided by the submitter for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments filed pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Susan Stanton, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, Crystal Station I, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 308&hyph;8327. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for use of the insecticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1 H -pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, available as Pirate 3SC from American Cyanamid Company, to control beet armyworms (BAW) on up to 200,000 acres of cotton in Louisiana. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. According to the Applicant, BAW is an occasional pest of cotton in Louisiana which seldom causes economic damage. However, under favorable environmental conditions, BAW populations can increase to extremely high levels and cause severe economic losses. In 1993, a severe outbreak cost affected Louisiana cotton producers $15 to $85 per acre. According to the Applicant, the registered pesticides provide only partial control of BAW. If Pirate Insecticide is not available for use and another outbreak occurs, the Applicant claims that yield losses of 10 to 20 percent may occur, resulting in significant economic losses for affected growers. Under the proposed exemption, a maximum of two ground applications of Pirate 3SC would be made at 8.53 fluid ounces of product (0.2 pounds active ingredient) per acre. No applications would be made within 21 days of harvest. A maximum of 40,000 pounds of active ingredient would be needed to treat up to 200,000 acres of cotton. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the Federal Register and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide) [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(1)]. 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1 H -pyrrole-3-carbonitrile is a new chemical. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry.
