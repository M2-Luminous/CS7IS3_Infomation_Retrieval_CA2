A persistent distrust in the local currency of the North, the won, is also driving the North Korean elite to convert their money into currency of capitalist nations or to buy up valuables, according to information filtering through from the North. Pyongyang's leaders have been instilling a war mentality among their countrymen by boasting, "We will accomplish unification through the barrel of a gun." Of late, they have been putting ordinary citizens in fear by claiming that South Korea and the United States are about to invade the North because of the deadlocked nuclear row. The Stalinist state's leaders have contributed further to the atmosphere of anxiety by ordering power blackouts and air raid exercises. As a result, many North Koreans apparently now believe that war will eventually break out on the peninsula. One member of the pro-Pyongyang Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chochongnyon) who claims to know the commander of the Fourth North Korean Army Corps, identified only as Gen. Chang, said many North Koreans were buying U.S. dollars and Japanese yen from ethnic Koreans in China who trade goods across the border. Others are secretly amassing stores of gold, he said. In particular, military generals like Chang are hording hundreds of thousands of dollars and gold ingots as large as 15 cm long, 5 cm wide and 4 cm thick. Some are also hoarding pearls, gold necklaces, gold bracelets and ear-rings. The Chochongnyon official said one of his relatives, identified only as An, a senior member of the Central Workers (Communist) Party in charge of agriculture, is hiding an unspecified amount of yen and jewelry. NAEWOE PRESS, South Korea's official watcher of North Korean affairs, said another reason North Koreans are hoarding foreign currency and valuables was because of a possible, abrupt exchange of old bills with new ones like the swap carried out July 15, 1992. At that time, the Pyongyang regime conducted a one-to-one exchange of old and new cash but limited the amount citizens could change, forcing them to deposit the excess at the central bank and other financial institutions. They were allowed to withdraw the deposited money under different regulations later on, NAEWOE said. The Pyongyang regime allowed individual households to exchange up to 399 won while depositing 30,000 won and no more. Because of this measure, many angry citizens burned the excess money they had saved or simply tossed the bills away.
