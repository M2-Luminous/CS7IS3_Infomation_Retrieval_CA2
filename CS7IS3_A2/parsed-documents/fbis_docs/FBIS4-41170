FBIS4-41170 "drsov121_a_94020" FBIS-SOV-94-121 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Details of Russian Transcaucasus Peace Mission Details of Russian Transcaucasus Peace Mission PM2206180094 Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 23 Jun 94 p 2 PM2206180094 Moscow IZVESTIYA Russian BFN [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "Paratroopers Named as Chief Peacekeepers in Transcaucasus"] [Text] The peacekeeping operation which was begun by Russian generals and troops subordinate to them in Georgia and Abkhazia with a reconnaissance and the introduction into the conflict zone of a reinforced engineer-sapper battalion and communications and control subunits, has finally acquired official, legal status. At a session closed to the press, the Russian Federation Council, after hearing a report by Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev, ratified the president's edict on Russian Federation participation in reconciling the warring parties. Now the sappers and communications personnel are to be followed to the Transcaucasus, to the Georgian-Abkhazian front, by paratrooper peacekeepers. But not, admittedly, the officers and men of the 345th Parachute Regiment, as was reported earlier, but their colleagues from Novorossiysk, Stavropol, and Ulyanovsk. The Russian Defense Ministry has accommodated the Georgian parliament deputies who believe to this day that the "fall" of Sukhumi happened purely because of the participation of servicemen from that regiment in the storming of the city and object to their presence on the line of disengagement between the warring forces. Under the decision agreed by the three sides, the paratroopers of the 345th Regiment will stay at their positions in Gudauta and Sukhumi and will guard the Bombory military airfield and the Moscow Military District Sanatorium, where the Joint Staff of the Russian peacekeeping forces in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone is already stationed, as well as other Russian Army facilities. Major General Vasiliy Yakushev is charged with leading the peacekeeping forces. The peacekeeping operation (you can see it in diagrammatic form in our drawing) [report is accompanied by a two- by two-inch sketch map captioned "Sketch map of the deployment of Russian peacekeeping forces in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone"] will cover an area in the region of the Inguri river 56 km wide and 78 km long. The dividing line between control zones one and two will run perpendicular to the present line of contact between Georgian and Abkhazian troops along the river. The actual armed formations of the two sides must be drawn back from the Inguri river 12 km on each side, so that in the event of a strained situation arising, no one can hit his adversary with tank or artillery guns, still less mortar or machinegun fire (dotted line on the map). The heavy equipment and main forces of the warring parties are to go to specially designated areas (indicated on the sketch map by broken elliptical lines). For the Abkhaz side these are Ochamchira and Meore-Gudava, and for the Georgian side -- the eastern suburbs of the cities of Kheta and Senaki (where the equipment and arms are to be sited), as well as the city of Chkhorotsku (for personnel). In the zones there are five checkpoints for the peacekeeping forces, which will regulate the flow of returning refugees -- at the destroyed bridge on the Inguri river, among others -- and bar the passage of weapons into the security and arms limitation zones, plus 22 observation posts on the entire territory of the "hot spot" (shown as triangles on the sketch map). Keen attention will be paid to Galskiy Rayon, where the refugees are mainly expected to return. It is proposed to site as many as seven observation posts there. The headquarters of Control Zone No. 1 will be sited in Gali, and of Zone No. 2 in Zugdidi. It is proposed to leave up to three battalions of peacekeeping forces in each zone. On the west bank of the Inguri they will be composite battalions of the Batumi Motorized Infantry Division belonging to the Transcaucasus Group of Russian Forces. For rapid reaction to explosive situations and incidents, four mobile groups are being set up, to which 10 helicopters are to be assigned. These groups, consisting of a reinforced platoon, will also monitor from the air the Kodorskoye Ravine zone, which does not form part of the demilitarized area but causes great concern due to the operations of various "independent" armed formations there. The plan for the conduct of the operation was not only discussed in the Russian Federation Council; the UN mission in Georgia is also familiar with it. It was coordinated with Lieutenant General Sergey Dbar, chief of general staff of the armed forces of Abkhazia, and Major General Guram Nikolaishvili, Georgian deputy defense minister. Now it is up to the plan's executors. And not only, or even mainly, the Russian peacekeepers. It is a matter of the political will of the Georgian and Abkhazian leadershop to resolve contentious problems exclusively by peaceful means. According to information at our disposal, the sending of the new Russian battalions to the conflict zone and their arrival at Gudauta airfield is planned for 22-25 June. This will require 60 trips by Il-76 and An-22 planes. The anticipated cost of the peacekeeping operation in Georgia and Abkhazia is 10-11 billion rubles. The officers' and men's pay alone (there will be some 3,000 of them) will require 1 billion every month. At the same time the Federation Council rejected the military people's proposal that Russia's "blue helmets" be paid for as a separate item in the state budget. The Defense Ministry will have to pay for everything. On the first day of work, Russian sappers have already rendered harmless 117 mines. Fortunately, there were no casualties.
