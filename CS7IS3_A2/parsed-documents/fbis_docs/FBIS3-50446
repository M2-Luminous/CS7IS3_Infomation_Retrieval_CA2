During the 20 minutes he stayed at the Planalto Palace press hall to wish journalists a happy new year, President Itamar Franco criticized the Supreme Federal Court and the PMDB, but praised the National Congress. He also spoke about ministerial reform and the events of 1993. [Begin recording] We have had a year with a very high inflation rate, but we must also stress, and stress categorically because the newspapers usually do not mention it, and if they do, they only refer to it in general terms, that the country has left recession behind. The country has managed to reach 1993 with a GDP of 4.5 percent, with all industrial areas fully recovering from recession. We must review several other areas where we had speculation, especially the famous pharmaceutical industry. The government has not yet been able to control the pharmaceutical industry. But the country has grown, especially in the energy area and also in its international relations. Thus, we can say that although we had a high inflation rate, the country has developed calmly and within a democratic environment. And no one can deny that the country has developed economically. [end recording] President Itamar Franco also said he is disappointed over the decision adopted by Supreme Federal Court Justice Marco Aurelio de Mello which has granted an injunction in favor of state companies continuing to pay super-salaries. According to the president, this decision by Justice Marco Aurelio de Mello and the STF does great damage to the country, not just to the government. The president of the Republic also took the opportunity to praise the National Congress. He said that congressional-Executive Branch relations are perfect and that he hopes the measures adopted by the economic team to curb inflation will be approved. The president also praised former Social Security Minister Antonio Brito, but bitterly criticized the PMDB. [Begin recording] Concerning relations with parties, I shouldn't say this because I do not want to fight, I do not want to disrupt the peace, because I would rather have a climate of peace, of love, and of brotherhood, but the PMDB, which until a few days ago had five ministers in the government, suddenly said that it was not part of the government. How could it not be part of the government! It had five ministers holding important posts. They were so important that the PMDB has forgotten that it had important ministers, including one who helped out in my work, who is a friend of mine, and who, in a demonstration of loyalty to the government and to the fatherland, had to leave his post to run for president of the Republic. I am referring to Former Minister Antonio Brito. The PMDB is a party that has grown quickly and has participated effectively in the government. One has to talk with parties that have ministers in the government, but when these ministers deny they are the government, then it is better to find intermediaries to hold talks with other parties. [end recording] Next Monday President Franco will meet with Senate Leader Pedro Simon to discuss names for the Mines and Energy, Industry and Commerce, and Agriculture Ministries. The president added that the future communications minister must be an expert in the area.
