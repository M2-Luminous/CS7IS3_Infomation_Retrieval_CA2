FBIS4-14594 "drsov063_a_94028" FBIS-SOV-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Churkin Believe Zagreb Agreement Will Hold Churkin Believe Zagreb Agreement Will Hold LD3103183194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1640 GMT 31 Mar 94 LD3103183194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Russia believes that the agreement between representatives of Croatia and Krajina's Serbs concluded in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on Wednesday [30 March] will be observed. The party which violates it "will challenge the key members of the world community. It would be extremely unreasonable," the special envoy of the Russian President Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy Foreign Minister, declared at a press conference on Thursday in Moscow. He also reported that the UN General Secretary Butrus Ghali had already addressed the Security Council with a request to allocate additional forces to be deployed in the disengagement zone. Responding to an Interfax correspondent, Churkin indicated that in Croatia there are 800 Russian servicemen in the composition of the UN peacekeeping forces. As many as 200 Russians will go there in the second half of April. Speaking about the political status of the self-proclaimed republic of Serbian Krajina, Churkin pointed out that "the solution of this problem should come with time. Those Croatian Serbs who adhere to unreconcilable positions on this issue are actually taking up an anti-Serbian position." In Churkin's words, "the event which occurred in Zagreb is of great importance because it is a political-diplomatic model within which one must work during the next few weeks and months to settle the situation not only in Croatia but in Bosnia as well. The meeting with the participation of the Bosnian Serbs, Croats, and Moslems may take place within the next few weeks if not the next few days." Churkin believes that the Bosnian Croats and Moslems who have concluded an agreement on the creation of the federation must coordinate and develop a joint position for the negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs. As Churkin said, an active involvement of the representatives of the United States, European Union, and United Nations is not just "a tribute to politeness." "Russia was and will be in favor of the expansion of international interaction during the settlement in the former Yugoslavia. We must act in agreement with the United States, European Union, and United Nations."
