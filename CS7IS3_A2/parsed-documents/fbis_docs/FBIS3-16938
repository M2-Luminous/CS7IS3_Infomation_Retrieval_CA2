Wives of officers and ensigns went onto the runway and started blocking flights. The cause of this was a chronic lack of money -- the 1egiment's servicemen have not been paid since January. Colonel Semen Romanenko, deputy chief of the Air Defense Troops Financial and Economic Directorate, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that money has today been transferred to the Far Eastern servicemen for a specific purpose. In his opinion, however, the question of money to pay servicemen and to finance the Air Defense Troops has not been resolved as a whole. Special concern is aroused by the debt of 18 billion rubles [R] in respect of Moscow Regional Power Administration accounts. This organization is warning of the possible disconnection of the Central Command Post and other important installations which ensure Russia's national security. Col. Romanenko blames the disastrous situation with regard to funding the Air Defense Troops' Far Eastern units on a shortfall of R2 billion compared with the planned provision. The ITAR-TASS correspondent managed to ascertain from the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense that not only the families of Sakhalin servicemen are suffering from a lack of money. In February one-fourth of Russia's servicemen did not receive their pay, and there will be still more in March.
