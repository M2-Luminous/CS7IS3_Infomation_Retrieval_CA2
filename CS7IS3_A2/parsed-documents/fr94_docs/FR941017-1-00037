FR941017-1-00037 FR941017-1-00008 The analysis was released for public review on October 29, 1992, and again in September 1993. During both review processes, the Council recommended that additional alternatives be studied to define the areas that would protect a majority of the species and habitat, while providing access to groundfish resources. The analysis identified areas of high blue king crab bycatch and low groundfish harvests. The analysis indicated that the proposed Pribilof Islands habitat conservation area would not significantly impact groundfish fishermen because it would affect only 14 vessels in the entire BSAI groundfish fleet and the operators of these vessels would have the opportunity to fish in the remainder of the BSAI. At its meeting in December 1993, the Council again reviewed the draft EA/RIR and sent the document out for public review. At its meeting in April 1994, the Council considered the testimony and recommendations of its Advisory Panel, Scientific and Statistical Committee, fishing industry representatives, and the general public on alternative habitat protection zones and how these areas would be defined, established, and managed. The Council reviewed information about the distribution and habitat of blue king crab in the NMFS annual trawl surveys, and on observer data. The proposed trawl closure encompasses a major portion of the historic blue king crab distribution during years of low abundance and during years when the population was expanding. Amendment 21a would prohibit trawling within the EEZ in an area bounded by a straight line connecting the following pairs of coordinates in the following order: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Latitude Longitude 57 ○57.0 ’ N. 168 ○30.0 ’ W. 56 ○55.2 ’ N. 168 ○30.0 ’ W. 56 ○48.0 ’ N. 169 ○2.4 ’ W. 56 ○34.2 ’ N. 169 ○2.4 ’ W. 56 ○30.0 ’ N. 169 ○25.2 ’ W. 56 ○30.0 ’ N. 169 ○44.1 ’ W. 56 ○55.8 ’ N. 170 ○21.6 ’ W. 57 ○13.8 ’ N. 171 ○0.0 ’ W. 57 ○57.0 ’ N. 171 ○0.0 ’ W. 57 ○57.0 ’ N. 168 ○30.0 ’ W. The Council determined that this area protects most of the crab habitat in the Pribilof Islands area, without significant adverse impacts on trawl operations for groundfish. This action balances the protection of the marine resources dependent on this habitat with the needs of the groundfish fishery. The Council voted to recommend that Amendment 21a, which prohibit trawling in this area, be submitted to NMFS for approval. Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the publication of regulations proposed by a Council within 15 days of receipt of the FMP amendments and regulations. At this time, NMFS has not determined that the FMP amendment these regulations would implement are consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. NMFS, in making a final determination about the FMP amendment and in implementing a final rule, will take into account the data, views, and comments received during the comment period. Classification The Assistant General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel of the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed action would not have a significant economic impact on the fishing industry because less than 3 percent of the Bering Sea groundfish is harvested in the Pribilof Islands area by 14 vessels in the groundfish fleet. The volume of groundfish historically caught in this area can be harvested elsewhere in the Bering Sea. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 675 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
