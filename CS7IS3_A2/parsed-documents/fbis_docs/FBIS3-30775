Baudys confirmed that by the end of 1995 the Czech Army would reach its final size -- 65,000 troops. He said, however, that further decrease in the army size was not being considered thus far because, Baudys said, following the euphoria after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet bloc, "a more realistic standpoint is gaining the upper hand and the restriction of armed forces in individual countries is coming to a halt." He added that the share of military expenditures in the state budgets of a number of European countries has begun to grow again.
