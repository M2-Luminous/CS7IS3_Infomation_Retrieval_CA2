A010␣General Information * * * * * 7.0␣ADDITIONAL STANDARDS FOR SECOND-CLASS MAIL 7.1 Preparation [Insert text of existing A200.1.1.] 7.2␣Address Labels [Insert text of existing A200.1.2.] 7.3␣Address Placement The delivery address must be clearly visible on or through the outside of the mailpiece, whether placed on a label or directly on the host publication, a component, or the mailing wrapper. If placed on the mailing wrapper, the address must be on a flat side, not on a fold (see Exhibit 7.3). If a polybag is used, the address must not appear on a component that rotates within the bag, and the address must remain visible throughout the addressed component's range of motion. 7.4␣Return Address The return address must appear on any mailing wrapper that is also endorsed ``Return Postage Guaranteed.'' 3. Revise all Domestic Mail Manual C200, Second-Class Mail, to read as follows: C200␣Second-Class Mail 1.0␣PERMISSIBLE MAILPIECE COMPONENTS 1.1␣Pages Pages are the printed sheets forming the publication or one of the mailpiece's components, bearing advertising, nonadvertising, or both, including those having textual and graphic matter (see E211.2.4); blank spaces for writing or marking; and material to be completed or used by the reader. A minor portion of the pages in a second-class mailpiece may have unusual characteristics, such as a different size, shape, or construction, or portions that may be wholly or partially separable; and pages prepared for folding out. No page may have dimensions (when folded, if folded) that exceed the dimensions of the cover of the publication. Pages are also subject to these standards: a. A detachable coupon, application, or order form must relate directly to advertising or nonadvertising matter printed on the page of which it is a part or to which it is attached. b. Multilayer pages, including those formed by sheets glued together and those that have unusual shapes, such as cutouts, movable flaps, or ``pop-ups,'' may include small amounts of fastening material such as grommets, string, or rubber bands as needed to assemble the page. Multilayer pages may also be formed as pouches or pockets but may contain only permissible loose enclosures (see 1.4) or other securely affixed permissible components. c. Multiple pages may be held together by staples or other means separate from and in addition to the regular binding of the publication. d. Oversized pages may be used for illustrations, charts, maps, and other advertising and nonadvertising content. 1.2␣Parts and Sections Parts and sections are pages (subject to 1.1) that are physically separate subdivisions of the publication, as identified by the publisher. Each part or section must show the name of the publication, and the number of parts or sections in the issue must be stated on the cover of the first part or section. Parts or sections produced by someone other than the publisher may not be mailed at second-class rates if these parts or sections are prepared by or for advertisers or if they are provided to the publisher free or at a nominal charge. On request, publishers must submit to the RCSC serving the known office of publication contracts entered into with producers of parts or sections. 1.3␣Enclosures at First- or Third-Class Rates Matter to be paid at the applicable First- or third-class rate may be enclosed in a second-class mailpiece subject to these conditions: a. The total weight of all enclosed third-class matter must be less than 16 ounces. b. Postage and fee payment is subject to P070. A permit imprint that may appear on a First- or third-class enclosure must not be visible when the mailpiece is prepared for mailing except as provided under P070. c. When enclosing nonincidental First- or any third-class mail, combination envelopes or containers with separate parts for the two classes of mail may be used. If both the sender's and addressee's names and addresses are not on both pieces, the sender's name and address must be placed on one and the addressee's name and address on the other. Combination containers with inseparable parts may bear the names and addresses on only one part.
