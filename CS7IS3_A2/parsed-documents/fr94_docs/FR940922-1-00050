FR940922-1-00050 FR940922-1-00008 (b) Technical Analysis of Need for OTC LEV (or LEV-Equivalent) Program for Maintenance. EPA believes that the OTC LEV program is necessary for all of the nonattainment areas to maintain the ozone NAAQS, even after they attain. This is because EPA's modeling analysis projects very high rates of growth in emissions in the OTR that must continue to be neutralized even after controls sufficient for attainment by the attainment deadlines are in place. Based on EPA's analysis discussed in sections II.A.(a), (b) and (c), the Agency does not believe that other available control options are sufficient to attain without OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent). Since EPA is not aware of sufficient additional control options to counteract growth following attainment, EPA believes, a fortiori, that OTC LEV will be necessary for these areas to demonstrate maintenance of the NAAQS over two consecutive ten-year periods following redesignation (as required by section 175A of the Act). Not only does EPA believe that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary for the nonattainment areas in the OTR to maintain the ozone NAAQS, but EPA believes that this program will play an increasingly important role in counteracting growth over the maintenance periods. Of course, implementation of the program in model year 1999 will not begin to play a role until well into the maintenance periods for the marginal and moderate areas that attain the standard by 1993 and 1996, respectively. Assuming areas could achieve redesignation in their attainment years, for the serious and severe areas that have attainment deadlines under section 181 of 1999, 2005, or 2007, the OTC LEV program will contribute to both attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. Due to the phase-in schedule for the LEV program and the time it takes for the fleet to completely turnover, the LEV program will continue to accrue additional benefits through the year 2028. In 2015 (the last year for which EPA has done a projection analysis), emissions reductions due to the OTC LEV program will be 1200 tons of NO X per day and 670 tons of VOC per day. This is a 39% reduction in NO X highway vehicle emissions and a 38% reduction in VOC highway vehicle emissions compared to emissions in 2015 without the OTC LEV program. The following table presents VMT growth rate information averaged between 1990 and 2005 for mobile source emissions within the OTR. The table focuses on growth estimates for mobile sources as the most relevant for assessing the impact of LEV in the OTR, since LEV affects emissions from this source category. These growth rates are derived from the EPA's MOBILE5 Fuel Consumption model, and are taken from a study prepared under EPA contract. 66 66 See E.H. Pechan and Associates, Regional Oxidant Modeling of the Clean Air Act Amendments: Default Projection and Control Data (Draft), Prepared under EPA Contract No. 68&hyph;D0&hyph;0120, Work Assignment II&hyph;60 (April 1993). Emissions rates for mobile sources are calculated by multiplying emissions factors developed for the fleet by projected activity levels, characterized as projected vehicle miles travelled (VMT). Growth in VMT tends to neutralize the downward trend in emissions factors resulting from turnover in the fleet to vehicles meeting federal tier 1 standards, and implementation of advanced inspection/maintenance programs. As the vehicle fleet turns over, fewer old cars with less advanced technology will remain on the road, and the downward trend in emissions factors will slow over time. Therefore, EPA expects that growth in VMT will overtake current programs to increase growth rates more and more over time beyond the 1990&hyph;2005 time frame in the table. Of course, the OTC LEV program would be helpful in increasing and extending the downward trend in emissions factors to offset growth in VMT and counteract overall emissions growth.
