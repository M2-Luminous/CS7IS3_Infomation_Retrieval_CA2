The ensuing reluctance to turn out at local and parliamentary elections is understandable, but it is incorrect and dangerous if political parties underestimate and downplay the problem, Hromadkova said. As the DEU advocates the idea of constituting a law-abiding state, it considers the current situation in the sphere of Senate untenable, Milan Hulik, a DEU leader, said. If the Constitution laid down the Senate, the Senators should be elected, he added. However, the Senate is substantiated only in the countries where it has a long tradition, which is not the case of the Czech Republic, Hulik said. "Although frequent changes in the constitution imply casting doubt on the legal state, the change in this case would mean a lesser evil," he added. The bill ending restitution, which is being discussed now is a nonsense and the process of restitution should continue until its very end because it is the best and purest way of privatization, he said, adding that the same strategy should be applied in relation to the church property.
