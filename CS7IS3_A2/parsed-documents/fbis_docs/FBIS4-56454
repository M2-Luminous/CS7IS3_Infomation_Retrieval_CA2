He was counseled by the entire spectrum of the American foreign policy establishment not to spoil relations with Beijing. Not even for this reason did Clinton quit treating the PRC as a third-class world power, and submitted its leaders (in Beijing) to the humiliation of telling them how to treat common and political prisoners, workers, and travelers. In name of human rights, Clinton created an impasse. The Chinese cannot lose face, and the United States is ready to spoil 20 years of rapprochement with Beijing. Besides this, Clinton is not contributing to the human rights cause, as if he demands respect for the dignity of man he will not receive an answer, and if he lets the case pass without further development he will be consecrated not to be a champion of decency, but rather a weak and timid leader. One of the great problems for the Clinton administration is that it has launched itself into a crusade to increase the economy and guarantee U.S. jobs without minding the rest of the world, on whom the trade guaranteeing American jobs depends. To this we must add that Clinton was elected by a party that is nothing more than a conglomerate of permanently conflicting trends. A Democratic president must implement policies of human rights, full employment, free trade, universal democracy, government incentives for the industry, etc., and still lead world affairs -- and all this within a highly ethical framework. Few presidents have managed to escape this complex position, and Clinton is no exception. Right now, in Washington and in other capitals, those harmed and the enemies shout: Hypocrisy! Allies and friends shout: Weakness! It is difficult to reconcile what the Clinton administration says with what it does. Washington is engaged in a real trade war with Japan, which is, in fact, a closed market. One of the battle fronts is the semiconductor market. U.S. chip producers hold 43 percent of the world chip market and 20 percent of the Japanese market, while the Japanese hold 42 percent of the world market and 20 percent of the American market. Which market is closed to whom? The U.S. Government has now decided to subsidize the flat computer screen industry with $1 billion. The pretext is that portable computers are essential for the U.S. Armed Forces, and the Japanese producers, who control this market, are reluctant to sell to the U.S. Defense Department. Thus an entire U.S. industrial sector will receive subsidies. These are not subsidies masked as military research and technological development, which afterwards return as products with civilian applications, as the U.S. Government has always done it -- but are direct subsidies for the installation of industrial plants and a marketing system. It is not the first time the electronics industry has received government aid. In 1987 the government carried out the multi-billion Sematech program for the development and consolidation of the chip industry. In those days the U.S. strategic defense really depended on imported chips, and the justification for government intervention in the economic domain could be swallowed. Now, however, the objective is simply trade: to increase the 3 percent U.S.-controlled market share of flat computer screens. The Argentines are now feeling the sour aftertaste of retribution for having aligned themselves politically with the United States. Once described by the U.S. Government as a model example of trade deregulation, Argentina will now be included on the black list of the disgraceful Super 301, because it did not manage to approve an intellectual property rights law satisfying the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. It must be pointed out that the Argentine pharmaceutical industry is not big enough to affect the international business of U.S. laboratories. The U.S. policy now is to conquer every single inch of market, every available cent, always flying the most noble banners. Ecology, for example, has justified pressures on Brazilian shrimp fishermen to use contraptions costing from $100 to $500 each, which allow turtles to escape from the fishing nets. Is this concern for Brazilian turtles? Perhaps. The fact is that the United States is burdening Brazilian fishermen in the same manner it burdened them at the end of the eighties, through justified domestic pressure. Hypocrisy or weakness? Whatever it is, it could cost Brazil dearly.
