The forum will discuss issues related to the election tactics, the future government, and the SDS's partners. It was pointed out that the attitude of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] toward the government is totally irresponsible. The country's economic and political situation and the questionable status of the cabinet require the urgent initiative of President Zhelev, who, according to the SDS, must immediately begin consultations with the political forces. The SDS sees the only solution to the situation in the country as early elections.
