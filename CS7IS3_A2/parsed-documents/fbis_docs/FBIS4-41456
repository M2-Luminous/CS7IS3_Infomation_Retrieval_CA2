This was said today by Viktor Chernomyrdin at Vnukovo-2 airport on his return from the United States. In all, the work of the Gore-Chernomyrdin intergovernmental commission resulted, the Russian prime minister said, in the signing of 22 documents on technical cooperation, including in the joint conquest of space. Russia signed space contracts worth in all 200 million dollars. In addition, four agreements were signed with the World Bank on the provision of credits totalling 500 million dollars for road construction and agricultural support. In effect, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed, it was a beginning of a breakthrough toward the practical side of Russia's cooperation with U.S. partners. Viktor Chernomyrdin pointed at a close link between the results of his visit to the United States and Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to the island of Corfu, where Russia had signed a document of cooperation with the European Community. "From talking about cooperation we have now come really close to specific actions," Viktor Chernomyrdin said. "During my meeting with Clinton we managed to consolidate the results achieved by the Gore- Chernomyrdin commission." In his view, all the conditions are now in place for the upcoming G-7 meeting in Naples, which is to be attended by President Boris Yeltsin, to end in a transformation of the G-7 into a G-8.
