However, there are doubts in the construction industry about "how many of the public works could actually be carried out even if the Diet passes the budget." Under the current situation, the execution of public works cannot be carried out without the cooperation of general contractors. The construction industry fears that the open competitive bidding system, which distances itself from general contractors, could be an obstacle to the execution of public works. Getting Contracts Not Guaranteed On 25 February, 1,200 people assembled at the main hall of the first floor of Pacifico Yokohama, an international conference hall at Minato Mirai in Yokohama. They were construction contractors who had come to learn about the reform of the bidding system for Yokohama City's public works projects. Regarding that the designated bidding system, in which contractors selected by a government office based on their past business records and confidence compete to win a contract, became the hotbed of bid rigging, the Construction Ministry [MOC] and local autonomous bodies decided to introduce the open competitive bidding system. Separation from the familiar system raised uneasiness among the construction contractors, and made them come to the Pacifico Yokohama. General contractors were able to increase the possibility of being designated by the government offices, and hold an advantageous position at a bid rigging meeting by cooperating with government and municipal offices from the public works project's designing stage, which imposes a heavy burden. However, under the open competitive bidding system, winning a contract for a project that one supported by spending time and effort is not guaranteed. Such an uneasiness was not eased even after participation in the explanatory meeting at the Pacifico Yokohama. Until 40 years ago or so, government and municipal offices' own technicians had mainly designed and carried out Japan's public works projects. But, since the government offices were not able to cope with the sharp increase in the work load of public works during the days of high economic growth, they entrusted private construction firms with the job of executing public works projects, while leaving the job of designing to themselves. However, everybody in the industry knows that general contractors now "help" the government offices even in the designing stage of large-scale public works constructions. Acknowledging the situation, the MOC says, "Mapping out a plan is becoming no longer the work of clients as the significance of environmental assessment and measures to obtain understanding of a project from the people in the district prior to execution of the project increases." Possibility of Unsuccessful Bidding The MOC has its own technical research institute, and 60 percent of its 24,000 workers are engineers. While the MOC is still all right in terms of technical experts, the local autonomous bodies are much weaker. For example, Ibaraki Prefecture's Sanwa-cho, whose mayor was arrested in the general contractors' bribery scandal, "does not particularly have an expert for designing," according to the town's General Affairs Division, and this is not an isolated case. General contractors have sent their valuable architects to the government offices to help in a project because the construction companies could expect to get a contract for the construction of the project later. Besides, earnings for designing are much smaller than those for building. If general contractors are not guaranteed to receive a contract after their cooperation due to the introduction of open competitive bidding system, they will become reluctant. The system of placing an order with outside architects and paying for it is stipulated in the present reform of bidding system. While this is a chance for architecture companies and consultants, only Nippon Koei Co., Ltd., the largest company in the designing business, can make a plan for a dam. The structure in which a designing for a public works project is dependent on general contractors is still the same. If general contractors withdraw from drawing designs, public works cannot be carried out. Also, there is the possibility of unsuccessful case of bidding under the open competitive bidding system. In a public works project, expenses for machinery and materials and personnel are estimated and called the estimated price. Partly due to the decline in clients' technology, however, there is a case in which a project is estimated at 80 while it actually costs 100. Although contractors avoid to take such a contract because they make no profit, "usually a company is selected at a bid rigging meeting to take the non-profit-making contract because reestimating the costs of project by redesigning it will loose government's face," an executive of a semi-major general contractor reveals. Such a trick [to avoid a situation in which no one places a bid for a contract in which no profit is made] will not be able to be used from now on. Scale of Public Works Becomes Smaller In addition, the fact that general contractors were excluded from public works projects by being suspended from bidding after they were investigated in connection with the bribery scandal has beclouded the situation. According to the MOC's Statistics on Public Works Construction Starts, the appraised value for the constructions started from April 1993 to February 1994 is the record high of 17.449 trillion yen, which is a 2.9 percent increase from the year-ago level. The details, however, show exactly two opposite trends: the amount for the national government's projects declined 0.7 percent while the figure for local governments increased 4.0 percent. Large-scale projects by the national government have declined, and small projects have increased, such as local municipalities' road constructions and sewage maintenance which can be carried out by small and medium contractors. "The scale of construction to become small prevents the procurement of materials and machinery, such as steel, cement, and construction machines, to increase, and as a result, the demand usually created by public works becomes small," Hiroshi Fujimura, deputy manager of Research Office, Management and Planning Department of Taisei Cooperation, says. This is one of the reasons why the economy is not recovering while Japan's public works have been increased by the government's economic stimulus package. While "steady execution of public works," "fulfillment of social capital," and "expanding domestic demand" are the government's international commitments, other promises such as "introduction of open competitive bidding system," and "strict employment of Antimonopoly Law" obstruct the realization of the former objectives, creating a paradox.
