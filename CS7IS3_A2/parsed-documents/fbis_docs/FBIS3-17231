Degtyarev report on meeting with electorate of Kiyevskiy Rayon by acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy; date not given: "The Business of Both Prime Minister and Deputy"] [Text] On Tuesday, acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy reported to the electorate of Kiyevskiy Rayon in Donetsk on his deputy activity in the Supreme Council. The deputy counts to his credit dozens of problems resolved with his assistance in the rayon and the city--from deliveries of crushed stone for road repair to the construction of housing, new trolley buses, and the beginning of actual construction on the metro. Zvyahilskyy considers one of the main results of his activity in the position of acting prime minister to be surmounting the energy crisis in Ukraine. The preconditions have been established for price stabilization of products. "This averted a new price hike in January. For this they call me a suppressor of reforms." Inflation in January and February ran at 20 percent. In March it is expected to reach 30 percent. Zvyahilskyy stated that not a single state has managed without administrative measures. He points out the establishment of relations with CIS countries as one of his achievements of merit. A number of positive shifts are seen as a consequence of this--from the opening in Moscow of the Ukraine bank to the production of drugs and medicines. Ukraine will have its own insulin. Anticancer medicinal preparations will be produced in Lugansk Oblast. After presenting a half-hour report, Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy responded to questions from Donetsk citizens. [Question] Will there be new price increases? [Zvyahilskyy] Today the government is undertaking all measures to see to it that prices not only do not increase but actually begin to be systematically reduced. The Zaporozhye "Tavriya" is incredibly priced. If "trade mark-up of up to 50 percent" appears in writing, they establish it at exactly 50 percent. Now there will be a trade mark-up of up to 10 percent. The plant will decide this. The government will lower excise taxes in response. [Question] How do you assess the way banks are operating? [Zvyahilskyy] Almost all Ukrainian banks are commercial banks, with the exception of one established for hard currency transactions. A few days ago I signed a document according to which all plants will conduct hard currency transactions through this bank. There will be a scandal, of course. Commercial banks have destroyed the financial system. It was recently discovered that the salaries of certain bank managers comes to 187-185 million a month. A resolution was adopted to make salaries over 6 million subject to tax at 90 percent. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is now monitoring time frames for payment processing. [Question] How do you view commercial drugstores? [Zvyahilskyy] That is not business--selling drugs and medicines to the populace for currency. Investments in medical industrial equipment and joint enterprises for the production of medicines was one of the first questions to be discussed in meetings with the ambassadors of foreign states. In 1995-1996 we will have a complete industrial base. But it is impossible to shut down the drug stores right now since there is no market saturation with respect to medicines. [Question] Will the hryvnya be introduced, and when? [Zvyahilskyy] A plant has already been built in Ukraine for producing money. On Friday (i.e., today--Ye.D.) I will attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony along with Kravchuk and Plyushch. I have seen the new hryvnya. The hryvnya we have is better than the one from Canada. Its security features are even better. When? Let us say, this will happen Thursday, but in what... [Question] The salaries of medical personnel and teachers are low. There is no money for pay or meals in the military units. [Zvyahilskyy] Some 1.5 trillion [rubles] has already gone into pension payments for military pensioners. Five hundred billion--to grants for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 100 billion--to border troops. When the economy gets adjusted a bit more, the question of salaries for medical personnel and teachers will be examined in the Supreme Council. Their salaries should be on the level of the average in industry. Today for mine workers at mines that are meeting quotas it is 4 million, for metallurgists--3 million, energy industry workers--3.5 million karbovantsy. This is not very much, of course. The state does not have such salaries for doctors and teachers. There is simply nowhere to get the money. [Question] How do you assess Kravchuk's purchase of a "bungalow" in Switzerland when our people are impoverished? [Zvyahilskyy] I have not been to Switzerland and have not seen this "bungalow." But I do know Kravchuk. I talk with him. He is a versatile politician. [Question] What do you have to say about corruption in the upper echelons of power, including in your government? [Zvyahilskyy] I have not noticed any violations at present on the part of deputy prime ministers or ministers. Also, my personal signature alone does not suffice for any document. The endorsements of all deputy prime ministers and legal counsel must appear. I do not permit deputy prime ministers to go abroad. There is a great deal to do at home. [Question] Why do we see the highest prices for products in Donetsk and in the oblast? [Zvyahilskyy] We must get involved in prices and price formation. I was in Kirovskiy on 8 March (in connection with a mine accident). I made a special trip to the store and found that butter was being sold there for 83,000. I asked--where did they come up with such a price? It turns out they got the butter through the canteen, with a mark-up. But butter is just sitting at the warehouses today--tens of thousands of tonnes, because people will not take it at that price. Lower the price--I said. The price of butter should be 50,000-55,000. I talked with V.V. Rybak by phone and asked him how things were going. He said he had just returned from the oblast executive committee where they decided to raise the price of bread one-and-a-half times. So I asked Minister of Agriculture Demyanov to see me. We looked into it and took this question off the agenda. [Question] How do you view a federative land structuring of Ukraine? [Zvyahilskyy] I support independence. I am in favor of a bilingual system. There need not be any coercion over language. [Question] Will there be a liberalization of prices? [Zvyahilskyy] All the problems of the economy in Ukraine stem from three factors. Liberalization of prices, oil products, and the export of metals--which is taking place outside state control. I am therefore today an opponent of price liberalization. [Question] When will children's footwear appear in the stores? [Zvyahilskyy] We will have children's footwear. We have a mighty shoe industry, with new equipment. But 16 million hides were exported out of Ukraine last year. What do you use to make shoes? The Donetsk shoe factory must produce children's footwear. [Question] What is your income and how well off is your family? [Zvyahilskyy] I have been working all my life, 37 years. I spent 26 of these years as top manager in the mines. That must mean something. Today my income is on the order of 4 million a month. My wife is on pension. Our children live independently. I am a rich man, for your information. [Question] Will there be indexation of deposits of the population? [Zvyahilskyy] There is no money for this. Ukraine needs 70 trillion in order to fully implement indexation. We can do this in phases, by age: 85-80, then 80-75, and so on down to 60. That will do it. I had a conversation with Kravchuk on this topic. We hope the United States Congress will provide--in addition to that $700 million you are aware of--more credits for 1994-1996, for 10 years. Perhaps we will allot a portion of that for indexation.
