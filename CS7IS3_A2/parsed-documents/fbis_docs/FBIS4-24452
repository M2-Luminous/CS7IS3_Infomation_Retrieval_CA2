Also, said an official with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, firms outside Shanghai and Shenzhen would be allowed to issue B shares in the future. So far, 42 enterprises have issued B shares with a total capital of 3.01 billion yuan ($346 million). All are in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Many enterprises outside the two cities want to issue B shares, because they think it is a quick way to pool foreign capital. The regulatory official said some large enterprises dealing in energy, communications, transportation and railways will be selected to issue B shares. To ensure that the expansion proceeds smoothly, he said, the most important thing is to improve the trading mechanism and the information-disclosure system. Supervision over listed B-share companies will be enhanced, and the issuance, trading and settlement of B shares will be improved. He said authorities are drafting a set of national regulations governing B shares. When they are adopted, he said, the State will consider listing B-share companies outside Shanghai and Shenzhen. But the official ruled out establishing a third market for trading B shares besides the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities exchanges. While expanding the domestic B-share market, the country is also considering the listing of B-share companies on the Hong Kong Stock Market. Meanwhile, the country is considering expanding the investor base by allowing B-share firms to issue American Depository Receipts, convertible bonds and other stock-related instruments. China opened its B-share market in November 1991, when the Shanghai Vacuum Electronics Co Ltd signed the first agreement to issue B shares. Creating B shares, which are denominated in renminbi but traded in foreign exchange, was based on two considerations. First, that the establishment of a stock market available to foreign investors would help Chinese enterprises gain access to foreign capital. Second, that, since the renminbi is not freely convertible, foreign investors and stock exchange firms are limited in their scope of business and must be separated from the A-share market, which is devoted to Chinese investors. In this way the development of a domestic market could be shielded from the influence of foreign factors while the interests of overseas investors, in turn, would be protected. Securities authorities have come to realize that the long-term division of the A- and B-share markets could create many problems. "From the view of progress, the two market should be merged," said Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The most essential prerequisite for the merger, Liu said, would be the free convertibility of renminbi. Technically, the timing depends on the prices on the A-share and B-share markets. Some local investors have suggested opening the B-share market to Chinese. Analysts say that opening the B-share market to domestic investors would give it a big boost. They note that, as of the end of April, individual foreign exchange savings in the Bank of China surpassed $10 billion, enough capital to easily push up the price of B shares.
