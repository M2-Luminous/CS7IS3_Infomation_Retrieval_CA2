The automobile industry in the country should concentrate in producing a number of backbone enterprises to meet the international challenge and competition. China has listed its automobile industry as one of the pillar industries of the country. Facing the grim situation of re-entry GATT, the State Council has enacted the new industrial policy for the automobile industry and the relevant document will be published in not far distant future. According to the document, the Dong Feng Automobile Manufacturing Corporation, the First Automobile Manufacturing Factory, the Shanghai Automobile Manufacturing Factory and the Tianjin Automobile Manufacturing Factory have become the four biggest car manufacturing bases in the country. Support should be given to certain key enterprises in the improvement of their economic performance by bettering management so as to speed up their development. Mr Li asked the Dong Feng Automobile Manufacturing Corporation to increase its production capacity of Fu Kang-XZ car, which was co-produced with the Citron Group of France, to a size of annual output of 150,000 cars, increasing the rate of product indigenization and reducing production costs while guaranteeing quality of products. There are now more than 120 automobile manufacturing factories in the Mainland, most of which are considered by Mr Li as "repetition at a low level". At a cross-road of co-existence of opportunities and challenge, Mr Li said China's automobile industry must solve the problem of "small size, decentralized layout and disorder in production" in a bid to develop backbone enterprises which have ability of technological development, ability of production in a large scale and perfect marketing and service network. Mr Li made it clear that China would not approve the establishment of any new automobile manufacturing factory including joint ventures in the coming years but would welcome foreign businessmen to develop, research and produce on a large size automobile accessories for the purpose of export.
