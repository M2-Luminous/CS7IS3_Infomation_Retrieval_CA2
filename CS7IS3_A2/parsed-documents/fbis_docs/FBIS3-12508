He said: If they imagine that massacres will scare us and make the nation retreat, they are mistaken. Addressing a ceremony marking the anniversary of the birth of Imam al-Husayn and the Badr battle yesterday, Shaykh Qasim said: We are not only facing a plan to occupy the land of Palestine, but a plan to occupy the whole region. The West and its followers who claim to be Palestinian political leaders are working to take the land from its owners and perpetuate the usurping Israeli entity in the region. He affirmed that the only response to the Israeli-U.S. plan is to continue the resistance so that the West and Israel will be unable to commit massacres in our region.
