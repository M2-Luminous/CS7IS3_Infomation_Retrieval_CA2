FR940118-2-00069 FR940118-2-00047 IV Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants Section 4 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 15) provides that any person who has just been injured as a result of conduct prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages the person has suffered, as well as costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of any private antitrust damage action. Under the provisions of section 5(a) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 16(a)), the proposed Final Judgment has no prima facie effect in any subsequent private lawsuit that may be brought against defendants. V Procedure Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment The United States and defendants have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court after compliance with the provisions of the APPA, provided that the United States has not withdrawn its consent. The APPA conditions entry upon the Court's determination that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest. The APPA provides a period of at least 60 days preceding the effective date of the proposed Final Judgment within which any person may submit to the United States written comments regarding the proposed Final Judgment. Any person who wishes to comment should do so within 60 days of the date of publication of this Competitive Impact Statement in the Federal Register . The United States will evaluate the comments, determine whether it would withdraw its consent, and respond to comments. The comments and the response of the United States will be filed with the Court and published in the Federal Register . Written comments should be submitted to: Roger W. Fones, Chief Transportation, Energy & Agriculture Section, Antitrust Division, Judiciary Center Building, 555 4th Street, NW., room 9104, Washington, DC 20001. VI Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment The proposed Final Judgment requires that either Dresser's interest in M&hyph;I or Baroid Drilling, and Baroid's diamond bit business be sold to a purchaser or purchasers that would use the respective businesses promptly to become viable competitors in both of the product markets alleged in the Complaint. Thus, compliance with the proposed Final Judgment and the completion of the divestitures required by the Judgment would resolve the competitive concerns raised by the proposed transaction, and assure that the respective businesses would remain independent and active competitors to Dresser's drilling fluid and diamond bit businesses in the United States. Litigation is, of course, always an alternative to a consent decree in a section 7 case. The United States rejected this alternative because the divestitures required under the proposed Final Judgment should prevent the merger of Dresser and Baroid from having a significant anticompetitive effect in either of the two relevant product markets alleged, and will provide substantially all of the relief requested in the Complaint. The United States believes that in the hands of appropriate purchasers, the drilling fluid business that is divested and Baroid's diamond bit business will likely maintain their respective competitive roles in the United States. The United States is satisfied that the proposed Final Judgment fully resolves the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger alleged in the Complaint. Although the proposed Final Judgment may not be entered until the criteria established by the APPA (115 U.S.C. 15 (b)&hyph;(h)) have been satisfied, the public will benefit immediately from the safeguards in the proposed Final Judgment because the defendants have stipulated to comply with the terms of the Judgment pending its entry by the Court. VII Determinative Materials and Documents There are no materials or documents that the United States considered to be determinative in formulating this proposed Final Judgment. Accordingly, none are being filed with this Competitive Impact Statement. Dated: December 23, 1993. Respectfully submitted, Angela L. Hughes, Denise L. Diaz, Attorneys, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, Judiciary Center Building, room 9104, 555 Fourth Street NW., Washington, DC 20001, (202) 307&hyph;6410.
