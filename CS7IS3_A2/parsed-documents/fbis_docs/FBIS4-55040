The sole point on the agenda was a motion by a group of Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] deputies that Roman Kovac be recalled from the post of deputy prime minister. The 100 minutes of a pitiful debate without any conclusive arguments in support of the accusations were concluded by a vote. The first attempt to wipe out the coalition government minister by minister did not come off. [Gembicky] Deputy prime minister, did you have any idea about the specific contents of the accusations? [Kovac] We have known about the HZDS tactics to propose dismissals of government members for about three weeks. They were laid down by Vladimir Meciar in the HZDS Club of Deputies. In line with these tactics, at every plenary meeting of Parliament they will come up with at least one motion to recall a member of the coalition government. I do not know whether I should consider it an honor that I was chosen as the first target. We did expect, however, that one of the former collaborators, who have now automatically become the biggest enemies for the HZDS, would be chosen first. I knew very little about the accusations cited in the motion -- that they concerned the inability to cope with the post of deputy prime minister, a suspected attempt at corruption, and a flawed moral profile. That was all I knew. [Gembicky] But already at that time reports were leaked from HZDS lobbies that the matter supposedly concerned an order for Siemens medical appliances.... [Kovac] The problem is that not a single specific accusation was raised by HZDS deputies in Parliament. They only wanted to discredit me in the eyes of the public. They will never prove what they accused me of. I knew that the proposal to recall me would be put forward by Mr. Masiar. His speech was followed by statements by a group of female HZDS deputies. That came as a surprise to me, and so did the statement by deputy J. Rea, who is a deeply religious man. While working at the Government Office, we used to go to the chapel for services together. It took my breath away that he, as a Christian, lowered himself and put his signature to such a heap of lies. The paradoxical thing is that I was hardly involved in the whole Siemens case. I met the firm's representatives only when they presented their offer to extend a loan to Slovakia. I was unable to assess how advantageous the terms of the loan were, which is why I invited Finance Minister Julius Toth, who was to assess the quality and specifications of the loan, as well as Health Minister Viliam Sobona to attend the talks. That was my first and last meeting with Siemens representatives. Ultimately, the agreement was signed by Viliam Sobona and handed over to Siemens by Vladimir Meciar. [Gembicky] Your signature did not figure under the agreement? [Kovac] No. And I was not invited to any subsequent talks. I came across the offer from Siemens once more when this material was submitted to a meeting of the cabinet that I happened to chair. It is remarkable that, originally, it had been submitted to the government as a financial credit but the Slovak National Bank governor objected that it was not a financial credit but a supplier's credit. Besides, the material had not been supplemented with any mention of a competitive tender. There were also objections to the repayment timetable, which is why we withdraw the item from the agenda. That was all. [Gembicky] On Wednesday [4 May] evening, speaking at the Na Pasienkoch indoor stadium, former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar also accused you of having embezzled $5 million earmarked for media policy.... [Kovac] Deputy J. Rea, too, reiterated this absurdity later that night. The sum of $5 million is an enormous one. It is not customary to give sums of this magnitude as a bribe. I would never be able to accept such money and, if I could, then only for state coffers to subsidize much needed and loss-generating periodicals, such as children's periodicals. [Gembicky] You supposedly brought it up at a government meeting? [Kovac] I beg your pardon, if someone wanted to collect such a sum in dollars, would he bring it up at a government meeting? This is ludicrous.... [Gembicky] But supposedly there are witnesses.... [Kovac] When J. Rea uttered these accusations, not a single former member of the government -- three of whom were present -- got up and said that this was true. [Gembicky] One cannot seek redress in court against something that was said in Parliament. What about the things that were said at the rally at Na Pasienkoch? [Kovac] I must get hold of the exact transcript of the rally. Then I will decide whether to seek redress in court. I believe, however, that the HZDS will be sued by Siemens, which has been accused of being a corrupt firm. [Gembicky] How did your coalition partners respond to the accusations? [Kovac] The aim was absolutely clear to everyone. I appreciate their statements. [Gembicky] In what way did you fail to cope with the post of deputy prime minister, according to the motion? [Kovac] I supposedly did not cope with the management of ministries. However, I was only supposed to coordinate their activity. Furthermore, I supposedly bear my share of responsibility for the catastrophic situation in the health services. But I did not run the ministry. Quite the contrary, I beseeched Vladimir Meciar not to recommend Viliam Sobona for that post and asked him five times to recall him from it. Deputy Meciar denied this, even though witnesses were present. They also blame me for having established an advisory commission to analyze the situation in the health services. My third sin concerns the dispute between [former Health Minister] Sobona and [former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs] Keltosova over the concept of the National Insurance Company. I have also been accused of failure to cope with the tripartite council, even though I succeeded in maintaining social peace in a complicated situation when unpopular measures had to be taken. Nor did I obstruct the signing of the general agreement [between government, employers, and trade unions]. It was [Finance Minister] Julius Toth who vetoed the acceptance of the social fund. Trade unionists could confirm my words. At night, after recalling me from the government, they sent a car to Piestany to fetch [chairman of the Confederation of Trade Unions] Alojz Englis and [chairman of the Employers' Association] Mr. Lach in order to sign the general agreement early in the morning, after an unnecessary delay of six weeks. It was necessary to prove that things work better without Kovac. [Gembicky] And what about the moral accusation that, by your personal approach, you stood in the way of an HZDS-Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] coalition? [Kovac] This coalition had been blocked by a decision of the HZDS national leadership, not by me. Some HZDS deputy even accused me of having actually changed the history of Slovakia. The best reply to this accusation was given by [SDL Chairman] Peter Weiss. [Gembicky] What affected you most strongly about the accusations raised by your former colleagues from the HZDS? [Kovac] I am grateful to those people from the HZDS who refused to sign the motion that I be recalled. However, some of the 35 names [that signed the motion] did surprise me. [Gembicky] Could you be more specific? [Kovac] Yes. I was surprised by the readiness of deputies Aibekova, Valcekova, and Romanovska to put their signatures to the motion.
