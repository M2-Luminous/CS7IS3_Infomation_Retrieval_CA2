High prevalence of HBV infection in China is well known, but anti-HDV antibody positive rate in HBV infected population is very low (0-2.7 percent) except XinJiang, XiZang (Tibet) and NeiMengGu (Inner Mongolia). In order to study if there are variant subtype of HDV in China, two Chinese HDV-cDNA fragments encoding HDAg were isolated from recombinants by PCR with specific primers. They were inserted into expression plasmid pBV220 and transformed into E. coli DH5 _a_. The ampicillin-resistant positive clones were selected by in situ hybridization with specific Digoxigenin labelled HDV-cDNA probe and ELISA. The results show that both fragments encoding HDAg either 214 amino acids or 74 amino acids at the N terminal end of ORF5 (according to Wang's report 1986) show the activity of HDAg. The ELISA titer was 1:10,000 to 1:32,000. SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and Western blotting show that the molecular weights were about 29 kD and 10 kD respectively. The large HDAg has the activity of binding HDV-RNA but the small HDAg has lost the site of binding. It is interesting that the large Chinese HDAg expressed in E. coli also has the ability of binding Neo-RNA. The mechanism of this nonspecific reaction and its significance should be studied. These antigens reacted specifically with anti-HD positive serum and anti-HD monoclonal antibodies. These antigens also had high immunogenicity for production of antibody.
