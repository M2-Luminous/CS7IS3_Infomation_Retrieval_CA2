This non-destructive testing equipment, heavier forms of which have long been used for nuclear reactor monitoring, can now be conveniently used out in the field for a variety of other tests. The key to the completion of this task, which the NTU researchers took over 6 years ago from the National Defense Science, Technology and Industry Commission, was the development of the scintillation augmentation screen, whose main performance parameters--especially imaging speed and resolution have been certified by the experts to meet the best current international standards. The system, which has a sealed neutron source tube, can take either film photographs or can send low-light-level cumulative images to a computer for further enhancement.
