It will thus be able to greatly spur growth in several other regions of the country. This goal was set forth by the minister of the presidency of the republic, Carlos Sanchez Berzain, who spoke at length with the LOS TIEMPOS editorial staff in the city of La Paz during a working breakfast, touching in particular on several facets of the status of, problems in, and projections for regional development in the Department of Cochabamba. After indicating that this major region of the country was "constantly deceived during the four years of the previous administration," the minister, who prides himself on being a genuine and dedicated representative of Cochabamba in the Executive Branch, noted that the political and historical process that the country is now undergoing raises hopes that this department can become a major center for generating and spurring national development. "Cochabamba must regain the leadership that it has had in various spheres of national life throughout the history of the republic," the minister of the presidency stated optimistically. The Myth of Misicuni During their conversation Berzain and the editors of LOS TIEMPOS gave lengthy consideration to the multipurpose Misicuni project, which various segments of the population in Cochabamba and nationwide see as the major one for promoting regional development. "Misicuni is no doubt the project that has been talked up the most, the one that has been inaugurated most often, and the one that has always been manipulated politically by various parties, without anything definite ever having been done to realize it in the short or medium term," the minister of the presidency contended. He reported that so far real sources of financing for the project have not been firmed up. He recalled that as the previous administration (former President Jaime Paz Zamora's) was drawing to a close, it merely started trying to secure a loan from the Italian Government so that it could begin work on part of the first stage of diverting the Serketa and Titiri rivers. This stage was also manipulated politically for clear-cut vote-getting purposes. He said that President Sanchez de Lozada's administration has continued these efforts, and an official response from the Italian Government is expected in February or March of next year. He explained that the current administration's policy is to preserve the multipurpose nature of the Misicuni Project, which is regarded as a national priority. To this end, it will be included as an essential component of the package of programs that will be submitted to the Consulting Council of the World Bank that will be meeting from 8 to 10 December in Washington. The administration will also negotiate a line of credit with the Inter-American Development Bank for the hydroelectric component of the project. He indicated, however, that "the first signs that the Misicuni Project is solving the problem of drinking and irrigation water are not expected to be seen for about five years." He thus said that there was an urgent need to develop alternative solutions that can be implemented quickly. Water Wells After indicating that the shortfall in drinking water supplies for the Cochabamba population is about 400 liters per second, Sanchez Berzain reaffirmed that the administration is determined to find quick solutions to this disturbing problem. In this connection, he reported that the administration has decided to give additional support to SEMAPA. It has pledged $300,000, $100,000 of which has already been disbursed, to harness water in the El Paso zone, where it expects to obtain an extra 107 liters a second for Cochabamba. He also mentioned the important technical studies that are being conducted with France's cooperation on drilling new wells to harness deep waters with the precautions necessary to prevent environmental damage in the region. He announced that the overall 1994 budget would include $800,000 for these drilling projects and for the expansion and renovation of the systems that distribute drinking water to the city of Cochabamba. He noted that "all this will be done without putting aside Misicuni at any time, but as President Sanchez de Lozada said, we are going to crow only after the egg has been laid." Oil Region Another topic that Minister Carlos Sanchez discussed during his talk with LOS TIEMPOS at the seat of government was Cochabamba's membership in the club of departments that have traditionally produced hydrocarbons, such as Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, and Tarija. He indicated that although Cochabamba's history as a potential hydrocarbons-producing region goes back many years, the department was long neglected because of the deceit of previous administrations and interference by certain sectors from other regions of the country. He pointed out that the situation has now been completely reversed, as Cochabamba looks to become the second largest fossil fuels producing department in 1994 and the largest in 1995. Sanchez noted that these projections, which President Sanchez de Lozada recently underscored on his visit to the Bulo Bulo oil field, represent a fundamental short-term change for the department of Cochabamba, which is taking shape as a major center of national development. He announced that the 1994 budget appropriates around $103 million for oil exploration and development projects in that department. He also gave assurances that the Carrasco-Valle Hermoso multipurpose pipeline would be completed, adding that there is a $23 million credit line for this purpose as part of the investment program totaling $77 million. Export Center The administration's overall plans for the regional development of Cochabamba also include turning the city's air terminal into one of the country's main export centers, especially in connection with nontraditional goods with value added. "We want to turn Cochabamba into the country's major aeronautical center," he said, adding that for this purpose the offices of the president and senior executives of Lloyd Aereo Boliviano have been ordered transferred to that city. He indicated that the new air terminal for passengers and freight may open in February of next year. He reaffirmed that as of then we can start building a major center for the export of processed foods, fruits, and other items and promote greater exports of various manufactured goods and handicrafts. The Coca Problem Berzain was equally optimistic about the problem of excess coca production in the tropical region of Cochabamba, which some opinion groups see as a hindrance to the department's regional development. He felt that the problem was on the way to a solution. "The excess production of coca is an economic problem that has an economic solution," he said, adding that the administration is bent on promoting programs to improve social conditions in the neglected rural areas of that department and other regions of the country to prevent large groups of peasants from moving into the Chapare.
