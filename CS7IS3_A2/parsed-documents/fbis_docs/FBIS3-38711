In a message he sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija Izetbegovic, Demirel expressed his deep regret over the horrendous attack in Sarajevo. He said: This recent attack shows once again that the time has come and gone for the civilized world and for the international organizations that represent it to fulfill their responsibilities. I call on the civilized world once again to silence with an air operation -- within the framework of the UN and NATO resolutions -- the heavy weapons of those forces mercilessly besieging Sarajevo as soon as possible, and to take effective measures to lift this siege. I am conveying our demands regarding this issue with messages to the concerned international organizations and to the leaders of the leading countries of the world. I extend Turkey's and my own personal condolences to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina for those killed in this despicable attack. I affirm that, as always, Turkey is on the side of Bosnia-Herzegovina and is ready to extend to it every kind of support. Taking this opportunity, I extend my deepest respects.
