As the spring breeze is blowing over the vast land of China, Premier Li Peng, faced by the deputies to the Second Session of the National People's Congress [NPC], once again walked to the platform of the 10,000-seat auditorium to begin delivering his seventh government work report since his assumption of the premiership. His report went from reviewing the domestic work last year to spelling out the basic principles for work this year; from maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy to accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic structure; from developing science and technology, education, and culture to strengthening the building of socialist democracy and the legal system; and from promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland to expounding on China's foreign affairs work.... Condensed in his 16,000-character report were the part reviewing the domestic work of the past year, the part on future prospects, the part on domestic and foreign policies, and the part on principles and tasks. People will notice, through a comparison, that this year's government work report, because it concentrated on the main points and was concise, was the shortest government work report in the past 15 years. A person in charge of the government work report drafting group explained the reason: One of the reasons for shortening the work report is that the national major policies and principles have been clearly defined. In particular, the basic principles for party and national work this year mapped out by the party Central Committee, as well as the general situation characterized by "seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability," provided a good foundation for the drafting of the work report. Therefore, the government work report, which was more concise than past reports, while focusing on the implementation of the important guidelines of the Central Committee, concentrated on the major tasks to be carried out by the State Council this year. It did not list the 1993 achievements of each ministry and its tasks for 1994. Although the work report was concise, it was rich in content. On the basis of the basic principles for party and national work and in the interest of the whole party and national work, the report, from the angle of government work, put forward a series of measures concerning the correct handling of the relationships between reform, development, and stability. -- "Development is the last word." Development requires a rational growth rate. Neither an excessively high growth rate nor an excessively low growth rate can realize our projected targets. In his report, Premier Li Peng proposed that the gross domestic product will increase by 9 percent this year. At the same time, he stressed the "importance of raising economic performance." Authoritative sources commented that this is a positive and steady growth rate. This shows that the government is becoming more mature in understanding the laws governing economic development. For today's China, whether the economy can develop significantly depends, in the final analysis, on the intensity, depth, and breadth of reform and opening up, as well as on the acceleration of the drive for building a socialist market economic system. The 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee produced a general blueprint and an action program for this purpose. The government work report, therefore, did not simply repeat this point but highlighted tasks in six areas in light of the demands outlined in the government work report, the distinctive aspects of this year's situation, and the reform plans, which had been basically introduced, on financial, taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade systems. It also urged governments at all levels to "devote greater efforts to reform," to combine breakthroughs in key areas with package reform, and to make substantial progress in reform of the economic system. Whether in reform or development, we cannot proceed without a stable and relaxed environment; otherwise, discussion of anything is out of the question. It is evident that the many reform and development measures enumerated in the report are sound strategies for maintaining stability because they are designed to control inflation and the scale of investment, to appropriately increase the purchase prices of grain and cotton, to alleviate peasants' burdens, to increase peasants' incomes by all means, to relieve all state-owned enterprises of their obligations to contribute to construction funds for key energy and transportation projects and to regulatory budget funds, to allocate special funds for reorganizing bankrupt enterprises and for reassigning their workers and staff members, to control price increases and stabilize foodstuffs prices in urban and rural areas, to continue to battle corruption in a deep-going and sustained manner, and to intensify efforts to improve public order in a comprehensive way. All this will serve the sole purpose of creating a good environment for reform and development. Reform, development, and stability are complementary, and none of them is dispensable. This is the result of summing up and reviewing our past experience, as well as a six-character dictum for carrying out all of our tasks successfully. As in the case of government work, the report reflected a practical style throughout. -- In the past, any discussion of economic work invariably entailed an attempt to use increases in output value as an important criterion for evaluating performance. This year's report, however, replaced the phrase "output value" with the formulation "added value." Authoritative people are of the opinion that the main difference between the two phrases lies in the fact that the phrase "added value" excludes the prices of intermediary inputs, such as raw and semifinished materials and energy. This helps avoid such deficiencies as the repetitive calculation and transfer of prices, overcomes the tendency to unduly stress output value, and places greater emphasis on efficiency in our country's economic development. Moreover, it reflects the end result of social production more truthfully. --While realistically outlining our achievements, the report frankly pointed out shortcomings and inadequacies in our work and truthfully set forth contradictions and difficulties: The investment scale for fixed assets is overextended; commodity prices have increased by a relatively large margin; the problem of an irrational economic structure remains salient; some state-owned large and medium enterprises face considerable difficulties in production and management; public order in some localities is bad; the fight against social ills is not forceful enough; a handful of government functionaries engage in corrupt practices such as embezzlement, bribery, favoritism, and fraud; and formalism and bureaucratism exist in government departments...[ellipses as received] Only a people's government has the courage and magnanimity to confront deficiencies and acknowledge difficulties instead of eschewing problems and disguising contradictions; only a people's government can improve its work, promote what is beneficial, and eliminate what is harmful with the support and under the supervision of the general public in order to better serve the people. -- Compared to previous reports, this year's report placed greater emphasis on spiritual civilization. Past government work reports subsumed science and technology, education, and culture on the one hand, and democracy and the legal system on the other, either under the section dealing with economic construction or the section dealing with social development. This year's report specifically discussed issues in these two areas under two independent sections, thus giving greater weight to such issues than in the past. This shows that in keeping the general situation under control, government departments place a greater premium on the coordinated development of the economic base and the superstructure, paying more attention to overall social progress. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic concept of "carrying out two tasks simultaneously and attaching equal importance to both" is being implemented further. After the drafting work began in mid-December of last year, the government work report submitted to the Second Session of the Eighth NPC for examination and approval was discussed and revised many times by the State Council's executive meetings and by meetings of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and its Standing Committee. Various localities and departments, as well as people in all circles, were canvassed extensively. Premier Li Peng even held five rounds of informal discussions to hear the views of officials in charge of various democratic parties; people with no party affiliation; people in scientific and technological, educational, and cultural circles; and some comrades from public security and judicial departments at the grass-roots level, enterprises, and institutions. The range of opinions canvassed was broader than before. People can see that the party's fine tradition of promoting democracy and drawing on all useful ideas is being expanded during the new period. At the end of its delivery, the report was greeted with warm, prolonged applause from deputies, who represent 56 nationalities, in a gesture of trust and support.
