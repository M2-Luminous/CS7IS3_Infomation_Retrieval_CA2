FR940428-1-00031 FR940428-1-00008 Proposed §222.11(d)(1) provides that livestock owners responsible for nonwillful unauthorized use would be charged the unauthorized use rate. This section also provides for the charge to be waived if certain criteria outlined in the proposed rule are met. In the case of a waiver there would be no unauthorized use or service charges to the permittee when the situation has been resolved to the satisfaction of the authorized officer. Paragraphs (2) and (3) of proposed §222.11(d) provide for charging two times the unauthorized use rate for willful unauthorized use and three times the unauthorized use rate for repeated willful unauthorized use. When unauthorized use is found to be willful, or repeatedly willful, charges will be assessed for the full cost of all resource and property damage resulting from the unauthorized use and all reasonable expenses incurred by the United States in detecting, investigating, and resolving such unauthorized use. In recognition that Forest Service financial penalties have not been effective as a deterrent in preventing unauthorized use in the past, this section of the proposed rule represents a significant increase in penalties for unauthorized use. Strong support for this section of the proposed rule was contained in the public comments on the ANPR. This support was based on the need for Forest Service enforcement of the terms and conditions of grazing permits and for strong penalties for willful unauthorized use; also, for the recognition that some situations of unauthorized use are unintentional and the appropriate resolution does not entail a financial penalty. Proposed Section 222.12_Information Collection Requirements While this is a new section in the proposed rule describing information requirements associated with the application and administration of grazing permits, the type of information requested has been routinely collected by the agency in its grazing permit administration activities for many years. For a description of the information requirements associated with this rule, see the discussion of ``Information Requirements'' at the end of this ``Supplementary Information'' section. Proposed Section 222.13_Improvements The current regulation at §222.9 authorizes the Forest Service to grant permission to individuals, organizations, or other agencies to perform range improvement work on National Forest System lands and other lands under Forest Service control. Additionally, the current rule allows authorized officers to require permittees to maintain range improvements to specified standards. The proposed rule at §222.13 includes the provisions of the current rule but would be reorganized for ease of use. The only substantive changes embodied in this section is to incorporate provisions related to the Range Betterment Fund into this section of the proposed rule (currently at §222.10) and to conform the rules prohibiting adjustment of fees or charges for range improvement work to the new rules governing grazing fees in the East adopted in 1990. The current rule at §222.10 details background and direction for range development through the Range Betterment Fund. Direction presently contained in the current rule at §222.10 has now more appropriately been incorporated into the Forest Service Manual (FSM 2240). Therefore, direction for use of the Range Betterment Fund in the proposed rule is greatly reduced from that in the current rule and is incorporated in paragraph (c) of proposed §222.13. The current rule at §222.9(d) prohibits adjusting grazing fees or charges for number of head months to compensate permittees for range improvement work performed on National Forest System lands with the exception of National Grasslands and land utilization projects. On January 26, 1990, FR 2646, Vol. 55, No. 18, Subpart C of part 222 was amended to allow grazing fee credits for range improvements on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States to facilitate the development of ranges. Therefore, the proposed rule at §222.13(d) makes clear where the use of grazing fee credits or adjustments for rangeland improvement work is authorized within the National Forest System. Proposed paragraph (d)(1) references the specific sections of Subpart C of part 222 authorizing grazing fee credits for rangeland improvements on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States. Proposed paragraph (d)(2) continues the provision of the current rule at §222.9(d) authorizing the adjustment of annual grazing fees on National Grasslands or Land Utilization Projects to reflect the cost to a grazing permittee of complying with required conservation practices. Proposed paragraph (d)(3) then specifically states that adjustment in grazing fees charged in exchange for rangeland improvement work is not authorized on all other National Forest System lands except as provided in proposed paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3). Proposed Section 222.14_Compensation for Permittees' Interest in Range Improvements This section of the proposed rule provides for and sets the conditions under which permittees may be compensated for investments in existing rangeland improvements in the event of grazing permit cancellation. The proposed rule at §222.14(a) would incorporate the provisions of the current rule §222.6(a) which directs that whenever a term permit for grazing livestock on National Forest lands in the 16 contiguous Western States is cancelled, that the current permittee shall be compensated for the current value of any authorized permanent range improvements they placed or constructed on the lands. This situation applies when the permit is cancelled, in whole or in part, to devote the land to another public purpose, including disposal. This provision is applicable only when lands are actually permanently excluded from grazing and does not apply in the situation when a grazing permit is partially reduced due to resource conditions but grazing use continues at a reduced level. The value of these range improvements may not exceed the fair market value of the terminated portion of the permittee(s) interest in the improvement. Questions have arisen concerning the status of former permittees and any interest they might have had in a range improvement. To address these questions, the proposed rule at §222.14 (b) and (c) would state that those permittees who had waived permits or allowed permits to expire prior to receiving notice of cancellation of grazing in an area would not be entitled to compensation under this section. This is intended to clarify the direction in the current rule at §222.6(b) concerning permittees who have waived their permit in connection with the sale of permitted livestock or base property. Proposed Section 222.15_Recognition and Cooperation With Local Livestock or Grazing Associations and Districts This section of the proposed rule deals with the recognition of and subsequent issuance of term permits to local livestock or grazing associations and the requirements that must be met and adhered to in order to maintain that recognition. Section 222.7(a) of the current rule authorizes and sets out procedures for Forest Officers to recognize and cooperate with local livestock associations. Section 222.15 of the proposed rule covers the same information in the current rule at §222.7(a); however, the text has been edited for clarity and contains two modifications of existing practice. Historically, a clause has been included in term permits which specified that grazing association or district members must address their grievances to the association or district in accordance with the term permit and the governing constitution and bylaws of the organization. This requirement should be in the rule. Accordingly, the proposed rule would include this longstanding grievance process at §222.15(a)(2).
