FR940627-2-00014 FR940627-2-00011 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Department of the Army Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a Land Exchange Between the City of Columbus, GA and Fort Benning AGENCY: Department of the Army, U.S. Infantry Center, DOD. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: Public Law 101&hyph;510, November 5, 1990, authorized a land exchange between the City of Columbus, Georgia and the Department of the Army (Fort Benning). In this agreement, the City receives approximately 3,125 acres of land from Fort Benning, and in exchange, the City will convey to Fort Benning approximately 3,225 acres located on the southern boundary of the military reservation, land currently owned by a third party, Mead Coated Board, Inc. The City intends to use the land to expand its existing sanitary landfill, to develop tracts for economic development, and to provide land for passive recreation. Fort Benning will use the land it receives to augment training areas in the southern part of the military reservation. DATES: Comments must be received not later than August 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: U.S. Army Infantry Center, ATTN: EMD&hyph;DPW, Environmental Manager, Fort Benning, Goergia 31905. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John J. Brent, Environmental Manager, (706) 545&hyph;4766. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Alternatives The purpose of the EIS is to document surveys and studies necessary to fully satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the National Historical Act, and the Clean Water Act, thus allowing the Secretary of the Army to approve the land transfer. It is further intended to provide the necessary information which will allow the City to properly plan the development of its parcel in harmony with the environment. As required by NEPA, the ``no-action'' alternative will be analyzed as a baseline for gauging the impact of the proposed land swap. Public Involvement The public is invited to participate in the scoping process and to review available documentation from on-going environmental surveys in a public meeting to be held on Wednesday, July 20, 1994, on the plaza of the Columbus Government Center, 100 Tenth Street, Columbus, Georgia. The meeting will start at 7 p.m. EDT. An announcement will be made in the local news media. Kenneth L. Denton, Army Federal Register Liaison Officer.
