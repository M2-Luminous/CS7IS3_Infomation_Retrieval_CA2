The law provides for pegging the Lithuanian litas to one specific hard currency. According to the new law, which comes into effect April 1, all lits released into circulation will be fully backed by hard currency and gold reserves of the central bank. On Monday, Lithuanian commercial banks virtually stopped selling hard currency and only some banks sold the U.S. dollar for 4.10 lits instead of the earlier 3.93. The exchange rate of other hard currencies went up by 0.02-0.05 litas. The official U.S. dollar rate did not change so sharply. It edged up by 0.01 litas on Monday and by another 0.05 litas on Tuesday. Trading became more active at the Lithuanian Interbank Currency Exchange. The volume of trade last week ran at 1-1.5 million U.S. dollars but increased to nearly 5 million on Monday and topped 2.5 million on Tuesday. Julius Niedvaras, president of the Lithuanian Commercial Banks Association, told Lithuanian TV that commercial banks are waiting and do not quite know how to act. In Niedvaras' opinion, if the litas rate against a chosen hard currency will be set in Lithuania, it is possible that the exchange rate will be around 4 lits to the U.S. dollar, but if the decision is made in Washington, for example, the rate may set at 3.5 lits to the dollar.
