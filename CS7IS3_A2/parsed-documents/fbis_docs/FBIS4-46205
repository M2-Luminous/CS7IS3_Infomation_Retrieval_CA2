The peace agreement is between the government and 600 militia members of Medellin's northeastern and northwestern communities. [passage omitted] With the support of the Army and the police, urban bus services are gradually being restored to Medellin and the surrounding communities. Currently the Granizal area is cordoned off and heavily militarized. After 1000 this morning in Granizales, during an event led by Government Minister Fabio Villegas Ramirez, the peace agreement will be signed by three of Medellin's five popular militias. This translates into the demobilization and disarmament of approximately 650 men from the three armed groups. [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1318 GMT on 26 May reports that three taxis, as well as 10 buses, were burned and that no injuries or fatalities were reported. The report says that bus service in Medellin has been drastically reduced because of fear among bus drivers and owners that their vehicles might be targeted, adding that authorities believe that the escalation of guerrilla activities is related to the 29 May elections.]
