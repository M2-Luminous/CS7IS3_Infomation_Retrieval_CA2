Schiaretti said that the protest march carried out by state workers and teachers on 16 February "does not represent the majority of the Santiago people's feelings." The acting head of Santiago's Executive Branch said his administration "has paid all public administration workers' back salaries," adding that "the financial situation is being balanced." Schiaretti denied the existence of any "social unrest" in the province, adding that the fact that on 16 February there were "1,000 people on the streets does not mean they represent the entire community's feelings, particularly considering that 40,000 people demonstrated during the original outburst. [no closing quotation mark as published] The trustee made these remarks at government house following a meeting with Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf to analyze the province's political situation. Asked about the incidents the day before between police and workers who were peacefully occupying a textile plant and which ended with eight people wounded, Schiaretti said he regretted what happened, stressing that the "police action followed a court eviction order." Regarding the beginning of the school year Schiaretti said "classes will begin in March as scheduled." Meanwhile, the provincial front of struggling unions called for a mobilization on 26 February to reject the salary policy implemented by the trustee, while secondary and university teachers announced that they will not go to work until their demands are answered. The front insisted that it will present 20,000 signatures requesting the repeal of the comprehensive adjustment law [ley omnibus de ajuste] while the CGT [General Confederation of Labor] regional unit offered their "unrestricted support to the struggle of local trade unions." The 26 February march will be the second organized by workers against measures adopted by the trustee. The first one was carried out on 16 February.
