The intensive three-day discussions, which went on virtually around the clock, resulted in decisions on the most complex problems in the Abkhazian drama, such as the return of the refugees, the strengthening of confidence and security, and the use of peacekeeping forces. These decisions have been included in the communique of the meeting, which was signed by the heads of the delegations and the representatives of the United Nations, Russia, and the CSCE. The present round of talks in Geneva, like the previous one (30 November-1 December), has been conducted under the aegis of the United Nations with Russia's assistance. The Georgian delegation was headed by Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the Interim Committee for the State of Emergency and parliamentary deputy, and the Abkhazian delegation by Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, chairman of the Council of Ministers. A lot of effort had to be exerted by the international mediators -- Edouard Brunner, the UN secretary general's special envoy, and Boris Pastukhov, Russian Federation deputy foreign minister -- to make agreement possible. One of the main results was the commitment, affirmed by the sides in the communique, not to use force and not to resort to the threat of force. The sides asked the UN Security Council to extend the mandate of the UN observation mission in Georgia, instructing it to monitor the nonresumption of hostilities. They advocated locating in the conflict zone UN peacekeeping forces or other forces sanctioned by the United Nations, expressing mutual agreement to the use of a Russian military contingent within them. The stationing of the "blue helmets" must be followed by the withdrawal of all armed formations within five days from the Inguri River and other possible zones of confrontation -- their place will be taken by the peacekeeping forces. The sundry volunteer formations and individuals who have arrived to participate in the conflict must be disarmed and withdrawn. A commission for refugee problems is being formed with the participation of representatives of the sides, the United Nations, and Russia. It is planned to start the phased return of refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia as of 10 February -- to Galskiy Rayon in the first phase. The most difficult question involved in finding a settlement -- that of Abkhazia's future political status -- will be discussed within the framework of the previously formed group of experts, which will meet for its next sitting 8 February in Moscow. On 22 February the delegations and international mediators intend to conduct a new round of talks in Moscow or Geneva. As Sandro Kavsadze, member of the Georgian delegation and chairman of the Georgian committee for human rights and interethnic relations, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the talks have made it possible "to move toward a settlement." Although the discussion was of a "very sharp nature and there were some fairly conflictual situations," "we reached agreement and understanding on the main issues." Having noted the great significance of the agreements, Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, head of the Abkhazian delegation, emphasized the important role of the Russian Federation in the settlement. "Thanks to the efforts of the Russian delegation and Russia as a whole, many positive results were achieved," he said in an interview with ITAR-TASS's correspondent. "Even in the past the Russian Federation did all it could to bring our positions closer together. Indeed, life itself evidently preordains it to participate in the fate of the peoples which were brought together by the Soviet Union."
