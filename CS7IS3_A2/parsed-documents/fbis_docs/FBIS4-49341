On May 2, the first day when the new currency was put into circulation in the territory, more than 40,000 local residents had reportedly turned up in front of BOC's central headquarters and its 31 branches and 44 automatic teller machines throughout the territory in order to obtain the new banknotes. "Some even stayed overnight outside our bank in order to get the new banknotes," said a clerk of a BOC's branch in Wanchai district. A 63-old man, named Chan Cheung, had to dash back home to get more money as he did not bring enough with him. He said, "I was late. But I was lucky and managed to join the last few customers in the queue to get a set of the new notes. I am fortunate that I live near the bank". Not all people are as fortunate as Chan. Many felt disappointed as they were not able to get the new banknotes owing to the long queues. At least 65.2 million Hong Kong dollars worth of new banknotes issued by BOC was withdrawn on the first day, said an official with BOC. Besides, a total of 70,000 MTR [mass transit railway] tickets designed to commemorate the launch of the new banknotes, each at a price of 30 H.K. [Hong Kong] dollars, were sold out within just one hour at BOC's 31 branches yesterday. Meanwhile, the 20,000 souvenir covers and postmarks were snapped up as hundreds of people queued up outside the general post office in central early yesterday and rushed in to buy the covers each worth of five H.K. dollars [as received]. Another 130,000 commemorative MTR tickets with an encoded value of 20 H.K. dollars (2.5 U.S. dollars) each, had reportedly sold out at eight MTR counters on the first day of issue on Sunday [1 May]. An official from the bank said that 100,000 H.K. dollars (13,000 U.S. dollars) raised from the sale would be donated to charity. The banknotes initially issued by the Bank of China totalled 3 billion H.K. dollars (385 million U.S. dollars) in value, which accounted for four percent of Hong Kong dollar banknotes in circulation. By issuing the banknotes in Hong Kong, the Bank of China has become the third bank to issue currency in the territory. The other two banks are the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp and Standard Chartered Bank. Analysts here said that the Bank of China's participation in the issue of Hong Kong dollar notes indicated the bank's commitment to the Hong Kong community for a smooth transition of Hong Kong's monetary system and for maintaining its stability and prosperity.
