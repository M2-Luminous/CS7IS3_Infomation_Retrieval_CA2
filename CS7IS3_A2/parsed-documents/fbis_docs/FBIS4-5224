"Though the bilateral trade framework talks are likely to resume between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor next week, the development will be unclear," said the official. Hata is expected to meet Kantor in Marrakech, Morroco, next week at the signing ceremony for the global trade pact concluded in the Uruguay Round last December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "I had believed Hosokawa may announce his intention to step down around weekend but today's sudden announcement is a betrayal against expectation of most Japanese," the official who asked not to be identified.
