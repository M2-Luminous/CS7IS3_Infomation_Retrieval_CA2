During a news conference, Kim Pok-sin said the DPRK is an independent country and as such he sees no obstacle in establishing ties with other independent countries. The DPRK delegation is scheduled to meet with political party leaders and the vice president. The delegation also plans to meet with President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. Government sources questioned have stated, however, that this meeting is "uncalled for" because Paraguay and DPRK have no diplomatic ties. This is the first DPRK delegation to visit Paraguay. It is an unofficial visit. The delegation is visiting in response to an invitation extended by the Febrerista Revolutionary Party (PRF). During a news conference at the international airport, Kim Pon-sin said this visit follows his country's wish to strengthen ties with Paraguay. Asked if the ideological and territorial differences with South Korea will obstruct an eventual establishment of diplomatic ties, Kim Pok-sin said: "We are an independent country and we are aware of the patriotism of Paraguayans. We also know that Paraguay is an independent country. I do not believe there will be many problems." PRF President Victor Hugo Sanchez stated that the visit of the DPRK vice premier "may be the start of auspicious bilateral ties." Kim Pok-sin is scheduled to meet Vice President Angel Roberto Seifart tomorrow at 1000. At night the PRF board will host a reception in honor of the DPRK delegation at the party headquarters. On 12 March, the delegation will visit the Itaipu dam which, Kim Pok-sin said is of particular interest to them because the DPRK builds hydroelectric dams. It has been reported that the delegation is scheduled to meet party presidents next week.
