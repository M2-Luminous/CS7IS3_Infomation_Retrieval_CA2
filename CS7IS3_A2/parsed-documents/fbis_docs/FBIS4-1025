IFP legal representative Maurice Basslian told the commission he had been instructed by the IFP only on Wednesday last week. Monday's proposed march by the IFP Youth Brigade, which was postponed on Sunday, had apparently made consultations difficult. Mr Justice Richard Goldstone said the IFP's failure to submit was contemptuous in the light of IFP spokesman Sue Vos' request for an urgent hearing. He ordered the IFP to submit reasons by 9AM on Tuesday for their failure to make submissions.
