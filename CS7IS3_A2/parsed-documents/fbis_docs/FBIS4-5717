FBIS4-5717 "dreas071_d_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 South Korea Seoul, Moscow Agree on Fishing Prices Seoul, Moscow Agree on Fishing Prices SK1304075294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0632 GMT 13 Apr 94 SK1304075294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and Russian fishermen have fixed the price of pollack caught in Russian waters, agreeing on a rate 18.5 percent lower than the international price, the fisheries administration announced Wednesday. The agreement on this year's catch sets a rate of 420 U.S. dollars per ton for egg-bearing pollack and 247 dollars for eggless pollack. Russia had asked for a minimum 515 dollars for egg-carrying pollack to match the international price, but South Korea had the upper hand in the bargaining because it voluntarily refrained from pollack fishing over the past year in the Okhotsk Sea at Moscow's request. Russia declared a unilateral moratorium on Okhotsk fishing last year even though the area lies in international waters, citing depletion of resources. South Korea and other countries protested but later agreed to voluntarily hold off on fishing there. The two countries had already agreed on this year's quota of 77,000 tons at last November's government-level talks but left the pricing to the fishermen. Representatives previously held two price negotiations but left empty-handed after Russia demanded 520 to 550 dollars per ton.
