The sources said all the equipment in the station has been tested is now ready for the launch of the static satellite. The sources said signals and data from the satellite at 36,000 km in outer space will be received and processed at high speed in the station and then transferred to meteorological stations across the country. The station will also be able to realize remote control and exact positioning of the satellite, the sources said. Among similar stations in China, the sources said, the new station possesses the most functions and the highest technical level. Its overall technological and automation levels match the most advanced in the world. The launch of the "Fengyun No. 2" satellite and the operation of the central station will greatly improve China's mid- and long-term meteorological forecasting. The whole Asian and Pacific region will directly benefit from them, the sources said. The earth station system was developed by the Chinese Research Institute of Space Technology, and its cost is only one-third of the imported version of such a system, the sources added.
