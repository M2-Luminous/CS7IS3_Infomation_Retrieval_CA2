FBIS4-2079 "drchi066_c_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Central Eurasia Russia To Sign `Partnership for Peace' Plan on Schedule Russia To Sign `Partnership for Peace' Plan on Schedule OW0604043294 Beijing XINHUA in English 0418 GMT 6 Apr 94 OW0604043294 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Moscow, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will fly to Brussels on April 21 to sign a framework agreement on the country's participation in the NATO's "partnership for peace" program. Kozyrev's Deputy Vitaliy Churkin told a press conference today that while Russia will sign the document of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the plan is not supposed to deal with all issues relating to European security or to replace the existing security structure. Russia's participation in the program does not mean it will abandon its own concept about European security, he said. Rather its participation is intended to ensure that the NATO plan reconciles with Russia's conception of European security. Russia hopes that the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) will be transformed into an effective all-European organization for closer cooperation between Europe and the former Soviet republics, he said. Such a transformation also requires close coordination among the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). At the same time, Russia also wants to strengthen its cooperation with the North Atlantic Cooperation Council so that the institution can become an effective instrument for coordination. The "partnership for peace" plan is not a new international agreement, Churkin emphasized. Therefore it can not ask its signatories to assume new obligations. Russia and the NATO should not be legally bound to each other under the plan, he added. Russia's participation in the plan has been a hot topic among the Russian leadership. Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov announced five days ago that Russia needed consultations of six to seven months to achieve a public consensus on the issue. However, Foreign Minister Kostikov said the next day that Russia would sign the plan in April as scheduled [sentence as received]. Sergei Shakhray, a deputy of the State Duma (lower house of parliament) and minister of nationalities and regional policy, also joined the debate today. He told reporters that Russia's participation should not be decided unilaterally by the government. Instead, the government should first consult the legislature. Moreover, he added, it remains unclear whether Russia's participation will affect its relations with other CIS member states and its eastern neighbors, especially China.
