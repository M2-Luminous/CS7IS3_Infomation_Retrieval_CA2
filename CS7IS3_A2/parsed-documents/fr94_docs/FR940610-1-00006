Designated Deposit Account A necessary component of the proposed direct-debit payment system is the designation by each insured institution of a deposit account to be debited by the FDIC. Under the proposal, each institution would be required to give timely notice to the FDIC of the account designated by the institution for that purpose. In addition, each institution would be required to take any action necessary to enable the FDIC to direct-debit assessment payments from the account, and to ensure that the account has sufficient funds to cover the assessment amount on the FDIC invoice. Failure on the part of the institution to take any such action or to provide sufficient funding in the designated account would be deemed to constitute nonpayment. 5. Semiannual Notice of Assessment Risk Classification Under the proposal, the date of the notice of an institution's assessment risk classification currently described in ยง327.3(e) would be changed to coincide with the date of the first-quarterly invoice. The FDIC believes that combining the notice and the invoice would result in operational efficiencies both for the FDIC and for insured depository institutions. Comment was requested by the FDIC on a similar operational change in connection with an assessment rulemaking proceeding last year. The change on which comment was sought at that time was the consolidation of the assessment rate notice and the certified statement form in a single mailing. A consolidated mailing was supported by each of the six comment letters that addressed it. See 58 FR 34357, 34365 (June 25, 1993). 6. Payment of Interest on Overpayments and Underpayments. Under ยง327.7 of the existing assessments regulations, the FDIC pays interest to insured institutions for any timely overpayments of assessments, from the time the assessment is due until the date a refund or credit is given for the overpayment amount. Similarly, institutions are required to pay interest on underpayments from the assessment due date to the date of payment of the shortfall. Because of inefficiencies inherent in the existing paper-based system, and in the semiannual collection procedure that allows very little time for the refinement of report-of-condition data before it is used in assessment computations, it typically takes in excess of three to five months from the assessment due date to identify, verify, and pay or collect overpayment or underpayment amounts resulting from miscomputations or similar errors. The proposed rule contemplates a ``rolling'' correction process in which any necessary adjustments in the assessment amount are made on a quarterly basis. Under this proposal, the FDIC would pay or collect interest on overpayments and underpayments, respectively, on a full-quarter basis. Interest would be due for the period beginning the day after the payment date on which the institution overpaid or underpaid and ending on the payment date for the quarterly invoice reflecting the corresponding adjustment. Thus, even if an underpayment were identified early in the quarter, the FDIC would not collect the balance due until the next quarterly assessment payment date, and would impose interest for the entire quarter. The converse would apply to overpayments; that is, the amount of the overpayment, together with interest through the next assessment payment date, would be credited to the institution on the invoice for the next quarterly payment after the overpayment is discovered.
