Plan Arrangements for 1994 In 1994, State plans arrange for expected raw coal output of 1.16 billion tons, an increase of 20 million tons over 1993. This includes 480 million tons at State-owned key coal mines, a reduction of 27 million tons; 195 million tons at State-owned local coal mines, basically the same as in 1993; and 485 million tons at township and town coal mines, an increase of 13 million tons. The total output plan for 1994 is a projected plan and does not check the total output execution situation. In 1994, the total amount commodity coal resources turned over to the State for allocation was still 552.24 million tons. This includes 479.98 million tons in State orders and 72.26 million tons in resources that were changed from State orders to regional orders, concentrated in northwest China, southwest China, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and other regions, with the remaining resources going through provincial orders and enterprises doing their own selling on the market. The problem reflected in coal orders in 1994 was once again that supplies of coal exceeded demand, and in particular there were surpluses of anthracite mixed pulverized coal and some varieties of dressed coal for smelting. During the process of executing production plans in 1994, we must be concerned about the following problems: 1) The State only implements macro regulation and control and an overall balance. Many rights have been transferred down to province-level administrative departments and enterprises, and we must certainly do our jobs and assume our responsibilities. We cannot let things slide because of the emphasis on macro management and create a situation in which things have no one managing them and nothing is being managed; 2) We must certainly establish the concept of the market economy, solidly grasp the focus on economic results, arrange plans on the basis of market demand conditions and selling and transportation conditions, and organize production and administrative activities; 3) Production plan management arrangements and management measures have changed, but mining bureaus and province-level administrative departments must have an idea of what their mine production situations are, how their economic results are, and which mines should increase their output and which should restrict their output or cease production, and they should adopt active measures for additional guidance. Although production plans have not been checked, enterprise production plans and province (autonomous region) production plans should all be reported to higher authorities on schedule and according to stipulations to enable us to gain information and carry out industry management and macro regulation and control. I ask that comprehensive planning departments at all levels focus well on this item of work in accordance with this requirement. In the area of technical upgrading, plan arrangements are for 883 million yuan to be invested in technical upgrading in the coal industry during 1994, which will include 200 million yuan in central government financial allocations, 513 million yuan in bank loans, and 170 million yuan in self-raised capital for projects receiving bank loans. The implementation of our technical upgrading plans for 1994 requires that we conscientiously focus on work in the following items: 1) Focus on providing the capital. Investments in technical upgrading during 1994 overall involve two forms. One is composed of State allocations and self-raised capital. The other is composed of bank loans and self-raised capital. To provide these funds, we must do a great deal of coordination and linking work everywhere. Planning departments at all levels must conscientiously do this work well and report the situation in funding implementation and plan execution to the Ministry of Coal Industry; 2) We must focus on work to implement technical upgrading projects, ensure project quality and progress, and make technical upgrading projects produce investment benefits as quickly as possible. In the area of capital construction, the scale of investments arranged for coal in 1994 by the central government is 15.29 billion yuan, an increase of 20 million yuan over plans at the beginning of 1993. This includes 4,247,300,000 yuan in domestic budget investments, 8,654,700,000 yuan in construction bank loans, 400 million yuan in special funds, 1.381 billion yuan in foreign investments, 237 million yuan in investments to shift from oil to coal, 270 million yuan in self-raising indicators, and 100 million yuan in small-scale capital construction investments in local coal mines. The main problems in arrangements for investments in capital construction in the coal industry are: 1) Limited investments, an increase of just 20 million yuan compared to 1993; 2) The 15.29 billion yuan in investments still arranges for a 400 million yuan development fund, but after coal prices are deregulated there will be no way that this money can be obtained by users outside the calculated prices. We have proposed to the State that it be changed into other categories of investments; 3) There is 3.16 billion yuan in capital construction bonds that will reach maturity and should be repaid in 1994. We have arranged to repay 210 million yuan in capital construction investments during the year, but the remaining 2.95 billion yuan (bonds and construction loan interest and principal) has not been dealt with. Preliminary arrangements have been made for a scale of capital construction of mines in the coal industry at 89 locations with 137.14 million tons, including 18 mines that will be placed into production with 31.99 million tons, 64 mines where construction will continue with 93.6 million tons, seven mines where construction will start with 11.55 million tons, and 18 mines where preparations for construction will be made with 68 million tons. There are five mines with poor results that will cease construction, with 3.09 million tons. After consultations with the State Council and investment companies, the principles for arranging for investments in the coal industry in 1994 are: make key arrangements for those projects that will have good administrative results after going into production, can repay loans, and have good external transportation conditions; make normal arrangements for those projects which will have relatively good results after going into production but which will be unable to repay the loans and which have external transportation conditions; straighten out those projects which would have poor administrative results after going into production, experience losses, be unable to repay loans, and have poor external transportation conditions, and cease building those where construction should be stopped. In addition, readjust the investment structure, increase investments as appropriate in railroads, power plants, cement plants, and other projects with benefits. In 1994, a total investment of 1.996 billion yuan has been arranged for cement plants, power plants, and railroads, an increase of 555 million yuan over 1993. The ratio between mines and matching facilities in yearly capital construction investments in the past was consistently 67:33, but it will reach 58:42 in 1994. There is a significant increase in investments in benefits projects. Rather substantial changes will occur in coal investment channels in 1994. In particular, construction bank loans will account for more than half the total investments, which is an increase of 1.9 billion yuan over 1993. All units should, in accordance with previously arranged construction projects, focus closely on linking together with management of construction banks and conduct evaluation work for new construction loan projects as quickly as possible to ensure that the loans are used according to schedule. 1994 is the year of the State's greatest reform efforts and a key year for completing the Eighth 5-Year Plan. The coal capital construction tasks are extremely heavy. The scale of mines (and strip mines) which we plan to place into production in 1994 is the greatest in one year during the past several years, and we should start focusing on this item of work from the beginning of the year and provide preferential guarantees for provision of the construction capital, the supplies of equipment and materials, and the construction staff arrangements required for these projects. All areas must work together to cooperate and ensure that tasks to place projects into operation during 1994 are completed. For those key mines where construction will continue, coal washing plants, and other matching productive projects, we must focus on those key projects which concern construction schedules and provide overall benefits and make preferential arrangements. For regular projects where construction will be continuing, we must follow the previously arranged investment indices and take into consideration price increase factors, arrange for unit projects according to how much we have to invest, and not leave investment shortages.
