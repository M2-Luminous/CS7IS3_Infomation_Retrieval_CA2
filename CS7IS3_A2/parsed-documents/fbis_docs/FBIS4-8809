A group of 520 Belgian soldiers is deployed in Baranja, which has been under Serb occupation for two years. In early April, Croatia agreed on a cease-fire with the rebel Serbs and, under the agreement, the Serbs placed their heavy weapons under UN control in six warehouses. The fact that a certain number of weapons have been stolen should be condemned, because this will have a negative impact on the peace process which has taken off well, Colonel (Van Weg) said.
