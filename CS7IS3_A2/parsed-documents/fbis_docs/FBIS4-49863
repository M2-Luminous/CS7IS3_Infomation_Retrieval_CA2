A number of young people wearing red vests concentrated their attention on the continuous flow of market quotations and transactions which flashed across the 5x2.5 meter electronic screen. While the exchange had only been open for 15 minutes, the transaction volume totalled 1,200 tons of electrolytic copper, with each transaction falling between 100 to 200 tons. According to SME President Zheng Yuanheng, SME's total transaction volume in 1993 exceeded the planned figure of 20 billion yuan by a substantial margin, reaching 38 billion yuan, a 6.5-fold increase over the previous year. "The exchange was jointly established by 38 enterprises on June 1, 1991, and began formal operations on January 18, 1992," Zheng said. "The business volume for 1992 reached 6.3 billion yuan, far exceeding the planned figure of 1 billion yuan." Standardization China initiated research and investigation of futures markets in the mid-80s. Peng Haike, director of the General Manager's Office of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Shenzhen Associated Corp., said his company began investigating international futures trading in 1985, and succeeded in carrying out hedging transactions on the London Metals Exchange in 1987. People were later sent to the London Metals Exchange to pursue indepth research and investigations. They gained an in-depth understanding of the requirements for establishing a futures market to boost the rapid development of China's market economy. At that particular time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy, and futures trading was something completely new for both enterprise leaders and officials. Situ Huai, president of the China Nonferrous Industry Shenzhen Associated Corp., who concurrently serves as a professor at the South-Central China Engineering University, wrote a book entitled An Introduction to Futures Business. His intent was to provide information and promote futures trading. According to Situ, "The first step is to help people in the economic sector understand futures trading and to train professionals. As a result, from the very beginning China's futures trading will operate under a standardized system." The Shenzhen Metals Exchange opened for business on January 18, 1992, following a long preparatory period. Prior to the opening, the Shenzhen municipal government issued its Provisional Regulations on Administration of the Shenzhen Metals Exchange and Regulations on Transactions in the Shenzhen Metals Exchange. Executives from major futures exchanges in countries and regions such as the United States, Britain, Japan, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong attended the opening ceremony. Filled with zest, they visited the transaction hall which had been operating on a trial basis, and expressed their appreciation for the standardized operations, while at the same time offering high praise for the establishment of the exchange. Futures trading, which represents the top end of the market, features major risk and heavy speculation. Therefore, activities must be governed by laws and regulations. The Shenzhen Metals Exchange, the first of its kind in China, must be operate with high standards and proceed on a steady course. It must be strictly managed in accordance with international practices. According to Zheng Yuanheng, this has been the guiding ideology from the very beginning. The SME practices a membership system. Members must be enterprises with relatively strong economic strength and which employ professionals. The enterprises, which seek membership on a voluntary basis, are examined by the board of directors and approved by competent authorities of the local government. Only members are qualified to appoint personnel as brokers, and all brokers are required to pass an examination prior to receiving working credentials. The number of members has risen from the initial 38 to the present 110. Most large-scale nonferrous metals enterprises in China are members, in addition to various commercial and marketing enterprises, processing enterprises, and financial and investment institutions. The exchange operates five days a week, and on any given day, brokers in red vests busily complete vouchers containing the selling and purchasing prices of commodities, which are then displayed on the screen. At present, eight metals--copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, tin, nickel, magnesium and antimony have been approved for listing for either one-month spot or one-year futures trading. The exchange's accounting center is responsible for all settlements. The Anhui Tongling Nonferrous Metals Corp. appointed Ma Ji, 26, a graduate of the Economics Department of Anhui University, as one of the first brokers on the Shenzhen Metals Exchange. Ma said that in the beginning business was far from brisk, but has increased steadily as people have gained a better understanding of the new business form. He noted that large production enterprises mainly engage in hedging transactions in order to lock-in costs to protect them from volatile market prices, and show little interest in profit-making. For example, the price for electrolytic copper on the international market was recently lower than the domestic price, with a substantial price difference of 1,000 yuan per ton. As a result, his corporation imported copper from foreign countries while selling reserves on the domestic market. Shortly thereafter, the domestic price fell, as did the price on the international market. Ma's company was nonetheless able to earn a profit. Today, the corporation allows Ma to personally make decisions to conduct transactions involving less than 1,000 tons. In addition to his work for the corporation, Ma also serves as a broker for various other enterprises. At present, each broker working on the exchange handles accounts at least five enterprises [as published]. Liang Xiaohua, a female broker working for an aluminum alloy processing plant in Sanshui City, Guangdong Province, said that futures transactions may be hedging, but nonetheless ensure a steady supply of goods. Strict rules and regulations instituted by the exchange ensure that payments will be made in a timely manner, and Liang said her company dare not undertake major futures trade due to limited operating funds and loans. Liang, who also works as broker for more than 10 other companies, finds her job quite interesting since she is able to learn a great deal from the exchange, while at the same time enhancing her judgment and developing a sense of competition. In the very beginning, Liang said, she was much too nervous to work well, and other brokers nearby often helped her correct mistakes. However, only two short years practice has transformed her into a skilled broker. At present, females account for only 10 percent of the total number of brokers. According to Zheng Yuanheng, the key to futures trading is designing standardized contracts for commodities, since contracts ensure that products must be traded in accordance with circulation standards and help to prevent switch selling. In addition, contracts not only help to increase business volume but also guarantee day of delivery. In 1992, the SME joined wit production, use and quality inspection departments to adopt a special-class standardized aluminum contract in line with current international standards. The contract, China's first ever for a commodity, was revised and used in trial operations prior to its formal adoption on April 26, 1993. Shortly thereafter, similar contracts were adopted for copper, zinc, tin and nickel. Zheng said aluminum and copper contracts have distinctly strengthened the circulation of commodities and attracted a large number of firms engaged in hedging and profit-making. As a result there has been a significant increase in business volume, up five fold per month over the previous period. At present, all transactions consummated on the exchange have been subject to standardized contracts and the rate of evening up has increased by a large margin to near 90 percent. The strict administrative system has ensured that the contract fulfillment rate has remained at 100 percent since the founding of the SME. The SME has invested several million yuan to install state-of-the-art telecommunications and computer systems. In addition, the exchange has installed 225 program-control telephones, and a new long-distance business transmission system links it with some 10 other exchanges. The number will soon be expanded to include another 20-odd exchanges both at home and abroad. The exchange is now linked with the Reuters Information Network which transmits market information worldwide. In addition, the network provides the exchange with rapid access to international market quotations published by Reuters. At the same time, negotiations are underway with United Press International and the Satellite Communications Corp. Market quotations from the SME are regularly published in more than 10 domestic newspapers and periodicals. And some local newspapers and magazines publish a weekly market outlook, and broadcasting and television stations carry daily quotations. Development With Chinese Conditions SME's effort to develop a futures market has included paying close attention to the unique characteristics in China. For instance, in consideration of the country's true conditions and resources, SME introduced antimony and magnesium to the futures market thereby setting a worldwide precedent. The exchange's settlement system requires the payment of earnest money representing only 3 percent of the total transaction volume. The intentionally low figure, which is in fact far below the international practice of some 10 percent, is designed to encourage enterprises lacking abundant excess funds to actively participate in the market and conduct large-scale business with small-scale funds. Following the lead of the SME, the Shanghai Metals Exchange went into operation in May that same year, and within a very short period its transaction far surpassed that of the SME. By exerting price guidance on production, consumption and circulation and using forward pricing, the exchanges have played an important role in regulating market supply and demand, and stabilizing market prices. The consumption surge resulting from the dramatic expansion of basic construction between 1988 and 1989 pushed the prices of aluminum, copper and nickel up by from 2.5 to 3-fold in a very short period of time. During 1992 and 1993, domestic basic construction was once again expanded and the prices for rolled steel and various other raw materials not yet listed on futures market increased by a wide margin, while prices for aluminum and copper maintained relative stability due to the regulatory function of the futures market. Zheng said that when materials are in short supply on the domestic market and prices rise, the majority of members of the exchange purchase on the international market and sell on the exchange, thereby bringing about a balance in supply and demand and stable prices. In accordance with open and just principles, all business transactions are carried out publicly, rapidly and in simple procedures. This particular form of business has gained great has popularity amongst the majority of enterprises, especially large enterprises. Ma Ji said most of his company's business are transacted on the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges, adding that the company has opened two futures trading companies in Shenzhen and Shanghai in order to act as large-scale trade agents. The success of the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges has ignited a fervor for the establishment of additional futures markets. By the end of 1993, the number of various types of futures exchanges rose to more than 40, 11 of which were nonferrous metals exchanges. In the interim period some have been forced close because of low standards. Speaking of future development, Zheng said the SME is still in the midst of a period of growth and self-perfection. Last December, based on the SME, the Futures Integrated Exchange was established to expand the scale of the industry to include banking futures and option trading.
