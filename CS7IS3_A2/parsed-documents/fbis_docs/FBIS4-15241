This is the opinion of the official presidential representative in the Federal Assembly, the prominent lawyer Aleksandr Yakovlev. On Wednesday he told Interfax that under the constitution the Council of the Federation appoints and dismisses the Prosecutor General but only candidates proposed by the president. Therefore, in Yakovlev's opinion, "common sense prompts that the council itself does not have the right to appoint anyone acting Prosecutor General, this remains the prerogative of the president." Yakovlev recalled that Kazannik resigned of his own free will, not as a result of "any unlawful moves by the leadership, in this case the president." "Therefore in any case the duties of the Prosecutor General will be performed by the person appointed by the president," Yakovlev said.
