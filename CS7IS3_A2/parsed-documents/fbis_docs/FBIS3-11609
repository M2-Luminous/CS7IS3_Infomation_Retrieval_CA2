Although the Governments of the United States and Colombia have not made official the suspension of aid or the exchange of judicial evidence, the prosecutor general noted that if the warning is carried out his office will continue to try the narcotraffickers with the evidence that it gathers. [Begin recording] [De Greiff] Nobody benefits. Nobody benefits from a lack of evidence exchange or a lack of cooperation. [Unidentified reporter] Who stands to lose the most or what happens? [De Greiff] I believe that the United States stands to lose the most. [Reporter] Mr. Prosecutor, who do you think is -- let us speak honestly -- trying to trip you up? [De Greiff] Ask the government. [Reporter] Do you think it is necessary to reform the law on criminal proceedings again? [De Greiff] I think that no foreign country has the right to indicate to another one how to dictate its laws. That is the mission of the legislators. [end recording] [Earlier in this same "24 Hours Newscast" Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 23 March also carries a three-minute report on press agency reports that the United States may suspend judicial cooperation with Colombia and U.S. State Department sources claiming there is very little behind these rumors. Colombian Embassy sources said that future cooperation is being assessed and "whether material would be given to the office of Prosecutor General de Greiff in the future." In a recording, when asked about this issue Colombian Foreign Minister Neomi Sanin said: "Colombia has a sovereign and independent policy. It has its own foreign policy that is respected by all countries of the hemisphere."]
