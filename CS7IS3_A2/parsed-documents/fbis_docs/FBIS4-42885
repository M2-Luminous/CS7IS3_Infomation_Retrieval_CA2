He was reacting to a recent claim by the Russian Foreign Ministry that the IMO had not approved the proposals of Turkey on the straits and that Turkey was asked to adapt its regulations to the IMO resolutions. Ataman said that it was not possible to share the Russian interpretation that the Turkish regulations were rejected by the IMO. `The IMO Sea Safety Committee has reviewed and adopted all rules and recommendations for the passage of ships and traffic rules,' Ataman said. Ataman recalled that the straits regulations were issued in the Official Gazette dated January 11, 1994 and the traffic charts were approved by the IMO. `Turkey believes that the regulations to be put into force on July 1 and which are in harmony with the IMO regulations, contain all arrangements to provide security and environmental protection and are in the interests of all the countries and the world maritime,' he concluded. [sentence as received] The straits regulations were prompted by the March 14 collision in the Bosporus of an oil tanker and a freighter which killed 20 crew members and dumped thousands of barrels of oil into the waterway.
