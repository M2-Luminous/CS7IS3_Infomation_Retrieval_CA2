Women of Russia speak in their program merely about a strengthening of the "international authority of Russia and the development of equal mutually profitable cooperation with the CIS countries and other foreign states in the interests of stability, peace, and security." The PRES has a more extensive program, but it also is very general and abstract. While advocating a union of the peoples of the former USSR and East Europe which gravitate toward one another and the development within the framework of the CIS of "confederative relations," the PRES at the same time believes that Russia's foreign policy should be that of a "great world power" and that the country should rely on its own efforts and proceed from its own national interests. It is hard to raise any objection to such assertions. But are the goals that have been formulated realistic and attainable in the foreseeable future? Hardly. According to the DPR's program, "foreign policy should support the realization of our economic interests," and "Russia's political influence should be directed toward a strengthening of the positions of our enterprises on overseas markets, increased exports, the lifting of discriminatory barriers, and a strengthening of trade and economic relations." Like all the other parties and blocs, the DPR did not overlook the problem of the CIS. Travkin's party puts the building of integration relations within the framework of the Commonwealth in the first circle of its interests. And this is as far as it all goes. Which, objectively, is little enough for so notable a party in Russian political life as the DPR. Little enough, but still more than with the Agrarian Party, in whose program a foreign policy section is lacking altogether. When interpreting the foreign policy sections of the above blocs, several questions involuntarily arise. What position will they hold in parliament, for example, during the discussion and, particularly, during the adoption of decisions on foreign policy matters? Or will they not be chess figures that are manipulated in their own interests by stronger rivals or leaders? These and similar questions are far from far-fetched, particularly if the overall alignment of forces in the future parliament is considered. And it is such that the end result could be influenced appreciably by the fluctuations of even small blocs or factions, not to mention their joint appearance on someone or other's side. In offering the electorate its program the Russia's Choice bloc clearly proceeded from the foreign policy doctrine of Russia published back in spring of this year. This coincidence is not fortuitous, of course. If only because if was from this bloc that Andrey Kozyrev, the present head of Russia's Foreign Ministry, ran for deputy. Although new points appeared in the Russia's Choice foreign policy platform--policy in respect to the "near abroad" is clearer and more detailed, for example--on the whole, the overall thrust of the doctrine remains unchanged. But however much we would like as soon as possible to become affiliated to the liberal-democratic world and to resemble it, this will not happen in the foreseeable future. Not because the path leading here is long and thorny, but mainly because the particular features of Russia and the mentality of its people (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has well-foundedly addressed this subject repeatedly) do not permit this. If we proceed from this, the overall policy of Russia's Choice, including its foreign policy course, is wrong and must for this reason inevitably go bankrupt. Judging by the events of 1993, the final months particularly, the results of the Duma elections included, resistance to this policy has been growing constantly and assuming new, increasingly serious forms. In the new parliament this resistance will be great and will intensify rapidly, including in the foreign policy sphere. A serious struggle under conditions where no force is clearly preponderant will enable some populist, in fact, dangerous extremist figures, representatives of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] in particular, to attract some deputies and a part of society that is even bigger than prior to the elections. The foreign policy doctrine of the LDPR is the direct opposite of all the others. Its main feature is aggressiveness, more, unconcealed bellicosity, which is atypical of all the other programs. This needs no proof. Although the foreign policy part of the program of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation is not as extensive or developed as with Russia's Choice, the LDPR, and YABLoko [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc], it exists, nonetheless. But the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has simply been unable to abandon the class approach or the ideological blinders. This is manifested if only in the evaluation of the most important factors that characterize today's international relations. And at the same time, however, a renunciation of the overemphasis on ideology characteristic, in particular, of the Soviet period and the at times unjustified geopolitical pretensions connected with it is considered an essential element of Russia's foreign policy. The foreign policy part of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc would seem to be the one which is most balanced and appropriate to domestic and international conditions. It is evident throughout that it was written by an experienced and competent hand. A special section of the program is devoted to relations within the framework of the CIS, which is entirely justified. Declaring that this sphere is the priority of Russian foreign policy, YABLoko goes on to note that the purpose of the bloc is the "all-around (economic, cultural, defense) integration of the former Union republics exclusively on a voluntary basis." YABLoko's program has not lost sight of any in any way important direction of foreign policy. While rightly observing that "the foreign policy of the new Russia should be as pragmatic as possible," YABLoko emphasizes attention to the fact that "Russia's geopolitical position requires Russian foreign policy's equivalent attention to Europe, the United States, Central and South Asia, and the Far East." The program formulates precisely the principles of the country's foreign policy and its goals and priority and long-term tasks. The particular efforts of Russian diplomacy, YABLoko believes, should be geared to the molding of foreign policy support for the economic transformations in the country and the promotion of Russian goods and services on foreign markets and the integration of our economy in the world economy on an equal, mutually beneficial basis. Within the framework of its overall strategy YABLoko advocates partnership with the West, but on the basis of a sober balance of the interests and possibilities of both sides. "Our interests," the program says, in part, "largely coincide. The current differences determined by the specifics of geopolitical interests and national and cultural traditions are natural and are not of an antagonistic nature. They can and should be overcome exclusively by way of political consultations, with an explanation and defense of our particular position." Russia is entering, if it has not already entered, a qualitatively new period of its development, which will undoubtedly make a strong impression on its foreign policy. In the new situation there is a very great probability that it is foreign policy that will be the object of fierce and uncompromising struggle between the parliamentary blocs or their captive. The tremendous difference in the programs of the election blocs will contribute to this to a considerable extent and will hardly disappear with time. The contrary, rather, an uncompromising struggle in parliament, for which many deputies are already attuned, will harden the adversaries even more.
