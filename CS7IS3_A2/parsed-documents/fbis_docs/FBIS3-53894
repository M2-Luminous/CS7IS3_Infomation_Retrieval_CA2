FBIS3-53894 "drnes014_c_94016" FBIS-NES-94-014 Document Type:Daily Report 21 Jan 1994 Egypt Muslim Brotherhood, Labor Party Air Differences NC1901132494 NC1901132494 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-SHA'B in Arabic in its issues of 11 and 14 January carries several articles highlighting an apparent dispute between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Labor Party in connection with a recent call by the government for a dialogue with the opposition and the opposition's response to it. In a 1,500-word article on page 5 of the 11 January edition, Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi notes that the Brotherhood welcomes the call for national dialogue and refers to the consensus among political parties and other political forces that "political reform is the true introduction to any earnest reformation of our dear country's affairs." He expresses astonishment at published statements saying that the dialogue will be restricted to five political parties the representatives of which will talk with the National Democratic Party's [NDP] representatives and that some political forces, notably the Muslim Brotherhood, have been excluded, at least from the initial stages of the dialogue. He asks: "Who permitted these parties to speak for the nation and the people or even to speak for other political parties and forces, some of which, notably the Muslim Brotherhood, have a real presence in several associations and institutions, a presence that rivals--even exceeds--the political weight and influence of these parties? I am afraid the gambit has succeeded and the government's party [NDP] has lured other parties into doing exactly the same thing they used to criticize the government and its party for doing. Each of these parties used to proclaim, for all the world to hear, that those who can speak on behalf of the people or make decisions pertaining to any public affair must be freely elected by the people in an integrated democratic process. How can these parties now participate in choosing the delegates to a conference that will discuss political, economic, and intellectual problems, et cetera? Is it enough to bestow legitimacy on them that the delegates are chosen by six political parties?" Al-Hudaybi continues: "We say frankly that each of these six political parties represents only itself." He cites the Wafd Party's newspaper [AL-WAFD] as reporting on 8 January 1994 that the 12 licensed political parties represent only 15 percent of the groups that speak for the nation. In a special 300-word message to Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn published inside a box below the AL-SHA'B article, al- Hudaybi blames him for ignoring the Muslim Brotherhood in a recent article in which Husayn spoke of the need for political reform to enable the legal political parties to participate in elections. Al-Hudaybi says: "I found that you limited the issue of political reform to expediting the exercise of political rights (elections). You repeatedly said that the elections should be held with the participation of what you called the legal parties. You did not say one word about the need to recognize other political forces, notably the Muslim Brotherhood. Your party carried it to the People's Assembly and it carried your party to the People's Assembly in the 1987 election. The same happened during the local elections of 1992. The Brotherhood established an Islamic alliance with your party, contesting the elections under the slogan 'Islam is the Solution.' This was originally a Muslim Brotherhood slogan." Al-Hudaybi adds: "You also referred in your article to the State Security detectives' pursuit of the members of what you described as the legitimate parties. You did not say one word about their pursuit of and injustice to other political forces, as if you believe that these forces--not having obtained what you refer to as legitimacy--have no immunity and that their pursuit and confiscation of their means of livelihood no longer concern you, and that this is why you neglected to refer to them in any of the 10 principles mentioned in your article." 'Adil Husayn responds in a 700-word message published inside a box on page 5 of the 14 January edition of AL-SHA'B addressed to: "My brother Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi." He says he can find no explanation for al-Hudaybi's remark that the political parties represent only themselves and reminds him that in their statement responding to the government's call for dialogue, the political parties agreed that the leaders and accredited representatives of the political parties and forces would take part in the dialogue. He advises him to resist the attempt to exclude the Muslim Brotherhood but not to reject the very idea of dialogue among the political parties and forces and the ruling party. He declares: "Honorable brother, my opinion is known. It is that the Muslim Brotherhood must participate in any earnest political dialogue as an independent body, not via another party." He adds: "It is strange that you should infer from my discussion of the legal guarantees we are demanding for the political parties that I am permitting the persecution of the Muslim Brotherhood. My dear sir, we are seeking to expand democracy so that the political forces that have not been recognized can be recognized, since they do have an undeniable presence." Husayn expresses dissatisfaction with the "tone" of al-Hudaybi's article from "beginning to end." He continues: "I did not feel comfortable with what you said about the Islamic alliance, particularly that the slogan 'Islam is the solution' is the Muslim Brotherhood's exclusive slogan. Actually it is the slogan of Muslims everywhere and in every age." Husayn ends his response with a reference to the Labor Party's long-established Islamic credentials and addresses al-Hudaybi: "Concluding, my brother Counselor: The enemies of Islam are lying in wait for its advocates and concocting plots and sedition. We must be wary and vigilant. I still believe that what joins us together is the declaration: There is no God but God and Muhammad is his messenger. This is much more important than any differences between us. Brother counselor, I pray that God will clear the differences between you and me according to righteousness. May this chapter be closed."
