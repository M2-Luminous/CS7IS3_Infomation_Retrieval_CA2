[Fujimori] It really started during the presidential inauguration in Asuncion. At the time, President Wasmosy and I became friends. This visit greatly strengthens our bilateral ties. I believe some steps will be taken to strengthen them even more. [NOTICIAS] Do you believe [Latin American liberator Simon] Bolivar's dream of achieving a politically and economically united Latin America will ever be accomplished? [Fujimori] I believe that each one of these markets, Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the Andean Pact, will have to consolidate themselves by establishing free markets that will lead to integration. It is very likely that some countries will become doorways between Mercosur and the Andean Group. Peru, and I believe all Latin American countries, are very willing to be part of a large bloc. [NOTICIAS] What is your definition of Peruvian economic policy, because any integration is based on the macroeconomic factor? [Fujimori] I believe that one of the issues that may delay this economic integration is the establishment of common customs tariffs. There is a wide variety of ideas on this issue. Peru's case in the Andean Pact is an example of this, at least temporarily. Peru has an open economic policy, with common customs tariffs ranging between 15 and 25 percent on products, while other countries have a differentiated customs tax. This is the main problem impeding an agreement. [NOTICIAS] What is Peru's domestic situation? Is terrorism still a shadow? [Fujimori] I hope you have the opportunity to witness for yourselves here in Lima, and throughout Peru, that people can walk freely and safely. Terrorism is not a problem for us anymore. In less than two years, we have been able to defeat two of the more violent groups in the world, not only in Latin America. By adopting specific and practical measures at all levels, and through an overall strategy, Peru is now able to overcome underdevelopment, precisely because terrorism was one of the factors that undermined this objective. Right now we have launched a great battle: the fight against poverty. This is done, of course, without overlooking other areas such as the fight against drug trafficking. We are concentrating on this to strengthen domestic security. [NOTICIAS] Do the Chiapas and Santiago del Estero cases worry you? [Fujimori] Similar cases may occur in other places. We have suffered a terrible nightmare for the past 13 years. Fortunately, we are almost through with it and we have gained great experience. We are aware that pacification is achieved only through development. We are working on this, and this is why we have declared war on poverty. [NOTICIAS] Mr. President, do you believe that the Fujimori approach in Peru as a Peruvian political experience can be applied in other Latin American countries? [Fujimori] I do not believe that models applied in one country can be repeated elsewhere. But I do believe that people are questioning themselves, not only in Latin America but in other regions of the world as well, because the so-called democracies are not working. Peru's particular case, and probably that of some Latin American countries, is that the objectives and aspirations outlined by the government and the people are not fulfilled. This is the cause of frustrations resulting from a system that is mistakenly called democracy. At the world level, there will be a need for reform that the peoples will bring about to improve the democratic system. [NOTICIAS] Do you believe the Latin American political class is declining? [Fujimori] It is being questioned and this is taking place in several places. If there is no rapid reaction, it is going to be challenged. [NOTICIAS] Are you thinking about seeking reelection? And if that is the case, what will be your political support? Will you be supported by any particular sector? [Fujimori] I reassert that I have not made up my mind yet. My entire government policy is based on the people, on the people's needs. My party, Change 90 or New Majority, is the one that groups competent people. We do not have a party structure. [NOTICIAS] How would you define democracy from your point of view? [Fujimori] I believe one must defend democracy, but not a pseudo-democracy, which strives to hide improper situations. Democracy must be increasingly more open. It is within this framework that democracy and the people will win. [NOTICIAS] Finally, what was [Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman to you? [Fujimori] A criminal...a criminal.
