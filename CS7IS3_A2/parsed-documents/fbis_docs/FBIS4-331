They also drew up proposals for a national code of conduct for the security forces during the elections. Several important players in the region were absent from the all-day meeting in East London, among them the Transkei government and its security forces, the Democratic Party [DP], the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] and its armed wing the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army. Independent Electoral Commission Eastern Cape Mediation Director Stax Masango said he had sent invitations directly to Transkei ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa and the PAC, while DP leader Dr Zach de Beer had played an important behind-the-scenes role in encouraging people to attend the meeting. "We are not sure why they are not here," he said. "We haven't received any apologies from them." He said the absentees would be invited to a follow-up meeting in East London on Tuesday next week. Representatives of the African Christian Democratic Party, African Democratic Movement, African National Congress, National Party, Ciskei's interim administration and defence force, SA's Police and Defence Forces and business and farmers' organisations, agreed on a ten-point code of conduct for parties. Among the points were a commitment to free and fair political activity in the region, a promise not to disturb other parties' meetings, and an undertaking to lodge complaints about breaches of the code with the Independent Electoral Commission. "The reason why the parties have accepted this code of conduct is that it is a reaffirmation of the principles of the Electoral Act and its regulations," said Mr Masango. "They merely wanted to express their commitment in a forum and also in public." Contraventions of the code could be dealt with through the Electoral Act. But the parties had also acknowledged this was a historic meeting "and if they did not abide by this, history would judge them". Among the issues which delegates felt should be dealt with in a code for security forces were protection of basic human rights, use of armed force, protection of polling stations and the relationship between the security forces and the media. Mr Masango said the purpose of the code was to help the police and defence force to understand their functions and limits "under such difficult circumstances". The proposals would be forwarded to the Transitional Executive Council for adoption, he said. If the code was promulgated nationally, it would have to be accompanied by a massive public information campaign.
