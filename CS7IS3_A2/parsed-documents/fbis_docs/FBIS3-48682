In his speech, the President expressed his determination to tackle domestic administration reforms in a positive way. His policies include the reform of the medical insurance system, an effort to renew the United States' strength; the revision of the welfare system; and the strengthening of anticrime measures. It is hoped that efforts to reform the domestic administration will lead to the enhancement of U.S. leadership in the world. Generally speaking, it has been observed that during the first year of the Clinton administration, "there were some losses," but "there were more gains," (as stated by the WASHINGTON POST). What can be termed as achievements include: the approval of the bill on reducing financial deficit; the approval of the bill on weapons regulations; and the approval of NAFTA. President Clinton, who is now in the second year of his term, has pledged further efforts for economic reconstruction, and at the same time, has called for strengthening anticrime measures as one of the top priority tasks. Because public security has deteriorated, particularly in big cities, he wants to set stricter penalties for those who choose to commit crimes. Among the measures to be taken are the addition of 100,000 police throughout the United States and an expansion of the death penalty for violent crimes. Moreover, President Clinton also touched on such measures as the creation of jobs; professional training for the purpose of reemployment; enhancement of education; and the strengthening of the information industry. In particular, he is determined to carry out some reforms such as the health care reform that all postwar Presidents have tried to avoid. His stance on positively tackling reforms that could result in pains among the people certainly deserves appraisal. In this speech, President Clinton clearly stated that priority will now be given to domestic issues. It is probably because he has taken the by-election this fall into consideration. But now that the economy is on the right track toward recovery and the President is gaining greater backing from the general public, it is hoped that he will be able to carry out these policies as he has pledged. On the other hand, there are factors that have aroused concerns over the Clinton administration. For example, there is the slow process of making personnel appointments and a rekindling of personal scandals. Last December, President Clinton accepted Defense Secretary Aspin's resignation and then nominated Inman, former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as his successor. However, Mr. Inman has rejected the nomination and so has an influential senator who was regarded as a likely successor. And finally, Deputy Defense Secretary Perry has been nominated for the post. Moreover, President Clinton has no other choice but to agree to the appointment of a special prosecutor because of the rekindling of the political fund scandal that took place during his Arkansas governorship years. All these concerns may result in the gradual loss of confidence in the President. And people may lose confidence not merely in his capability in handling domestic affairs. Some West European nations have now come to cherish apprehensions about the United States' foreign and security policies. In this post-Cold War age with less danger of nuclear weapons, President Clinton is promoting an economy-oriented diplomacy while giving priority to safety at home over national security. Moreover, concerning settlement of regional conflicts, Clinton has stressed the functions of the United Nations and the sharing of responsibilities by major countries. During his address, President Clinton touched on issues concerning foreign and security policies but his remarks were made merely in general terms. In addition to touching on the situations on the Korean peninsula, in China, in former communist countries, in the Middle East, and in South Africa, President Clinton stressed the need for providing continuous assistance to Russia in its efforts for democratization. However, we had hoped that he would also have touched on the new role for the United States in his post-Cold War world as well as on practical measures for settling regional conflicts. As the President has stated, there still exist dangerous situations in various parts of the world at present. And for the United States, which still enjoys a strong influence in this post-Cold War world, its responsibility lies not only in tackling the reform of its own domestic administration but also in taking a strong initiative for the sake of the international community.
