You criticized them both and said they represent "a different policy." Yet, only a short while ago, Haider was a guest of honor at FDP events. [Kinkel] Haider was indeed invited to several events by subdivisions of the FDP. I did not feel comfortable with that, but we are a liberal, tolerant party. Mr. Haider supports policies that are incompatible with our ideas of liberalism. [DER STANDARD] Does this mean that Haider will not be invited to any FDP events in the future? [Kinkel] I think it would be very unwise for FDP subdivisions to invite Haider, who is actively campaigning for the anti-Europe Brunner. But there is no imperative mandate in our party. [DER STANDARD] Mr. Kinkel, why did you, in your capacity as foreign minister, support Austria so strongly during the European Union [EU] membership negotiations? [Kinkel] Because I am convinced that Austria and the other EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries need to be in the EU. They will be an asset in economic, political, and cultural terms. This goes especially for Austria. It would be rather strange, if the German Foreign Minister did not speak up for Austria in particular. [DER STANDARD] The referendum on EU membership is pratically upon us. Do you expect a positive outcome? [Kinkel] I do not want to interfere in Austria's internal affairs. But I cannot imagine the Austrians taking a negative decision in the referendum.
