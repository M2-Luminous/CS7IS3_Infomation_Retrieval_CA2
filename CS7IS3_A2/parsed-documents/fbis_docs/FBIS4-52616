Hata told reporters Japan favors the present formula of "G-7 plus one" postsummit dialogue with Russia. His comment was in response to reports from Moscow that President Boris Yeltsin wants to make Russia an eighth member of the group, which consists of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Hata said Russia is still a recipient of economic and financial aid but its political influence is undeniably strong as in the case of the military conflict in the former Yugoslavia. A high-ranking Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that many members of the G-7 countries, at a recent meeting of G-7 government representatives, were against Russia's participation in the dialogue as a regular member. A senior Finance Ministry official also said, "It is difficult for both donors and a recipient nation like Russia to sit at the same table."
