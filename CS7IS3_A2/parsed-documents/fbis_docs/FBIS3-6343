You have brought with you the Thai people's friendship for the Vietnamese people. For myself, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to return the hospitality that Your Excellency Prime Minister Chuan Likphai has accorded to the Vietnamese leaders during their visits to Thailand, which have achieved much in terms of economic development. I am very pleased to note that since October 1991, when I had the opportunity to pay an official visit to Thailand, the relations between our two countries have reached a new level of development. Comrade Do Muoi, our party general secretary, paid a visit to Thailand and the Vietnamese people had the opportunity to welcome the Thai Prince and Princess. Those visits were of great significance because they have contributed to consolidating and strengthening our bilateral relations. We have exchanged honest views on issues of common concern in an effort to strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries. Bilateral economic, trade, scientific, technical, and tourist cooperation has been expanded. The signing of agreements on bilateral tourist cooperation and cooperation between the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Thai Industries during your current visit to Vietnam is a new indication of that positive trend of development. Vietnam and Thailand are two neighboring countries with many cultural similarities and long-lasting relations throughout the course of history. The harmonious relations between our two peoples are a very important factor for the prosperity of each country and also a great contribution to stability and cooperation in Southeast Asia. Being fully aware of this, our government and people have done all we can to contribute to consolidating and promoting good friendship and neighborliness. We are persisting in a comprehensive national renovation policy while at the same implementing a foreign policy of openness for the sake of peace, cooperation, and development. That policy is in conformity with the great trends of development in the region and other parts of the world. Consequently, it is gaining the full support of our entire people and of broad sections of world public opinion, and is bringing about important results. Against such a backdrop is our resolve to join efforts with countries in the region in turning Southeast Asia into a region of peace, independence, cooperation, and development. Prompted by that resolve, Vietnam will make a constructive contribution to the upcoming Regional Security Forum in Bangkok. Your Excellency the Prime Minister and distinguished guests, I would like to invite you to toast the health of the King and Royal Family, the president of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and His Excellency the Prime Minister and other distinguished Thai guests. May the friendship and comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and Thailand continue to be consolidated and developed with each passing day. Let us toast the health of all those who are present here.
