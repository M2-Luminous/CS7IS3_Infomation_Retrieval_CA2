The DPRK Central Broadcasting Station quoted a spokesman for the atomic energy authority as saying that his country fully complied with the February 15 accord during the two-week inspection of seven of DPRK's nine nuclear sites which began March 1. The results of the inspection were also adequate to verify that the DPRK is not developing nuclear weapons, the official added. However, the IAEA Secretariat claimed that the inspection was conducted only in line with the nuclear security agreement and did not guarantee the continuity of nuclear security. The DPRK spokesman disagreed, and said that the IAEA has now made more unreasonable demands. Since the DPRK has shown great flexibility by meeting all IAEA demands, the secretariat's reluctance to air the results, and threats to call a council meeting, only show that it openly violated the February 25 U.S.-DPRK agreement on nuclear inspections and has become increasingly unfair. The spokesman said that unless the IAEA Secretariat revokes its unjust decision, it must be fully responsible for whatever action the DPRK may take.
