The exchange was bought from the Motorola company of the U.S. The number of mobile telephone users has increased rapidly in China in the past few years, and Shanghai's original mobile telephone system had reached its full capacity before the exchange was introduced. Sources at Motorola's Beijing office said the equipment of the EMX 2500 digital telephone exchange system belongs to the latest generation of the company's cellular products. Pertti Johanson, vice-president and general manager of Motorola's international cellular infrastructure division, said that, so far, more than 120 Chinese cities have introduced cellular systems from Motorola. The software of the EMX 2500 in operation in Shanghai has been modified to better meet the requirements of China's telecommunications networks, he added. The introduction of the large-capacity telephone exchange in Shanghai will not only enhance call-processing speed, but also lay a solid foundation for the network and capacity to expand.
