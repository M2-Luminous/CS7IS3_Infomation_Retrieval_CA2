As it has been reported, North Korea claims that it has never agreed with the United States on the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys as a precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, thereby showing a negative attitude in the inter-Korean working contact. Moreover, the nuclear inspection on North Korea by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] appears to be running into a problem. The ROK and the United States, therefore, are struggling for appropriate measures to cope with this situation. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, who came to the ROK on 10 March, his entourage, and relevant government officials are supposed to hold a series of meetings on 11 and 12 March to intensively discuss countermeasures. Assistant Secretary Gallucci, who heads the U.S. delegation to the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, came to Seoul to coordinate the ROK and U.S. positions on the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks. However, since doubts raised whether the third round of talks will be held as scheduled, the ROK-U.S. talks are expected to discuss various possible scenarios. The scenarios the ROK and the United States can consider are: first, if North Korea sincerely permits the IAEA inspections and helps realize the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys, second, if North Korea sincerely permits the IAEA inspections but does not help realize the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys before 21 March, and, third, if North Korea obstructs the IAEA inspections and refuses to realize the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys. In case of the first scenario, the most favorable one, the ROK and the U.S. position is to hold the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks on 21 March and discuss extensively the North Korean nuclear issue and the improvement of North Korean-U.S. relations. The ROK and the United States have set up a policy that they will demand that North Korea fully return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and permit special inspections. The ROK and the U.S. strategy is not to arrive at a package solution for the nuclear issue and the North Korean-U.S. relations, as North Korea demands, but to accede to the North Korean demands on a step-by-step basis depending upon the degree of its ensuring nuclear transparency. In other words, the lifting of restrictions on trips to North Korea, allowing trade with North Korea except strategic goods, guaranteeing in writing not waging preemptive strike on North Korea with nuclear arms, and opening of a liaison offices, can be made on a step-by-step basis. Assistant Secretary Gallucci, in meeting with relevant ROK Government officials, is expected to explain the U.S. plan as to what sort of "carrot" it could present for the North Korean demands, and adjust and coordinate the U.S. position with the ROK. In case North Korea sincerely permits the inspections but refuses to exchange special envoys before 21 March, the ROK and the U.S. position is to postpone the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks until the envoy exchange is made. However, noncompliance with the promise for the envoy exchange itself is not enough to take the issue on sanctions on North Korea to the UN Security Council, so the ROK and the United States will continue to persuade North Korea to help realize the envoy exchange. The worst scenario is the case in which North Korea refuses to sincerely permit the IAEA inspections and to exchange special envoys. It has been reported that North Korea raised some objections to the IAEA inspection team's activities and postponed the taking of test samples from the radioactive chemical laboratory and the five-megawatt nuclear reactor, thus taking an uncooperative attitude. The basic ROK-U.S. position is that if North Korea refuses to permit the inspections of its key nuclear facilities in the present IAEA inspection, which is scheduled to end on 14 March, North Korea will have to be subjected to sanctions by the UN Security Council. The ROK and the United States have set up a policy that they will endeavor to bring a complete resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue through the third round of the North Korean-U.S. talks. They will discuss various countermeasures, but their agony continues because they will have to overcome many obstacles in view of the North Korean attitude.
