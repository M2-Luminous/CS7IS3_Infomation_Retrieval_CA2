One result of that agency's reorganization was to make certain road machines and trucks superfluous. The National Road Administration is selling off its surplus, but there is no demand for some of its older equipment. But there is a serious lack of that kind of equipment in the Baltic states. The government therefore considers it reasonable that the National Road Administration should send its unsalable older equipment over there.
