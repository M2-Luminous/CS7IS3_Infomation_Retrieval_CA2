FR940930-0-00220 FR940930-0-00029 Final Rule This section requires a railroad to take the same initial actions as it would take in cases of activation failure. Upon receiving a credible report of a false activation, a railroad having maintenance responsibility for the warning system shall promptly initiate efforts to warn highway users and railroad employees at the subject crossing by taking certain actions. Paragraph (a) provides that prior to any train's arrival at the crossing, the railroad must notify the train crew of the report of activation failure and notify any other railroads operating over the crossing. Paragraph (b) requires that the railroad notify the law enforcement authority having jurisdiction over the crossing, and paragraph (c) requires the railroad to provide for alternative means of actively warning highway users of approaching trains. Paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) provide for the alternative means of warning highway users. Subparagraph (c)(1) as proposed in the NPRM has been divided into two parts to distinguish between the requirement that there be an appropriately equipped flagger for each direction of highway traffic while flagging by one uniformed police officer is sufficient even though there is more than one direction of highway traffic. Paragraph (c)(1)(A) provides that, if an appropriately equipped flagger is stationed at the crossing providing warning for each direction of highway traffic, trains may proceed through the crossing at normal speed. Paragraph (c)(1)(B) provides that, if at least one uniformed law enforcement officer (including a uniformed railroad police officer) provides warning to highway traffic at the crossing, trains may proceed through the crossing at normal speed. Paragraph (c)(2) provides that, if there is not an appropriately equipped flagger providing warning for each direction of highway traffic, or if there is not at least one uniformed law enforcement officer providing warning, trains with the locomotive or cab car leading, may proceed with caution through the crossing at a speed not exceeding 15 miles per hour. Normal speed may be resumed after the locomotive has passed through the crossing. In the case of a shoving move, a crewmember shall be on the ground to flag the train through the crossing. This section has been expanded from that proposed in order to eliminate any possible confusion. Although we believe it was clear that this section as proposed only applied to trains with a locomotive or cab car at the leading end, the section has been revised to be more specific. Additionally, in the event of a shoving move, the rule has been expanded to require that a crewmember be on the ground to flag the train through the crossing. This requirement is similar to requirements in both NORAC and the General Code of Operating Rules pertaining to malfunctioning warning systems. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides the railroad an option of temporarily taking the warning system out of service until repairs are completed. However, the warning system may only be taken out of service if the railroad complies with the protection requirements for activation failures. From a highway traffic control and warning system credibility perspective, it would be preferable for a railroad with few trains traversing the crossing to take a falsely activated warning system out of service. The railroad would then comply with the activation failure provisions of §234.105 rather than §234.107. Paragraph (d) provides that a locomotive's audible warning device shall be activated in accordance with railroad rules regarding the approach to a grade crossing, regardless of any State laws or ordinances to the contrary. Section 234.109␣Recordkeeping The labor/management group recommended that this section be revised to clarify that the recordkeeping provisions apply only to ``credible'' reports of warning system malfunctions. We agree and have modified the section accordingly.
