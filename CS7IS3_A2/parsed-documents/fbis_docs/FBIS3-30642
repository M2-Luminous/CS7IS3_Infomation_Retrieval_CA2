At consultations held before the signing, the sides found that political relations are making very good progress, especially after President Zhelyu Zhelev visited Warsaw last year to sign a bilateral treaty of friendship and cooperation. The Polish guest said that the Bulgarian minister of foreign affairs, Stanislav Daskalov is expected to meet in Warsaw shortly with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Olechowski. Mr. Byczewski described this as the second very important stage in bilateral relations. During the consultations the sides expressed their dissatisfaction with the progress of economic contacts, agreeing that both governments can help an expansion of trade and economic cooperation. Cultural relations were also on the agenda, as well as the premises of the Polish Cultural Centre in Sofia. Mr. Byczewski stressed that Mr. Daskalov had assured him that the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry will do everything within its powers to solve the problem. "I think this is particularly important because both the Bulgarian Cultural Centre in Warsaw and the Polish Cultural Centre in Sofia have fine relations and it would be wrong to break them," the Polish deputy foreign minister said. The building which now houses the Polish Cultural Institute in Sofia was recently restituted to its former owners. Integration into Europe's economic and Euro-Atlantic structures, joining the U.S. Partnership for Peace initiative and the situation in the Balkans were discussed at a meeting between Mr. Byczewski and Bulgarian Foreign Minister Daskalov. Mr. Byczewski said Bulgaria and Poland have no fundamental differences on these matters.
