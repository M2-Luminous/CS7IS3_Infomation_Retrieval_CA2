He told a media briefing in Pretoria the mediation should be on the scale of that of the Palestinian/Israeli option. Gen Viljoen accused the government and the African National Congress [ANC] of "stalling tactics" in negotiations and the Freedom Alliance had been put in a "pressure chamber" with four days left before the constitutional deadline. With a deadlock in the negotiations looming, the AVF was prepared to use "as little violence as possible" to achieve its goal of self- determination, Gen Viljoen said. Although the AVF was still committed to a peaceful negotiated settlement, "there is no way the Afrikaner can be forced into a new situation and new nation as you make instant coffee", the general said. He re-iterated that the AVF's own transitional authority would be implemented in public in Pretoria on January 29 to be mandated to "lead the Afrikaner to freedom". The AVF had made enquiries about the international mediations and it could be available within a week, Gen Viljoen added. He could not divulge more information due to the sensitive nature, he said.
