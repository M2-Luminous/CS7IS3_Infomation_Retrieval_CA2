President Salinas de Gortari noted that one of the most significant results of the official visit to Cuba was the confirmation of a telephone project. Salinas made the announcement during a news conference following a meeting with President Fidel Castro, within the agenda drawn up for his short stay in the Cuban capital. On Monday, Domos Internacional, a private Mexican consortium, and the Cuban Ministry of Communications signed a "general agreement" to pave the way for a $1.5 billion investment to modernize the Cuban telephone system. The final details of the plan have yet to be established. General Silvano Colas Sanchez, the Cuban minister of communications, disclosed that it calls for the creation of a partnership in which the Cuban State will own 51 percent of the company's shares and Mexican investors will control 49 percent. The investment will be made in two parts and part of the Mexican portion will be in the form of a trade-off of Cuba's debt, also known as swaps. This project could very well represent the single largest foreign investment project in Cuba. Its main goal is to modernize and expand the Caribbean island nation's current telephone network and provide all other related services. President Salinas de Gortari said that during his interview with Castro, he discussed other Mexican private sector plans for investing in the textile and glass industries. Salinas de Gortari spent six hours in Cuba and then flew on to the Colombian port city of Cartagena de Indias, where he was scheduled to sign a free trade agreement with the Group of Three [G-3]. The Mexican president will sign the agreement with Presidents Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Rafael Caldera of Venezuela, the other two nations that make up the G-3. The leaders expect the agreement to enter into effect on 1 January 1995.
