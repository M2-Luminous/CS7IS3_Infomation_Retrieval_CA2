This delay caused speculations in the media over the state of repair of the Russian Federation communications system. On this matter, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told ITAR-TASS today that "there are absolutely no technical communications problems on our part, it would be better to ask the other side about this." "All allegations that one cannot get a line to Moscow are absolutely unfounded," he emphasized. Andrey Kozyrev also said that Russian President Boris Yeltsin is in good shape and he has had a phone conversation with him. "There are no problems at all in this respect either," the minister remarked.
