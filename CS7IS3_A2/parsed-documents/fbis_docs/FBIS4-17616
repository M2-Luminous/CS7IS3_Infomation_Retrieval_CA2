In the opinion of Wang Zongzhang, vice governor of Heilongjiang Province, which borders Russia, restrictions on the entry of Chinese businessmen introduced at the end of February 1994 are the cause of this reduction in trade turnover. Whereas previously Chinese citizens could, after paying a small sum to the state, acquire official so-called general-purpose passports and cross the Russian border without hindrance, a new agreement whereby they are required to have visas has now come into effect. The former liberal system of registration afforded not just entrepreneurs but also small-time speculators and criminals the opportunity to get into Russia and stay there for an indefinite period. Now the invitations on which people come to our country from the PRC are carefully checked. The falloff in trade is the other side of the coin. Russian-Chinese trade exchange has relied to a significant extent hitherto not on major firms but on "pedlars," who bring all their goods with them. As soon as the number of such traders declined, the volume of trade dropped. A Russian expert, in private conversation with me, said that this might be not so bad. Too much of what was brought here was plain junk. In his opinion, the situation could change for the better thanks to the fact that Russia and China have agreed to certify goods according to standards accepted in Russia. These duties will be assumed on the Chinese side by the Industrial Inspection Service for Import-Export Goods. Liu Baoyi, deputy general director of the inspection service, says that the arrangements whereby Chinese foodstuffs, electronics, and machines, items on which people's health and safety directly depend, receive an expert quality certificate will be introduced before this year is out. Quality control will gradually be applied to other goods.
