Such statements are in conflict with the CSCE final act of 10 July 1992, in which Russia pledged to withdraw her troops from the Baltic states' territory as soon as possible. The statement also conflicts with interests of international security and peace. For this reason the regulation of all relations between Estonia and Russia has come to a halt. A swift and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops cannot be based on haggling. The Riigikogu proposes to both president and government to protest resolutely (?against) the Russian Government. The statement was issued today by 30 Riigikogu members and handed over to the ETA [Estonian Telegraph Agency] by Vardo Rumessen.
