The details of the active shuttle diplomacy being conducted behind the scenes in Tunis are not being divulged as yet, but our correspondent managed to obtain a comprehensive interview, which sets forth Russia's general approaches to the situation in the region at this time, with Viktor Posuvalyuk, special representative of the president of Russia in the Near East and chief of the North Africa and Near East Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, who has already been here several days. Responding to a question concerning the fundamental bases of the restoration of the peace process, the representative of the president of Russia emphasized that Russian policy proceeds from the need to preserve as the base of the negotiating process the "Gaza and Jericho first" agreement and the Declaration of Principles of Relations Between the PLO and Israel signed on 3 September 1993 in Washington. "All the direct participants in the peace negotiations, Russia included, are confronted by a single task--making it recoilless," Viktor Posuvalyuk continued. He observed here that after 13 September "many people succumbed to a certain euphoria, believing that the process had become irreversible," but after the tragic events of 25 February at the mosque in the city of Hebron, "it transpired that we had all been `resting on our laurels' too soon." "No compromise, as the phenomenon of a combination of two viewpoints, is ideal if seen merely from the standpoint of one party," V. Posuvalyuk observed. "But, by and large, the negotiations in Oslo and their `crown'--the Declaration of Principles--are of `an optimum diplomatic form.'" "Russian diplomacy not only knew of the secret meetings in Oslo but also actively assisted their successful completion. Despite the pressure being exerted from different sides, we always put the emphasis on the PLO and its present leadership as the sole credit-worthy partner of the government of Yitzhak Rabin, who came to power in Israel to slogans of peace." Posuvalyuk rejected attempts to revise the said agreements inasmuch as it would play into the hands merely of extremist forces of all shades on both sides. "We must not farm out the development of events in the region to madmen, fanatics, and provocateurs," Viktor Posuvalyuk declared. While recognizing that fundamental questions of a settlement (the fate of the Israeli settlements on the West Bank of the River Jordan and in the Gaza Strip, the future form of the official status of the occupied territories, the affiliation of East Jerusalem, and so forth) remained outside of the framework of the said agreements, the Russian diplomat emphasized that, in his opinion, the boat could not be "overloaded" at the time they were being signed. To conclude the interview Viktor Posuvalyuk observed that Russian diplomacy intended to continue to play an essential part both in the Near East and at other focal points of international tension and to step up its efforts in resolving conflict situations. "Russia occupies its ample niche in the Near East region, to which, by virtue of its distinctiveness, primarily historical and spiritual, no one else can lay claim," he emphasized. Touching on the situation in connection with Iraq, the Russian diplomat observed that "Baghdad has already gone a considerable way toward compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 687." "This could at some stage, not too far off, what is more, put on a practical footing discussion of the question of the lifting of the international sanctions, the oil embargo in particular," he noted. Posuvalyuk emphasized in this connection that Russia "has a particular interest in this, considerable, what is more," alluding to Iraq's debt to Moscow. "This does not, it is true, release Iraq from its obligation to unequivocally comply with all the other resolutions," he concluded, "particularly those connected with unambiguous recognition of the sovereignty and borders of Kuwait." The representative of the president of Russia announced that during his stay in Tunis he had "useful talks with Ambassador al-Ubaydi, special representative of the Libyan leadership, during which the present situation in the `Lockerbie case'" and also problems of bilateral Russian-Libyan relations with regard to Russia's serious economic interests in this country were discussed.
