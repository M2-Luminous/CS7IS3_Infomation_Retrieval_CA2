Demirel hosted a dinner for the foreign ministers of the countries which participated in the NATO foreign ministers meeting at the Dolmabahce Palace. In his address Demirel recalled that Turkey had hosted in 1980 a similar meeting. `I was prime minister at that time, I believe that I am in a position capable of evaluating developments that occurred in Europe in politics and security since then,' he said adding that at that time Europe was divided by hostile blocs and Germany was divided. `We've travelled great distances since then. The NATO meetings took place in a Europe where hostility between the blocs has been replaced by cooperation for security. Our continent is no more divided by the abyss of the Cold War,' he said. `Globalization is becoming the sole concept for peace, developments and prosperity,' he added. Pointing out that the Dolmabahce Palace was situated on the Bosporus, which overlooks the other continent, Demirel said, `This is an excellent place for such an occasion because it is a living symbol of the Turkish society. This is a point where continents join each other, cultures and civilizations interact and strategic interests conflict.' He added that the modern city of Istanbul in Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's Turkey is a typical symbol of all dynamics which make Turkey an inseparable part of the West. `NATO has extended its arm to countries which were our enemies in the past. Our approach has been expressed in the initiative of the Partnership for Peace accord which increases mutual trust, facilitates the filling of the confidence vacuum, creates a discussion forum and shows our search for a global peace,' he said. Demirel went to on say that the massacre in Yugoslavia was a disgrace and the reluctance of the international community to bring an end to this ethnic cleansing, was a very dangerous example. On terrorism, Demirel said no reason or pretext could justify terrorist actions. `All of us have a responsibility when one of our members becomes a target of terrorism which targets the territorial integrity of a country,' he said.
