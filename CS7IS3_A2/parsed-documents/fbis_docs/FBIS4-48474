FBIS4-48474 "drafr098_e_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Mali Unions Threaten To Strike Over Accord With Tuaregs Unions Threaten To Strike Over Accord With Tuaregs AB1905214594 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 19 May 94 AB1905214594 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] This week, the Malian Government and Tuareg rebels from the Azaouad Movement have signed an agreement in Algiers. Under the terms of the agreement, the former Tuareg rebels will be integrated into the Malian Army and civil service. But today, two different organizations who have an interest have given their reaction to the agreement, one is (Ganda Koi), an organization representing Africans who have had their own problems with Tuaregs in northern Mali. The other is the Malian Trade Union Movement, and it seems that neither of them are happy. From Bamako, Moussa Fofana telexed this report: In an appeal published in a daily newspaper today, the (Ganda Koi) movement urged Malians to fight against the Tuareg rebels. It said that the country was in danger, and said it would fight until the eradication of rapists, murderers, and looters -- who are known as rebels. The movement, however, said that it would not attack the Malian Army, peaceful civilians, and foreigners. (Ganda Koi) is a movement composed of members of the black ethnic group Songhai, who live in the north of the country in the Tuareg areas. The words (Ganda Koi) mean: masters of the land. Meanwhile today, the powerful grouping of Malian trade unions, the UNTM, issued a communique reacting to the government's decision to integrate Tuaregs into the Army and civil service. The unions say that ethnicity should not be the basis for employment in the civil service. The secretary general of the UNTM, Mr. (Issa Doukoure), told me that the trade unions could use strike action and other forms of civil disobedience in order to force the government to back down. He said that the unions would never accept the allocation of civil service positions to people who did not possess the necessary skills to carry out their jobs properly.
