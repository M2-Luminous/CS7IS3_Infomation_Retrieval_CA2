Our colleague Gulsefa Ahmedova interviewed Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Afiaddin Dzhalilov. [Begin Dzhalilov recording] I believe that these are mere rumors and are provocative in nature. With a group of parliamentarians we visited [word indistinct] (?Siazen), Khachmasskiy, Kubanskiy, and Kusarskiy Rayons in recent days. We met the local inhabitants. Of course we also met with the Lezghins living in Kusarkiy. I can state unequivocally that the Lezghin people and all the peoples living in that region are involved in Azerbaijan's life, are doing everything for the speedy resolution of the Karabakh problem, and the Azerbaijani and Lezghin peoples, who have lived and created together in that same place, are sparing nothing in this grave historic, political, military, and economic period for Azerbaijan. The conclusion at these meetings was that human rights in Azerbaijan are being protected, every suitable condition is being created for national minorities, and the national minorities in Azerbaijan, including the Russian community, share Azerbaijani people's cares and are resolved to see a speedy end to this war and the Armenian aggression, and a peaceful resolution of the Karabakh problem. In a word, I want to say that no matter if they are Lezghins, or Russians, or other ethnic minorities living in Azerbaijan, they state unequivocally in connection with our visit there that they support Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev's political activity.
