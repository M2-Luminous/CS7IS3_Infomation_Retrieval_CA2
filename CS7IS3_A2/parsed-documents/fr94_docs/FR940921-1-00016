FR940921-1-00016 FR940921-1-00007 Question 8: Should soft contained play systems be subject to the same requirements as other play structures? The Access Board is interested in receiving information on how access can be provided to these play structures. Golf (Pages 103&hyph;118) Accessible Route (Pages 108&hyph;112) Golf is played in the open air on courses that incorporate natural and constructed elements. An 18-hole golf course typically occupies more than 100 acres and slopes on fairways frequently exceed 1:20. Because the route of play is determined by where the ball lands, the golf subcommittee focused on providing players with a disability access to their ball without defining an accessible route through the green. The subcommittee based its recommendations on the premise that players with a disability will use a golf car or similar mobility aid to access their balls. The subcommittee recommended that at least one accessible teeing ground be provided on each hole. An accessible route would be required from the golf car path or parking area to the accessible teeing ground. Where continuous access onto the fairway is not possible because of natural barriers, access to the fairway would be required at maximum distances of every 75 yards from the golf car path, unless precluded by extreme terrain or environmental issues (wetlands and protected areas). The subcommittee recommended against providing access to hazards and bunkers on the grounds that doing so would substantially change the nature of the game. (Practice bunkers would be accessible.) An accessible route would be required to all putting greens from the golf car path or parking area. An accessible route would also be required from golf car paths or parking areas to toilet rooms, snack bars, weather shelters, and other amenities provided for players. The subcommittee also recommended that the playing area of the golf course be exempt from the requirement for stable, firm, and slip resistant surfaces. Question 9: Do the golf subcommittee's recommendations adequately address accessible design for golf courses? Miniature Golf (Pages 115&hyph;117) The golf subcommittee also examined miniature golf courses. The subcommittee recommended that all holes on miniature golf courses be connected by an accessible route and that the entire playing surface of these courses be accessible, except for sloped surfaces where the ball cannot come to rest. Access would be required at starting points, end points, and to points in between where the ball may rest. The subcommittee also recommended that where obstacles such as concrete blocks, gates, and caves are placed on the playing surface to enhance difficulty or competition, an accessible path be provided to either side of the obstacle, or entrance and exit points be provided on both sides of the obstacle to allow players with disabilities to bypass the obstacle. Owners and operators of miniature golf courses have expressed concern about requiring the entire course to be accessible, especially courses developed on smaller sites which are often designed to rise sharply in elevation to increase the playing surface area. Question 10: Are there conditions where a lesser degree of accessibility should be allowed for miniature golf courses? The Access Board is interested in receiving information on designs for providing access to miniature golf courses. Boating and Fishing Facilities (Pages 119&hyph;132) Gangways (Pages 126&hyph;129) The boating and fishing facilities subcommittee examined a variety of facilities ranging from primitive fishing areas in national parks to highly developed, multi-use marinas in urban settings. The marine environment is dynamic and poses design challenges different from those encountered in a static, land-based environment. Bodies of water experience changing levels due to such factors as tides, seasonal changes, reservoir draw-downs, flooding, and dam releases. The subcommittee identified three options at pages 126&hyph;129 of the committee's report for providing access to gangway structures which connect to floating, boating and fishing facilities. The subcommittee did not reach consensus on the options and encouraged public input and additional research. Question 11: Which option most adequately addresses issues affecting access to floating, boating and fishing facilities? Are there other solutions that are not reflected in the recommended options? Persons responding to this question should review pages 126&hyph;129 of the committee's report. Boat Slips (Pages 125&hyph;126) The boating and fishing facilities subcommittee also recommended scoping provisions and technical specifications for accessible boat slips. The subcommittee recommended that the number of accessible boating slips be based on the scoping provision for accessible parking spaces for motor vehicles (ADAAG 4.1.2(5)). Question 12: Should the scoping provision for accessible parking spaces for motor vehicles be applied to boat slips? Should other factors be considered such as whether the boat slips are leased on a long-term or a short-term basis? Outdoor Developed Areas (Pages 133&hyph;202) Outdoor Recreation Environments (Pages 133&hyph;190) Over the past decade, the National Park Service, USDA Forest Service, various State and local government agencies, and private entities have examined issues related to providing access to outdoor recreation environments. The outdoor developed areas subcommittee built on these earlier efforts. The committee based its work on the premise that there is a spectrum of recreation settings that occur in the outdoor environment and identified four different settings based on the degree of development and modifications to the natural environment. The settings are: the highly developed or urban; the moderately developed or natural; the minimally developed or back-country; and the undeveloped or primitive. The subcommittee attempted to develop recommendations that provide the highest degree of access practicable and feasible, commensurate with the amount of development, while at the same time preserving and protecting the fundamental nature of the various elements of the outdoor recreation environment. The subcommittee outlined three degrees of accessibility (easier, moderate, and difficult) that related to the first three settings with the degree of access decreasing as the amount of development decreases. No guidelines were recommended for undeveloped or primitive settings. The outdoor developed areas subcommittee attempted to define a process by which decisions can be made regarding the degree of access which should be provided in different outdoor recreation environments. The subcommittee proposed two approaches for determining the degree of access to be provided. The first approach is set out at pages 153&hyph;156 (outdoor recreation access routes) and pages 166&hyph;170 (recreation trails) of the committee's report and reaches decisions regarding the degree of access to be provided through analysis of the recreation setting, the condition of the natural environment, the amount of structural modification, the recreation experience, and consultation with individuals with disabilities. The second approach is set out at pages 157&hyph;159 (outdoor recreation access routes) and pages 170&hyph;171 (recreation trails) of the committee's report and begins by requiring a certain degree of accessibility and proposes a series of exceptions that allow the other degrees of accessibility for a variety of conditions including severe elevations, geologic features, historic significance, or the specific purpose of the trail. Under the second approach, an entity would also have to consult with individuals with disabilities when making an exception and document the decision. Both approaches are intended to result in the highest degree of access practicable and feasible for the setting. Question 13: Which approach is more likely to achieve an acceptable level of access? Can these approaches be applied to all outdoor recreation environments regardless of size, location, entity, or other factors? Are there other alternatives that would facilitate application of accessibility guidelines to outdoor recreation environments? Persons responding to this question should review pages 153&hyph;159 and 166&hyph;171 of the committee's report.
