Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Boris Yeltsin wrapped up the second day of their summit by issuing a joint declaration supporting Moscow's ongoing reforms and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. Delving into the finer points of bilateral relations, the declaration says Yeltsin promised to give favorable consideration to South Korea's bid for non-permanent U.N. Security Council membership while Seoul will do the same for Russia's application to join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Moscow agreed with Seoul's insistence on maintaining the present Korean armistice regime until a new peace structure can be created between the two Koreas. To implement the new partnership, the two countries plan to engage in more active political dialogue at all levels including heads of state and government figures. Kim arrived in Moscow Wednesday for a four-day visit that began with a dinner meeting on the day of his arrival and continued with a second summit round Thursday. "The presidents declared that the relationship between the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation is now turning into a `constructive and mutually complementary partnership' based on the common values of freedom, democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights and a market economy," the declaration read. Much of the declaration was given over to an emphasis on finding common principles between the two countries and expressing support for each other's stands on key issues. Kim reassured Yeltsin of Seoul's support for and cooperation with the ongoing reform process in Russia and pledged to promote human rights improvement. They found common ground in seeking a security dialogue among Northeast Asian countries and agreed to keep open a bilateral channel on formulating a regional security forum. They took note of the other side's concerns, chiefly South Korea's position on the North Korean nuclear crisis. "President Yeltsin confirmed that Russia, along with the states involved, will continue to play an active part in the efforts of the international community to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," the declaration states. Recording that Kim explained his country's bid for a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, it notes that "President Yeltsin promised to consider it favorably." Likewise, Kim "welcomed Russia's intention to participate actively and constructively in all areas of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and... Would give favorable consideration to the candidacy of the Russian Federation for APEC membership when the matter is taken up at future APEC fora." They touched briefly on clearing up the awkward past, with Kim thanking Moscow for its efforts in restoring the dignity of ethnic Koreans in Russia, handing over documents related to the downing of a Korean air passenger jet in 1983 by a Soviet fighter jet and delivery of archival documents on the Korean war. On the economic front, Kim and Yeltsin hoped to combine Russian technology with the industrial know-how of South Korea and to encourage investment in developing Russia's natural resources. Capping the declaration, the presidents state they will "intensify the political dialogue at various levels, including summit meetings of the heads of state or government, parliament leaders and ministers."
