He said that he had not read the text of the agreement submitted earlier to the State Duma. Yet he was against proposals not to introduce changes in the Constitution and not to hold elections. Speaking about the movement known as Accord for Russia, Zyuganov said that the movement's leaders meet every week coordinating a common platform and main demands for protecting the country from a civil war and for warding off territorial and social-economic disintegration. Along with the member of the Constitutional Court Valeriy Zorkin, the former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy and chairman of the Agrarian Party Mikhail Lapshin, he signed the movement's founding declaration. He said that in late-April to early-May a Accord for Russia movement congress is planned which will determine its character and "attitude to all power structures." Zyuganov said that regular contacts are being maintained with Aleksandr Rutskoy. Contacts are established with leaders of the military-industrial complex, directors of large enterprises and leaders of other political movements. Speaking about the current situation in Russia, Zyuganov said that "the Kremlin poses the main danger," currently and that "the only thing left for a hungry man to do is to steal or rebel." Answering the question about the changes in the program of the Russian Communist Party, Zyuganov talked about the rejection of revolutionary leaps and forceful methods for solving acute problems, as well as the recognition of the fact that state ownership as the main system is inadmissible, and that the multi-structured economy is a reality.
