Today, however, they are only recollections. There is no return to the past, as there is no road to Agdam, which, in fact, has also not existed for several months. We turn in the direction of the headquarters of the Agdam brigade. Regular buses taken off routes for soldiers' transportation pass on the road. Tomorrow a young replacement will join the battle. The column of the battalion medical station, which has thundered past us in the direction of the front line, smells of war. The buses remind us of the city. In the barracks of the Agdam brigade, officers sleep on the floor and soldiers have forgotten what bed linen and blankets are. After a meager supper in the soldiers' mess one does not want to think about anything else but sleep. Here, at the very front line, this is a luxury, because the lice, with which the barracks are teeming, are not asleep. In this war senseless victims (if, in general, it is appropriate to talk about any sense) are in the order of things. On the Azerbaijani side up to 90 percent of the losses are the consequence of the low level of combat training of both soldiers and officers. One colonel complained to me that from among the commanders subordinate to him no one knew how to handle even a compass. Despair is heard in the voice of the former Soviet Army officer, an Azerbaijani, who has served in Ukraine for 20 years. Things are even worse with soldiers. Adolescents, who have barely left school, receive weapons almost in trenches. If a cartridge suddenly becomes wedged in the barrel during combat, the weapon becomes a useless piece of iron, because no one has taught the soldier how to take the Kalashnikov assault rifle apart and clean it. After the command "attack" soldiers maintain the correct direction of motion for no more than about 10 meters and then disperse in different directions like blind cats. We arrived at the front line before the very beginning of the Armenian attack. The enemy tank was stopped one meter from the defense line--it almost overran the trench. A grenade hit the track and the T-72 rolled back downhill. If not for this lucky accident, both the defenders and we, journalists, would be in a bad way. Later soldiers tried to determine who fired more accurately. The most accurate grenade launcher operator can expect a reward of 2 million rubles. What even the youngest cannot be denied is the desire to win. However, desire alone is not enough. "It is easy to be killed and this is by no means always heroism," says a young lieutenant--a battalion commander. "A soldier deserves more glory if he wins and remains alive." He did not want to remember how a unit of the second battalion tried to leave the position during the attack. The commander stopped them with shots into the air. Soldiers are killed not only in combat. Quite recently 27 young combat engineers were blown up on an antitank mine during a training exercise. The commander explained to them the principle of fuse operation and forgot that in front of him there was a real, not training, mine. My friend was killed last year: during dinner the barracks was wiped off the face of the earth, because someone carelessly unloaded ammunition nearby. Some battalions have been sitting in trenches since the summer of 1993, when Armenian forces scored several crushing victories in succession. The offensive was stopped thanks to a corps of Afghan mujahidin. In the middle of January of this year Afghans also liberated Goradiz, a strategically important station on the Iranian-Azerbaijani border. Mujahidin act autonomously, coordinating only the most necessary details with the Azerbaijani command. An Afghan soldier receives up to 10,000 U.S. dollars per month. Legends are composed about mujahidin in Beylagan, where their headquarters are located. People say that one Tajik-Afghan (the majority of those fighting in Azerbaijan are Tajiks) can handle a tank: he jumps up onto the armor with a pail of dirt and blocks its vision devices. The subsequent extraction of the crew from the tank is a technical matter. Mujahidin bring prisoners from missions in packs. If they seize Russians fighting on the Armenian side, they do not hand them over to the Azerbaijani military. Afghans have iron discipline, although they scorn conventions such as uniforms, drill training, and so forth. On a road in Beylagan we picked up four mujahidin, who mastered the Azerbaijani language to such an extent that they were able to explain where to bring them and to thank us at parting. The day before our 25-year old traveling companions seized Goradiz. An Azerbaijani girl, who was a medical corpswoman, told me later that several corpses of women snipers--according to rumors, either Lithuanians or French--were found in the city ruins. All the women's throats were cut. "One of them had very beautiful hair," the girl said. After this story the driver of the microbus refused to drive us to Goradiz. After the series of defeats last year the desertion of Azerbaijani soldiers assumed a catastrophic scale. President Aliyev's edict promised amnesty to those who ran away if they returned to their units before 10 January 1994. A few days before the expiration of this date crowds of deserters and their parents gathered in front of the entrance to the Ministry of Defense in Baku, trying to find out in the personnel administration where the units were located. The number of those who repented tripled after the decree of the military tribunal, which sentenced two deserters to execution by a firing squad, was published in the Azerbaijani press. The prospects for the return of deserters do not gladden soldiers. The fighters think that, having ran away once, they will also ran away for the second and third time. "When the war ends, I am sure to meet one of them," says the bearded sergeant with a bandaged head. "I know what I will do then... If I remain alive." Soldiers in trenches do not consider deserters to be Azerbaijanis. With the exception of several elite subdivisions in the Azerbaijani National Army there are no units capable of performing serious combat missions. Assault battalions and special forces, basically, consist of professional servicemen, former members of the special-purpose militia detachment. They are too few to alter the course of the war in a short time and to forget about the most serious destruction of Azerbaijani arms, which has led to a revision of the political course and change of the republic's leadership. Moscow has never denied that the Transcaucasus is a zone of special interests of Russian foreign policy. However, until now Russian politicians have not brought themselves to acknowledge their indirect (or direct) participation in the Armenian-Azerbaijani war. Meanwhile, Russia's military aid to Armenia has never been a secret to those let in on it. In Yerevan the seventh combined-arms army of Russia's Armed Forces, which was later transformed into three mobile brigades modeled after American quick-response forces, was used either as a shield, or according to the direct purpose. Suffice it to recall the tank attack on Fizuli and the bombing of Azerbaijani settlements from the air by aircraft, which Armenia does not have. With Aliyev's coming to power Baku's situation seemingly has changed for the better. A draft of the Azerbaijani-Russian agreement on military cooperation, which, probably, will be signed in the very near future, has caught my eyes. A compromise has finally been reached on the matter of joint operation of the former Soviet--and now no man's--center of radioelectronic reconnaissance in Gabal in the north of Azerbaijan, which is the largest in Europe. In exchange for concessions Russia transferred to Azerbaijan several dozens of the latest "Shturm-S" antitank systems and, at the same time, specialists as well, who will teach Azerbaijani servicemen how to handle fine equipment. The results of backstage negotiations between Azerbaijani political leaders and the Russian military will make themselves felt in spring, when the weather makes it possible to activate combat operations around Karabakh. In all, about 100 Russian military specialists now serve under contract in the Azerbaijani Army. Most of them have arrived here at the beginning of the current year. This is the result of the secret mission, on which a group of Azerbaijani recruiting officers departed from Baku to Russia at the end of December 1993. In the military commissariats of Moscow, Ivanovo, Yaroslavl, Nizhniy Novgorod, and other Russian cities Azerbaijanis obtained access to the service records of reserve servicemen: some of them agreed to serve in the Azerbaijani Army. The republic's armed forces are experiencing an acute shortage of air defense, artillery, and other specialists. Russian military specialists do not (or hardly) take part in combat operations. Nadzhmedlin Sadykhov, chief of the General Staff of the Azerbaijani National Army, is surrounded by Russian military specialists. Colonel Aleksandr Vasyak, chief of the Operations Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, who was invited from Russia, formulates and directs the activities of the Azerbaijani Army all over the front. At the headquarters of the Agdam brigade, Colonel Vasyak's eloquent expressions before a formation of Azerbaijani officers about the lackadaisical attitude of the latter made me give up the idea of asking the colonel a few questions. Major Gribanov, chief of staff of x-brigade, came to Azerbaijan from Murmansk, leaving his wife and three children there. He is fighting for his homeland. The Russian major considers it to be Azerbaijan, where he has lived for more than 1 year. Mikhail Vasilyevich says: "I am the same Azerbaijani as all of them. Sometimes I tell my children that I am a better Moslem than they are, although I am not circumcised. If necessary, I will die here."
