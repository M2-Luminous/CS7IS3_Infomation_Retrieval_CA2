Tension and anxiety prevail in the southern areas adjacent to the occupied border strip in the wake of continued threats by Israeli leaders to launch a new war. Israeli shelling of southern areas have continued and more Israeli reinforcements have been brought to the occupied border strip. The resistance men and the occupation forces and their agents exchanged artillery fire yesterday. The Israeli forces bombarded the al-Litani River basin, the outskirts of Zawtar al-Sharqiyah, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, Arnun, al-Hamra' plantation, the Habbush bridge, the outskirts of 'Arab Salim, Kafr Rumman, al-Nabatiyah al-Fawqa, Kafr Tibnit, Jabal al-Rafi', Mlita, al-Luwayzah, Jabal Safi, Mimis, Marj al-Zuhur, and 'Ayn al-Tinah. Israeli helicopters flew intensive sorties over the line separating the south and the occupied area and fired flares over the western slopes of Mount Hermon. Israeli gunboats cruised off the Lebanese coast between al-Zahrani and al-Naqurah throughout last night. Israeli forces brought 15 artillery pieces to the al-Khardali bridge and stationed them south of the township of Blat. This just in from a NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY CORRESPONDENT in al-Nabatiyah: The Israeli forces bombarded the al-Sit Zubaydah bridge, the outskirts of Habbush, and the road linking al-Nabatiyah with Iqlim al-Tuffah between 0100 and 0430 today.
