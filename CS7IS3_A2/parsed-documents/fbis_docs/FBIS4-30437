Police, meanwhile, raided a church hall in downtown Seoul Sunday afternoon to haul away over 250 striking railroad workers who have been staging a sit-in at the hall since they began the strike last Thursday. It was the second time in a day that the police raided sit-in protest sites of striking railroad and subway workers. Earlier in the day, police broke into Kyung Hee and Dongduck Women's Universities to arrest and disperse striking workers and sympathizing students. In the joint government and ruling party meeting, the two sides agreed to come up with measures to fundamentally head off the possibility of railroad paralysis while trying to mobilize military manpower to minimize adverse impacts of the ongoing strike on the country's economy. The joint meeting attended by relevant high-ranking government officials and lawmakers including O Myong, transportation minister; Nam Chae-hui, labor minister; Yi Won-chong, Seoul city mayor; and Yi Se-ki, the ruling DLP's chief policymaker, also agreed to sternly deal with any sympathy strikes which the National Council of Union Representatives or Chonnodae encompassing the nation's major manufacturing companies threatened to stage Monday. Transportation Minister O said in the meeting "We expect the ongoing strike to enter a recovering phase starting tomorrow," adding the ministry will make it sure that the strategic material, in particular, be moved without fail. "As of 10 A.M. this morning, the ministry finished accepting applications of the striking workers to return to their works and the ministry will not extend the deadline," said O. "From now on, the ministry will continue to accept those who want to return to their works but they should be subjected to disadvantages in personnel management."
