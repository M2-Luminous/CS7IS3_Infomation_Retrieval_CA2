"I am glad that the problem was solved. That will enable us to resume peaceful and constructive work and, surely, we all got a useful lesson," Laar said and added that "constitutional dispute had ended". Laar said he had received the information from Tunne Kelam, vice chairman of Estonian parliament who had been informed of the President's move over the telephone by Meri's office. Laar also said Meri had expressed wish to hold a speech before the parliament on Tuesday in order to explain his latest moves. Meri's office has not confirmed the news. Last Saturday, Meri rejected Laar's government reshuffle plan refusing to dismiss Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae while sacking Finance Minister Madis Rike and turning down Premier's nominee for Finance Minister, Heiki Kranich. Meri agreed to award Foreign Minister's portfolio to Juri Luik and Defence Minister's portfolio to Indrek Kannik. Both ministers refused to take up their new positions if Meri refused to approve the whole package. [passage omitted]
