This has attracted wide attention in the world. The nucleus of China's reform of its economic system is the reform of enterprises. Where shall Chinese enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, go? This is an issue that the people are most concerned about. China's socialist market economic structure is a new system combined with the basic socialist system. It is suited to China's national conditions and is conducive to the development of its productive forces. In reforming China's state-owned enterprises we should consistently adhere to the principle of taking public ownership as the main body and developing other sectors of the economy at the same time. Therefore, whether at present or in the future, China's state-owned enterprises cannot take the road of privatization. In the country as a whole, the position and role of the state-owned economy cannot be replaced by any other economic sector, nor will there be major changes in the overall setup. In carrying out enterprise reform we should look for a way to speed up development of enterprises and an effective form of public ownership, with the premise of adhering it. China's large and medium state-owned enterprises always take an important position in the national economy. Since 1978, although the world economy has been increasing slowly, China's GNP has been growing at a rate of 9 1.326369e-315very year, and the output value of state-owned enterprises has been increasing at a rate of 8 1.326369e-315ach year. In 1992, of all industrial enterprises, state-owned enterprises were only 0.162000060100f the total, but their production value accounted for 36.672000060100f the total, and the profit and taxes they handed to the state accounted for 51.62000060100f the total. This shows that the state-owned large and medium enterprises are the mainstay of the national economy. The reform of state-owned enterprises is the basis for establishing the system of socialist market economy. In the past decade and more, the reform of enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, has been the key to China's economic restructuring. Ever since the 4th plenary session of the 12th National Congress of the CPC in 1984, we have realized that the reform of state-owned enterprises is the most important and essential issue of the reform of the entire economic structure, and have adopted a series of policies and measures for the reform of state-owned enterprises. Last year, the question of the establishment of a basic framework for a socialist market economy was raised at the 3rd plenary session of the 14th National Congress of the CPC. The session also clearly pointed out that we should change the operational system of state-owned enterprises, establish a modern enterprise system, and continuously deepen reform of state-owned enterprises. This has made us deeply aware that enterprises are the basic economic units and the main elements for competition in the market. To confirm the principal position of enterprises and to remold the micro-basis of the market economy are the major topics in the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. The strategic concepts for the reform of Chinese enterprises are: Centering on the general goal of establishing a socialist market economic structure, strengthen enterprise legislation to move enterprise reform onto a legal track; centering on reform of property rights of state-owned enterprises, further improve the legal entity system; with the establishment of a system of modern enterprises as a basic direction, further change enterprise operational mechanisms; and closely combine enterprise reform, establishment of a market system, reform of the macro economic management system, and establishment of a social security system to create a good environment for deepening enterprise reform. The fundamental purpose of enterprise reform is to strengthen the vitality of enterprises and to increase, to the greatest extent, the economic efficiency of enterprises. The main elements of the reform of China's enterprises are: 1. At present, all state-owned enterprises should continue to implement the "Regulations Governing the Change of Enterprise Operational Mechanism" and the "Regulations Concerning the Supervision and Control of the Assets of State-Owned Enterprises," which are to be issued soon; carry out in a planned way the work of reappraising the stocks and assets of enterprises, defining property rights, clearing up debts, evaluating assets, and setting up standard internal management structures; and do a good job of experiments in establishing a system of modern enterprises, accumulating experience, creating good conditions, and gradually popularizing it. 2. Clearly define the property rights of enterprises. There are two problems which should be solved well: 1) The separation of the ownership of assets from the legal person's rights to enterprise property to enable them to become independent of government administration, release the state from undertaking unlimited responsibility toward enterprises, and turn state-owned enterprises into commodity producers and dealers owning all legal property and independently undertaking business activities. 2) Solving well the relationship between property rights and managerial rights within an enterprise. The representative of the legal person of an enterprise should truly give managerial rights to the manager, with the manager only reporting to the legal person of the enterprise and having independent managerial rights to turn the enterprise into an independent legal entity. 3. Establish a system of modern enterprises with a perfect legal person system as the basis, limited responsibility as the feature, and company as the main form. The organizational forms of enterprises are not classified according to the nature of ownership but by the organizational form of property and the legal responsibility they undertake. Promoting the system of modern enterprises in state-owned enterprises is of major significance in changing operational systems, raising managerial and competitive abilities, and bringing their lead in the national economy into full play. According to China's practical conditions, adopting the corporate system for state-owned enterprises is a beneficial experiment in establishing a modern enterprise system. Through the experiment in limited liability and joint-stock companies in recent years, we have seen the good points of enterprises having a corporate form. But new contradictions have arisen in these experiments, which tell us that it is quite difficult to turn enterprises into ones having a corporate form. Thus, we should not institute changes too widely or for all enterprises, but should gradually, step by step, promote it. Therefore, we experiment on a portion of the large and medium state-owned enterprises to practice a modern enterprise system, and at the same time standardize existing companies with limited liability and joint-stock companies according to corporate law. 4. Strengthen legislation on enterprises. Laws and regulations concerning the market, except for the already promulgated corporate law, are now in preparation. These laws and regulations include those concerning single-investor enterprises, partnerships, and cooperative share companies. Other laws for standardizing the market and perfecting social security are also in preparation, such as the law against monopoly, and commercial act, contract, labor, insurance, and social security laws. So that the laws can be smoothly implemented and actually followed, further efforts should be made to enforce the execution and jurisdiction of the laws. 5. Clearly define the relationship between the government and enterprises, and conscientiously change the function of government. The government executes its administration of the national economy mainly by economic and legal means, aided by some necessary administrative means. Generally, the government undertakes the functions of macroeconomic regulation and control, overall coordination, and administration of society, rather than directly interfering with the production and management of enterprises. 6. Current state-owned enterprises will be administrated or reformed according to their classifications. Enterprises which have something to do with state security, national defense, sophisticated sciences and technology, and some special trades, and enterprises which manufacture special products, will still have the state-owned enterprise form and can be converted into solely state-funded companies. Large and medium enterprises which are strongly competitive can gradually develop into enterprises in the form of stock companies controlled by the state. Small state-owned enterprises can be turned into companies with limited liability or cooperative share companies; some can be contracted or leased and some can be sold at auction. 7. Speed up the structural adjustment of enterprises. With regard to the many old state-owned enterprises whose product structures are irrational, economic results are not good, and debts are high, the state needs to make fairly major structural changes. For instance, all sorts of methods, such as merging, liquidation, joint ventures, peeling off, and reorganization, will be used to make the structure of enterprises more rational. This year, the state plans to gain experience through experiments with the liquidation of enterprises and making a major breakthrough in the standardization of enterprise liquidation. 8. Create a better environment for the reform of enterprises. We must enthusiastically do a good job in reform of the fiscal and tax, banking, investment, and foreign trade systems, set up and perfect market and social security systems, do our best to nurture and bring up a contingent of high-quality, professional entrepreneurs to lay social and economic foundations for the development of enterprises. 9. Encourage all sectors of the economy to set up and run single-investor enterprises, partnership businesses, cooperative share companies, and corporations in accordance with relevant state policies and regulations, and encourage the promotion of the modern enterprise system in foreign-invested, township and town, and urban collective enterprises where conditions are ripe. The situation of the reform of Chinese enterprises is good, and opportunities for reform are hard to come by. Though there are difficulties and problems, they are what all enterprises meet in their development. So long as we fully foresee the difficulties, carefully design our reform plans, and consistently carry out the reform, we will be certain to reach our goal.
