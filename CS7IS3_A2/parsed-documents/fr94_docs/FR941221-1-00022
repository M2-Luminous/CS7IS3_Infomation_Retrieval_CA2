SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of April 17, 1985 (50 FR 15219), which announced that Chevron Chemical Co., 540 Hensley St., Richmond, CA 94804, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 5F3188), proposing to amend 40 CFR 180.205 by establishing tolerances for residues of the herbicide paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium ion) derived from the application of either the bis (methyl sulfate) or dichloride salt (both calculated as the cation) in or on rice grain and rice straw at 0.05 part per million (ppm). There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing. The chemical, paraquat, was sold to ICI Americas, 1800 Concord Pike, Wilmington, DE 19897, which later changed its name to Zeneca Ag Products. The petitioner subsequently amended the petition by submitting a revised Section F proposing to establish a tolerance for residues of paraquat on rice straw at 0.06 ppm. Because there is a potential increase in risk to humans from this revision and because it has been longer than 5 years since the original proposal, the tolerances of 0.05 ppm on rice grain and 0.06 ppm on rice straw are being proposed again for 30 days to allow for public comments. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerance is sought. The toxicological data listed below were considered in support of these proposed tolerances. 1. Several acute studies placing technical paraquat in Toxicity Category I. 2. A 1-year feeding study with dogs fed dosages of 0, 0.45, 0.93, and 1.51 milligrams of paraquat cation/kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight (bwt) per day with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 0.45 mg/kg/day based on increased severity and extent of chronic pneumonitis in both sexes, but especially in the males at 0.93 mg/kg/day. 3. A 2-year chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in mice fed dosages of 0, 1.87, 5.62, and 15/18.75 mg/kg/day, expressed as paraquat cation (the highest dose had to be increased from 15 mg/kg/day to 18.75 mg/kg/day because no toxic signs appeared at 15 mg/kg/day), with no carcinogenic effects observed under the conditions of the study up to and including 15/18.75 mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested [HDT]) and a systemic NOEL of 11.87 mg/kg/day, based on renal tubular degeneration in males and weight loss and decreased food intake in females at 5.62 mg/kg/day. 4. A 2-year chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats fed dosages of 0, 1.25, 3.75, and 7.5 mg/kg/day expressed as the cation, with uncertain evidence of carcinogenicity (squamous cell carcinomas in the head region (ears, nasal cavity, oral cavity, and skin)) in males at 7.5 mg/kg/day (HDT) and an approximate systemic NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day, based on increased incidence of opacities, cataracts, and nonneoplastic lung lesions (alveolar macrophages, epithelialization, and slight peribronchiolar lymphoid hyperplasia) at 3.75 mg/kg/day. 5. A 2-year chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats fed dosages of 0.25/30 (M/F), 1.26/1.50 (M/F), 4.15/5.12 (M/F) and 12.25/15.29 (M/F) mg/kg/day expressed as paraquat dichloride, with no carcinogenic effects at 12.5/15.25 mg/kg/day (HDT) and a systemic NOEL of 4.15/5.12 mg/kg/day based on increased mortality in males and females, decreased erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and serum protein in males and females, decreased hematocrit, glucose and corpuscular cholinestrease activity in males, decreased leukocytes, albumin-to-globulin ratio and alkaline phosphatase, GOT and GDT activities in females, increased polymorphonucleocytes in males, increased potassium and glucose in females, decreased absolute and/or relative weights of heart (males and females) and liver and brain (females), and increased absolute weights of kidneys (males and females) and ovaries at 12.5/15.25 mg/kg/day (HDT). 6. A three-generation reproduction study with rats fed dosages of 0, 1.25, 3.75, and 7.5 mg/kg/day, expressed as cation, with no reproductive effects observed at 7.5 mg/kg/day (HDT) and a systemic NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day based on increased incidence of alveolar histiocytosis in the lungs of the male and female parents at 3.75 mg/kg/day. 7. A developmental toxicity study in mice fed dosages of 0, 1.0, 5.0, and 10 mg/kg/day, expressed as cation, with no teratogenic effects observed occurring at dosages up to and including 10 mg/kg/day (HDT); a fetotoxic NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day based on partially ossified sternebrae at 10 mg/kg/day; and a maternal toxicity NOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day based on weight reduction at 5.0 mg/kg/day. 8. A developmental toxicity study in rats fed dosages of 0, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg/day, expressed at cation with no teratogenic effects observed at 10 mg/kg; a fetotoxic NOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day based on reductions in weight and slight retardation in ossification at 5 mg/kg/day; and maternal toxicity NOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day based on piloerection, weight loss, and hunched appearance at 5.0 mg/kg/day. 9. Sixteen acceptable mutagenic studies were submitted for paraquat. These include six gene mutation assays with S. typhimurium (T4 92, TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 and G&hyph;6 histidine-requiring strains) and A. nidulans (strains 35 and P3); and L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells in culture; four structural chromosome aberration assays including dominant-lethal assays with Charles River CD&hyph; mice and Swiss-Webster mice; cytogenic assays (human lyphocytes and bone marrow of Wistar rats); and micronucleus test in mice; Six DNA damage/repair assays including S. typhimurium (TA 1978 and TA 1538 strains), Saccaromyces cerervisiae (D4, JD1, and ``other'' strains); human embryo epithelial cells; rat hepatocytes in culture; and sister chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts. Paraquat was negative in eight studies (mostly in gene mutation and chromosomal aberration assays); weakly positive in two gene mutation assays, one chromosomal aberration assay, and one DNA damage/repair assay; and positive in four DNA damage/repair assays. The reference dose (RfD) based on the 1-year feeding study in dogs (NOEL of 0.45 mg/kg/ bwt/day) and an uncertainty factor of 100 is calculated to be 0.0045 mg/kg/ bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) for published tolerances is 1.9 X 10 3 mg/kg bwt/day representing 42% of the RfD. The current action will utilize an additional 2% of the RfD. These tolerances and the previously established tolerances utilize a total of 43% of the RfD for the total U.S. population. For the most highly exposed U.S. subroup population, children 1 to 6 years of age, the current action and previously established tolerances utilize 96% of the RfD assuming that residue levels are at tolerance levels and 100% of the crop is treated. There are no desirable data lacking for this chemical. There are currently no actions pending against the continued registration of this pesticide. The Agency (Peer Review Committee) initially classified paraquat as a ``C'' carcinogen based on the significant increase in squamous cell carcinomas in the head region (ears, nasal cavity, oral cavity, and skin) of the high-dose (7.5 mg/kg/day male, Fischer rats) in the chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study. Review of the study by an independent laboratory concluded that the above tumor sites should not be combined. Without the combination, there were no statistically significant tumor increases for any particular tumor type. The Agency also considered two additional carcinogenicity studies (rat and mouse) and further evaluated the tumors. Based on a second peer review of paraquat, the Peer Review Committee, after reviewing all the evidence, concluded that there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male Wistar rats at 12 mg/kg/day (HDT); in female Wistar rats at 15 mg/kg/day (HDT); in male and female JCL:ICR mice at 13 mg/kg/day (HDT); in male and female mice (SPF Swiss) derived at 19 mg/kg/day (HDT). It was also concluded that there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in male Fischer 344 rats at 7.5 mg/kg/day (HDT). According to the EPA Carcinogenicity Guidelines, paraquat was, therefore, placed in Category E (evidence of non-carcinogenicity for humans), based on a lack of convincing evidence of carcinogenicity in adequate studies with two animal species, rat and mouse. The pesticide is useful for the purposes for which these tolerances are sought. The nature of the residue in plants and animals is adequately understood for the purpose of establishing these tolerances. Adequate analytical methodology (reflux extraction with sulfuric acid), cleanup on ion-exchange resin, reduction with sodium dithionite color reagent and spectrophotometric color measurement) is available for enforcement purposes. The method is listed in the Pesticide Analytical Manual II (PAM II). Any secondary residue occurring in meat, milk, poultry, and eggs will be covered by existing tolerances on these commodities. Based on the information considered by the Agency, the Agency has determined that when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this ingredient is useful and that the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health. It is proposed, therefore, that the tolerances be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number [PP 5F3188/P596]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;54, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;12), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or food additive regulations or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
