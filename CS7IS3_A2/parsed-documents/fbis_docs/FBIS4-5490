"I'm pretty sure we can solve our problems to maintain and develop our coalition government," Social Democratic Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference. Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, a top coalition strategist, also told reporters, "everything is going in the right direction," in a reference to the bickering among coalition partners over procedures to choose a replacement for Hosokawa. At a session of their caucus on Tuesday evening, coalition executives concurred on the need to work out differences between them and coalition party leaders on the succession procedures, Kubo said. The top coalition officials will meet again on Wednesday morning to discuss the matter further, he said, adding he believes they can get down to the nitty-gritty of picking a candidate for the premiership from Wednesday. While new party Sakigake (Harbinger), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the SDP favor the selection of a new premier at a forum of coalition chiefs, Shinseito, Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) contend the secretary general-level caucus should first discuss the matter. Hosokawa, who remains in office until his successor is picked, had asked the coalition executives' forum to take charge of the selection business. Earlier Tuesday, leaders of four coalition components met for a second time since Monday and shared the view that coalition chiefs should first discuss how to choose a candidate for the next premiership. The four were Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura of Sakigake, Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi of the DSP, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Eiichi Nakamura of the Democratic Reform Party, a small parliamentary group in the House of Councillors. Murayama twice proposed holding a meeting of coalition chiefs, once on Monday and again on Tuesday, to break the gridlock over the choice of a new premier, which poses a threat to the unity within the eight-month-old coalition. But leaders of four coalition partners -- Shinseito, Komeito, the JNP and the United Social Democratic Party -- rejected the bid and boycotted the two sessions. The row over the procedures to find Hosokawa's replacement clearly revealed the deep gulf between the moderate-to-leftist Sakigake-DSP-SDP bloc and the more conservative Shinseito-Komeito camp over political philosophies and some fundamental national policies. The known personal rivalry between Shinseito's Ozawa and Sakigake chief Takemura has also fueled the coalition's polarization into two blocs. While hoping to install Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who heads Shinseito, as the new premier, the latter alliance has also been considering fielding former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as a candidate to succeed Hosokawa. Watanabe, whose close personal relationship with Ozawa is no secret, has signaled his readiness to run for the highest government office. The Shinseito-Komeito bloc would give the boot to the SDP, the largest coalition contingent whose basic policies are still far apart from those of other coalition partners, should Watanabe decide to quit the LDP with a large number of his followers and join a part of the coalition, political sources said. The ex-foreign minister said Tuesday he wishes to run for the premiership, "with an irreversible determination," even by launching a new party, said Seiichi Ota, a close associate of Watanabe. While Watanabe's supporters are waging a campaign to have their boss selected as the LDP's candidate for the premiership, LDP President Yohei Kono himself vowed Tuesday to run in the parliamentary election to pick Hosokawa's successor. The two men will meet Wednesday to exchange views on the selection of a replacement for Hosokawa, party officials said. Sakigake, for its part, also showed interest in forming a tie-up with pro-reformers within the LDP, which was ousted from power last August for the first time in 38 years. Sakigake is an LDP breakaway party. As the possibility increased of neither of the two plans bearing fruit, however, the squabbling coalition parties began moving to mend fences and maintain the current framework of their alliance. "We faced a problem concerning the basis of the coalition this time," Kubo said. "I believe the coalition will grow solidified by overcoming problems like this."
