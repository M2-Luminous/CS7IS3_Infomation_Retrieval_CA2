Chinese Premier Li Peng said, however, the international community should try to solve the problem through patient negotiations, the officials said. Li was also quoted as saying it is important to call on North Korea to accept complete international inspections but giving North Korea "what it needs" is also important, they said. The Chinese premier, however, did not specify what North Korea needs, the Japanese officials said. During a two-hour meeting at the Diaoyutai Guesthouse, Hosokawa said Japan has "grave concern" that inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of North Korea's nuclear facilities ended insufficiently despite Pyongyang's accord with the IAEA, and talks between Seoul and Pyongyang failed because of North Korea's negative stance, the officials said. "If this problem goes as it is, the possibility of this problem being raised in the U.N. Security Council is becoming high," Hosokawa was quoted as telling Li. He also said the international community's patience is "nearing the limit" although Japan, China, the United States and South Korea have held common acknowledgement that it is best to solve the problem through dialogue and negotiations. "Looking at North Korea's stance up to now, the international community cannot but feel that it is trying to procrastinate," Hosokawa was quoted as saying. He said it is vital to call on North Korea to accept all inspections by the IAEA and to exchange envoys between Seoul and Pyongyang. Hosokawa also told Li China has an important role to play in conveying the mood of the international community properly to North Korea, the officials said. Li told Hosokawa China supports nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and also does not wish the emergence of a new nuclear- possessing country. He said, however, that by trying to solve the problem patiently through negotiations "the results will naturally come out," the officials said. "It is very important to cope with this problem by taking more time," Li was quoted as saying. Since South Korean President Kim Yong-sam is to visit Japan and China next week, the problem of North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons is expected to be discussed among Japan, South Korea and China. In the talks that covered a wide range of topics, Hosokawa referred to japan's wartime responsibilities and said he wants to "foster future-oriented Sino-Japanese relations" based on his policy speech at the Diet last August. In the speech, he expressed "deep remorse and apologies for the fact that past Japanese actions, including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people." It was the first time for a Japanese prime minister to use the words "aggression and colonial rule" in a policy speech in referring to Japan's actions during World War II. Millions of Chinese are believed to have died during the Sino-Japanese war that lasted from 1931 through 1945. Li welcomed Hosokawa's remarks, telling him it was the "most frank and sincere attitude" he has ever heard, the officials said. Also during the meeting, Hosokawa urged China to make its military spending "transparent." Li replied that china will make efforts to increase the transparency, they said. Hosokawa also told Li that Japan is particularly interested in extending yen loans to projects involving environment preservation and agriculture, and in shifting emphasis to inland china from the coastal regions, they said. Li expressed concern over Taiwan's "vacation diplomacy," alluding to Taiwan President Li Teng-hui's series of visits to the Philippines, Indonesa and Thailand in mid-February. The Chinese premier told Hosokawa he wants Japan to cope with the matter based on the 1972 Sino-Japan joint communique that restored diplomatic ties between the two countries. In the document, Japan endorses Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China. China strongly opposes any attempt to create "two Chinas" and the notion of "One China, One Taiwan." During the meeting, Hosokawa voiced support for China's bid to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, while Li did not openly support Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, the officials said. Hosokawa and Li agreed to meet again in Tokyo, they said. In the cultural field, Hosokawa pledged to provide 1 million dollars through the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to help preserve the Hanyuan Palace in the ancient capital of Xian. Earlier in the day, he visited the monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square and placed flowers in front of the monument.
