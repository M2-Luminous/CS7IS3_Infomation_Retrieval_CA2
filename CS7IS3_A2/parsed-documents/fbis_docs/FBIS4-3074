The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court reached the final ruling on maintaining the sentences decided on after the first trial of the two defendants. Xi Yang, 38, went to Hong Kong from the mainland in June 1992 after inheriting property, and became a MING PAO reporter in August the same year. From June to July 1993, he was assigned by the person in charge of the newspaper to conduct activities in Beijing in the name of covering the Sino-British talks and inauguration of the Preliminary Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. During his stay in Beijing, he spent most of his time illegally gathering state financial and economic secrets. Under Xi's instructions, Tian Ye provided him with top-secret information concerning China's bank note printing pattern and the People's Bank of China's plans to sell gold on the international market; to readjust the foreign exchange rates; and to again raise bank deposit interest rates, which Tian Ye had stolen and illegally gathered. Tian Ye also illegally provided Xi Yang with documents on "An Explanation on the Provisional Regulations Governing the Dealing of Renminbi by Foreign-Funded Financial Institutions," which were marked "confidential." Xi Yang incorporated these state secrets into articles and sent them to MING PAO for publication, causing serious economic losses to the state. Tian Ye and Xi Yang were arrested separately according to the law in October 1993. The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate instituted proceedings according to the law against Tian Ye and Xi Yang on 14 December 1993. Because the case involved state secrets, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court, according to article 111 of the "Criminal Procedural Law," conducted a nonpublic trial of the case. During the trial, because some evidence required further confirmation, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court returned the case on 27 January 1994 to the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate for evidence substantiation. On 15 February, the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate again referred the case to the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court. Before the trial began, both Tian Ye and Xi Yang said they did not need an attorney and would defend themselves on their own. During the trial, both defendants admitted their crimes and repented what they had done, and asked the court to show leniency. After the trial was completed, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled that, as a state worker Tian Ye violated the state's secrecy laws and regulations, and stole and illegally gathered and provided state secrets; that his act constituted the crime of stealing and illegally gathering and providing state secrets; and the case was especially serious. The court also ruled Xi Yang had ignored state law, stole and illegally gathered state financial and economic secrets, and published these secrets in a newspaper outside the country; that his act constituted the crime of stealing and illegally gathering state secrets; and the case was especially serious. The court ruled: The evidence of both defendants' crimes is well substantiated. According to the "Supplemental Regulations on the Punishment for the Crime of Revealing State Secrets" of the National People's Congress Standing Committee -- which states "Those who steal, illegally gather, buy, or provide state secrets to organs, organizations, or personnel outside the country are to be sentenced to 10 years or more in prison, to life imprisonment, or to death, and are to be deprived of political rights, if the case is especially serious" -- the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court, considering that both defendants had admitted their crimes and confessed, decided to appropriately reduce the punishment and reached a first-trial verdict on 28 March 1994, sentencing Tian Ye to 15 years in prison and depriving him of political rights for three years, and sentencing Xi Yang to 12 years in prison and depriving him of political rights for two years. Xi Yang refused to accept the verdict and lodged an appeal to the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court, after completing a second trial of the case, decided to reject Xi Yang's appeal and maintained the original verdict. The two criminals' prison terms begin from the date of detention.
