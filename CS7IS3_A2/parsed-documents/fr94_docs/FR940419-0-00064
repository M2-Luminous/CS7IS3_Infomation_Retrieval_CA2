FR940419-0-00064 FR940419-0-00019 In the case of ``treatability studies'', we recognize that this type of work may have a high risk of conflict of interest, yet we believe it is in the public interest to promote innovative technology and exempt such subcontract work from any limitations on future contracting. However, because there may be a high risk of conflict for this type of work, it is essential that protection is provided by flow down of the basic conflict of interest clauses. 22. Expansion of the Class of Exemptions for Subcontractor Flow Down Several commenters requested that we broaden the classes of work to be exempt from the flow down requirements which apply to subcontractors and consultants in all of the conflict of interest clauses. Some provided specific suggestions of additional categories to be exempted including: Laboratory services, industrial hygiene, selected geotechnical consulting, medical surveillance, transportation services, and graphics printing. We have given serious consideration to the commenters' recommendations and believe that categorically exempting these types of work from flow down would pose an unacceptable risk of conflict of interest to the Agency. For example, if a laboratory services subcontractor were also providing environmental consulting services for a specific site in support of a PRP's legal position, it would be a conflict of interest for the same subcontractor to then take or analyze samples for the EPA from the same site. In addition, if a transportation subcontractor has a relationship with a disposal facility that is a PRP on a site, it would be a conflict of interest for that same transportation subcontractor to also perform work at or relating to the site for EPA, or involving the disposal facility. Each of the other recommended categories also poses such risks, and the Agency cannot categorically exempt them. However, we recognize there may be special cases in which these type of activities can be excluded and each clause allows for Contracting Officers to authorize such exemptions. Thus, we have added a provision permitting a contractor to request in writing that the Contracting Officer exempt from the flow-down requirements of the Limitation of Future Contracting clauses a particular subcontract or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services not specifically exempted in the clauses, including laboratory analysis. The Contracting Officer will review and evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis, before approving or disapproving the request. 23. Costs Associated With Flow Down of Clauses to Subcontractors Commenters expressed concern about the costs associated with the flow down requirements of the rule's clauses. One commenter asked if EPA is willing to pay for the costs associated with the LOFC flow down provision. The allowable and allocable costs associated with this rule may be chargeable to EPA contracts in accordance with the provisions of FAR part 31. This would also apply to allowable and allocable costs associated with this rule, which are incurred by non-exempt subcontractors or consultants, except that such costs would be submitted to EPA's prime contractor rather than to EPA. We anticipate that costs associated with future contracting requests under an LOFC clause will be minimal and would be performed as a part of the normal bid and proposal effort. 24. Expansion of Subcontractor Flow Down Exemption To Apply To Prime Contractors Some commenters also requested that prime contractors be exempt from the LOFC or other conflict of interest clauses when work to be performed under the prime contract is one of the exemptions identified in the flow down section of the clauses. We disagree. EPA prime contracts include a wide variety of tasks, many of which pose a high risk for conflict of interest. However, in the unlikely event that an EPA prime contractor only performed the type of work exempted in a specific subcontractor flow down provision, the contractor could request from the Contracting Officer an exemption from inclusion of that conflict of interest clause.
