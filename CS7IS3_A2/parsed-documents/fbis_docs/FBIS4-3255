FBIS4-3255 "drchi075_w_94010" FBIS-CHI-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Macao Portuguese Prime Minister on Macao, PRC Issues Portuguese Prime Minister on Macao, PRC Issues LD1704223394 LD1704223394 BFN [Editorial report] Lisbon RDP Antena 1 Radio Network in Portuguese at 1732 GMT on 17 April carries a 28-minute recording of an interview with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva conducted in Macao earlier in the day by Teledifusao de Macao [TDM]. The interviewers are TDM's Mario Rui de Castro, Fatima Cid, and by an unidentified local journalist. Asked to comment on criticism levelled at him by the weekly EXPRESSO and by the secretary of the Portuguese Episcopal Conference for not speaking about human rights during his visit to China, Cavaco Silva says: "Portugal, in terms of human rights, has the same stance as the remaining 11 European Union [EU] countries. There is no difference. In 1992 I had the opportunity to speak with the Chinese prime minister about this matter. And I did so once again in Beijing. It was very clear that Portugal has a different position, interpretation, emphasis -- as the Chinese say -- when it comes to human rights. I believe this matter should not be discussed in public because if it is, it will not be effective, therefore those who made such statements in Portugal regarding my visit did so through ignorance because they were not at the meeting and they do not know what I told the Chinese leaders." In connection with this question, the prime minister goes on: "I would like to add that it was I, myself, personally, who in the last few days, almost in the last few hours, negotiated with the Chinese authorities the possibility of the church of Macao maintaining relations with religious organizations outside Macao. With a view to preserving, obviously, relations between the church of Macao and the Vatican." The prime minister is then questioned about the matter of the nationality of the people of Macao. He says: "Those with Portuguese passports are Portuguese now and in the future. Portugal will not withdraw anyone's nationality. However I knew that there was some concern regarding the implementation of the Chinese nationality law in the future here in Macao and therefore I broached this subject with the Chinese authorities. The answer I was given by the Chinese leaders was that they do not intend to impose Chinese nationality on Macanese people of Portuguese descent." When asked about the future of civil servants in Macao, Cavaco Silva says: "It is essential for Macao that its special characteristics and identity remain after 1999, that Macao's character goes beyond the end of the Portuguese administration. An important contribution to this can be made from those working in the public sector. Therefore I believe it is in Macao's interest, and I stress in Macao's interest, that the current civil servants remain so after 1999 and nothing should be done against this principle. It would be a terrible mistake for Macao and even for Portugal if we were to create the conditions for all the civil servants to leave Macao." Later in the interview, Cavaco Silva speaks of the changes in China, saying: "I have noticed a significant change in China regarding the economy. I believe it is difficult to describe what is happening in China today. I said yesterday and I say it again, the whole country looks like a construction site, with a thirst for economic development and growth which I believe does not exist anywhere else in the world. It would be a mistake for Portugal and for the EU to ignore one of the largest world markets in the very near future." He is then asked for his opinion on whether the British are defending the interests of Hong Kong in their dealings with China. Cavaco Silva replies: "I think it is not up to the Portuguese prime minister to comment on the Hong Kong transition process. I answer for the Macao transition process." Returning to the subject of the Chinese economy, he says: "It appears to me that there is virtually total flexibility and economic openness. The Chinese authorities say this is the appropriate way to eliminate the poverty which still exists in China. I was amazed. It is difficult to imagine before coming here what is happening in the Chinese economy. I believe that China will be an economic power in the 21st century if the current rate of development is maintained. No one in the world will be able to ignore China. I have been saying for a long time that it would be a mistake for the western world, the EU, the United States to ignore a country with 1.2 billion people and which is fundamental for world stability and peace." Asked to confirm that he advocates openness by the EU to China, Cavaco says that "all economic restrictions have disappeared, all financial restrictions. There are no restrictions on visits by prime ministers, so it does not make sense to maintain restrictions on visits by heads of state. I would describe this as hypocrisy by Europe, so let us put an end to it and let us fully normalize relations between the EU and China." Cavaco Silva goes on to confirm that the Chinese authorities expressed the wish to have President Soares visit China. Later he confirms that the Chinese have acknowledged the importance of a Portuguese cultural presence, of the Portuguese language, in Macao. He adds that it was important for more Portuguese to speak Chinese, and he regrets the fact that so few people speak Portuguese in Macao. "I would like the inter-penetration of cultures to be more visible with regard to language -- with Chinese speaking Portuguese and Portuguese speaking Chinese." Questioned about the Portuguese Government's commitment to joint ventures between Macao, Portugal, and China, Cavaco Silva says that although the government backs these, "the Portuguese Government cannot be too much of an umbrella for Portuguese businessmen. We want them to have initiative and innovation, and to take risks. But in this case we have decided to provide special help. In May another business delegation will visit China, Macao, and Guangzhou. Obviously, these will be private initiatives. The Portuguese Government is not going to lead businessmen by the hand -- they will have to act and show their ability. You have to struggle here -- it has not all been done, things have to be built. I hope they will not give up easily. It would be a mistake if, after the political welcome which was reflected onto the economic side, our businessmen do not insist on being present here in Macao, Guangzhou, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Beijing." He continues: "I have great confidence in the future, that is why I brought to Macao a message of confidence in the future, and this is what I asked the Chinese authorities to support. The message from Beijing to Macao was clearly one of confidence in the future." Cavaco Silva then speaks of TAP-Air Portugal's plan to integrate Air Macao: "The government will help, things are going well. I cannot give details but I can say that the negotiations saw some progress in Beijing." When asked if Air Macao would have Portuguese investment, he says that "the signs point to that, but first we need to have the airport. I have not seen the airport so I don't want to talk about this yet." He goes on to say that he believes that the airport would be positive for Portugal because "it is the missing link to the outside world for Macao. Macao will gain autonomy and a special link with Europe and Portugal. That is why I said here in China that we want and offer Portugal as a platform for China's, and in particular Macao's, penetration in the EU." Asked about the Portuguese economy, Cavaco Silva expresses his belief that a recovery is under way; he is confident that the inflation rate will stand at 5 percent, between 5 and 6 percent. The prime minister goes on to reiterate that Macao should come under the government's jurisdiction. "I think that more than ever the question of Macao is a foreign policy issue and as 1999 draws near the foreign policy aspect tends to surface. It is more a question of negotiating with China about the future of Macao and about the Portuguese presence in Macao, than a question of resolving administrative matters." In conclusion, he leaves a message for the Portuguese and Chinese who live in Macao. "My message is one of confidence in the future. I believe there are reasons -- especially after the talks in Beijing with the Chinese authorities and after observing the evolution in the implementation of the Joint Declaration during the last seven years -- I believe that are reasons to think that Macao will continue to enjoy stability, which is important, will continue to enjoy a strong economic growth, and will continue to enjoy progress."
