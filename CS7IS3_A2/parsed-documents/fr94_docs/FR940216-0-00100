FR940216-0-00100 FR940216-0-00010 c. Benzene. EPA proposed to use ASTM method D&hyph;3606 for the regulatory test method, and most commenters were in agreement with the use of this method. However, commenters noted that other acceptable gas chromatographic methods exist for the determination of benzene such as D&hyph;4815 (a gasoline oxygenate method) and D&hyph;4420 (an aromatics method). Comments were made that D&hyph;3606 requires a dedicated chromatograph for benzene in gasoline only. It was also noted that the D&hyph;3606 results may be affected by interference from the presence of ethanol and methanol. EPA has decided that the single regulatory method for measuring concentration of benzene will be ASTM method D&hyph;3606&hyph;92. Due to the possibility of a slight interference from ethanol and methanol in the test results, the method has been amended by the regulation to require that the instrument parameters be adjusted to ensure complete resolution of the benzene, ethanol and methanol peaks. As with all reformulated gasoline parameters, EPA has chosen one regulatory test method. However, it should be noted that the presence of benzene can be tested also by the GC&hyph;MS, the regulatory method for aromatics testing. With the GC&hyph;MS, there should not be a problem with the presence of oxygenates and a dedicated chromatograph is not needed. EPA is interested in the possibility of participating with industry in the development of the GC&hyph;MS method for benzene. d. Aromatics. EPA proposed to use the Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry (GC&hyph;MS) method, developed by EPA, for total aromatics determination. Most commenters opposed the method proposed by EPA. One commenter recommended delaying selection of a lab test method until the procedure can be evaluated and completely developed. Commenters also criticized the method for its cost, the amount of time the method demands, and because industry feels that the method will require highly specialized staff. One commenter stated that the proposed method was so incomplete that it was not possible to provide detailed technical comments on it. Most commenters suggested that EPA adopt ASTM method D&hyph;1319, a fluorescent indicator absorption method. EPA has decided to adopt the proposed method, the GC&hyph;MS, as the single regulatory method for the determination of total aromatics. However, because the method is relatively new, leaving industry little time to scrutinize the method, the final regulations allow use of ASTM method D&hyph;1319&hyph;93 until January 1, 1997 for purposes of meeting the industry testing requirements under section 80.65(e), provided this method is correlated with the GC&hyph;MS method. This two year transition period should allow sufficient time for industry to purchase equipment and become familiar with the new method. In addition, during this time period, it is anticipated that EPA and industry can discuss any problems that might arise as a result of the new method being promulgated. Moreover, the GC&hyph;MS method has been rewritten to provide more detail and specificity. EPA is aware that industry is uncomfortable with a newly developed method that has not had the usual round-robin testing or extensive participation by ASTM. However, EPA believes that the method available, D&hyph;1319, is so archaic when compared with present day technology, and has such extremely poor accuracy and precision, that it is necessary to develop a new method. Furthermore, D&hyph;1319 has not been proven effective with oxygenated fuels even though the updated version does include a multiplication factor to use when oxygenates are present. EPA also believes that it does not have the choice of leaving the method open until the GC&hyph;MS could be evaluated more thoroughly given the timing of the final rule. EPA believes the GC&hyph;MS is a dependable, accurate and precise method that, with the aid of industry, can be applied in the near future to many of the other reformulated gasoline parameters. The eventual use for several parameters should somewhat offset the initial cost. EPA also believes, based on personal experience, that the GC&hyph;MS apparatus is readily usable by competent lab technicians with about one week of training. It is less personnel-intensive and more accurate than the D&hyph;1319 method. e. Oxygen and Oxygenates. EPA proposed to use the GC-Oxygenate Flame Ionization Detector (OFID) method for determining oxygen content. Many commenters objected to the OFID method due to the fact that ASTM is still reviewing it through round-robin testing and precision information is not presently known. Commenters were concerned with the laboratory time required and the high deterioration and replacement rate cost of the cracker reactor. Commenters were also concerned with possible increased down-time in the laboratory. Most commenters suggested that ASTM method D&hyph;4815, a method used by industry during the winter oxygenate season, be used for testing oxygenates. Some commenters also suggested the use of portable Infrared (IR) analyzers because of their low cost and rapid results.
