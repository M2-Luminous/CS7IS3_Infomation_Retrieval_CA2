According to these data, to the question as to the direction in which Ukraine is currently headed, those responding that it is headed in the right direction constituted 7 percent in the cities, 10 percent in the villages, and 7 percent in Ukraine on average; the "don't knows" constituted 11, 15, and 13 percent respectively; those responding that Ukraine is moving in the wrong direction constituted 84 percent in cities, 74 percent in the villages, and 81 percent in Ukraine on average. For the answer to the question as to which problem currently confronting Ukraine worries them the most, it was suggested that those polled choose three problems, and the answers were distributed as follows: 68 percent of those polled declared that they were worried most by the state of the economy, 39 percent, by relations with Russia, 35 percent, crime, 28 percent, Ukraine's security, 8 percent each the nuclear weapons situation and the Crimea problem, 6 percent, the position of Russian in Ukraine, and 5 percent, the Black Sea Fleet, and 4 percent of those polled either cited other problems or had no answer. Sixty-five percent of those polled agree fully that it is necessary to acquire the right to private ownership of the land, only 9 percent disagree, and the rest are undecided. But only 29 percent of those polled are sure that the ordinary people would benefit from the introduction of private ownership, 22 percent disagree, and the rest of have not made up their minds. It is hard to call these data anything other than a lack of confidence in the economic policy of present Kiev officialdom. And the following data are indicative with respect to the political course of the present leadership of Ukraine: To a question concerning the attitude toward the CIS, 79 percent of those polled declared that Ukraine should remain in the Commonwealth, 10 percent, that it should quit the CIS, and 11 percent did not know. Concerning the economic union with the CIS, 75 of those polled responded that Ukraine should become a full member, 17 percent, that it should remain an associate member, and 7 percent, that it should quit the economic union, and 6 percent of those polled did not know. More specifically concerning Ukrainian-Russian relations: 18 percent of those polled declared that Ukraine and Russia should coexist as two totally independent states with closed borders, visas, and customs, and 39 percent of those polled declared that Ukraine and Russia should be fully independent, but friendly states--with open borders and without visas or customs. Forty percent of those polled declared that Ukraine and Russia should unite in one state, and only 3 percent are as yet undecided. The sociologists circumspectly did not inquire as to what had brought about this lamentable result of two years of Ukraine's independence. Thirty-nine percent of those polled see Crimea as an oblast of Ukraine, 29 percent of those polled, as an autonomous republic within Ukraine, 27 percent, as an independent state, if this is what the people of Crimea want, and 12 percent did not know. Some 51 percent of those polled advocated Russian as a second official language, 33 percent of those polled supported it as a second official language where this is what the public wants, 12 percent support the complete elimination of Russian from official use, and 4 percent could not say. Sixty-one percent of those polled declared that the Black Sea Fleet should be Ukrainian, and 18 percent, that it could be sold to Russia, and the rest either suggested other options or could not say. Some 58 percent of those polled responded that they would take part in the parliamentary elections if they were held today, and 66 percent of those polled are prepared to turn out for the elections in the villages, and 54 percent in the cities, what is more. Twenty-nine percent of those polled would stay away, and a further 13 percent were undecided. Of those who declared a readiness to take part in the elections, 5 percent named in response to the question of which present people's deputy they would like to see in the future parliament Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil. He was followed by Ivan Plyushch, speaker of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, with 4 percent, former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma with 3 percent, Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, leader of the Democratic Party, and Volodymyr Hrynyov, leader of the New Ukraine association, with 2 percent each, and Levko Lukyanenko, former ambassador of Ukraine in Canada, and Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, with 1 percent each. The remaining 34 deputies named mustered less than 1 percent of the vote. Some 69 percent of those polled found it difficult to name a modern political party of Ukraine for which they would vote were the forthcoming elections to be conducted by party slate, and of the 31 percent who named such parties, 10 percent supported Rukh, 9 percent, the Democratic Party, 7 percent, the Communist Party, and 2 percent, the Socialist Party, and the People's and Peasant Parties, the Ukrainian Justice Party, and the Green Party "garnered" 1 percent each. Among those who cited no party, 40 percent of those polled declared that they simply could not recall the parties' names, and 37 percent, that they would be voting for nonparty candidates, and the rest found it hard to say. It should be recalled in conclusion that there are 26 days remaining until the parliamentary elections in Ukraine.
