He said this during talks with three British MPs who are currently visiting Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serb republic, the Republican Ministry of Information said in a statement. In May 1992, the United Nations Security Council imposed tough sanctions against the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro because of their alleged involvement in the civil war among Moslems, Serbs and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The allegation that only Serbia is responsible for the war in Bosnia is not correct, one of the British MPs, Nigel Evans, said in an interview to Serbian Television after the meeting with Sainovic. He also said he would present this view to the British Government. The talks focused on the effects of the sanctions and the possibilities for unhindered and speedier delivery of British humanitarian medical supplies to Yugoslavia, he said. We are especially interested in working in that direction after our visits to hospitals where we saw the effects of the sanctions, Evans said.
