Since July 1991, Daimler Benz, as a partner of the French computer services group, has held a 34 percent interest in Sogeti, which is CGS's holding company. But now, by converting a stockholder loan into shares and by exercising, in a new stock issue, the subscription rights it obtained as part of the partnership accord negotiated between the two groups, it has the chance to acquire a controlling majority of CGS as of 1 February 1995. Though all this is still a year ahead, rumors are already flying. Last week the rumor mill was stirred up again by publication of CGS's earnings statement for 1993, which showed a loss of 434 million [French] francs. Daimler Benz attitude toward CGS is unambiguous, according to sources at the company's Stuttgart headquarters. The group says it does not want to withdraw from the French company but rather is looking for a partner that will help out on capital acquisition but allow it to operate the French concern. Daimler Benz says it will entertain offers from any potential partner. Matra and France Telecom are among the names being mentioned. If unsuccessful in its quest for an ally, Daimler Benz will decide next year whether or not to exercise its option to acquire a 51 percent interest.
