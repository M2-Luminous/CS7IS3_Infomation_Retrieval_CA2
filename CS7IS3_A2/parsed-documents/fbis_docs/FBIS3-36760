The government's personnel department stated that from January 17 to 20 Illarionov did not report to work and that he refused to give any explanations. It turned out that during that time he was giving lectures in Britain without informing the government about this. Illarionov's statement that he resigned because he did not support the government's policies was an attempt to conceal the real cause of his dismissal, said the government's spokesman.
