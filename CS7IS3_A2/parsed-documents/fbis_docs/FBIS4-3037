Lien made the remarks while receiving the chairmen of farmers' associations from around Taiwan. Around 3,000 farm association representatives and farmers rallied in Taipei today, demanding that the government look out for their interests. In meeting Premier Lien, Chien Chin-ching, chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Farmers' Association, submitted a statement calling on the government to maintain the ban on rice imports and to raise NT$100 billion to compensate farmers hurt by the opening of Taiwan's produce market. The farmers also asked the government to implement a pension scheme for farmers, to lift restrictions on real-estate transactions involving farm land, to form a supraministerial organization to help farmers cope with the impact likely to be brought about by Taiwan's admission into GATT, and to increase the budget for agricultural development. Lien promised that a governmental task force would be established to study ways to help farmers, who he said have long been the "weak group" in Taiwan.
