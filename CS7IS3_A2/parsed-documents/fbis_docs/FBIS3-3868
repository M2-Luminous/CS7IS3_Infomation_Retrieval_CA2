Mayor Li said that the city was still facing some problems despite the good results achieved last year. The outstanding problem was the grim public order situation with an increase in serious criminal cases. The management level over the city was not commensurate with the economic development there and this resulted in frequent big accidents. There were arduous tasks to be done in ensuring safety in the workplace and in protecting workers' legal interests and rights. The high inflation rate had affected the residents' lives and the industrial structure was not reasonable and needed to be adjusted while the pace of the transferring of government functions, macro-control and administration were not able to meet the demands of development of a market economy. All these problems, he added, would be solved this year.
