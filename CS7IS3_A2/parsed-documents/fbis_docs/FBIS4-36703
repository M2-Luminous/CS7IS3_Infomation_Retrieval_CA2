[Abu-Libdah] In fact, we did not come back with $42 million in our pocket. We returned with commitments to pay an additional $42 million to what was pledged on 27 January 1994. [Zaydani] When will the donor states begin to transfer the funds? [Abu-Libdah] Some of them have already started to do this. There is a sum of money in the Johan Jorgen Holst Peace Fund. We expect additional funds to be transferred this month. [Zaydani] During this month, how much will there be in the Holst Fund? [Abu-Libdah] We expect the funds to total $62 million. [Zaydani] Is this the sum you have asked for? [Abu-Libdah] It is part of what we have asked for. We went to the Paris conference three days ago having in mind the need to cover the $81 million deficit in the budget of the Palestinian National Authority [PNA]. We had expected some donor states to step forward to cover this deficit. We got $42 million, however. [Abu-Libdah] Which states have so far contributed funds to the PNA? [Abu-Libdah] The big states. The United States has pledged an additional $10 million; Japan an additional $9 million; Saudi Arabia an additional $10 million; Norway an additional $2 million; Canada an additional 1 million Canadian dollars; in addition to other states that will announce this. Let me explain here that these sums are not new pledges; they are a redistribution of the previous pledges. In 1994, many nations pledged to pay more than $700 million. Of course, not all the money will be disbursed in 1994. Based on discussions with these nations, it was agreed that some of them will redistribute their commitments so that we can cover the deficit. [Zaydani] What are the priorities to which these funds will go in the self-rule region? [Abu-Libdah] The first priority, of course, is paying the salaries in the public sector, in addition to a variety of programs which we deem of priority. These programs will try to respond to the requirements of the poorer sections of Palestinian society. [Zaydani] Will the funds then be transferred from the Holst Fund to a particular Palestinian side, the PLO or another fund? [Abu-Libdah] The Johan Holst Fund is run by the World Bank, but it is at the disposal of the Palestinian leadership, which will decide where to disburse any sums from this fund. [Zaydani] Another question, if I may. These funds will be enough for only several months. [Abu-Libdah] Certainly. We went to the Paris conference, and we will go to the next conference on 11 July to demand that the deficit in the PNA budget be covered until the end of this year. We think that if we manage to lay down the appropriate mechanisms to collect Palestinian income in other ways, then we will begin 1995, hopefully, with little or no deficit at all. [Zaydani] How will the Palestinians contribute money to the PNA through the collection of taxes from Palestinians abroad? [Abu-Libdah] The Palestinians abroad are expected, in general, to contribute a great deal to development and reconstruction. Palestinian revenues inside the occupied territories will definitely not be enough to lay the foundations of true economic progress that will enable the private sector to operate smoothly. Therefore, we expect our Palestinian brothers outside the occupied territories to be the way we know them, to invest their funds in the self-rule region and pledge funds to allow for progress in economic reconstruction in general. [Zaydani] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has made his travel to Jericho conditional on receiving aid from the donor countries. Has Yasir 'Arafat dropped this demand? [Abu-Libdah] Brother Yasir 'Arafat knows best under what conditions he will be able to enter his country. However, I believe that brother Yasir 'Arafat will arrive shortly in Jericho. [Zaydani] Why this secrecy about his arrival in Jericho? [Abu-Libdah] There are several factors that will determine the date of his arrival in Jericho, some of which have to do with the arrangements for the transfer of the PLO offices and its commitments inside the occupied territories, and some of them have a direct relation to the political situation in general. [Zaydani] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, thank you very much. [Abu-Libdah] You are welcome.
