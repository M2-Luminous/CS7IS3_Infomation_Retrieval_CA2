For UN members, the war against drug trafficking has not even begun. The report by the UN International Control Board concludes drug cartels are increasing their economic power and political influence. It noted drug traffickers are increasingly violent and ruthless in their attempt to control the drug-trafficking network. Regarding Colombia, the report states drug traffickers have always tried to exert influence on the legislative branch and government. During presentation of the document, Prosecutor General de Greiff said the antidrug war has been a failure. [Begin de Greiff recording] Here in Colombia, Mr. Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha has died at the hands of authorities. Mr. Pablo Escobar has died. Mr. Carlos Lehder was extradited. We have in jail a large number of drug traffickers, and what has happened in the market? Absolutely nothing. [Arturo Heinz, UN director in Colombia, identified by caption] As Colombia stated at the appropriate time, there has to be an overall approach between the narcotics demand and supply. This is a complex problem; it is not a unilateral problem in which the culprits are the consumers or producers. [end recording] The prosecutor general stated whereas in Colombia the policy is to open the door to drug traffickers who want to surrender to justice, the United States prefers to withhold evidence, hoping the Colombian drug traffickers will turn up in other countries.
