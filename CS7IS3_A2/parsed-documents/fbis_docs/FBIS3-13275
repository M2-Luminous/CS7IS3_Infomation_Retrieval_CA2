Praise be to God and peace be upon the prophet and his scion and upon God's pious people. On the last Friday of the blessed month of Ramadan and on the International Day of Jerusalem, we salute the memory of our late imam, who gave the jihad movement for liberating Palestine fresh impetus through his declaration of this great day. This year, the heinous crime at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque awakened people, especially the Islamic nation, and their interest in the cause of Jerusalem, Islam's primary cause. Zionism exposed its alien, aggressive face. It was naive for some to extend a hand of friendship to the usurping invaders and forget the movement of jihad, which the mujahidin staged for years and paid with the blood of many virtuous martyrs. Those people left the ranks of jihad and struggle, deluding themselves into thinking that the Israeli leaders would grant them special privileges on the land of Palestine. The Palestinian issue clearly demonstrates the right of the Muslim Palestinian people to jihad. There is no need for incidents like the one in Hebron for people to realize the intrigues of Zionism and the lies of its leaders and protectors when they talk about peace in the Middle East. We must warn those who deviated from the right path and tell them that they should return to the movement of jihad along with the sons of the Islamic nation and the valiant Palestinian people, consolidate the bonds of Islamic unity, and comply with what Islam and the Koran decided for them. They must be assured that there is no other way to achieve the rights of the persecuted Palestinian people than struggle and steadfastness. The Zionists and their covetous protectors will never stop their aggressive and expansionist spirit without the jihad of the Muslim people, which God promised victory and might. Peace be upon you. There is no help except from God. When comes the help of God and victory, and thou dost see the people enter God's religion in crowd, celebrate the praises of the lord, and pray for his forgiveness, for he is oft-returning in grace and mercy. [Koranic verses]
