According to a government decree signed a couple of days ago, from now on citizens of draft age will be allowed to leave the republic only with the appropriate note on their military identification card. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been instructed to submit proposals concerning the procedure for returning draft dodgers from other states. At the same time certain economic sanctions and restrictions on draft dodgers and their families are being considered. Additionally, the state minister for questions of defense, Vazgen Sarkisyan, speaking at a government conference, categorically denied the assertion that draftees would be sent immediately to the front lines, calling such rumors "absurd."
