The Mozambican committee for friendship with the people of the DPRK in its letter said: "The IAEA is continuously making a fuss about the `nuclear issue' of Korea while keeping mum about Japan's concealment of plutonium. This is aimed at stifling socialist Korea at any cost." "To destroy socialist Korea where the leader, the party and the masses are united in one mind is no more than a foolish dream," said the letter, urging the IAEA to make an issue of Japan's concealment of plutonium and probe its truth. The Malaysian action front in its letter said the IAEA should strongly urge the U.N. Security Council to take sanctions against Japan which is continuously stockpiling plutonium in defiance of world opinion and concern.
