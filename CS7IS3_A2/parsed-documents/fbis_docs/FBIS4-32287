FBIS4-32287 "dreeu121_b_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-121 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 BULGARIA BSP, SDS Not Interested in Early Elections BSP, SDS Not Interested in Early Elections AU2306113594 Sofia KONTINENT in Bulgarian 21 Jun 94 p 4 AU2306113594 Sofia KONTINENT Bulgarian BFN [Commentary by Svetlana Belousova: "Elections as Fiction"] [Text] The leaders of the two major political forces have had a second official tete-a-tete meeting. The first meeting failed to produce any public results; it only helped Zhan Videnov legitimize his position as leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. However, it was that meeting that served as the cornerstone of his current -- and after the congress -- future political career. Aleksandur Lilov, Andrey Lukanov, Nora Ananieva, and certain smaller self-proclaimed leaders remained in his shadow. In this context, the second meeting was a reciprocal diplomatic act that aimed to convince the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] that Filip Dimitrov is its only leader. Whether he will be able to utilize his position in the upcoming events or mess things up until they become fully unclear, which is typically the case, is a different issue. Against the background of the expanding political cacophony, which has been brought on by the idleness of the two political centers rather than by any action on their part, Videnov and Dimitrov could not meet in order "to discuss the political situation" -- one of the contemporary politicians' new cliches. They were expected to discuss the Election Bill and the amendments to the Constitution, and it was precisely this that they announced at the news conference as the main topic. Being led by considerations of "political expediency" -- another cliche -- became one of the fundamental principles of our politicians. At their news conference, Videnov and Dimitrov firmly explained that there are differences in the manner in which the two centers view the elections issue. Actually, neither the BSP nor the SDS are ready for early elections in the fall. Furthermore, they do not want the elections. Naturally, it is not advantageous to admit this to the voters nor is it "expedient." Now is not the time for this, as both parties need time. They are absolutely sure that the division in the next parliament will again be between the blue [SDS] and the red [BSP], and the difference will only be in the satellite political formations. This is precisely why the two major parties need time. Forming a new centrist coalition and expanding the constituency of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms -- these are goals whose implementation requires time.
