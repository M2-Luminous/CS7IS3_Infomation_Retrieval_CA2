The dialogue is moving forward and the prospects for resolving the conflict are good. At a news conference, San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz announced the EZLN had presented its list of demands to the federal government's representative, who in turn provided broad answers. Ruiz, however, did not disclose any of the EZLN's specific requests. Meanwhile, Subcommander Marcos explained the reasons for his struggle. He criticized society for having forgotten the Indian community and asked society to remain at the EZLN's side. When his turn came to speak, Commissioner Camacho said the only way to resolve Chiapas' problems is by strengthening the Republic's institutions. He pointed out that a peaceful solution for Chiapas will be found in new answers for the state, not only for the EZLN but for society as a whole.
