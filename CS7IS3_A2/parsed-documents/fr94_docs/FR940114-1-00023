FR940114-1-00023 FR940114-1-00008 Section 2002 of ISTEA, Highway Safety Programs, requires that the uniform guidelines for State Highway Safety Programs include programs: (1) To reduce injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicles being driven in excess of the posted speed limits; (2) to encourage the proper use of occupant protection devices (including the use of safety belts and child restraint systems) by occupants of motor vehicles and to increase public awareness of the benefit of motor vehicles equipped with airbags; (3) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from persons driving motor vehicles while impaired by alcohol or a controlled substance; (4) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from crashes involving motor vehicles and motorcycles; (5) to reduce injuries and deaths resulting from crashes involving school buses; and (6) to improve law enforcement services in motor vehicle accident prevention, traffic supervision, and post-accident procedures. Four of the areas represented by these six guidelines (i.e., Impaired Driving, Occupant Protection, Motorcycle Safety, and Police Traffic Services) have previously been identified as National Priority Program Areas (under 23 CFR part 1205). Other Priority Areas include Emergency Medical Services, Pedestrian/Bicycle Safety, Traffic Records, and Roadway Safety. Although Speed Control and School Bus Safety are not currently Priority Areas, the agencies are now engaged in another rulemaking action and in a separate notice in today's Federal Register are considering whether to amend 23 CFR part 1205 to include Speed Control and/or School Buses as National Priority Program Areas. Further, the Guideline for Pupil Transportation was revised in April of 1991 and needs no further revision at this time. In addition, section 4002 of ISTEA requires that State agencies which receive Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) grants coordinate their respective commercial motor vehicle (CMV) safety enforcement plans with the State highway safety agency (49 CFR 350). FHWA administers the MCSAP. 1 1 Under MCSAP, States conduct uniform inspections of commercial motor vehicles at roadside sites and perform safety reviews of carriers to check for compliance with safety and hazardous materials regulations. Under the ISTEA, MCSAP was expanded to include additional safety activities, such as traffic enforcement, impaired driving initiatives, uniform truck and bus accident reporting, vehicle weight enforcement, training for hazardous materials enforcements, Commercial Drivers License (CDL) enforcement, research and development, public education, and drug interdiction efforts. Information on CMV inspections and crashes is collected by the States and transmitted electronically to FHWA's mainframe through the SAFETYNET system. Since all States have access to SAFETYNET, information on the system can be valuable in identifying problems and improving traffic safety. The agencies encourage States to coordinate their section 402 plans and activities with MCSAP where appropriate in order to maximize benefits to both programs. Proposed Addition of Three New Guidelines The existing 18 Highway Safety Program Guidelines currently address four of the six programs identified in ISTEA; they do not specifically address Speed Control or Occupant Protection. Therefore, the agencies propose to issue two new guidelines: Highway Safety Program Guideline No. 19, Speed Control; and Highway Safety Program Guideline No. 20, Occupant Protection. Though Speed Control has always been a component of the Police Traffic Services Priority Area, it requires special attention in light of the involvement of speed in many traffic crashes. The agencies also intend to take this opportunity to propose issuance of one additional guideline, which would be identified as Highway Safety Program Guideline No. 21, Roadway Safety. The Roadway Safety Guideline is a consolidation of the key aspects of various Guidelines which relate to the roadway. The addition of these new guidelines will result in a formal guideline corresponding to each of the current National Priority Program Areas. Because the vast majority of all highway safety projects funded under title 23 U.S.C. 402 are designed to address one or more of these Priority Program Areas, the existence of corresponding guidelines for each will be of great value to the States and communities in the design and implementation of highway safety programs. Proposed Guideline # 19: Speed Control The issue of speed control has received considerable attention by NHTSA. Over the course of the agency's history, NHTSA has funded and promoted many programs and initiatives addressing the problem. Some common conclusions from these programs and initiatives indicate that higher speeds and speeds too fast for conditions (whether or not travelling in excess of the speed limit) adversely affect the safety of motorists. Historically, Speed Control has not been separately identified as a National Priority Program Area under 23 CFR part 1204. It has, however, been an integral part of the Priority Program Area involving Police Traffic Services, resulting in numerous programs at the State and local levels. In addition, the FHWA, through the MCSAP, supports speed control initiatives as part of an overall traffic enforcement program aimed specifically at commercial motor vehicles. The agencies are currently engaged in rulemaking to add Speed Control as a separate National Priority Program Area. This proposed guideline is written to assist States and communities in the design and implementation of effective Speed Control Programs. The guideline sets forth recommendations for the development and management of effective speed control plans, visible public information and education efforts to gain voluntary compliance, promotion of the use of new technology in the enforcement of speed laws, the establishment of safe and reasonable speed limits, and effective training for police officers involved in speed control.
