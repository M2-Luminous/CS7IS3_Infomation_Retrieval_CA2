FR940405-1-00068 FR940405-1-00013 (c) Indoor Levels of Environmental Tobacco Smoke Constituents. Personal monitoring studies have confirmed the role of the workplace as an important microenvironment of ETS exposure to nonsmokers. Spengler et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;288] and Sexton et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;280] demonstrated by personal monitoring of respirable suspended particulates (RSP) and the use of time-activity questionnaires that exposures to ETS both at home and at work are significant contributors to personal RSP exposures. Coultas et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;66], in a pilot study of 15 nonsmokers in Albuquerque, New Mexico, collected questionnaires and samples of saliva and urine to determine workplace ETS exposure. Personal air samples were obtained pre- and post-workshift. Exposure to ETS was reported by 13 of the 15 subjects. The mean number of hours of exposure was 3.4 ( # 2.1). Basically, although the levels of cotinine, respirable particles, and nicotine varied with self-reports of ETS exposure, the general trend was a direct relationship between increasing incidence of self-reporting of exposure and actual biomarker data. Coghlin, Hammond, and Gann [Ex. 4&hyph;61] found similar results for 53 nonsmoking volunteers studied by use of personal nicotine monitors, diaries, and questionnaires. They also found that the closer a nonsmoker was to a smoker, the higher the probability that the nonsmoker would report exposure. Presently, vapor phase nicotine and respirable suspended particulate matter (ETS&hyph;RSP) are the most commonly used markers for ETS because of their ease of measurement, knowledge of their emission rate from tobacco combustion, and their relationship to other ETS contaminants [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. Controlled experiments have shown that vapor phase nicotine varies with the source strength, and shows little variation among brands of cigarettes. Field studies have also shown that vapor phase nicotine concentrations are correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked, and further that weekly average nicotine concentrations are correlated with ETS-RSP [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. (d) Levels of Respirable Suspended Particulates and Nicotine Found in Field Studies. Respirable suspended particulates (RSP) and nicotine are the most commonly used surrogates for ETS exposure [Ex. 4&hyph;239]. Both chamber and field studies have demonstrated that tobacco combustion has a major impact on indoor RSP mass when particle size is under 2.5 microns [Ex. 4&hyph;239]. A few examples illustrating the impact of ETS on nicotine and RSP concentrations in workplace and domestic microenvironments are shown in Tables III&hyph;10 and III&hyph;11. Studies of RSP in public access buildings by Leaderer et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;190], First [Ex. 4&hyph;105], and Repace and Lowrey [Exs. 4&hyph;260, 4&hyph;261] (a total of 42 smoking buildings and 21 nonsmoking buildings) showed that the weighted average RSP level during smoking in the smoking buildings was 262 μg/m3, while in the nonsmoking buildings the RSP level average 36 μg/m3. Leaderer and Hammond [Ex. 4&hyph;189] measured weekly average vapor phase nicotine and RSP concentrations in 96 residences. Vapor phase nicotine measurements were found to be closely related to number of cigarettes smoked and highly predictive of RSP generated by tobacco combustion. The mean RSP background in the absence of measurable nicotine was found to be 15.2 # 7 μg/m3. The mean RSP value in the presence of nicotine was 44.1 # 30 μg/m3. The weekly mean nicotine concentration in the 47 residences with detectable nicotine values was 2.17 μg/m3 (Table III&hyph;10). Summary statistics of additional studies on personal monitoring for nicotine are shown in Table III&hyph;11 [Ex. 4&hyph;263]. These studies show that the median exposures ranged from 5 to 20 μg/m3. Summary nicotine data analyzed by the U.S. EPA [Ex. 4&hyph;311] suggest that average nicotine values in residences where smoking is occurring will average 2 to approximately 10 μg/m3, with peak values of 0.1 to 14 μg/m3 as shown in Table III&hyph;10. Offices with smoking occupants show a range of average nicotine concentrations similar to that of residences, but with considerably higher peak values. RSP mass concentrations in smoker-occupied residences show average increases of from 18 to 95 μg/m3, with individual increases as high as 560 μg/m3 or as low as 5 μg/m3. ETS&hyph;RSP concentrations in offices with smoking occupants on average appear to be about the same as in residences. Restaurants, transportation, and other indoor spaces with smoking occupants have a generally wider range of increases in particle mass concentrations due to ETS than residential or office environments [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. In summary, field data show that RSP is elevated by one to two orders of magnitude during smoking, and that nicotine released during smoking is easily detectable in both homes and workplaces by area or personal monitors. Offices with smoking occupants show a range of average nicotine concentrations similar to that of residences (2 to 10 μg/m3), but with considerably higher maximum values. ETS&hyph;RSP concentrations in offices with smoking occupants on average appear to be about the same as residences (18 to 95 μg/m3). Restaurants, transportation, and other indoor spaces with smoking occupants have a generally wider range of particle mass concentrations due to ETS than residential or office environments [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. It must be noted that measurements of nicotine and ETS&hyph;RSP in indoor spaces do not constitute a direct measure of total exposure. Concentrations measured in all microenvironments have to be combined with human activity pattern studies to determine the time-weighted sum of various exposures. (e) Biomarkers of Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure. Nicotine, and its metabolite, cotinine, and other tobacco smoke constituents in the saliva, blood and urine have been used as biomarkers of active and passive smoking. Nicotine and cotinine can be used to determine the integrated short-term exposure of ETS across all microenvironments [Ex. 4&hyph;311].
