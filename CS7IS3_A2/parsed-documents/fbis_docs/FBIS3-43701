"The nationalist government and its intelligence and security agencies seem fixated on the right wing and the Pan Africanist Congress, while they ignore far more serious violence orchestrated by the ANC against opponents in the black community," IFP spokesman Dr Ziba Jiyane said in a statement from Durban. He added that any attempt to address violence without taking into account the ANC's role as "a primary player" or excluding other important players was doomed to failure. "The meeting in Pretoria...has no significance at all, except as glitzy window- dressing," said Dr Jiyane. The meeting was clearly meant to create an impression of impartial government and ANC concern about violence, while sanitising one party's role in it, he concluded.
