Is this what we fought for? Why are our neighbors reaping the fruits of market reforms while we are making no headway? Moreover, we are sliding ever closer to economic carnage. Why is Belarus -- whose standard of living was one of the highest in the USSR -- lagging behind our Baltic neighbors and Russia? Production is falling, hopes are expiring.... Professor Vladimir Ivanovich Tarasov, deputy director of the Institute of Economy at the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, is one of those few people who can see a real way out of this predicament. Today, Vladimir Ivanovich Tarasov visited our editorial office. I hope that our interview with him will help some people to differentiate between the "black" and "white" sides of our economy. Some years ago, many residents of Minsk started making "shopping-tours" of Poland and Turkey. Currently, most of them have accumulated the initial capital. The second wave of "shopping- tours" rolled into the Baltics, Moscow, Smolensk, St. Petersburg.... They have literally stripped the Belarusian foodstuffs market. Some of my acquaintances state that Belarus has raised market reforms in Baltic states and Russia with its dairy products... What is your opinion on the issue? [Tarasov] I would support such commercial junkets if our economy was healthy and sound. Why not? Exports which stimulate production are growing.... Our Belarusian "merchants" make profits of around 500,000 rubles [R] on every commercial trip. Nevertheless, given our deficit economy and falling production, these exports will not bring us any good. I would like our merchants to bring back to Belarus some Russian goods, however, they do not do this. They bring Russian rubles and one ruble is worth three or four Belarusian "hares." You see: Money makes money. However, it is not provided with goods produced in Belarus. Next, the twist in the price spiral follows.... The next problem is the trade deficit. It turns out that we import more goods than we export. Nobody has yet calculated this deficit amount. If we could receive precise statistics from our state customs checkpoints and the Belarusian National Bank, we would be able to coordinate the prices for Belarusian goods with the constantly changing prices for imported raw materials and energy. If we had these data, we could realize that constantly increasing prices for energy resources leave our command economy far behind and raise the prices of goods produced in Belarus. The main reason for this is the expansionist economic policy of Russia. Therefore, we should draw some conclusions. First of all, our government should start watching the price policy changes of our neighbors. Do you remember the increase in prices for glassware in the Baltics when the price of one bottle stood at R3 there and 20 kopeks in Belarus? Our neighbors started with bottles and since then have achieved serious economic reforms. [Markina] Maybe our wages and salaries should also be increased, along with prices? [Tarasov] We need a Belarusian currency. Only then we will be able to pursue our own policy in the sphere of price changes. Currently, we do not have a rate for our Belarusian "hare" currency. [Markina] Vladimir Ivanovich, can we expect that everything could be automatically resolved when we join the so-called ruble zone, which had been promised by our government and the Supreme Soviet? [Tarasov] What will this ruble zone look like? That is the question. Russia will hardly agree to the establishment of a 1:1 exchange rate giving the possibility of introducing single prices. Everything could have been different if Belarus were a subject of the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, Belarus is an independent state. Therefore, in my opinion, it is unlikely that Russia will introduce a 1:1 exchange rate. Hence, we should speak not about a single ruble zone but about a currency union. In addition, all the cataclysms of the Russian economy will effect the exchange rate of Belarusian payment notes. By the way, this currency union will not be a novelty in the realm of international economic relations. For example, the Austrian schilling is linked to the German mark. Thus, all changes in the German mark affect the financial sector in Austria. Our government should demonstrate its political will regarding the introduction of our national currency. We have been using Belarusian payment notes for some two years. However, have they become a solid monetary unit? Yes, they are used in payment operations but they do not fulfill another function -- the accumulation of capital. Who saves "hares" in Belarus? People are saving dollars. Sometimes, they are saving Russian rubles. Moreover, Belarusian "hares" are not used in export-import financial operations. This means that "hares" do not fulfill the function of international money. It is evident that we should introduce our own national money. We should not be scared that this will break our relations with Russia. On the contrary, they will become stronger. Pay attention to the fact that Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has already visited Lithuania, which introduced its own currency, but he has never been to Belarus. It is high time for Belarus to take analogous steps. We should not rely on the "kind uncle." To my regret, many people think the opposite. For example, Prime Minister Kebich has visited Valday, where he spoke with Chernomyrdin on increased deliveries of oil to Belarus. However, where is this oil? Currently, the political situation in Russia is extremely unstable. Belarus should conduct talks on all levels, including contacts between government delegations, individual enterprises, and commercial structures. Russia has started creating joint stock companies. We could do the same. Belarus can attract Russian partners. However, we have no favorable conditions for foreign investments. Belarus has hundreds of joint ventures with French, German, and English partners, however, not a single one with Russia. At the same time, our economic potential depends primarily -- 70-80 percent! -- on Russia. We could have no problems with gas if we had joint ventures with Russian oil structures. The Baltic states do not experience any gas shortages due to the fact that Latvian and Lithuanian businessmen have found a common language with Russia. I want to emphasize: Progress is obtained by private initiative. So, we should stimulate our own Belarusian private initiative.
