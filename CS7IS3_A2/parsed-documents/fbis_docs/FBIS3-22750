He said today the government had set aside funds to modernise the armed forces to deter any prospective aggressor. "With the armed forces' improved capabilities, an aggressor will think twice about testing our defence," he added. Najib said this when interviewed on the TV3's inaugural Malaysia Hari Ini [Malaysia Today] morning talk show. He also said the government was reviewing the national defense policy to keep it in line with the changes and challenges facing the armed forces. He said the higher defense spending should not be seen as an attempt by Malaysia to join the arms race. However, this was to keep up with developments in defense technology to ensure the armed forces had modern equipment and for continuous economic development. During the special programme, Najib also answered public enquiries and suggestions through the toll-free telephone lines. To a caller's question, Najib said the armed forces did not plan to include nuclear arms as part of its modernization programme. There was no need for such weapons in the region since the end of the Cold War had removed superpower rivalry in the region, he explained. To another question, Najib said Malaysian troops were safe in Bosnia despite the Serb forces' recent threat to retaliate against the air strike threat by NATO. NATO had threatened to carry out air strikes if the Serb forces did not pull back their heavy guns from the hills around Sarajevo.
