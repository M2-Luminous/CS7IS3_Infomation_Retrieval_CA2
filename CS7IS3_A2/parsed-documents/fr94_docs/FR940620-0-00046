This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic in the immediate vicinity of the event.

Jaczinski, Chief, Boating Affairs Branch, Second Coast Guard District, 1222 Spruce Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63103&hyph;2832. The telephone number is (314) 539&hyph;3971, fax (314) 539&hyph;2685. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are LCDR J.O. Jaczinski, Project Officer, Second Coast Guard District, Boating Safety Division and LT S. Moody, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office. Regulatory History In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impractical. Specifically, the sponsor's late submission of the regatta application left insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in advance of the scheduled event. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation immediately. Background and Purpose The South Sioux Regatta Days consists of a raft race. The event will begin at 10 a.m. and will end at 6 p.m. local time. In order to provide for the safety of spectators and participants, and for the safe passage of through traffic, the Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regulated area. The river will be closed during part or all of the effective period to all vessel traffic except official regatta vessels and patrol craft. These regulations are issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1233 and 33 CFR 100.35. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because of the event's short duration. Federalism Assessment Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment Under section 2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this regulation is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
