The main protagonist in the three calls seems to be Alberto Giraldo, a journalist who has worked for EL SIGLO, LA REPUBLICA, and Radio Super and who gained some notoriety when he was described as the spokesman of Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela in 1987, a few months after the Cali trial, which ended with Gilberto Rodriguez' acquittal in the first public legal proceeding against him for drug trafficking. In the three conversations, the man, who is apparently Giraldo, phones individuals who are apparently the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers to let them know of the efforts he has made with persons close to the Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana campaigns to negotiate a solution to the Rodriguez' case. On each occasion, the person, who has been identified as journalist Alberto Giraldo in different circles, refers to names and to efforts to demand, in each case, a remuneration for serving as a middleman. Conversation One In the first conversation, Giraldo phones someone who seems to be Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela. He asks him about the plane that should pick him up and then explains he has great news. Giraldo tells him he has spoken with Beltz and Maza Marquez [former presidential candidate]. The person speaking with Giraldo, presumably Gilberto Rodriguez, anxiously asks Giraldo about the security of the line they are using and then asks Giraldo why he has not gotten in touch with "Gordo Garcia." Later in the conversation, Rodriguez instructs Giraldo to get in touch with Alvaro Pava, the Conservative senator who owns Radio Super, so he can be brought up to date on the efforts he has made within Andres Pastrana's campaign. At the end of conversation number one, Giraldo explains to Gilberto Rodriguez that he has spoken with Maza Marquez, that things have improved a "heck of a lot" and that the important thing is that they deliver the cash so that, according to what he implies, it can be given to Maza Marquez. Conversation Two In the second conversation, Giraldo does not seem to be talking with Gilberto but with Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. Giraldo begins by complaining to Miguel about several articles that have appeared in the newspaper LA PRENSA, whose director is Juan Carlos Pastrana. According to the complaints, the Pastranas, through LA PRENSA, have accused Giraldo of being the reason why Maza Marquez joined Samper's campaign. Immediately thereafter Giraldo explains to Rodriguez that "Eduardo," who from the context of the conversation would appear to be Eduardo Mestre, urgently needs money and Rodriguez explains that in fact "Eduardo" already sent an envoy to them. The revelation worries Giraldo, who finally asked Rodriguez who the envoy was, to which Rodriguez responded that it was Villegas (during the same conversation he was identified as Cesar Villegas). Both [Giraldo and Villegas] are named in the conversation as alleged intermediaries between the Samper campaign and the Rodriguez Orejuela's. Moreover, the person who is seemingly Miguel Rodriguez reveals that he had also received telephone calls from "Medina" and he asks Giraldo to be calm and discreet and to not discuss this matter with "Eduardo." "Medina," who elsewhere in the conversation is referred to as Santi," seems in reality to be Santiago Medina, Samper's campaign treasurer. Due to the tone of the conversation, the person believed to be Miguel Rodriguez questions his caller regarding the safety of the telephone line and later explains that efforts must be conducted on various fronts. Giraldo insists on the importance of five points, among them several important appointments which, he said, must be guaranteed. Later in the conversation Giraldo asks what he must tell "Medina," and Rodriguez instructs him to explain that the money will be sent in two payments as they had agreed. Further on, Giraldo confirms to Miguel Rodriguez that Samper's victory is in his hands and he denies what appears to be an assertion by "Medina" to the effect that the Santo Domingo Group was prepared to contribute to Samper's campaign all the money it needed. According to Giraldo, the campaign needed 5 billion and has only received 2 billion, apparently from the Santo Domingo Group. Rodriguez explains to Giraldo that the remaining 3 billion are ready and the cartel can deliver them without any difficulties. In response to this assertion, Giraldo complains there was nothing in it for him, to which Rodriguez responds that he is not the candidate nor does he have 47 percent of the vote. Giraldo later insists on receiving a bonus for the efforts he presumably made and Rodriguez tells him that if Samper wins the cartel will give him a bonus. However, he prohibited Giraldo from making separate requests to the two alleged Rodriguez' and two other powerful drug traffickers in Valle. Later, reference is made to Maza's campaign concerning the fact that it was a good thing he only garnered 60,000 of an expected 100,000 votes, adding that therein lies the importance of the [Rodriguez'] efforts. He was apparently referring to 40,000 votes that might go to Samper. To conclude, they discussed "Eduardo," apparently Eduardo Mestre Sarmiento, and Villegas; Rodriguez complained of the meager results that usually characterize efforts with "Eduardo" and Giraldo tells him that "Eduardo" had already met with the two top men of the campaign and that what matters is the existence of an agreement that will be fulfilled.
