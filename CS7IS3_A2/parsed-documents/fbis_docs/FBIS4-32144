Hazer Hajzeraj, who, according to the indictment, was "the minister" in "the ministry," was heard first before the court council. Hajzeraj, who had for a long time been deputy defense secretary and the commander of the civil defense in the Kosovo province, did not admit to being the minister, claiming that he had never organized "a defense ministry" or any similar association. He confirmed that he had had contacts with Fehmi Agani and Anton Koljaj, the leaders of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo [DSK], but he justified this by saying that the meetings had been "informal and not specially organized" and that they had simply exchanged opinions on the situation in Kosovo. He also said that he had not advocated the secession of Kosovo from Serbia and Yugoslavia, explaining that the "autonomy of Kosovo" was his position. "I am aware that there is already one army in Kosovo and that there is no room for two armies here", Hajzeraj said. Asked by the prosecutor to explain his contacts and meetings with the self-declared Kosovo prime minister in exile, Bujar Bukosi, Hajzeraj admitted that they had met three times in Albania and Germany. They discussed, as he said, "only how to protect the population and property." He gave a similar explanation of his meetings with DSK deputy president Anton Koljaj, who is in charge of defense issues in Rugova's party, and admitted that his "expert assistance" had been required. However, he did admit to having received certain amounts of money in German marks, but explained that this was "help for the Albanians sacked from work." [passage omitted] The trial resumes tomorrow, when the other accused are expected to be heard.
