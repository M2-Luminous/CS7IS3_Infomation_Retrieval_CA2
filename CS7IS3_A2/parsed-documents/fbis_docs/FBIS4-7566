The Hungarian Government -- in accord with European Union recommendations for water division, which were rejected by Slovakia -- calls upon the Slovak Government to open bilateral talks on a temporary water management regime immediately, the ministry's press department informed MTI on Wednesday [30 March]. The Slovak side unilaterally diverted the Danube in 1992, to operate the Gabcikovo power station. Since then, the main riverbed has been supplied with much less water than before, endangering the ecological balance of the Szigetkoz region. The negotiations are urgent because the vegetation growth period has already begun. The talks are also justified by obligations which the two sides assumed in a Separate Treaty concluded in connection with The Hague trial. Hungary's government stressed in the communique that it is indispensable to guarantee a considerable increase in the water discharge to the main riverbed.
