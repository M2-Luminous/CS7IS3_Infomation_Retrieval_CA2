It reflected topical matters of Russia's development, consolidation of the state and all its institutions, stregthening of law and order in Russia", Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's Choice parliamentary faction, said on Thursday. He spoke at the colloquium "The future of reform in Russia" held in St. Augustin, Germany. The colloquium was organised by the Konrad Adenauer foundation close to the Christian Democratic Union. The Russian president could have spoken more definitely on economic matters, believes Georgiy Zadonskiy, influential deputy of the State Duma. "I followed closely Boris Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly. I believe it has not set out a firm economic course", he told ITAR-TASS. "This can be used both for continuing the deepening of reform and for trying to consolidate the power of bureaucrats which the president mentioned". Zadonskiy said he has no sense that the president and the government have adopted a common stand for adjusting reforms. He believes Yeltsin remains on positions of reform, but vagueness on matters of state regulation of the economy is quite dangerous. "The president's message to parliament leaves an ambiguous impression", said chairman of the communists faction in the State Duma, Gennadiy Zyuganov. Nevertheless he welcomes Yeltsin's ideas for the consolidation of statehood and separation of powers between subjects of the federation. Zyuganov told ITAR-TASS that the meeting between the head of state and parliament on Thursday "looked like a dialogue". He said the report did not have signs of the search of an enemy. Quite the contrary, it was an attempt to rally forces for the sake of normalisation and reconciliation. Zyuganov still believes the Russian Federation will be unable to cope with any of its problems unless there is a renewed union. From this viewpoint he approves of the fact that the president attaches priority to the strengthening of ties within the Commonwealth of Independent States. Zyuganov again deplored the fact that Russian leaders had not set themselves this task earlier, in the framework of the union.
