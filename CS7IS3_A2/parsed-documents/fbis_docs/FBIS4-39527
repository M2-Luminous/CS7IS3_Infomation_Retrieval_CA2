To use this territory in the interests of the rayon, mine clearing, and land improvement should be carried out, and the housing of the small garrison should be repaired. The rayon executive committee addressed the command staff of this unit and the Belarusian Defense Ministry asking for help. However, foreign servicemen refuse to perform this work. Therefore, the rayon executive committee addressed the Mogilev Oblast Executive Committee to plead with the Belarusian Government to resolve this issue on an intergovernmental level.
