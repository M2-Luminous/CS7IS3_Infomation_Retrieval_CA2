Luan Shaholli, chairman of the PS Management Committee for Tirana, commenting on the police's negative response to the rally planned for today, hoped that the Constitutional Court will now issue a pronouncement on the "repeated violations of the law by the police." Thus, on the day before the trial of Fatos Nano, a day that the PS Management Committee has declared "a day of nationwide protest against violations of basic human rights and freedom," the party's leaders are obliged to issue an appeal not to organize "illegal activities." Nonetheless, "we will continue to demand permits for rallies, even though we have hitherto been given arbitrary refusals," PS Deputy Chairman Servet Pellumbi said. Meanwhile, the Public Order Ministry issued a statement the day before yesterday laying particular stress on incitements to illegal assemblies just before the Nano trial and warning that it "will use the force of the law against anyone who attempts to exert pressure against Albanian justice." The public announcement of today's gathering in Skenderbeg Square first appeared in the pages of the Socialist newspaper ZERI I POPPULIT. However, the PS leaders say that the replies from the Public Order Ministry and from the capital city's First and Second Police Commissariats refusing permission for this rally came on Tuesday [2 March]. "Concerning the 4 March rally, we will act according to the law," Luan Shahollari told GAZETA SHQIPTARE, "but we will also denounce these negative replies in our press." According to Shahollari, the publication of the negative replies from the police would be more than enough to contact the people who had earlier been informed about the rally to be held in Skenderbeg Square. Meanwhile, PS Deputy Chairman Servet Pellumbi said that people interested in the rally would in the normal course of events realize that permission for it had been refused because "the rally can only take place if the people organizing it appear and make their speeches." Pellumbi said that requests to hold this rally will be repeated every day, regardless of refusals, but he again appealed, "Our guideline is to always behave in accordance with the law, thus avoiding all kinds of confrontation. While the police have now refused permission for the rally in Tirana, PS management comittees in many other districts have asked for identical rallies in their respective towns. "As the PS Management Committee decided," Pellumbi said, "almost all districts have made requests to hold peaceful assemblies, but we still have not been informed in which towns they have been approved." Meanwhile, the Public Order Ministry spokesman has denounced the PS and its newspaper for "continually issuing calls for and inciting illegal assemblies on the threshold of the trials of Fatos Nano, Ramiz Alia, and the other blockmen [former Albanian Workers Party leadership]." The Public Order Ministry had meanwhile guaranteed order, calm, and stability to the judiciary in its work, also warning that "All those breaking the law will answer to the law, whoever they may be."
