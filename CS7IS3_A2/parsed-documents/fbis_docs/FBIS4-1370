Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama has alleged that there is a secret accord between the Mozambican Government and neighboring countries concerning the participation of foreign nationals in the elections. Efforts to convince the Renamo leader, who made the accusation, to identify those countries have been in vain. He simply said those letters had been sent two weeks ago. Dhlakama told NOTICIAS that Renamo "had concluded that there was already a secret accord between the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and the neighboring countries, whereby those countries would send their citizens to vote for the Frelimo Party. We, in Renamo, know which countries those are because, in the past, Frelimo also sent Mozambicans to vote in favor of certain southern African leaders." We asked the Renamo leader whether he was talking about South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zambia. He replied: "Yes, some of those countries." The Renamo leader also disclosed that the recent Renamo congress had decided that "our people should get in touch with those countries to make them see that the war is over. However much ideological sympathy there may be for Frelimo in those countries, it is important in southern Africa at this stage that we make every effort to create economic development, forget the past, and enjoy good relations with the neighboring countries." Asked about how the census would be conducted to allow foreigners to participate in the country's elections, Dhlakama answered that it would be "very simple, because there are many Mozambican refugees in those countries and it is easy for foreigners to come in with them on their return. What is more, many border posts have been reopened along the borders, where in the past there used to be none. Today, Frelimo is opening them up, thereby making it easier for aliens to come in illegally and take part in elections. It is possible that the [census] teams could discover they are foreigners during the census, but this is not a plan that Frelimo is just following blindly. It is part of a strategy intended to fool even the census teams." The Renamo leader said he believed that the letters "making the accusation official," the governments of those countries "may desist from their plans to send their citizens in to vote in favor of Frelimo." [sentence as printed] Afonso Dhlakama reiterated his accusation that the government is sending youths to some southern African countries "where they are being trained to attack Renamo when it is in power." He refused to give details but stressed that Renamo is committed to "diplomatic action to explain the reality of the Mozambican peace process to those countries and to make it clear that Renamo does not want war any more." Similar accusations had already been made by Renamo General Mateus Ngonhamo, but they have been proven groundless. NOTICIAS approached some African embassies in Maputo in connection with Afonso Dhlakama's allegations, but they said they knew nothing about them.
