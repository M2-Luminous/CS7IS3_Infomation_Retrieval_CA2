FBIS4-30866 "dreeu105_d_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 SLOVAKIA No-Confidence Vote Shows `Cracks' in Coalition No-Confidence Vote Shows `Cracks' in Coalition AU3005133794 AU3005133794 BFN [Editorial Report] Bratislava SME in Slovak on 27 May on pages 1 and 2 carries a 1,000-word "bog, jam"-signed report on the 26 May meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR], most of which was taken up by the debate on a no-confidence motion in Milan Janicina, minister for the administration and privatization of national property, which had been initiated by opposition deputies. According to the SME report, "in a secret ballot, NRSR deputies decided not to express no-confidence in Minister Milan Janicina. Of the 144 ballots cast, 139 were valid. A total of 71 deputies voted in favor of the vote of no-confidence being passed, 65 deputies were against, and 3 abstained. A total of 76 votes would have been necessary for the vote of no-confidence to be passed." On the same day, on page 2, Bratislava SME in Slovak carries a 400-word interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], by Maria Hluchanova entitled "We Simply Harmonized Coalition Views." As the interviewer points out, the fact that 71 deputies were in favor of Janicina's dismissal "raised doubts in the NRSR lobbies about the SDL deputies' support for Milan Janicina in the secret ballot." She therefore asks Weiss "to confirm or deny conjectures that part of the SDL Club of Deputies had voted for Janicina's dismissal." Weiss replies: "All kinds of things can be heard in parliamentary lobbies, including that the dismissal was supported by a part of Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, Coexistence, and centrist deputies. The voting was secret and engaging in speculation is pointless. It has never been customary in our Club of Deputies to look one's colleagues over the shoulder. The SDL Club of Deputies decided to vote against Milan Janicina's dismissal." Weiss emphasizes that "the SDL is interested in the coalition working and in all debates about privatization being conducted on an expert level and not on an ideological level." He also confirms that coalition talks were held prior to the vote on Minister Janicina, at which the coalition partners "harmonized coalition views" on the issue. Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 27 May on page 2, under the headline "Cracks in Coalition?," carries a series of brief interviews with representatives of coalition parties, totalling 350- words, on their voting on Minister Janicina. The interviews are preceded by the following introduction: "The outcome of the secret ballot on trust in Minister Milan Janicina (National Democratic Party) revealed that some coalition deputies had supported the opposition's call for his dismissal. In this context, we asked coalition partners whether this problem would be taken up by the Coalition Council and whether they can rule out that their own deputies had supported the no-confidence vote in the minister of privatization." In their brief replies, all interviewees voice the conviction that their own deputies had not violated the agreement to support Janicina. They agree, however, that it would be pointless to raise this issue within the framework of the coalition because it is impossible to ascertain how individual deputies had actually voted.
