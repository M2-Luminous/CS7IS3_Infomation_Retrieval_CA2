FR940826-1-00074 FR940826-1-00009 59. Finally, we are concerned that there are companies that would be eligible for an entrepreneurs' block license that may desire larger license areas than MTAs and BTAs. It appears that over half of the bidders in the nationwide auction would have qualified for an entrepreneurs' block license. As a result, we propose to redesignate the two BTA licenses as regional licenses organized in the same configuration set forth in section 24.102 of the rules. Doing so would give designated entities an opportunity to bid on a larger and more valuable license under the rules for entrepreneurs' blocks. We also seek comment on other means to achieve larger geographic license sizes such as designating these BTA licenses as nationwide licenses or by maintaining the BTA designation, but allowing combinatorial bidding for the designated regions. Commenters should also address the appropriate premium we should adopt for comparison of combinatorial and BTA license bids if we allow combinatorial bidding. We also seek comment on whether some of the MTA and BTA response channels should be redesignated as larger license areas with bidding limited only to those entities eligible to bid for entrepreneurs' block licenses. II. Procedural Matters and Ordering Clause A. Further Notice_Initial Analysis 60. Reason for the Action. The purpose of the Further Notice is to implement competitive bidding rules and regulations rules consistent with the Commission's competitive bidding authority that will carry out the statutory mandates that certain designated entities, including small entities, are afforded an opportunity to participate in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. 61. Objectives of this Action. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the subsequent Commission actions to implement it are intended to establish a system of competitive bidding for choosing among certain applications for initial licenses, and will carry out statutory mandates that certain designated entities, including small entities, are afforded an opportunity to participate in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of narrowband PCS services. 62. Legal Basis. Authority for the Further Notice can be found in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and in Sections 2(a), 4(i) 303(r), 309(i) and 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§152(a), 154(i), 303(r), 309(i) and 309(j). 63. Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements. The proposals under consideration in this Further Notice include the possibility of new reporting and recordkeeping requirements for a number of small business entities. 64. Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules. None. 65. Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved. The rule changes proposed in this Further Notice could effect smaller entities if they have mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses or permits for narrowband PCS licenses. The Further Notice proposes to establish certain narrowband PCS spectrum blocks for bidding exclusively by smaller entities and to provide installment payments and bidding credits to certain eligible entities within those blocks. 66. Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent with the Stated Objectives. The Further Notice proposes certain provisions for smaller entities designed to ensure that such entities have the opportunity to participate in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of narrowband PCS services.
