[Begin recording] [Magnet] I cannot disclose anything because sessions are secret, it was the sessions of the... [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] But did you submit a report? Can you tell us about that? [Magnet] I was invited to the session. [Reporter] What is the current status of the agreements between Chile and Peru on the Lima Convention? [Magnet] The meetings have been suspended. A decision has been made to wait. [end recording] The ambassador said this after attending a meeting that was presided over by Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma. The talks on the Lima Convention were on the meeting's agenda. The Lima Convention, which was signed on 11 May 1993, seeks to resolve matters that are pending from the 1929 Treaty, and includes the construction by Chile of facilities at the port of Arica. Chilean representatives at the talks (Luis Vinter) and (Eduardo Biogrossi) read briefings during the closed-door session. Members of the foreign affairs committee of the Chamber of Deputies also attended. Committee Chairman Jorge Pizarro said that the Chamber of Deputies agreed that the Lima Convention must be ratified in its entirety, the way it was approved by the Chilean Senate. Deputy Teodoro Ribera commented on specific topics. [Begin recording] [Ribera] We believe we should wait until the El Chinchorro issue is resolved through one of the agreements signed in Lima. If that cannot be implemented, however, Chile should obviously resort to the powers granted by the law and the Constitution to resolve Arica's urban problem. The state should thus use its powers as it would with any private party, be it an individual or a corporation. [Unidentified reporter] Will the Chilean Government pay compensation for the land that we have occupied in El Chinchorro. [Ribera] Without doubt. We are not speaking here... [changes pattern] Chile always pays compensation for expropriations. A fair price that will be negotiated, and if there is no agreement, the price will be decided by a judge. It is not a matter of expropriating without paying compensation. We will simply implement the powers granted to the Revenue Department and to the Chilean State under Articles 19 and 24 of the Constitution, which establish expropriation for reasons of public need. [end recording] The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies decided to suspend a visit to Lima to meet its Peruvian peers, because of the recess in the Peruvian Constituent Congress.
