It was considered a difficult process. Desired three dimensional shapes are formed by first mixing ceramic or metal fine powders with photosenstive liquid polymers, irradiating laser beams for solidification, and then heating to evaporate the polymers. With wider selection of materials and structures, much more flexible designs and manufacturing can be available for micro machines, thus its R&D is expected to make a big boost. The new technology employs the `photoforming method.' Ceramic or metal powders are mixed as much as possible with ultraviolet sensitive liguid polymers. Then, optical beam is irradiated using the design measurement data of the parts intended for production. The laser beam is irradiated through the glass window located at the bottom of the container to solidify the mixture in the small space between the substrate, which is immersed in the liquid, and the bottom of the container. When the solidification takes place as the substrate is being pulled up slowly, the desired three dimensional parts containing plastics are built. When heated at 300-500� C, the plastic evaporates, leaving the metal or ceramics behind. Then it is sintered at high temperatures of above 1000� C. The research group conducted an experiment by mixing 2 kinds (averaging 0.25 microns and 3 microns in particle diameter) of oxide aluminum powders with ultraviolet sensitive polymer and irradiating helium/cadmium laser beams for solidification. At the time of mixing, ultrasonic vibration was applied for the liquid mixture for several hours, so that oxide aluminum will avoid coagulation and be evenly dispersed in the polymer. As a result, they discovered that the smaller the particle sizes are and the more the amount of oxide aluminum is contained in the liquid mixture before irradiation, the higher the viscosity. Laser beam irradiation produced the parts with high precision-only a few microns discrepencies. The research group will acquire the optimum processing condition based on the basic data collected through these experiments, so that they can evaporate polymers and start producing ceramic or metal micro parts for actual use. Production of Micro Machine Parts Using Composite Materials [Commentary] The new technology is quite useful for the production of micro parts by improving conventional methods. However, there are still problems to be overcome before it proves to be practically useful. Parts for micro machines were at first produced using silicon substrates, a part of the semiconductor processing technology. Gears and motors were produced instead of transistors, but those parts had to be flat. Later, the LIGA process using x-ray which has shorter wave length than ultraviolet for the light source was introduced, theyreby the depth of the structure of the parts was much improved. However, this method also was limitted to use light exposure for producing parts, therefore, it was difficult to build perfectly three dimensional structures. The photoforming method is free of such limitation and able to produce combination of multiple parts all at once. R&D on this method is at present actively under way. Due to the base material of plastics, it was considered impossible to make ceramic or metal parts which are superior in strength and resistance. The new technology can use either plastic, metal, or ceramics and has an advantage of being able to use the photoforming method. Research on evaporation of polymers out of the solidified parts will continue, focusing on the heating condition and the parts design in order to accomplish high precision measurement. Actually, evaporation of the polymers is not necessarily required. Polymer ceramic or polymer metal composite materials, which are much stronger than pure plastic parts, can be adequately useful.
