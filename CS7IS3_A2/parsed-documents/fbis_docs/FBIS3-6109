When he took office, Kim Yong-sam made a noisy advertisement as if he would bring something like "reforms" and "changes", but nothing has changed, the analyst says, and continues: He has only inherited the ruling system of the preceding dictators, more harshly suppressed the people with physical strength and made all social evils prevail. The Kim Yong-sam group is now deeply vexed, expressing "regret" at the report of the Amnesty International noting that the human rights situation has not improved in South Korea. The denunciation of the Kim Yong-sam group by the international community is a result of its crimes. It deserves that. The Kim Yong-sam clique must step down before it faces greater denunciation from the South Korean people and the international community.
