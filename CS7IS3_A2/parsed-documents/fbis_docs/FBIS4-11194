The elections, which began at 0700 (1300 GMT), were characterized by voter apathy and low turnout, the extent of which has not yet been estimated. The TSE called upon all 2.7 million citizens eligible to vote to do so and installed 381 voting centers in 262 municipalities throughout the entire country. Once the polling stations closed, the TSE immediately began receiving the vote count certificates at the official vote counting center located in a luxury hotel in San Salvador. The TSE authorities announced this afternoon that the first preliminary report will be announced after 30 percent of the votes cast are counted.
