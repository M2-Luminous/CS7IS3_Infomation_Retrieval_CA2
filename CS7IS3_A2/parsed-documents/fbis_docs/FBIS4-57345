One of these banks has a $1 billion portfolio of investments, of which $700 million comes from abroad. The decision follows a combination of two factors: The lead in the polls by PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and his statements during his meetings with bankers and investors in the United States. The comments by Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (PT-SP) [Sao Paulo], who is considered to be one of the mentors of the PT economic policy, confirm investors' perception that Lula will head for a closed, government-controlled, economy with restrictions on foreign capital. The decision to begin withdrawing money now from the country is strategic. Investors believed they would not have to worry about the subject until September, just before the first voting round of the presidential elections (3 October). They initially planned to withdraw the money between the first and second voting round. The banks decided to move now given Lula's lead among voter preference. A good portion of foreign investments is applied in the stock exchange. If investors decide to sell en masse there will be big losses because prices will drop considerably. Those who believe Lula will win the elections decided to start pulling out now, without panic and taking advantage of the good market quotations.
