As your side knows, at the 11 April joint meeting of the government, parties, and public organizations of the DPRK, our side proposed convening a national meeting -- in which representatives of the authorities, parties, and organizations and individuals in the North and South will attend -- on the occasion of the upcoming 15 August [anniversary of liberation from Japan], a year before the 50th anniversary of national liberation. As an immediate measure to successfully hold this meeting, our side proposed forming a national meeting preparatory committee composed of five representatives each from the North and South and overseas and holding the first [preparatory committee] meeting in Pyongyang or Seoul sometime in May. Our side has sent the letter containing this proposal to your authorities and persons concerned in South Korea via international mail because we could not send the letter containing this proposal through Panmunjom. Our historic proposal for convening a national meeting was advanced out of a single patriotic desire to resolve prevailing difficulties, ensure peace in the country, and hasten reunification in the nineties on the united strength of the nation. Our proposal for convening a national meeting wins greater support and sympathy from people from all walks of life in the North and South and abroad as time goes by because it is reasonable and realistic. We acknowledge that your authorities have no reason not to accept the proposal for convening a national meeting, which all fellow countrymen hope for. If the historic national meeting is convened, its convening itself will open a new stage of reconciliation and unity. We will be able to seek a joint way to realize the country's peace and reunification while opening each other's mind and achieving the grand national unity through candid [kitanopnun] consultations. One should now throw away the idea of confrontation, with which one has shown unconditional opposition to a proposal, because it has been put forth by the other side. It is time that one should open the way out for the nation through joint efforts while sincerely accepting a proposal--if it is conducive to the country's peace and reunification--even if it is not one's own proposal. We expect that your authorities will keep in step with us by selecting at an early date the South side's delegates to the preparatory committee for the national meeting as well as showing a positive response to the proposal for convening the national meeting. Also, availing ourselves of this opportunity, we are informing you that the consultative meeting of representatives of the DPRK Government, parties, and social organizations, which has been held now, selected as the North side's delegates to the preparatory committee for the national meeting Chong Mun-san, director of the Secretariat of the DPRK State Administration Council; Kim Yong-ho, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party; Paek Nam-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Fatherland; Kim Yong- nam, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea; and Kang Yong-sop, vice chairman of the Korean Religionists Council and chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Christians Federation.
