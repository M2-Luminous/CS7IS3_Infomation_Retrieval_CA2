Reform means that we shall speed up reforms according to the decision adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in order to set up the framework of the socialist market economic structure; development means that we shall maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the national economy; while maintaining social and political stability is the major foundation for reform and development. Correctly handling the relationships between reform, development, and stability will ensure the healthy development of the socialist cause with Chinese characteritics. In the field of economic development in 1994, we still need to promptly adjust the intensity of macro-control, properly control the size of capital construction, the size of credit, and the momentum of inflation. In the action of macro-control in 1993, it was impossible to solve all the problems arising in the process of high-speed economic growth since 1992. The macro-control measures in 1993 curbed inflation and restrained the excessively growing size of capital construction and credit and the excessive monetary input in some sectors, but the problems were not thoroughly solved in the investment and banking systems. Now, the size of capital construction is still too large, and the belated effects of the excessive monetary input will continue to arise in 1994. It will take time to overcome such belated effects. That is to say, the macro-control tasks in 1993 have not been completed fulfilled, and the economy has not effected the "landing." Therefore, in 1994, we shall continue to work for the "soft landing" in order to ensure the economy's healthy development and to prevent losses caused by violent ups and downs. Now, the size of the ongoing construction projects throughout the country is much greater than that in 1991, and one third of such large-scale construction is supported by bank loans. If such a large amount of capital construction is to be completed, it will require excessive monetary input. How then can the economy endure all this? Therefore, it is necessary to actually cut down on the size of capital construction. In 1993, the party Central Committee and the State Council did not adopt administrative measures to order all localities to cut down on construction projects; instead, they mainly relied on measures for strengthening and improving macro- control measures. In 1994, such practice will continue. All localities should make adjustments according to their own conditions, and should really cut down on the excessively expanded amount of capital construction. Over more than 10 years, China's economic development has repeatedly proved that out-of-control capital construction is always the beginning of the out-of-control economic aggregate, in which aggregate demand substantially exceeds aggregate supply. Therefore, it is of great importance to reform the whole economic structure, including the investment structure, to form an investment mechanism that may properly exercise self-control. In 1994, the pace of reform will be speeded up, and this also reflects the necessity of such reform. In the process of forming the new investment structure, the steps for strengthening and improving macro-control, promptly adjusting the intensity of such control, and promoting the improvement of the economic structure and the enhancement of the economic efficiency are all extremely important points in the 1994 economic work. China is a large country. Any slight action of construction in villages or factories may bring about a tremendous demand on material and fund input for capital construction, and the swelling size of investment will inevitably strain the supply of raw materials and bid up their prices. Take steel products as an example. In early 1993, its price was 1,600-1,800 yuan per tonne; later, it increased to over 4,000 yuan; after the macro-control measures were adopted in July and August, it declined to a level below 3,000 yuan; but it is rising again. The upwward tendency of the steel and cement prices will bring about chain effects. This shows that it is a critical link to control the amount of capital construction in the efforts to curb the price increases. Of course, this does not mean that no investment will be made in capital construction. Necessary capital construction remains a major means of maintaining the lasting momentum of economic development. What we should do is to keep construction at an appropriate size. Good things cannot be accomplished overnight or even in one single year. The structure must be rationalized in the orientation of strengthening the basic industries. Priority should still be given to such basic industries and infrastructural facilities as agriculture, transportation, communications, and energy production so the "bottleneck" effects of these industries which are relatively lagging behind may be removed. As for the development of real estate, especially the construction of high-class hotels, office buildings, luxurious villas, and holiday resorts, its scale must be resolutely cut down. The speed of economic growth should be appropriate; the amount of capital construction should be appropriate. These are major conditions for the smooth process of reform and also major conditions for maintaining social stability. We must be very prudent on this point.
