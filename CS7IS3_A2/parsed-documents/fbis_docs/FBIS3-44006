This follows a recent threat by the RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels of Foday Sankoh to infiltrate the town, and bearing in mind that the rebels launched an attack just 80 miles from the town itself not so long ago, the authorities are taking the threat very seriously. Victor Silver has been in Kenema. He is now back in Freetown from where he sent this report: [read by announcer] Green tents have started dotting the Kenema township landscape as part of operation keep Kenema safe. The authorities have decided to take no chances. At six key points across town, tents are manned by both military and police personnel drawn from different sections of the two forces. Two days ago, an offer from members of the region's civil defense unit, known as Kamajowas or local hunters, to assist in the operation was accepted. Telephone hot lines to report any suspicious circumstances have not yet been established as in the capital, Freetown, but mobile and static patrols work on a 24-hour basis. One top security officer told me that the emphasis is first to stop rebel-attempted infiltration. Secondly, to ensure that all soldiers are usefully engaged and, thirdly, to reduce the crime rate in Kenema town and its environs. Given the recent spate of rebel attacks which came as close as 18 miles to the town, it would appear that the residents are taking nothing for granted. They remember the Kono takeover in 1990-92 and they form themselves into defense units to combat any potential rebel threat. Life in Kenema is pretty normal, business is as usual but you have to be close to the security network to know that the military has thrown a ring of steel around the township as government forces go into operation in an area still occupied by rebels. One commander told me that the continued occupation of (Noma Farmer) area by rebels was his continuous nightmare and he predicted that once they were flushed from this area, the rebels would have no base in Sierra Leone. How soon this might be, he didn't say, but he believed the morale of government troops was very high and he said that even six soldiers are volunteering for frontline service.
