This confirms that a bargain has been struck: The former Bank of Italy governor can now start training to jog his way up to the Quirinale [President's Palace]. On the other hand, Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office] would now open its doors to [IRI (Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) President] Romano Prodi. This changeover is expected to take place after the 27 March elections -- Sisde [scandal allowing. It is the voters who will indicate the timing and the way in which it is carried out. The coupling of the two politicians is indissolubly linked to the vote. In order for it to be possible, the progressives must win. However, they must win with a percentage that forces them to join forces with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian People's Party (PPI) secretary Mino] Martinazzoli. Basically, this you-scratch-my-back-I'll-scratch-yours arrangement looks set to be the ideal result of an agreement between left-wing forces and Mino [Martinazzoli] and Mariotto [Segni's] centrists: a left-wing Catholic -- Prodi -- for prime minister, and a personality capable of vouching politically for the PDS for seven long years -- Ciampi -- as head of state. Is this political fiction? In order to explain the maneuvering currently under way, we must start with [PDS Secretary] Occhetto. Together with PDS Deputy Secretary Massimo D'Alema, the PDS secretary has become a TV globetrotter. Massimo paid a visit to [Fininvest talk show host] Costanzo, and Achille [Occhetto] hurried off to be [Fininvest talk show host] Funari's guest. D'Alema also payed Funari a visit, and Occhetto evened the score by meeting [RAI talk show host] Minoli. Fair enough, the tandem is faced with the task of explaining, to millions of Italians, the difference between "being under investigation" and "being reported." However, it was precisely in the course of the political and judiciary tour that Occhetto, in response to a question, said: "For us, Ciampi is a reserve of democracy." At first, everybody considered Carlo Azeglio a dignified reserve player for the Palazzo Chigi, where he already occupies a seat anyway. This hypothesis is becoming increasingly improbable. Ciampi could continue to be prime minister if the progressives were to win massive support in the elections. Basically, the former governor would remain at the head of the new government for a few months, long enough to make Italians digest the victory of the former communists, in order to then pass on command directly to Occhetto. However, judging from the opinion polls, it is unlikely that the left forces will win more than 40 percent of the vote. Assuming the coalition made up by [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, [League leader] Bossi, and [National Alliance Secretary] Fini does not achieve more than 50 percent, the PDS will be forced to seek the support of the Center's survivors -- Martinazzoli and Mariotto -- in order to be able to govern. This is, in fact, the objective of the plan which many are engaged in putting together behind the scenes: Prodi thrown in the bargain to keep the People's Party happy, and ferry-man Ciampi providing the maximum guarantee for the PDS. There is no lack of small and large signals pointing to the resurrection of the accord between the Catholics and the PDS. A case in point is the appointment of Mario Sarcinelli to head the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which was welcomed by Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] and even sponsored by the PDS, just as Renato Riverso's upcoming nomination as chairman of the national airline company Alitalia. Riverso is favored by Ciampi and Prodi. The latter would also be getting ready to wipe the slate clean at the STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company] by replacing Chairman Biagio Agnes and Managing Director Michele Tedeschi. Are these purely coincidental occurrences, or rather a foretaste of what may happen after 27 March? In order to steer to the Left, Occhetto has no alternative but to establish a link between the Palazzo Chigi and the Quirinale issues. The Sisde storm is not abating, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the progressives to defend Scalfaro in an official capacity. But, if it wins, the PDS, must not "scare off" moderate voters by choosing a head of state -- such as Borrelli, the head of the Milan Public Prosecutor's office or, even less, Rete member Capponnetto -- who might -- admittedly for very different reasons -- appear to be partisan, just to mention two of the names currently being mentioned at the Quirinale. Paradoxically, Ciampi would ensure innovation within a framework of continuity, having already headed the government and being very reliable, in the estimation of Occhetto's party. The rest of the Catholic-progressive team would include [lower house Speaker] Giorgio Napolitano as foreign minister, [Anti-Mafia Commission Chairman] Luciano Violante as interior minister, Massimo D'Alema as defense minister, [Budget Minister] Luigi Spaventa as budget minister, and [PDS financial affairs spokesman] Vincenzo Visco to deal with the problems of the economy. In order to show its democratic goodwill, the PDS would also take [Labor Minister] Gino Giugni on board as labor minister, [Civil Service Minister] Sabino Cassese as head of the civil service, and [former judge] Giuseppe Ayala as justice minister. That, more or less, is the Left's shadow cabinet, which would obviously give Green Party Coordinator Carlo Ripa di Meana the environment portfolio. Of course, at the height of the electoral campaign none of those involved will be willing to confirm that they are aiming for the various ministries, much less for the Palazzo Chigi or the Quirinale. Ciampi was still saying that he is to stay out of the fray. Quite, but only if the moderate front carries the day.
