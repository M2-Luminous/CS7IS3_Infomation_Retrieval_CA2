ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined that USS SQUALL (PC 7), USS ZEPHYR (PC 8), USS CHINOOK (PC 9), USS FIREBOLT (PC 10), USS WHIRLWIND (PC 11), USS THUNDERBOLT (PC 12), USS SHAMAL (PC 13) are vessels of the Navy which, due to their special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with their special functions as naval patrol vessels. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Captain R.R. Rossi, JAGC, U.S. Navy, Admiralty Counsel, Office of the Judge Advocate General, Navy Department, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332&hyph;2400, Telephone number: (703) 325&hyph;9744. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR part 706. This amendment provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy, has certified that USS SQUALL (PC 7), USS ZEPHYR (PC 8), USS CHINOOK (PC 9), USS FIREBOLT (PC 10), USS WHIRLWIND (PC 11), USS THUNDERBOLT (PC 12), USS SHAMAL (PC 13) are vessels of the Navy which, due to their special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with 72 COLREGS, Rule 23(a)(ii), pertaining to display of a masthead light and a second (after) masthead light on vessels exceeding 50 meters in length; Annex I, paragraph 2(k), pertaining to the vertical distance between the forward and after anchor lights and the height of the forward anchor light above the hull; Rule 21(c), pertaining to location of the sternlight, without interfering with their special functions as naval patrol vessels. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy has also certified that the number of masthead lights displayed and the location of the other mentioned lights are in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements. Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR Parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based on technical findings that the number and placement of lights on USS SQUALL (PC 7), USS ZEPHYR (PC 8), USS CHINOOK (PC 9), USS FIREBOLT (PC 10), USS WHIRLWIND (PC 11), USS THUNDERBOLT (PC 12), USS SHAMAL (PC 13) in a manner differently from that prescribed herein will adversely affect the vessels ability to perform their military functions.
