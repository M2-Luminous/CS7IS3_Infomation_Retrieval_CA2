As far as the efforts to satisfy disabled people's subsistence needs are concerned, he said, our goal is to narrow the gap between the standard of services for the disabled and the economic and social development level, to give the disabled more opportunities for social involvement and to expand the scope of involvement, to enable them to achieve self-improvement, and to improve their living conditions. Deng Pufang specified this general goal as follows: --To solve the problems regarding the supply of sufficient food and clothing to the disabled. --To raise both the employment rate for disabled people in urban areas and the at-work rate for disabled people in rural areas to about 80 percent. --To raise the compulsory education enrollment rate for disabled children to 80 percent; and to provide vocational training to about 80 percent of job-awaiting disabled people. --To assist most disabled people in undergoing rehabilitation training in their own neighborhoods or at home; and to start some urgent and effective rehabilitation projects with a view to rehabilitating about 2 million disabled people. --To enrich disabled people's cultural life. --To promote preventive efforts to eliminate the main factors leading to disability. Deng Pufang talked on this topic during the 10th meeting of the board of directors of the China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped held this afternoon. He also noted that the services for the disabled in China should be guided by the following principles in the future: 1) To comprehensively enforce the Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons; 2) to implement the development guideline of "stressing real effects and laying down a solid foundation"; to focus on efforts that can meet disabled people's urgent needs, benefit a large part of the disabled population, and promise rapid results and good effects; and to further develop a sound operational and working system, a sound system of policies, laws, and regulations, and a sound infrastructure system for services for disabled people; 3) to adhere to the working principle of "socialized services"; and 4) to give full play to the initiative of disabled people and to the role of organizations of disabled people, so as to enhance the spirit of self-strengthening among disabled people. The tasks facing Deng Pufang and his colleagues, one should say, are not easy, because quite a lot of difficulties have yet to be solved regarding services for disabled people in China, even though many achievements have been scored in recent years. The illiteracy rate among the disabled population remains as high as about 60 percent, nearly 80 percent of blind, deaf, or mentally retarded children stay out of school, 40 percent of disabled people are jobless, and most disabled people have no access to rehabilitation or medical facilities. However, as Deng Pufang put it at the board of directors meeting today: "We certainly can do a good job so long as we mobilize all sectors of the community to join our efforts, and work in a down-to-earth and creative manner."
