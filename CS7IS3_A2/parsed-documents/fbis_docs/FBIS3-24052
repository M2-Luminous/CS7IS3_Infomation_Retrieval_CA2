Their deep-lying causes and roots are inaccessible to an analysis within the framework of the customary approach and require a serious and comprehensive philosophical conceptualization. This field still awaits its thoughtful and impartial researcher. At the same time, on the other hand, the practical needs of the present day insistently demand a determination of the pluses and minuses of Russia's present position on the basis of the centuries-old majestic tradition. So that we might, finally, stand with a "firm footing" on the native soil of the country's primordial national interests, it is vitally necessary that we restore the natural historical retrospective. And the formulation of such a most important philosophical problem presupposes, in turn, the accomplishment of the following tasks: 1. The formulation of a concept making it possible to reveal and substantiate the "geopolitical invariants" of Russian national interests, that is, the stable requirements pertaining to the assurance of state security that guarantee us long-term conditions of the country's peaceful and harmonious development. 2. The formulation of a procedure of the "ideological correction" of our ailing society aimed at restoring the historical continuity of Russian life in the national self-consciousness, reviving the spiritual health of the people, and ensuring the moral immunity of public opinion to relapses into "foreign-mania." 3. Determination of a prospective model of Russia's social and state development in the channel of its distinctive traditions, spiritual reference points, and religious shrines. Two Approaches A distinctive method making it possible to ascertain the invariants of Russia's state interests is that of geopolitical analysis. In terms of its content, geopolitics is a science studying the normalities of the influence of geographical factors on the role of states in world history and the formation of political trends and the national-state interests of various peoples and countries. The basic propositions of this science were formulated back at the end of the last century by the British political scientist Halford Mackinder (1861-1947), whose studies formed the basis of all subsequent geopolitical models of world history. The term "geopolitics" itself, however, was first put to use by the Swedish expert Rudolf Kjellen and immediately taken up in Germany by Karl Haushofer, who became a most important authority in this field. A most important postulate of geopolitics is the assertion that for formulation of the optimum strategy of state development paramount significance should be attached not to political or ideological predilections--short-term and rapidly changing--but to stable factors of a country's spatial-geographical position. Geopolitics attributes to such primarily a state's location (continental, insular, or littoral), the size of its territory, the prevailing type of communications (sea or land), the predominant landscapes, and similar parameters. All the remaining aspects of state life, be they commercial-economic or political-ideological, are deemed from this viewpoint to be factors which are, although important, nonetheless subordinate. It is believed here that it is the permanency of the main "support characteristics" chosen as the reference point that enable geopolitics to formulate with the maximum efficiency the strategy of state development--be it in the sphere of its foreign policy or defense. In most general form the essence of geopolitical doctrine may be characterized by the following most important propositions: Throughout human history two alternative, continuously contending approaches to the conquest of the earth's surface have formed the basis of constitutional development. They may be designated the continental, land-expansionist, approach characteristic of continental states and the "nautical" approach basing the economic prosperity and state power of the metropolis on the exploitation of overseas territories, which makes domination on water lines of communication of fundamental importance. In recent European history the basic principles of geopolitics are convincingly illustrated by the opposition of the "ruler of the seas" of the British Empire to the states of continental Europe that developed in the 16th-19th centuries into a whole series of almost continuous wars and clashes both in the European region and in the enemies' continental possessions. America, which in the 20th century became Great Britain's geopolitical successor, but no longer on a regional but on a global, world scale, naturally inherited all the fundamental features of this path of development. Throughout the last century the scientific-technological revolution has contributed and continues to contribute a number of essential correctives connected with the modernization of the means of information and communication, but there have nonetheless been no fundamental changes here as yet. Speaking in this connection of the molding of cultural and world-outlook values, it should be stipulated that the complex and mysterious sphere of the spiritual and religious-moral development of the peoples cannot be adequately described in terms of geopolitics concentrating their main attention on outward, state-political forms of societal existence. But it can be seen distinctly here that liberal-democratic ideology with its cult of individualism and personal success serving the commercial-economic mechanism of the "market" plunder of continental sources of raw material and manpower becomes a most important pillar of the trading "nautical" civilization. At the same time, however, the traditional world outlook, with its powerful communal roots presupposing the priority of solidary, collective, conciliary forms of societal self-organization, becomes the ideological foundation of "totalitarian" continental culture and spirituality. With reference to modern conditions what has been said above signifies that the territories and regions lying on the "continental periphery" of Eurasia and representing a connecting link, as it were, between the inland expanses of the mainland and the expanses of the oceans inevitably become an arena of bitter and uncompromising opposition. The "nautical" civilization endeavors to the utmost to advance inside the mainland, turning the expanses which have been won away from it into "forward-basing zones" and original strong points for the defense of its global interests. In turn, the representatives of the "continental" geopolitical tradition have no choice but to make every effort to "throw into the sea" their ocean adversary, having increased their own influence in the littoral zone, creating in this way a barrier against his expansion. The United States expended colossal efforts to establish a celebrated "arc of instability" on the external borders of the USSR. Or we recall the well-known call of Zbigniew Brzezinski--"to nibble at the Russian pie around the edges." Truly something to think about. In such a system the coordinate of the notorious "new world order" appears to be nothing other than an attempt to enshrine on a planetary scale the leading role of the "ocean power" United States and its satellites by way of the power imposition on the entire world community of the "liberal-market" values of the trading nautical civilization. Elevation of the State As a subject of geopolitics, the Russian state took shape back in the ninth century as a result of the unification of related East Slav tribes, the ancient cultural center of which was the Middle Dnieper region headed by Kiev. Since the moment of its formation Kievan Rus immediately became a most important state of that era, and its statehood was of an unequivocally continental nature. The basis of the material prosperity of Kievan Rus determining to a considerable extent the burgeoning of a very rich culture also was control over the inland mainland expanses through which the celebrated trading route "from the Varangians to the Greeks"--the most important communications artery of Eurasia of those times--ran. The development of Russian statehood was from the very outset filled with dramatic content, for that matter. A stern test awaited the young state en route to prosperity: An insidious steppe predator, the Khazar Khanate kept a jealous eye on its strengthening rival. Their struggle, in the course of which it sometimes appeared that the unenviable role of submissive vassal had been prepared for Rus, until, finally, the valiant and warlike Prince Svyatoslav smashed the khanate in the mid-10th century, lasted several decades. The first military encounters set a disturbing tone, as it were, for all of subsequent Russian history. For 10 centuries after this Russia had time after time--again and again--in continuous rivalry with aggressive neighbors to prove its right to distinctive existence, paying for this with the blood of its best sons and daughters. Just about the most fearful test on its historical path was the Tatar-Mongol yoke. The immense empire of the Genghis Khanites, which encompassed the entire mainland and stretched from "the walls of immovable China" to the Baltic and from Northern Siberia to Khorezm and Bukhara, was, by all accounts, to have swallowed up as part of itself for good the "land of the Rus" as a distant western province. No one could have imagined that Rus, ravaged and perishing in the turmoil of princely fratricidal strife, would have taken over the baton from the empire of the Genghis Khanites and at a price of incredible sacrificial efforts have united within it the giant expanses of Eurasia, becoming forever a guarantor and custodian of world geopolitical balance. Nonetheless, this is precisely what happened. Lost in the remoteness of impenetrable forests, the downgraded hamlet of Moskova rose by the efforts of a long succession of Russian princes--patient, consistent, and single-minded builders of sovereign power--higher and higher, becoming the visible center of all-Russian national-state unity. It defended this role in the 14th-15th centuries by the diplomatic skill of its rulers, the commercial aptitude of the merchants, and the martial valor of the warriors, who fell in countless numbers in 1380 on Kulikovo Field, paying the supreme price for the independence of their country. As a result of heroic efforts Russian statehood had acquired a new quality by the mid-15th century under the scepter of Ioann III. Nonetheless, the true founder of the Russian geopolitical state was Ioann the Terrible. First, he conquered the Kazan and Astrakhan kingdoms--the last islets of the former Tatar-Mongol might. Russia's second strategic breakthrough was the annexation of Siberia. Altogether this process took several decades, its decisive stage was the campaign of the Cossack chieftain Yermak Timofeyevich, who was zealous for the security of the country's eastern borders against the nomad raids. The formidable tsar clearly understood the geopolitical needs of his state. It was no secret to him that the logic of Russia's national-state interests insistently demanded control over the maritime regions, and he began in the West an exhausting and bloody war for the return of the country's sea boundaries--for an outlet to the Baltic, which had come to be called the Livonian Sea. For 12 years (1558-1583) Russia strained every nerve in the struggle against four enemies--Poland, Sweden, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Livonian Order. The cause begun by Ioann was completed by another celebrated sovereign--Peter I, the founder of the Russian Empire. As distinct from the conventional opinion, in fighting Sweden (the strongest European power at that time) for the Baltic Peter was not so much endeavoring "to carve out a window onto Europe" as, on the contrary, to secure Russia against possible aggression from the direction of the sea. It was these same geopolitical considerations that dictated many other famous undertakings of Peter--the building of the navy, the decision to erect a new capital "on the shore of the desert waves," and the close attention to European engineering and military innovations. When the Northern War with Sweden ended in 1721 with the Peace of Nystad (which annexed Ingria, Estonia, and Livonia to Russia), this signified not only the return of primordial Russian lands but a triumph of geopolitical single-mindedness which ensured a regime of the maximum possible tranquillity and peace for the population of the region, incidentally, for the next 200 years (until the advent of those who loved "to rectify injustice"). All of Russia's subsequent steps aimed at the discovery of its natural geopolitical borders were dictated by its aspiration to sovereign-state peacemaking. The closest confirmation of this is the history of the annexation to Russia of the Crimean peninsula. As of the 15th century the Crimean Khanate, the last fragment of the once mighty Golden Horde, having consolidated its position in Crimea and having become a vassal of the Turkish sultan, became a pirate's nest regularly sending out its hordes, which laid waste to everything around and reached the walls of Moscow in their raids. Russian troops attempted repeatedly to put an end to this plunder, but their forces were insufficient, and the raids continued. Finally, in the course of the 1768-1774 Russo-Turkish War, in which Catherine II had been forced to act to secure the country's southern strategic borders, Crimea was taken by Potemkin's army. The center of aggression was suppressed, and long-awaited peace was established on the vast expanses of the Black Sea steppe, which lost, as a result of the Russian Empire's single-minded pursuit of its geopolitical interests, its border and "front-line" status. A no less striking example of Russian peacemaking was its decisive contribution to the victory over Napoleon. From the viewpoint of the local European France-Britain opposition Napoleon, with his "continental system," was undoubtedly the main threat to the "nautical" geopolitical principle personified by Great Britain. Nonetheless, on the scale of the immense Eurasia this conflict was of a manifestly local, peripheral nature, whereas Bonaparte's attempts to conquer Russia, having disarticulated its giant expanses, contained a lethal threat to the entire geopolitical balance of the mainland. It is interesting that even so decidedly an anti-Russian politician as Henry Kissinger was recently forced to acknowledge in the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE that "the tsarist and Soviet empires twice saved the European countries' independence inasmuch as without their contribution Napoleon and Hitler would have gained the ascendancy." A compliment from a highly dubious source, of course, but nonetheless.... Following the victory over Bonaparte, it was thanks to the efforts of Alexander I (with the active role of the Austrian Chancellor Metternich) that the Holy Alliance of continental states of Europe--Russia, Prussia, and Austria-Hungary--which was one further attempt to establish stability and security in the European part of the continent--was concluded. The persevering attempts--completed by Nicholas I--to secure Russian control over the strategically important region of the Caucasus lay in this same direction. The Caucasus War of 1817-1864, which ended with the annexation to Russia of Chechnya, Highland Dagestan, and the Northwest Caucasus, was not at all (like other Russian wars also) an act of conquest or aggression. Following the voluntary incorporation as part of Russia of the Kingdom of Georgia (1801-1810) and Azerbaijan (1803-1813), the Northwest Caucasus had become a springboard for Turkish and Iranian expansion in the region engendering endless military conflicts and bringing devastation to entire provinces, and grief and death to hundreds of thousands of peaceful inhabitants. This state of affairs was actively supported by Britain, for which the strengthening of the continental power of Russia contained a great threat. The results of the annexation of the Caucasus may be judged if only by the fact that the endless bloody wars that had been lacerating this region almost continuously from century to century came to an end for a long time under the Russian scepter. And now in our post-perestroyka times, when the defenders of the fatherland are abandoning the "independent states," blood is being shed in Chechnya and Ingushetia, Ossetia, Abkhazia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan! Does history never teach us anything? Generally speaking, the leading politicians of Russia understood full well that the empire's Eurasian interests could not be secured exclusively by military power and always put the emphasis on peaceful influence in regions where its vital interests were concentrated. This, incidentally, makes for the unique multinational nature of Russia, which has for many centuries accepted as brothers all the peoples that have reunited with it. It seemed that this growing continental might of Russia had become eternal and invincible. Nonetheless, the evidence to the contrary, the 20th century has been for our country a period of devastating social cataclysms, bloody wars, and geopolitical catastrophes. In order to understand why this became possible it is essential to address the spiritual and world-outlook processes that determined the inner strength of the Russian State.
