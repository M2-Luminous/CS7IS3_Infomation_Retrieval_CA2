It has threatened directly the government. The prime minister now clearly wants to revive the mechanism of a reshuffled team, not by refusing to forget the "scandal" but by trying to show that ministerial work must continue. [Dehaene] With regard to the Agusta scandal, it is a good thing that matters have been clarified by drawing a distinction between government policy and the handling of "scandals." And that those whose names have been mentioned should be free to defend themselves. I do not want to trivialize these events. This issue must be cleared up, like the Andre Cools murder, and any other scandal which breaks out in the future. I therefore insist that the legal authorities be allowed to act, according to their rules, on this issue and on any others that arise. [LE SOIR] The Agusta scandal has shown the need for some reforms. Will you propose them? [Dehaene] Discussions were already under way on party funding, the limitation of election spending, ensuring the objectivity of nominations, or the establishment of an ombudsman in public enterprises or Parliament. What has happened has served as a catalyst. The issues on which parliamentary groups and parties will have to take the initiative -- namely immunity, the status of deputies, and funding -- should be distinguished from those which relate to the state apparatus and are the government's responsibility: ministerial responsibility, the control of public appropriations, recruitment and promotion in the magistrature and civil service. [LE SOIR] Are you not afraid that other scandals will emerge, as they have in Italy? [Dehaene] First, let us not make too hasty a comparison with Italy. Second, if other scandals emerge, they will have to be clarified. Third, if they are the result of vengeance, that is dangerous. [LE SOIR] Do you share the view of those who talk of different ethics in the north and the south? Those who think that the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] is a sicker party than the others? [Dehaene] Public opinions and voters are different. The parties, politicians, and media often reflect that. That may create different sensitivities. But I do not think there are fundamentally opposite approaches. In other, previous cases, questions were asked, in the north and the south, about the resignation of certain people.... [LE SOIR] What do you think of the defense adopted by Guy Coeme? [Dehaene] I will not express an opinion or a judgment on the aspect of this case under jurisdiction. [LE SOIR] Guy Coeme has criticized the "excessive media coverage" and "over-politicization" of the issue. Do you agree? [Dehaene] The system of parliamentary immunity and Article 90 must be reviewed because, in view of the media coverage, what was originally a protection has turned into a system under which the politician is tried twice. It is up to Parliament to draw the necessary conclusions. [LE SOIR] Nonetheless you called for the creation of a financial, social, and fiscal status for the deputy.... [Dehaene] It is one thing to say what is a desirable reform. Giving a verdict on how to implement it is a different matter. As a deputy, I will say what I think about it within my party. But that is not the prime minister's role. [LE SOIR] At one time, the PS said that you too had met with Agusta envoys. Did that annoy you? [Dehaene] I note that, susequently Mr. Spitaels issued a communique explaining that he had not intended to implicate other people. As for the decision on the Agusta issue, I participated in it as a government member. I have shouldered my responsibilities. At the time there were contacts between the different candidates and my office. A distinction must be drawn between the licit and illicit aspects of the issue. I have been involved in other cases of public appropriations: At the time of the RTT [Telegraph and Telephone Administration] contract, we were subjected to lobbying from all sides. The RTT's interests seemed secondary to the effects on Flanders or Wallonia. I therefore say that the issue of appropriations should be dealt with according to the principle of the best relationship between quality and price and not in accordance with which enterprises need investments. Indirect compensation, which is often dubious, must therefore be abandoned. On the other hand, direct compensation can be useful if it does not affect the price. [LE SOIR] Last week, did you pass on the view of the CVP [Christian People's Party] deputies who thought that Guy Coeme should resign? Did you take that action? [Dehaene] I am abiding strictly by the reply I gave in Parliament, each word of which was carefully considered. [LE SOIR] Coeme says that his resignation was a personal decision. But it came several hours after a conversation which you had with the PS president. Was that meeting not the decisive factor? [Dehaene] No. [LE SOIR] Has the government now been weakened? [Dehaene] It is a good thing for the government program that the PS has appointed new ministers. But I certainly do not rule out the fact that the process of the Agusta scandal or the emergence of other issues could have an influence on the government or the pursuit of its policy at a given time. At present, the two spheres are clearly separate. During my meeting with the presidents of the majority parties, all clearly expressed their desire to see this issue resolved and their desire to pursue government action until the end of the parliamentary term. [LE SOIR] Do you agree with Gerard Deprez? He does not rule out the possibility of the government's unity being undermined? [Dehaene] His remarks speak for themselves! It is one thing to say: For the time being matters have been clarified and the government is in a good position to pursue its policy; saying that the development of the Agusta scandal or the emergence of other scandals will have no influence on the coalition is a different matter. You would have to be naive to think that! [LE SOIR] Was it necessary to give guarantees to the PS for it to remain in power? [Dehaene] No. Not other than to express our determination to carry on to the end of the parliamentary term, which is natural. Philippe Busquin clearly took account of the other parties' desire to complete the parliamentary term. Moreover, this is in the interests of the PS and the other parties, because the government had a threefold objective: The reform of the state virtually has been completed, the overall plan has been drawn up and must be implemented in all its dimensions, and, finally, the contract with the citizen must be highlighted and given greater prominence and this implies reforms which take longer. After two years of preparatory work in several spheres, we can adopt bills and start to implement them on the ground. [LE SOIR] The Flemish liberals continue to level very harsh criticisms at you. What is your answer to them? [Dehaene] Those who think they will extricate themselves by exploiting the antipolitical climate are merely strengthening that phenomenon.
