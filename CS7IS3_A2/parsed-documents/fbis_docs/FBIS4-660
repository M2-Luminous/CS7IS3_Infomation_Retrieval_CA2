Today Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin confirmed the deaths of two French gendarmes and the wife of one of them to the National Assembly. Francois Leotard informed the senators of the departure late this afternoon of the last French company of soldiers. Before leaving Rwanda himself our special correspondent, Philippe Boisserie, sent us his report: [Begin Boisserie recording] The French military are leaving Kigali at the same time as the Rwandan Patriotic Front are entering it. Operation Amaryllis, for the evacuation of foreigners, is ending. With 120 of his men, Colonel Poncet, who was leading the operation, left as night was falling, while all around the airport, the guns thundered. Only 50 French soldiers remain on the scene. Their mission is to support the Belgian and Italian soldiers in recovering their nationals who are still trapped in the four corners of the country. The two warring sides have promised to allow these operations to go ahead, the only condition being that everyone should be out within 48 hours. The Rwandans are thus going to settle their scores among themselves, and it appears that the Tutsi minority of the Rwanda Patriotic Front are in the process of taking power.
