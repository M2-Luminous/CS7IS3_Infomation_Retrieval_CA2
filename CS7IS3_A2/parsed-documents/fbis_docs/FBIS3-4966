Foreign companies in China "are rushing to buy foreign cars before the duty is imposed," an official at Nissan Motor Co. said. "But the boom will be short-lived. After the duties are slapped on in April, shipments will plunge," he said. In January, the Chinese Government decided to impose a uniform 110 percent custom duty on cars to be purchased by both domestic and foreign companies. The latter have up to now been allowed to import cars duty-free. Under the tax reforms, import licenses issued last year will be extended to the end of March. This gave foreign firms operating in China a three-month grace period to import duty-free cars. Nissan shipped some 2,700 vehicles to China in January, more than double the number for December. Mazda Motor Corp.'s exports have doubled since December to some 250 vehicles a month, according to the industry sources. The Chinese import boom has helped Japanese automakers reduce their inventories of completed vehicles by more than two-thirds from 20,000 at the worst stage last year, they added.
