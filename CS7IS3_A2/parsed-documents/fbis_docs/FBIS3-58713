The programs will promote measures to convert regions and businesses affected by the rundown in defense-related activities in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Berlin, Brandenburg, Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Schleswig- Holstein, Saxony and Thuringia. The ERDF is to contribute ECU14.2 million and total costs, including German part-financing, amount to ECU46.8 million. The programs cover the following priorities: - Consulting services and assistance in the conversion of defense production to civil production, in particular for small and medium-sized businesses; - innovation promotion and technology transfer measures -- planning and development concepts; - restoration of land previously used for military purposes. The projects include: environmental redevelopment and change of the designated use of the Altes Lager in Jueterbog so that a polytechnic college can be built (Brandenburg), waste disposal measures on an area previously used by Western units of the CIS armed forces on the Ravensbrueck concentration camp memorial site (Brandenburg), the construction of a software center in Marburg (Hesse) and the construction of an industry and service sector park on the site of the former Holtzendorff barracks in Kaiserslautern (Rhineland-Palatinate). Commenting on the decision, Mr. Millan said the German Konver programs meant that the initiative had now reached the practical implementation stage in all member states, and that as a result of the good cooperation between the Commission and the national authorities concerned it had been possible to adopt the decisions in an extremely short time.
