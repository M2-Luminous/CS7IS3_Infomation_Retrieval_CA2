Relatives of the 24 Taiwanese victims had been told that they could attend the hearings if they wished, official sources here said. The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) invited relatives of the boat fire tragedy to attend the public trial, via the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), on the 2nd, 5th and 8th of this month, the sources said. ARATS said that representatives of SEF, too, are allowed to attend the trial in their own names. Seats are actually reserved for them. In the afternoon of June 8, ARATS received a formal notice from the SEF saying that five relatives of the Taiwan victims would attend the trial. But none of them have been present at the trial so far. Officials here said that the court will make proper arrangements for them if relatives of the victims and representatives of SEF want to attend the trial before the court reaches its decision.
