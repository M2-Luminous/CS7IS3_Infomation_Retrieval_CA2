[Begin recording] [Reporter Julia Mirabal] In the first place, as regards financial matters, Mr.(Max Vincent), cochairman of the delegation, says: [(Vincent), in French] ...and, (?as I said), the French Government is to sign, no doubt within the next (?month), an agreement to guarantee investments. Consequently, regarding investments, theoretically there should be no problems; and the heads of companies are currently working on the matter of exchanges. [Mirabal] There are also other results. [(Vincent), in French] ...(?create), on the basis of this first contact, is, on the one hand, to (?have) the heads of companies (?attend) the fair to be held in Santiago de Cuba and, based on that exchange, set up a network of relations that will permit us to create, on the basis of that undertaking, the need and the desire to come work in Cuba. [Mirabal] One of the steps toward contributing to Cuba's communication with that part of the Caribbean is the establishment of weekly flights; heretofore, they have been sporadic. [(Vincent), in French] Why? Because the potential for Guadeloupe companies, on the level of both tourism and trade, is very great. [Mirabal] At the end of this brief dialogue, I asked Mr. (Vincent) a question to which he responded in Spanish. [(Vincent)] We feel that all the Caribbean Basin countries are brothers, like the fingers of a single hand, and that they should work together for the well-being of their peoples. [Mirabal] This has been Julia Mirabal reporting on the Cuba-Guadeloupe meeting. [end recording]
