Sukhanov and Reserve Captain 2nd Rank V. Smirnov: "Foreign Navies' Surface Combatants' Torpedo Defense Systems and Equipment"] [Text] The development of torpedo defense systems and equipment for surface combatants and auxiliary ships continues to remain one of the most dynamic directions of R&D [research and development] and the primary orientation of purchases in the navies of foreign countries. This is explained by the fact that the command authorities of their navies view modern and future heavy torpedo submarines, especially "Soviet, that are following in the wake of the 65 class", as a serious threat to surface combatants and ships at sea. It is thought that they can be utilized in joint strikes with antiship missiles at distances that are beyond the maximum assured detection ranges of submarines that employ these torpedoes. At the same time, we note that a ship, due to its specific design features, is most vulnerable to underwater explosions, especially of torpedo warheads and, in the event of damage by torpedoes, has less chance for survival than when damaged by a missile. Therefore, according to foreign experts, along with other defense measures, we must equip the primary classes of surface combatants with a single multi-echelon torpedo defense system similar to the PVO [air defense] system, which must not only detect attacking torpedoes, suppress and deceive their guidance systems in a reliable and timely manner, but also destroy these torpedoes. It is being asserted that there are no such torpedo defense systems on foreign surface combatants at the present time and defense from torpedoes is being carried out utilizing only towed and fired sonar countermeasures systems. And that is already inadequate to effectively combat modern and, all the more so, future torpedoes. Abroad, these circumstances have provided a priority for a number of efforts on the development of comprehensive torpedo defense systems, including, besides sonar countermeasures systems, attacking torpedo destruction systems which, in turn, have received the greatest development in the navies of the United States, Great Britain, and France. At the present time, various types of nationally-produced towed torpedo decoys form the foundation of these countries' torpedo defense systems. In the process, sonar countermeasures systems are being combined into the comprehensive SSAWS "acoustic combat" systems (SSAWS -- Surface Ship Acoustic Warfare System) on U.S. Navy surface combatants and ships. The Nixie type towed portion of the decoys, thanks to its small size, as a rule is located in an below decks space along the right side. Two towed bodies are deployed at the same time -- each through its own port hole and with its own winch. On British ships, towed bodies of decoys that have adequately large dimensions (see the table), along with winches, are located in the stern on the upper deck. Other countries, for example Germany and Japan, utilize various modifications of American Nixie type decoys. However, I must note the development of national sonar countermeasures equipment on behalf of surface combatant torpedo defense systems in the Israeli Navy where today the ATC-1 small electronic-acoustic torpedo decoy has been developed at the level of modern Western standards. At the beginning of the 1980's, work was begun, practically simultaneously, in the United States, Great Britain and France, on the modernization of existing and the development of fundamentally new surface combatant and ship torpedo defense systems based upon the SSTD (United States), Talisman (Great Britain), and Spartacus (France) programs. In the process, the American SSTD (SSTD -- Surface Ship Torpedo Defense) Program consists of three independent stages. The 1st and 2nd stages form a purely American national program that is being carried out under the management of the U.S. Navy's Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). During the course of accomplishing the program, in the first stage, work was completed to improve existing torpedo defense systems and, in the 2nd stage, new generation torpedo defense systems were developed utilizing modern technical solutions. In contrast to the 1st and 2nd stages, during the course of which systems which protect surface combatants and ships from modern torpedoes were developed within the framework of existing torpedo defense systems, during the course of the 3rd stage, they propose developing a fundamentally new multi-echelon system for their defense from future torpedoes with various types of guidance systems and target attack methods. While considering the system's high complexity and cost of R&D on the development of this torpedo defense system, in 1998 the U.S. and British governments decided to combine the scientific-technical and financial efforts of the two countries for the successful completion of work by the end of the 1990's. An improved variant of the AN/SLQ-25 -- the AN/SLQ-25A decoy was developed during the 1st stage of this program. According to American experts, this is essentially a new development that significantly exceeds its predecessor in specifications and capabilities. Series production of the AN/SLQ-25A decoys had already begun in 1988 and deliveries of it to the navy were planned from April 1991. The overall need for them until the year 2000 was assessed at 240 systems (at a rate of manufacture of two systems per month). In accordance with the 2nd stage of the SSTD Program, the following surface combatant torpedo defense subsystems have been developed or are at the concluding stage of full-scale development: an anti-torpedo; the AN/SLR-24 torpedo passive detection and classification system; the AN/SLQ-36 towed combined countermeasures system and improved fired sonar countermeasures systems to suppress EX-10 torpedo guidance systems and also a countermeasures control system (CDC). The anti-torpedo was developed based on the Mk 46 small antisubmarine torpedo. A total of approximately 70 practical launches of the anti-torpedo have been conducted during full-scale tests against a 65 cm torpedo simulator. Based upon tests results, they planned to reequip 172 Mk 46 torpedoes into anti-torpedoes in the 1993 fiscal year. Later, they propose to reequip more improved torpedoes -- the Mk 50 Barracuda -- because, according to American experts, anti-torpedoes must become the primary torpedo defense systems of aircraft carriers in the near future. An experimental model of the AN/SLR-24 passive torpedo detection subsystem has already been tested on the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and demonstrated its capability to successfully recognize the noises of a simulator of an attacking antiship torpedo in the background of the aircraft carrier's own noise. In 1992, they anticipated the delivery to the navy of two experimental models of this subsystem. As for the AN/SLQ-36 towed countermeasures system, its development was completed in 1988. It is anticipated that a new torpedo defense system, which consists of the AN/SLR-24 subsystem, an anti-torpedo, and a CDC type control system will enter the inventory of American aircraft carriers already in 1996-1997. Therefore, the participation of two international consortiums headed by the firms Westinghouse and General Electric (United States) was planned at this stage of work. They propose concentrating primary efforts on the development of highly effective robotic torpedo defense systems employing artificial intelligence technology, including short-range self-defense torpedo destruction systems. The scientific-technical achievements obtained during the course of work of the 2nd stage of the SSTD Program and the SDI Program are being utilized for their development. In the process, expanded research is being conducted with the involvement of the experimental facilities of the U.S. Navy and universities. They are examining the following systems as torpedo destruction systems: promising specialized small anti-torpedoes; anti-torpedo networks with warhead-destroyers that have been installed in the path of the attacking torpedo and various types of depth charges. Analysis of information materials indicates that significant successes have been achieved in the United States in the development of specialized anti-torpedoes and also anti-torpedoes based on small 324 cm antisubmarine torpedoes. For example, the completion of work in 1991 on the development of a 203-mm anti-torpedo for submarines and the 2nd stage of the development of a fundamentally new navigation system for future anti-torpedoes that have a speed of approximately 40 knots and the capability to complete turns with an angular velocity of approximately 50ï¿½ per second have been reported. Full-scale testing at Los Alamos Laboratory (New Mexico, United States) has confirmed the technical capability to dispense a 5 X 5 meter anti-torpedo network from a 324-mm platform and a 10 X 10 meter network from a 533-mm platform. Deployment of the network in the path of the torpedo is carried out using four hydro-rocket projectiles which explode when the torpedo ends up in the network. At the beginning of the 1990's, the United States developed an anti-torpedo depth charge with a diameter of the bottom portion of 373-mm and a weight of approximately 360 kg, that is capable of carrying out ricochetless entry into the water at acute angles at speeds of up to 610 meters per second at permissible G-loads. During the course of work on the 3rd stage of the SSTD Program, significant attention is being devoted to the development of a reliable torpedo detection system that provides the time required to implement torpedo defense system measures. American experts think that the problem of detection of torpedoes requires the development of a special torpedo circuit in a centralized underwater situation information processing system. In the process, primary emphasis is being made on the development of hull-mounted and towed concentrated acoustic systems, and of acoustic systems with a GPBA [flexible towed extended sonar antenna] -- torpedo detection circuits and the appropriate processing, analysis and information depiction software. It is thought that, when torpedoes are detected, their classification, determination of coordinates, and parameters of their movement must be conducted, and also detection of the main threat for surface combatants with the goal of subsequent automatic selection of the most effective technique to combat them. A memorandum between the United States and Great Britain defines the following time periods during the 3rd phase of work: 1991 -- Selection of the variants of future torpedo defense systems for further work, a preliminary assessment of the cost of the torpedo defense system elements and systems on the whole and conclusion of contracts for R&D; 1992-1993 -- Conceptual design and selection of one basic variant of the system for each class of ships of the U.S. and British navies and determination of developing firms on a competitive basis; 1994 -- (second half) -- Initiation of full-scale development of the future torpedo defense system; and, 1998-1999 -- Entry of series-produced models into the inventory. The U.S. Navy Naval Systems Command has announced that the list of all ships on which the future torpedo defense system will be installed will depend on its effectiveness, operational requirements and production capacity. According to expert assessments, the U.S. Navy's need for new torpedo defense systems totals more than 400 sets and the British Navy's need -- is approximately 80 sets. Furthermore, it was noted that the involvement of the French Navy in the work is possible during the 3rd stage of the SSTD Program and that its needs are assessed as more than 100 sets of the new torpedo defense system. Great Britain's Talisman Program is similar to the American SSTD Program and contains three subprograms (stages in the U.S. program): modernization of existing torpedo defense systems; development of new generation torpedo defense systems for surface combatants that are in the inventory and that are under construction; and, development of new promising torpedo defense systems within the framework of the 3rd stage of work on the SSTD Program. The SEA SIREN Towed Torpedo Decoy, which is considered to be a next generation system, was developed based on the latest microprocessor technology during the course of modifying torpedo defense systems at the end of the 1980's in Great Britain. Like its predecessors -- the British 182M and GI 738 [sic] decoys, it is designed to deflect torpedoes with active, passive and combined acoustic guidance systems away from surface combatants. The British are applying significant efforts toward the development of fired drifting sonar countermeasures devices. So, here they developed the ATAAC 76- and 100-mm projectiles (ATAAC -- Anti-Torpedo Air-launched Acoustic Countermeasure) for suppression of torpedoes' acoustic guidance systems at the end of the 1980's. A rocket-propelled projectile with a noise jamming generator has been integrated with the launchers of surface combatants of the U.S. and British navies that are designed to dispense jamming and decoys. The appropriate functioning program can be entered into the projectile prior to launch based upon the data received from the acoustic systems. After entering the water, the projectile creates powerful noise jamming in the water in a wide band of torpedo acoustic frequencies. An experimental model of the Spartacus surface combatant torpedo defense system was developed in France at the end of the 1980's. They proposed initiating its series production in the middle of 1992. This system consists of: a passive torpedo detection system and issuance of a "torpedo alert" signal; a countermeasures process control system and rocket-propelled projectiles with warheads in the shape of various types of sonar countermeasures instruments. The torpedo detection system in its complete configuration consists of the Albatros sonar system with a flexible towed extended sonar antenna and U/RDT-1A (SPDT-1A) torpedo detection noise direction-finding equipment that operates from a DUBA-25 type hull-mounted acoustic system antenna. The joint operation of these two systems provides continuous 360ï¿½ surveillance of the situation in the passive mode, in the process, French experts note that the torpedo detection range can reach 10 or more kilometers with a torpedo DF accuracy of more than 10ï¿½ under favorable acoustic conditions. The U/RDT-1A acoustic system depicts noise spectral analysis data in time sequence on a color panoramic display and the noise frequency spectrum on a monochrome panoramic display. The countermeasures processor control system is a data processing device of the nearby underwater situation, tactical situation depiction, data processing on the accomplishment of torpedo defense missions and control of the torpedo defense process. The following is carried out using a data processing unit: underwater situation information analysis on behalf of torpedo defense; target classification; calculation of the relative coordinates and the elements of movement of attacking torpedoes and target ranking based upon the degree of threat they pose to the surface combatant. In the Spartacus system, a triangulation method jointly with carrying out coordinated inter-antenna signal processing from the bow and towed extended U/RDT-1A and Albatros sonar system antennas, respectively, is utilized to determine target coordinates and elements of movement. The system provides: automatic issuance of an alert signal based upon the results of the assessment of the tactical situation with its subsequent confirmation by the control panel operator; calculation of the availability, state, loading and readiness of torpedo defense systems and launchers to dispense decoys, and processes recommendations for maneuvering of the surface combatant and dispensing torpedo defense systems. The following are depicted on the display: the mutual location of the attacking torpedoes and the surface combatant, the safe zone, and recommendations for maneuvering the surface combatant; state of loading the launchers with torpedo defense systems and the degree of readiness of the launchers and torpedo defense systems for employment. Rocket-propelled projectiles with three types of sonar countermeasures systems have been developed for the Spartacus system: --with a load in the form of a generator of consecutive explosive signals to suppress the sonar systems of the firing submarine and the torpedo's remote control channel; --with a load in the form of water-reacting substance charges that create a powerful camouflage gas screen of small hydrogen bubbles between the attacking torpedo and the surface combatant-target during the process of the reaction with water; and, --with a traditional electronic-acoustic load that ensures suppression of attacking torpedoes guidance systems using camouflage or diversion jamming. A torpedo defense projectile is a 127 X 900-mm cylinder that weighs up to 50 kg. Maximum firing range is 3,000 meters. The Spartacus system utilizes 1-2 Dagaie launchers to fire these projectiles. The onboard system consists of up to 30 rocket-propelled projectiles with different missions. Dagaie launchers are universal and have up to 10 launch rails that serve to launch various EW [electronic warfare] munitions, including sonar countermeasures devices. Sagaie launch canisters can also be adapted to fire torpedo defense projectiles. After receiving the command to fire, the selection of torpedo defense projectiles is conducted for this situation and their automatic launch is carried out. During the terminal phase of the projectile flight trajectory, speed is reduced using a braking parachute, the projectile enters the water and the jamming devices begin to operate at the assigned depth. Their functioning time is 2-3 minutes and the gas curtain operating time is 8-10 minutes. The Spartacus system's operating principle is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. The Operating Principle of the Spartacus Torpedo Defense System. Thanks to modularity of design, the new torpedo defense system can be combined with a ship's submarine defense system and can be installed on various ships regardless of the equipment and acoustic weapons on them. According to Western experts, the Spartacus system, despite the absence of torpedo destruction weapons in it, is sufficiently effective because it is thought that the mission of reliable detection, classification and localization of attacking torpedoes has been successfully accomplished during its development. Tourville Class destroyers will be the first ships on which they plan to install this system because these ships are equipped with SLASM sonar systems that ensure detection of torpedoes (a low-frequency hull-mounted acoustic system, a medium-frequency acoustic system, and an acoustic system with towed flexible long linear sonar antennas). Beginning in 1995, they propose installing some components of the Spartacus system on seven Georges Leygues and Cassard Class destroyers, and also on other French Navy surface combatants. While considering the French Navy's extreme interest in equipping the aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle with effective torpedo defense systems, the system's developing firms have been conducting research since October 1990 to improve the Spartacus system for its subsequent installation on the aircraft carrier. The foreign press has reported that the Israeli firm Rafael Armament has completed development of the ATC-1 (ATC -- Anti-Torpedo Countermeasure) towed torpedo defense system during the second half of the 1980's. The firm notes that this system, thanks to its compact construction, can be installed both on the primary classes of surface combatants and also on merchant ships. A "decoy" weighing approximately 25 kg, 120 cm long and 30 cm in diameter emits strong sound signals that create a false phase front, forcing the torpedo to move in the direction of the noise, completing in the process a series of consecutive attacks of the emitters until the total expenditure of its power source. They also note that, thanks to its small dimensions, the ATC-1 does not impede the maneuvering of the ship-platform in course and speed and its installation does not require a great deal of area or space on the upper deck or in below decks spaces. Since 1987, the ATC-1 torpedo defense system has been in series production by Rafael Armament in Haifa. It is important to note that the "decoy" was designed and tested in accordance with the MIL-E-16400 All-European Standard in the sphere of military electronics. It is being reported that Sa'ar-5 class escort ships, which are being built for the Israeli Navy in the United States, are being equipped with ATC-1 decoys. The lead ship of this series was transferred to the Israeli Navy in 1993. The primary tactical-technical specifications of foreign countries navies torpedo defense systems have been cited in the table.

But as before, the West considers the conclusion of SEKAY NO KANSEN Commentator Oh Rekhey [transliterated] to be timely... "Aren't the colossal expenditures on the construction of surface combatants senseless from the point of view of self-defense if we can sink these ships without hindrance..." That is why foreign navies are paying such serious attention to torpedo defense as a very important element of the self-defense of surface combatants and ships. Today, it seems very important to painstakingly study leading foreign experience in the area of their effective defense from torpedoes when a new native concept of design and construction of surface combatants and ships is being developed.
