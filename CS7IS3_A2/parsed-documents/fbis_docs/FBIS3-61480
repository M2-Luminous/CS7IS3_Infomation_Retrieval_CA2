Ishchenko, A.D. Gaydukov, V.A. Doronin, NIKIMT Scientific Production Association; UDC 621.791:621.643.1/.2] [Abstract] The effect of the purity of gases transported over various types of pipelines with welded joints on the "memory" of modern electronic devices, the scarcity of detailed data on the extent to which the welding practices and welds serve as sources of trace amounts of impurities, and the lack of relevant regulatory documents governing the design and process parameters prompted a reevaluation of the practical aspects of wedding on pipelines intended for carrying superpurified gases in the electronics industry. The appearance of superfine residue on the welded pipe surface with particles �0.5-1 �m in size and changes in the weld and heat affected area (OShZ) surface composition, e.g., the appearance of nonmetallic inclusions, are discussed, and certain factors which determine the weld and heat affected area protection inside the pipe are described in detail. The effect of the shielding gas purging duration which ensures a twentyfold replacement of the gas atmosphere as a function of the flow velocity (in order to eliminate the fine deposit), the weld and heat affected area surface quality as a function of the plate surface preparation on the fusing side, and the effect of the welding conditions and inner surface state on the weld surface roughness are summarized. The findings demonstrate that the weld is the principal source of elevated impurity desorption which can be lowered by taking into account the effect of the welding method and conditions on the weld surface roughness, shielding gas rate, and protective device design on the development of nonmetallic inclusions, evaporation products, and changes in the phase composition of the heat affected area surface.
