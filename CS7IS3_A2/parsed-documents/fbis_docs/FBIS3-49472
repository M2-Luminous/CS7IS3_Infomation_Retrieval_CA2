The content of the talks was aimed at assessing the U.S. project Partnership for Peace. According to the prime minister, the project is valued by the Czech Government for the broad and liberal approach it offers its participants. U.S. interest in the development of regional cooperation, which, according to Madelaine Albright, is as important as the Czech Republic's good relations with the United States, was also debated. [Begin Klaus recording] I think the American side understands that if we protest sometimes it is rather a protest against certain empty regionalism, against artificial concepts that lead nowhere. As for real and good regional relations, we, I believe, say clearly yes. [end recording] [passage omitted]
