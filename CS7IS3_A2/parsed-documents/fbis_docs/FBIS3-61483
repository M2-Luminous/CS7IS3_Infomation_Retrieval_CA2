Schmidt of the Russian Academy of Sciences; submitted 24 Oct 92; UDC 550.34.013.2] [Abstract] Short-term precursors of earthquakes were defined as variations in a geophysical field that satisfy three primary conditions for the amplitude of the variation (it must exceed a precursor threshold equal to two standard deviations of the quantity in question during periods of seismic calm), the time interval prior to a particular seismic event (hours and days), and the distance from where the precursor was measured to the epicenter of the earthquake (epsilon[.sup]M[/] kilometers, where M equals magnitude). Each of these components of the definition was elaborated individually. This definition was then used as a basis for performing a statistical analysis of a wide variety of short-term precursors recorded at a number of observation stations over a large area around the epicenters prior to the Tanshan*** and Haichen*** earthquakes in China. The quantitative analysis of this data point to a definite correlation between the short-term precursors of an earthquake and the formation of its seismic focus. According to all the data available for this particular study, the value for the correlation between the time frame and amplitude of short-term precursors, on the one hand, and the distance of these precursors from an earthquake's epicenter and the magnitude of that particular earthquake, on the other, lies between 0.57 and 0.84, with an average value of 0.70. It was concluded that the statistical correlation between short-term anomalies in a geophysical field and specific earthquake parameters indicate that these anomalies are indeed precursors of actual earthquakes and that they should be used to forecast the time frame within which a particular seismic event is expected to occur.
