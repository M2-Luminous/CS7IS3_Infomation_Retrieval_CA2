These agreements are aimed at putting right the present injustice and giving to the F.R.Y. the status of principal Romania's economic partner, Mircea told Serbian Government Minister Dragan Tomic during their meeting, Serbian Information Ministry has announced. Even in the present situation, Romania has strived through allowed activities to maintain cooperation with Yugoslavia. During one year, it addressed to the sanctions committee one thousand requests for humanitarian exports to the F.R.Y., but only 334 of these requests worth 456 million dollars were granted. The Romanian Government believes that authorizations for humanitarian exports to the F.R.Y. should from now on be granted more speedily and frequently, and will persevere in its requests to this end, the ministry communique says. Tomic said that his talks with the Romanian delegation, which comprises government repgesentatives, businessmen and experts in economic development, were paving the way for a more fruitful economic cooperation in all fields in the joint interest, as soon as sanctions are lifted. The cooperation continues even in conditions of international embargo, which is causing great losses to Yugoslav and Romanian economies, he added. The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions on Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) on May 31, 1992 because of Yugoslavia's alleged military involvement in the civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The arrival of the Romanian delegation for a several-day visit to Serbia was agreed at the highest state level during Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's visit to Romania last month. During that visit, the two sides had expressed interest in market transformation, privatization and economic integration in the Balkans, especially as the united Europe is now finalizing its own integration process, the communique said.
