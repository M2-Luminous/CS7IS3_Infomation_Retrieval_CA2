They have authorised local authorities in Denmark to offer grants of up to 20 percent for the setting-up and expansion of Research Parks. The purpose of Research Parks is to promote a closer cooperation between firms and universities. The grants will slightly ease the burden of paying for the park's facilities and will partly finance the consultancy services offered to resident firms. Such benefits will be below the aid intensity of 50 percent allowed under the SME [small and medium-sized enterprises] guidelines for soft aid. The research Park is, in principle, open to all firms, but in practise it is almost entirely small companies (5-50 employees) which have been established in the existing Parks (150-200 firms). The maximum grant local authorities will be allowed to offer a Research Park will be around ECU1.3 million. On 16 February, the Commission gave the green light to a Spanish R&D State aid scheme for the aeronautical sector, which provides advances which are repaid in the event of a profitable return. It is pointed out that, in order to upgrade Spanish aerospace technology and meet the challenges of the next decade, specific efforts need to be focused on important strategic objectives. Depending on the availability of funds, the total maximum budget appropriations for the implementation of the Plan will be approximately ECU105 million from 1993 to 1998. The firms likely to participate in the Plan are geographically dispersed and often in Less Favoured Areas (LFAs), as defined by the Commission. The firms benefitting will repay the State contributions in the light of the application of the results of the applied research/development to products which they market, either individually or within national or international cooperation programmes. Where basic industrial research is all that is carried out, the relationship with marketable products will come from the application of the knowledge acquired as aerospace equipment is developed and then marketed. Interest will be charged at 9 percent or at the cost of borrowing on the international market. If the recipient does not implement the project in respect of which aid is granted, the advance is repayable in full with interest. The Spanish authorities have confirmed that the final aid intensity for applied research/development will conform to the Community framework for State aids for R&D (OJ C83/2 of 11-4-86) and previous Commission decisions. The Commission therefore raised no objections to the scheme under the application of Articles 92(3)(C) of the EC Treaty and 61(3)(c) of the EEA [European Economic Area] Treaty. Regarding the implementation of the German R&D State aid scheme, "Basistechnologien der Informationstechnik" [Basic Technologies in Information Technology], the Commission has also raised no objections. The aim of this programme is to strengthen basic research in the field of micro- and optoelectronics on materials other than silicon. The scheme aims to support fundamental and basic industrial research relating to the Community framework for State aids for R&D. The notified scheme is intended to follow a programme already approved by the Commission which lasted until the end of 1993. Those benefitting from the programmes include research institutes, enterprises and universities. The budget amounts to ECU194 million from 1994 to 1998. According to the Community framework for State aids for R&D, aid to scientific institutions, is not considered to be State aid as far as the EC-Treaty and the EEA-Treaty are concerned, unless the R&D activities are undertaken on a contractual basis or in collaboration with the private sector. In so far as universities and research institutes are conducting fundamental research, its financing is not regarded as State aid. The financing of collaborative projects between such institutes and the private sector, however, is considered as State aid. It follows from the criteria laid down in the Community framework for State aids for R&D that the aid intensity in relation to the distance to the market place has to be considered as the most important element when assessing the impact of the aid scheme on trade and competition. The notified intensity of 50-percent gross for basic industrial research projects, 60-percent gross for this type of research in the New Lander, 60 percent for SMEs and 65 percent for SMEs conducting such research in the New Lander is in accordance with the Community framework for State aids for R&D and previous decisions by the Commission.
