Doonan] [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi was received as a hero by about 10,000 jubilant supporters in Ulundi on Wednesday [20 March] at his first rally in support of next week's elections. The mood in the kwaZulu capital throughout Wednesday was one of excitement and celebration, following the IFP's decision on Tuesday to contest the country's first all-race poll. Thousands of singing and dancing IFP supporters streamed through central Ulundi during the day, before gathering outside the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly building to hear Mr Buthelezi's first pro- election address. "Who is the president of South Africa?" an official asked the excited crowd, which responded with a resounding: "Shenge (Mr Buthelezi's clan name)." The crowd sang, danced and ululated in a jubilant celebration of the impending election. Despite being three hours late Mr Buthelezi arrived to overwhelming cheers. In his address he acknowledged there was little time for electioneering, but said: "Miracles may still happen." He urged his followers not to be complacent, but to face the "biggest hurdle which is the election". The IFP president said he had been serving his people for 40 years and "now that my dream is coming true, I hope you will allow me to complete my job by electing me". The IFP had joined the elections to save the country from disaster and to contribute to peace, he said. The IFP's participation in national elections would not lead to an immediate reduction in violence but the "proportion of violence will be less," he added. The party's late entry into the elections would hamper its performance because voter education had not reached all his supporters. Asked whether he expected to fare well in next week's elections, Mr Buthelezi said he did not want to predict what would happen, but added "that will be tested". "Some of our offices can't cope with the number of people joining," Mr Buthelezi said. He later told a news conference he would accept the results of South Africa's first all-race [passage indistinct]. "One must accept that whatever the international monitors say will be it -- whatever one's feelings may be." On the IFP's election candidate lists, Mr Buthelezi said these were still being drafted. He however "assumed" he would head the party list for the national assembly. "As national leader of the party I have to be on the national list. One can't appear on both," he said in response to a question on whether he was eyeing the kwaZulu Natal premiership position.
