The draft project was submitted to the Ministers' Cabinet in March. Authors of the program claim that the draft is drawn by the private initiative, not by the order of government, and is based on scenario of government activity, with specific targets and roles of economic institutions. Before submission, the draft was agreed with all these institutions. Project includes the acceptance of 87 laws and sub-law acts providing the necessary conditions for normal functioning of economy. To this instant, told the authors, the project has been cut almost for a half and divided into several units. "This violates the project integrity and makes the program impractical".
