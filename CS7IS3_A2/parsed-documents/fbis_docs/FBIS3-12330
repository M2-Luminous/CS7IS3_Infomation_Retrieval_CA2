It was perpetrated by armed settlers in collusion with, and with the participation of, the army guard which was guarding this area. The latter had taken part in the opening of fire against our kinfolk in al-Khalil area [following the massacre] killing 8 martyrs and injuring 28. Clashes flared up in all our land, in Gaza, Nablus, Jenin, in Galilee, in Bethlehem, in Khan Yunis, in Rafah, in Qalandiyah, in Jerusalem. Even in Jerusalem, people performing the Friday prayers today were subjected to an attack by special units of the [Israeli] army resulting in between 60 to 65 injured. I have put the president in the picture of all these matters in detail, and of the collusion between the armed settlers and some elements in the Israeli Army. I would like to add also that we have called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council because we are now in need for an international force to protect our people, our kinfolk, our children and women, and the conspiracy has now become clear, aimed at all our people and all our kinfolk, and it clearly exposes the dangers caused by settlements and settlers. I want to say all these things, and I have coordinated with the president so that he may help us whether at the international, local, or UN level, or all levels. In my own name, I have thanked him for the noble feelings showed by Tunisia in this terrible loss. This is not surprising on the part of Tunisia, and its president, government and people. Despite the large-scale nature and size of the tragedy concerning this massacre, our people, the people of martyrs, freemen and mujahidin, will bear it as it has borne before it many blows dealt to it by these dangerous elements. At any rate, clearly what is meant is to deal a blow at the heart of the peace process, and the dimensions of this conspiracy have become clear. In this respect, I address myself to the two cosponsors of the peace conference who had signed with us the agreement last September in the White House, to all the international community and to the members of the Security Council, whether the permanent ones or the non-permanent ones, to take up their tasks and shoulder their responsibilities at all levels to face up to this serious development. Thank you.
