The congressional Permanent Commission has referred to the fact that the U.S. House of Representatives has instituted a series of hearings to evaluate the status of human rights in various places in the world, including the events in Chiapas. Despite certain coincidences, the six Mexican political parties have failed to reach a consensus, however; consequently, two different points of agreement were produced to establish the position of the Mexican Congress. Senator Gustavo Salinas has read a statement in the name of the PRI [Revolutionary Institutional Party], the PPS [Popular Socialist Party], the Cardenist Front for the National Reconstruction Party, and PARM [Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution]. [Begin Senator Salinas recording] The congressional Permanent Commission hereby rejects absolutely the idea of hearings being held in the U.S. House of Representatives to debate matters that are exclusively Mexican. Such activities cannot be permitted to lead to intervention in our country. [end recording] PRD [Party for the Democratic Revolution] Deputy Alejandro Encinas spoke in the name of his party and PAN [National Action Party]. [Begin Encinas recording] We think it is desirable for the Mexican Congress to call for public hearings on violations of human rights, particularly against Mexicans living in the United States. This is a duty we should do as responsible citizens. [end recording] During the Permanent Commission session, it was agreed that no special sessions will be held in February and that a consensus should be sought among all parties.
