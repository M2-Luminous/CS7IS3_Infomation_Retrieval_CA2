A police investigation directed against terrorist activity is under the personal control of the prime minister. All materials from the investigation of the bomb blast that occurred in front of the Kadrioru police department are being turned over to the prime minister. As is known, an explosion occurred the evening of November 14 in Tallinn in front of the Kadrioru police department, which injured two policemen and demolished three police patrol cars. On 28 October, a bomb exploded at 10:25 p.m. in front of the same police department, which destroyed two police cars. "The explosions demonstrate that the Estonian police have started to feel open to attack. Earlier there wasn't any thought of bombing the police, but now evidently the need to intimidate the police has arisen," explained Laar. The fight against crime is one of the most important tasks for 1994, assured the prime minister. "It's reason to believe that a merciless war with criminals has started," noted Laar. The prime minister assured that the state would provide for its police officers, who had suffered injuries in the attacks against the police. In the words of the prime minister, the families of these police officers would be cared for as well. An allotment of Israeli purchased arms will go towards replacing police weapons. "In connection with the bomb explosions of the Kadrioru police department building, Tallinn Police Commissioner is doing all that is possible in finding those responsible for this crime and restoring law and security in the city," a representative from the Tallinn Police Commissioner's Press Department told the ETA. The Tallinn criminal investigation department is currently checking on several possible theories in a joint effort with representatives of the Defense Police. In their operation, the Commissioner's criminal investigators have discovered 8 kilograms illegally held explosives, weapons and detonators. Twelve people have been arrested. Their involvement with the bombing is being verified. Tallinn police commissioner Ralf Palo added, that considering the extraordinary occurrence, a 5,000-10,000 kroon reward is being offered to anyone who can inform the police of crucially important facts in one's possession which can aid in the investigation of the explosions. Anonymity is guaranteed.
