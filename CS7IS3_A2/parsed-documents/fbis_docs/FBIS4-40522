This was stated in an exclusive interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent by Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia. He is heading Georgia's delegation at the international forum devoted to the problems of East-West relations which started here on Thursday. "We regard this action with hope," the head of the Georgian Government noted, "and think that it should not be restricted solely to the bounds of Gali Rayon." He called the results of the visit to Georgia by Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev "encouraging," having stressed that "common approaches were achieved which allowed a number of agreements to be signed." "In relations with Russia," O.Patsatsia said, "we are returning to what it ought to be -- to friendship. We cannot get away from that." At the same time, it is necessary to continue the active quests for ways of attaining a peaceful political settlement to the conflict, the prime minister pointed out, having admitted that "this process will be a lengthy and delicate one." In Crans-Montana he intends to discuss this issue with (Eduard Brunner), the special representative of the UN secretary general. Commenting, at the request of ITAR-TASS, on the stand taken by the Georgian prime minister, Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation, who is head of the delegation at the Crans-Montana forum, noted: "This is not the first time we have been able to see for ourselves that Georgia's progress, the prospects for development that are opening up before her are directly linked with Russia. There is no other way. Russia has saved Georgia from internal division and outside threat more than once, and therefore orientation on Russia corresponds to the interests of Georgia." This is also important for Russia, he continued, since any destabilization in this region has a direct effect on us too. It is sufficient to recall that approximately 100,000 refugees from Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been forced to seek refuge on the territory of Russia. R. Abdulatipov spoke out in support of the decision of Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin to deploy peace-keeping forces in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone and expressed the hope that, in discussing this issue on 21 June, the Federation Council would also express itself in favor of this measure. In the opinion of the deputy chairman of the Federation Council, "Russia is not interested in servicemen from other states taking part in the peace-keeping forces since it is a question of the zone of her national interests." The interference of any other forces, he thinks, will not promote stability in the region. "For the moment I can only remind you that it is largely thanks to the Russian peace-keeping forces that they have practically managed to put an end to the war in South Ossetia, and thanks to Russian soldiers and officers peace is being maintained there and the situation is gradually getting back to normal," R. Abdulatipov pointed out.
