With violence still unacceptably high and the fact that a state of emergency is in operation, what are the chances of a free and fair election there? On the line to Steven Lange, we have the chairman of the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], Judge Johann Kriegler: [Begin recording] [Kriegler] A very short while that it's been in operation, but the prospects are that it would improve the outlook for a substantially free and fair election in kwaZulu-Natal. To the extent that it enhances stability, law and order, free movement of people without fear of harm, it can only be beneficial. [Lange] Is the state of emergency having the desired effect, from what you've heard so far? [Kriegler] So far, certainly yes. But it's early days yet, I repeat. [Lange] Have you had cooperation from the kwaZulu administration? [Kriegler] No, not the requisite degree. We've had a very close look at the extent to which we could mount an election with the cooperation that has been offered. The subcommittee is due to report to us tomorrow. But the last report that I had from our side was that it didn't look as if we were really getting a great deal of cooperation. [Lange] In what respect is it failing? [Kriegler] Well, it's failing in the will. The word is there, but the will is not there. You know, our officials can work for you provided they're available, provided they're not engaged in essential services, provided they realize that in the political climate they're taking an enormous risk -- that kind of ostensible support, but really not. [Lange] Do you sense a sort of passive resistance? [Kriegler] Yes. There used to be a term in the old British army called dumb insolence -- you know, you go along, but you do so with such obvious ill-will and unwillingness that in fact it's tantamount to disobeying. [Lange] Over the weekend Chief Minister Buthelezi suggested that the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] might still participate in the elections. Is this logistically possible? [Kriegler] On the ballot paper as it is, on the planning of the election, the legislation as it stands, it's not possible. The only feasible means that I can imagine -- but then, I don't have all of the options necessarily in mind -- the only feasible option is for them to join in, in collaboration with a party already in the ballot paper, otherwise there's no way that I can see them joining in this particular election on the 26th, 27th, 28th. [Lange] So the IFP will not appear on the ballot paper? [Kriegler] No, it simply can't. We've been printing those ballot papers for weeks and weeks now, and we cut it very short as it is, to allow late participants an opportunity to come in, and there's no way that we can start reprinting and have ballot papers available for the predetermined election days with other runners on.
