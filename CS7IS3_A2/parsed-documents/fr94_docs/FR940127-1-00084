However, the Secretary may issue special instructions for payment by methods other than those in §163.22; and (e) Performance bonds may or may not be required in connection with operations on Indian land by such enterprises as determined by the Secretary. §163.14 Sale of forest products. (a) Consistent with the economic objectives of the tribe and with the consent of the Secretary and authorized tribal representatives, open market sales of Indian forest products may be authorized. Such sales require consent of the authorized representatives of the tribe for the sale of tribal forest products, and the owners of a majority Indian interest on individually owned lands. Open market sales of forest products from Indian land located off reservations will be permitted with the consent of the Secretary and majority Indian interest of the beneficial owner(s). (b) On Indian forest land not formally designated for retention in its natural state, the Secretary may sell the forest products without the consent of the owner(s) when in his or her judgment such action is necessary to prevent loss of value resulting from fire, insects, diseases, windthrow or other catastrophes. (c) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, each sale of forest products having an estimated stumpage value exceeding $15,000 will not be approved until: (1) An examination of the forest products to be sold has been made by a forest officer; and (2) A report setting forth all pertinent information has been submitted to the approving officer as provided in §163.20. (d) With the approval of the Secretary, authorized Indian owners who have been duly apprised as to the value of the forest products to be sold, may sell or transfer forest products for less than the appraised value. (e) Except as provided in §163.14(d), in all such sales, the forest products shall be appraised and sold at stumpage rates not less than those established by the Secretary. §163.15 Advertisement of sales. Except as provided in §§163.13, 163.14, 163.16, and 163.26, sales of forest products shall be made only after advertising. (a) The advertisement shall be approved by the officer who will approve the instrument of sale. Advertised sales shall be made under sealed bids, or at public auction, or under a combination thereof. The advertisement may limit sales of Indian forest products to Indian forest enterprises, members of the tribe, or may grant to Indian forest enterprises and/or members of the tribe who submitted bids the right to meet the higher bid of a non-member. If the estimated stumpage value of the forest products offered does not exceed $15,000, the advertisement may be made by posters and circular letters. If the estimated stumpage value exceeds $15,000, the advertisement shall also be made in at least one edition of a newspaper of general circulation in the locality where the forest products are situated. If the estimated stumpage value does not exceed $50,000, the advertisement shall be made for not less than 15 days; if the estimated stumpage value exceeds $50,000 but not $250,000, for not less than 30 days; and if the estimated stumpage value exceeds $250,000, for not less than 60 days. (b) The approving officer may reduce the advertising period because of emergencies such as fire, insect attack, blowdown, limitation of time, or when there would be no practical advantage in advertising for the prescribed period. (c) If no instrument of sale is executed after such advertisement, the approving officer may, within one year from the last day on which bids were to be received as defined in the advertisement, permit the sale of such forest products. The sale will be made upon the terms and conditions in the advertisement and at not less than the advertised value or the appraised value at the time of sale, whichever is greater.
