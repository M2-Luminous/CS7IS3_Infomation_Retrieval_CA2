FR940805-0-00042 FR940805-0-00014 There were no comments received by this NPRM; therefore, no changes were made. Regulatory Evaluation This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full evaluation is unnecessary. This rule conforms terminology and cross references throughout Coast Guard regulations with a new, already established classification system. It will have no economic impact. Small Entities This regulation is administrative in nature and conforms existing regulations to a new system for classifying and labeling explosives. It will have no economic impact on entities large or small. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule involves administrative changes in terminology and clearly does not have any environmental impact. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under `` ADDRESSES .''
