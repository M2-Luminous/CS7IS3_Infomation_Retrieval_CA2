A Foreign Ministry statement on the subject noted that two religious officials who left for western Thrace yesterday, were sent back by Greek authorities at the Ipsala border checkpoint. The statement added that the Greek ambassador to Ankara was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and a protest was lodged with Greece in connection with the incident. The statement said: There is a lesson to be learned with regard to contemporary concepts and norms from the fact that Greece -- a member of the European Union -- is unable to tolerate an invitation to two religious officials from abroad extended by a minority in the country in order to meet their needs for worship during a holy month.
