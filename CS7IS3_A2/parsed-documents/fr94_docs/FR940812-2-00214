FR940812-2-00214 FR940812-2-00076 6. The differences between the respective Acquiring Funds and Acquired Funds are principally in their respective rule 12b&hyph;1 plans and in the customers to whom they are marketed, not in their objectives, policies, and restrictions. The Board has determined that these differences can be accommodated with equal effectiveness by combining the funds that have an identity of objectives, policies, and restrictions and by instituting a ``multiple class'' structure in the surviving funds. These contemplated ``multiple class'' arrangements are not the subject of the application, but their approval by FAF shareholders is a condition to the closing of the Reorganizations. 1 The Board has further determined that significant advantages may accrue to shareholders of the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring Funds as a result of the proposed combinations. 1 SEI Financial Services Company, the distributor for each series of FAF, has obtained an exemptive order permitting funds distributed by it to issue multiple classes. Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19698 (Sept. 9, 1993) (notice) and 19757 (Oct. 4, 1993) (order). 7. The expected advantages to the Acquired Funds and Acquiring Funds considered by the Board include the elimination of certain duplicative expenses of separate funds; spreading of relatively fixed expenses across larger asset bases; potential increased sales of the surviving funds due to the addition of new classes and channels of distribution; and facilitation of portfolio management. The potential benefits to the Adviser considered by the Board include potentially reduced expenses for advisory fee waivers to the extent that the total expense ratios before waivers of the combined funds decrease as a result of the Reorganizations. The Board found that the expected advantages to the Acquiring Funds and the Acquired Funds outweighed the potential benefits to the Adviser. 8. Applicants agree not to make any material changes to the reorganization agreements that affect the application without the prior approval of the SEC staff. Applicants also have agreed not to waive, amend or modify any provision of the reorganization agreements that is required by state or federal law in order to effect the Reorganizations. 9. A registration statement on Form N&hyph;14 will be filed with the Commission with respect to the Reorganizations. A special meeting of shareholders of FAF will be held to consider and act upon the Reorganizations in accordance with the Act and Minnesota law. At the special meeting, FAF shareholders also will consider and act upon proposals to authorize the issuance of shares of each series of FAF in multiple classes and to institute or modify rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plans with respect to certain of these classes. If these proposals are approved by shareholders and the Reorganizations are consummated, after the Reorganizations FAF will consist of three series: a ``Money Fund'' series (currently Institutional Money Fund); a ``Government Fund'' series (currently Institutional Government Fund); and a ``Treasury Fund'' series (currently CT Treasury Fund), each of which will be offered in three classes. 10. If the proposed Reorganizations and multiple class structure are approved by shareholders, former shareholders of Money Fund would become shareholders of the new Retail Class of the current Institutional Money Fund, and former shareholders of CT Government Fund would become shareholders of the new Corporate Treasury Class of the current Institutional Government Fund. 11. Investment advisory fees would remain unchanged at .40% of average daily net assets for former shareholders of Money Fund when they become shareholders of Institutional Money Fund. Investment advisory fees would decrease from .50% to .40% of average daily net assets for former shareholders of CT Government Fund when they become shareholders of Institutional Government Fund. The Adviser has agreed to waive advisory fees and reimburse expenses with respect to the new Retail Class of Institutional Money Fund to the extent that total expenses of such class exceed .75% of average daily net assets, and to waive advisory fees and reimburse expenses with respect to the new Corporate Treasury Class of Institutional Government Fund to the extent that total expenses of such classes exceed .60% of average daily net assets, in each case through July 31, 1995. The differential among classes in the total expense cap agreed to by the Adviser is and will be equal to the differential in rule 12b&hyph;1 fees applicable to the respective classes. As a result, through such date former Acquired Fund shareholders will retain the benefit of the fee waivers currently applicable to them following the Reorganization.
