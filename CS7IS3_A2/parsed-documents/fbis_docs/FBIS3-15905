The Lilas Island, a bulk carrier chartered by the Cubans and flying the Panamanian flag, left the Ukrainian port near Odessa carrying 100 tonnes of powdered milk, 210 tonnes of canned meat, 50 tonnes of medicines, and other goods bound for Cuba. This consignment of humanitarian aid has been put together by several governmental and public organizations in Ukraine, notably the young people's fund "Children of Chernobyl." This is not the first such humanitarian action by Ukraine toward Cuba as a mark of gratitude for its participation in the treatment and recuperation of children affected by the Chernobyl accident.
