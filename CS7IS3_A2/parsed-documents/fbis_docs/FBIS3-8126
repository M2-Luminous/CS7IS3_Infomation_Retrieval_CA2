Also present were chairmen of the government coalition parties -- Jan Kalvoda of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), Josef Lux of the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and Ivan Pilip of the Christian Democratic Party (KDS). Premier Klaus is also chairman of the fourth government coalition party -- the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). Havel said the Czech Republic's security situation from the long-term perspective and the Czech security relations were discussed at the meeting, organised by Zieleniec. Klaus characterised the meeting as a "conceptual philosophic debate" and "clarifying of general matters." He said that similar meetings serve to diminish the number of political statements which harm the Czech Republic's reputation abroad. Baudys told journalists that neither his proposal for solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina nor the Czech-German relations have been discussed. Parliament Deputy Chairman Jan Kasal told CTK today that Baudys has interrupted his vacation to attend the meeting. Deputy Foreign Ministers Pavel Bratinka and Alexandr Vondra were reportedly also present at the meeting.
