Something is changing in the subdued atmosphere that has surrounded the government majority's first steps. The bulldozer thrust which began immediately after the elections seems to have suddenly ended, and a sinister creaking seems to be emerging from the leaderships of the majority parties. It should be assessed for what it is, without dismissing it and without any pointless optimism. [Northern League Secretary] Bossi called for a pause for reflection in the negotiations. [Prime Minister-Designate] Berlusconi replied to him curtly, "I will continue." Bossi demanded the Interior Ministry. [National Alliance leader] Fini sent him the following message, via the press agencies: "I would not grant the Interior Ministry to the League." Bossi demanded, like others in the consultations, a separation of powers between the prime ministership and ownership of economic, financial, and media concerns. Berlusconi replied by appointing three watchdogs, which even such a moderate as Sergio Romano described as "a false step: It is as though a `defendant' had the right to choose `his own judge.'" I believe that even Bossi knows that he cannot continue indefinitely to make loud protests while at the same time reaching petty agreements. His electoral strength has already been greatly reduced. And he really does risk finding himself in the government as an irksome and subordinate ally, rather like some of the nonconfessional parties in the old five-party coalition. Meanwhile, the prime minister, who is striving to project an image of "prudence and moderation," is having to take account of the broadsides coming from several directions. Including the most unexpected ones. When someone yesterday brought to his attention the critical interview given by prospective foreign minister Antonio Martino, Berlusconi replied confidently: "I have not read the interview; I will certainly find expressions of respect and esteem in it." Let us mention some of Martino's expressions of "esteem" in his regard: "Berlusconi has been infected by the virus of politics more seriously than you can even imagine." And, asked by the interviewer for his opinion about the meetings with the social partners, he replied: "I do not approve of them at all. How could I deny it?" Then there are [Northern League Senate floor leader] Speroni's attack on Martino, the MSI's [Italian Social Movement] questioning of the Osimo Treaty, and the Christian Democratic Center raising its voice. And [Radical leader] Pannella, who is constantly losing ground. He was foreign minister, then justice minister. Now there is talk of an Environment Ministry post for Emma Bonina -- maybe. Really. Meanwhile the demands that Berlusconi should have expected are coming from both at home and abroad. Berlusconi assured Professor Modigliani "that there will be no fascist ministers in the government." We shall see. When the prime minister announced his own candidacy in the European elections, as a joke, he received a deluge of criticisms. As though to secure guarantees of Europeanism, Kohl's party asked "Forza Italia" to join the Christian Democratic group in Europe. And the Socialist parties have announced that they will not attend European meetings with fascist ministers. A fine mess, in other words. Domestic problems and natural tensions and anxieties abroad. It is fortunate that everything started under the banner of speed, decisiveness, lack of negotiations, and the new republic. There is no need to point out that, in the process of forming his government, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi displayed much greater autonomy than has been seen at the "majority summit meetings." Everything resembles the old games, a return to the old Cencelli manual [supposed rules for spoils sharing], to cunning, and to tactical, affected games. This is the situation just over a month after the victory of the right-wing forces. And we must wait and see what will happen when Berlusconi is in government and has to meet the expectations, hopes, and promises -- often very conflicting -- which he created during the election campaign and which granted him victory. A major scope for initiative could open up for the opposition. This, on condition that it makes itself heard at once. As long as it shows that it has understood that in the new political system a new kind of opposition is necessary too. New, because, for the first time since the war, it finds itself confronted with a genuinely right-wing government. And because, more than ever before, it will have the task of waging a tough battle while at the same time indicating feasible and alternative solutions. There will be several oppositions, including one of the center. It is by no means a bad thing that it expresses itself with an identity of its own. It is in the battles of the months ahead that the various tendencies of Italian democrats will make themselves known and will be able to identify, through opposition, whatever convergences and progress they can achieve together. Meanwhile, on the Left, we should, as I have already said, put an end to the endless talk about possible leaderships and also to the boring litany of tears. This, because we must feel a duty. That of meeting the expectations of a million Italians who voted for the progressive forces. The intermission is over. Now we must start the race. And it is a new, difficult, and fascinating one.
