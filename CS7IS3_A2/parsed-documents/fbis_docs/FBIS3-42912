What Awaits Us Ahead"] [Text] According to information from the All-Russian Center for the Standard of Living (VTsUZh) under the Ministry of Labor of the Russian Federation, the proportion of the population in Russia living below the poverty line was 32 percent in July 1993 and had more than doubled as compared to the same period of 1992. Here the lower limit of poverty was taken as the budget of the subsistence minimum or, as we usually say, "subsistence minimum." According to data of the VTsUZh, its level in monetary terms varies depending on regional peculiarities. Thus it is highest in the Far East, in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, and in Amur Oblast, and it is lower than others in the Central Chernozem regions of Russia, Rostov Oblast, and the Republic of Tatarstan. In December the value figure of the subsistence minimum for Tatarstan amounted to 24,000 rubles [R], while the average for Russia was R44,350. In order to evaluate the standard of living we now use the concept of subsistence minimum and not minimum consumer budget. Although society cannot for very long allow itself to be oriented toward the subsistence minimum (lower limit of poverty), which makes it possible to make ends meet only with difficulty. This is why it is necessary to prepare for a shift to indicators of the minimum consumer budget, which is considerably higher than the subsistence minimum and is essentially the upper limit of poverty. Recently the appearance of new sources of income for the population has led to rapid changes in the social structure of society and further separation in terms of income levels. Last year the average per capita income of the most well-off 10 percent of the population increased at the most rapid rates. In September 1993 they increased 15-fold as compared to September 1992 (for the least well-off--12-fold). The difference between the per capita incomes of the wealthiest 10 percent and the poorest 10 percent of the population was 10.2-fold as compared to 8.2-fold in September of the preceding year. The wealthiest 20 percent of the population accounts for 43 percent of all the monetary incomes, and the 20 percent of the population with the lowest incomes--7 percent. In 1991 these figures were 36 and 9.4 percent, respectively. The ratios for Tatarstan are approximately the same as for the Russian Federation in 1992. This is if the subsistence minimum is used for evaluation. But if one takes the amount of the minimum consumer budget, the picture shows even sharper contrasts. This is why our republic's government devotes so much attention to questions of social protection when conducting the economic reforms. Moreover, while at the beginning of the year, in keeping with the Program for Targeted Social Protection, assistance from the state was received by practically all of the republic's population, today it is received specifically by the underprivileged. In April 1993 a permanent republic commission for implementing the Program for Targeted Social Protection was formed under the Government of Tatarstan. This resulted in the creation of a comprehensive system that makes it possible to improve methods of state regulation of the economy during the process of conducting the reforms. On the commission's initiative, laws were adopted on the minimum wage and the subsistence minimum and went into force effective 1 January 1994. This means that the minimum wage cannot be below the subsistence minimum. Changes were made in the Program for Targeted Social Protection that keep the standard of living of underprivileged groups of the population from dropping. We all understand that the state can render assistance to the underprivileged and unfortunate and guarantee a minimum wage at the level of the subsistence minimum only if the economy is functioning normally and the budget is being augmented. Unfortunately, 1994, like last year, is beginning with a decline in production, profit, and investments...and nonetheless, according to predictions of analysts of the Center for Social Problems, in 1994 the rates of the economic decline should slow up. The volumes of industrial production will decrease, but not as severely as last year (5-6 percent as against 18 percent). The volume of investments will probably remain at the current level. In today's economic and political conditions it is difficult to imagine large-scale reconstruction of the economy or large structural changes. We found this out for ourselves from the example of YelAZ and the KamAZ Engine Plant. Obviously, this year the main "players" in the structural rearrangement will be the enterprises themselves. Let us hope that they will begin more actively to change the profile of production for their own development and economic growth. One can assume that, having learned from bitter experience in overstocking finished products, the producer enterprises will be oriented toward satisfying the effective demand. Then productions that cannot compete will be shut down and capital investments from ineffective productions will shift to effective ones and, naturally, there will be a stronger tendency toward the formation of prices that precisely reflect expenditures and conditions of demand. And this, in turn, will exert an influence on inflation as well. For, according to preliminary data, in 1993 inflation amounted to about 1,000 percent and prices grew on average 10-fold (in 1992--30-fold). And if a strict finance-credit policy is observed and relations between the federal and republic budgets are clearly defined, in 1994 we can count on an easing of inflation. Then it will be possible to predict also a stabilization of the standard of living of most of the republic's population. At the same time there will be a sharp increase in expenditures by the population on municipal services and transportation costs. It is known that these branches are surviving on state subsidies here. But it is also known that if the producer is subsidized, the branch is subject to stagnation. In other words, if society has a social need for certain goods or services and their production is costly or too expensive for the consumers, it is not the producer who should be subsidized but the specific consumer himself. And conditions must be created for the branches whereby the operation of their enterprises is profitable. All these issues must be resolved during the forthcoming year. A great deal, of course, will depend on the course of the economic reforms in the republic. But the solutions to certain problems are obviously being dragged out. Thus while small-scale privatization has almost been completed in the Russian Federation, in our republic only 2 percent of the enterprises in retail trade have been turned over to private hands, and the volume of commodity turnover in retail trade was 5.6 percent during the 10 months as compared to 32.6 percent in the Russian Federation. Now about unemployment. In 1993 it held at the level of 0.2 percent (as against 1 percent on average for the Russian Federation). According to the economic theory of the market economy it is necessary to choose: either high inflation or a further decline in the economy but a small percentage of unemployment (as now), or suppression of inflation and strengthening of the ruble but inevitable bankruptcy of enterprises and growth of unemployment. The inevitability of these alternatives is confirmed by world practice, but the ratio between them can be regulated. If we awaken a spirit of entrepreneurship and resourcefulness that lies dormant in each person, if we create conditions that support entrepreneurship (the system of taxation, credit policy, and the code of laws on entrepreneurship), this will also entail the creation of new jobs and, hence, both a reduction of unemployment and an increase in production volumes. And so during the year that has begun there are preconditions in the republic's economy for overcoming the crisis phenomena caused by the transition to the market. In certain branches stabilization and even an insignificant growth of production have occurred. Therefore it is possible to count on 1994 being a year of hope and real positive changes.
