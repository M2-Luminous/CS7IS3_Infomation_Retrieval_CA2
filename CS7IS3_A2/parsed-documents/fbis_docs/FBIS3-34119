In a speech to the 59th session of ministers of the Organisation of African Unity in Addis Ababa, the assistant secretary general of the Arab League said that we call for all resolutions adopted by the Arab League, the Organisation for African Unity, the Islamic Conference Organisation and the Nonaligned Movement to be complied with.
