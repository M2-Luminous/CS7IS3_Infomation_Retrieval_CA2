Dotted with metal studded inspection portholes, draped with power cables, lit by a flashing green laser beam, and surrounded by display monitors, it looks just like any another laboratory. In the basement of the Claude Bernard University in Lyons, accessed by a narrow corridor, there is nothing to indicate to the visitor that what he has before him is a machine unique in Europe. Nonetheless, it plays a key role in the study of material in grains so small that you can almost count the exact number of atoms -- what the experts call aggregate structures. This intermediate state of matter, known scientifically as mesoscopic, comes between the atom (or the molecule) and the larger compact solid. Rich in new properties that probably lie at the heart of macroscopic phenomena -- crystal growth, conduction, magnetism -- until recently aggregates had been an enigma for physicists. Hard to produce -- in small ovens -- they had been ephemeral, giving just enough time for a small peek and a rapid analysis. Times have changed: physicists have now managed to tame them. Here they are produced by a combination of the two extremes of very hot and very cold: burning laser shots and cooling jets of helium. The heat of the laser is powerful enough to vaporize even the most heat-resistant of substances, such as carbon which requires a temperature of 4,000� C. Helium -- or argon -- injected at the same frequency as the laser pulses, expands and leads to a sudden and violent refrigeration to around 0K (-278� C). The aggregates are thus not given enough time to recombine with their neighbors. They are analyzed by their "flight" in the machine. This is common practice, and is also used at Lyons to sort them by mass. Then, after they have been sorted, the less common practice is performed of spreading them out in layers on thin plates. Only a few laboratories can do this, notably the AT&T laboratories in Murray Hill in the United States, and the federal polytechnique school in Lausanne, Switzerland. Physicists rarely lack the adjectives to qualify matter: "condensed," "soft," and now we have "divided," to use the word employed by experts in aggregates and adopted by Michel Broyer. Professor, laboratory director, and master in the art of analyzing aggregates by the duration of their flight through the vacuum, he sums up in one sentence the aim being pursued: "to clarify the behavior of matter when it is prevented from forming a compact solid." In short, a little pile of atoms -- from three or four to a thousand -- of iron, nickel, silicon, cobalt, or carbon. Things can also be complicated slightly by using piles of assemblies of two types of atom. At a time when nuclei are smashed into a thousand pieces to determine their constituents, there is still much we do not know about the properties that these aggregates could reveal. How are they formed? What shapes do they take? What happens to their electrons? In thin layers, are they hard or soft, conductive or insulating? Will they prove useful for chemists, interesting for electronic engineers, or revolutionary in optical electronics? Used as projectiles, could these microscopic shells destroy a target substance? There are so many questions that the theorists remain rather guarded. Verbose on the subject of nuclei, specific on single atoms, they have little to say when it comes to this divided matter. This is an ideal situation for the three promoters of the Lyons pole and their experimental approach that has turned up so many surprises. Michel Broyer stresses: "We explore." The theorists can calculate the shape of an aggregate of up to 10 silicon atoms, but more than that, and they can only draw on approximate notions or theories for as long as there are not enough atoms to speak of a compact solid. Alain Perez is director of research at the National Scientific Research Center [CNRS], charged with designing and developing the source of aggregates in association with the Lyons group. He says: "Few predictions are possible in this domain." With his group and the group headed by A. Hoareau, the materials expert started the adventure with a gamble: No one could say for sure whether the aggregates would keep their specific structures and properties when they were deposited in layers on a substrate. Would they not, rather, "lose the memory" of their violent and imbalanced formation and reform as a conventional substance? The last of the three men, Albert Renouprez, leads a team in a chemistry lab close to the Claude Bernard University, specializing in catalysis. Chemists and aggregates go back a long way. The reactors in the oil industry have been using aggregates for a long time to crack long hydrocarbon molecules. They are commonly used in perfume manufacture and pharmacy. A recent CNRS report estimated that at least 20 percent of the GDP of the United States is generated from activities relating to substances obtained by catalysis. However, their production by chemical means -- as a platinum salt deposit on a plate and then stripping the salt off -- is certainly efficient, but it remains essentially an empirical process. It is difficult, in these conditions, to identify the chemical processes at work, and especially difficult to invent recipes based on new elements or mixed aggregates. Albert Renouprez admits: "We know absolutely nothing about the chemical properties of this type of aggregate." He has just obtained, using the vaporization source, the first samples of mixed platinum and palladium aggregates on silicon and graphite substrates. He sees the adventure leading to the possibility of working on "model" aggregates that could, perhaps, be applied to the catalytic exhausts of the future. Michel Broyer leads the way in this exemplary project of cooperation. It is his team at the ionic and molecular spectrometry laboratory (CNRS/Claude Bernard University) that is charged with identifying the aggregates formed in the vacuum chamber. The efficiency of the equipment in Lyons has sped up the research. When subjected to analysis, the aggregates reveal their secrets. In addition to their shapes and construction, physicists are interested in the properties of these aggregates. How many atoms does a metal need to conduct electricity? There is no theoretical answer to this question. Catherine Brechignac of the Aimo-Cotton laboratory in Orsay (CNRS coordinator of French teams working on aggregates) and Michel Broyer conducted experiments with mercury aggregates in the Orsay Lure laboratory for the use of electromagnetic radiation to study the transition from insulator to conductor in relation to the number of atoms. They saw that as long as there are less than 12 atoms, excitation remains limited to just one. The "current" -- a shared behavior affecting an electron population -- does not flow. From 12 atoms, the interaction between them intensifies and their electronic fields interconnect. Over 80 atoms, and electrons are knocked out of place. However, we need at least 1,000 atoms before we can really speak of electrical conduction. Even on this scale, the electrical and chemical properties of the aggregates are not always the same as those of the solid substance. Going one stage further, Michel Broyer is now examining "mixed" aggregates, cautiously combining the simplest of metals, lithium, with the simplest of atoms, hydrogen. The aggregates obtained consist of eight to 15 lithium atoms and one or two hydrogen atoms. He has discovered that the latter tend to form on the aggregate's surface. While Michel Broyer's team is refining its methods for precisely determining the aggregates produced, Alain Perez's team has been preparing the plates. After a relatively stringent sorting process, these plates capture aggregates at the end of their trajectory forming, in one hour, plates of up to a thousand angstroms thick over an area of one square centimeter. He exclaimed: "What we had hoped for has happened! The aggregates retain the memory of how they were formed and land unaltered on the substrate. This is a world first that opens up a whole new avenue of research." The initial guinea pigs were widely reported in the media, including the famous fullerenes (assemblies of carbon atoms, some of which -- between 20 and 60 atoms -- grouped together in little balls or even footballs). "In fact we have managed to isolate a whole series of families -- from the spherical and never-before seen C20, to the C900 -- which we chose because of their specific characteristics." Alain Perez talks enthusiastically of "an ideal technique for producing thin, nanostructured layers." The prefix nano is currently the vogue in laboratories, a sure sign of physicists' ambition to be able to manipulate matter one atom or one molecule at a time. The layers of carbon aggregates are organized in piles of spherical particles some 15 to 25 nanometers in diameter, as seen in atomic microscopes. Alain Perez manufactures strange "nano-sponges" on the surface of his plates. They combine the perfect order of aggregates at a short distance with the disorder of the layer where the aggregates are deposited at random. This crystalline/amorphous mixture can result in new and interesting electrical, magnetic, and optical properties. Alain Perez actually speaks of "new substance." The C20 nano-sponges, insulating and transparent, are almost as hard as diamond but have less than half the density, making them similar in mass to polymers. With aggregates of iron 20, iron 150, and nickel 200, the magnetic effects of the nanostructured layers differ considerably from solid substances. Alain Perez talks of a ferromagnetic state midway between amorphous and crystalline substances. It is possible that his small packets of aggregates, whose magnetism can be controlled, are the precursors to future, hyperdense magnetic computer memory. Other teams have shown that nanoporous layers of silicon are luminescent in the visible spectrum, although nobody really knows why. Will optronics engineers be able to use this phenomenon? Alain Perez insists: "Not all these properties could be deduced from the properties of aggregates. However, the initial experiments on carbon will serve as a reference for our future research on silicon." He is looking to build silicon aggregates with less than 30 atoms. Some theorists predict that they will be compact, with layers more dense than are found in solid blocks of the substance, thus producing a new metal phase... To summarize expert opinion, the last CNRS economic report speaks of the "major stakes" that are represented by thin layers of aggregates. Four hundred km from Lyons, another French team has declared war with aggregates. Figuratively (since it has just embarked two major scientists) and literally, as it aims to accelerate aggregates and use them as a shell to bombard matter with. A change of scenery, with big machines and warlike vocabulary. On the Orsay campus, the physicists working on the Tandem electrostatic accelerator -- a blue-colored machine some 30 meters long, built at the start of the 1970s -- have seized on these new projectiles. Accustomed to working with atomic ions, their job is to observe the reaction of a bombarded substance through the behavior of individual atoms. Using energy of around 100 million electron volts, they force the bombarded substance to emit ions, or even molecules in the case of organic matter, which can then be analyzed for identification. Standing by the blue Tandem machine, supervisor Serge Della Negra is almost apologetic: "Of course, we cannot see anything, but Orion is in there." Orion lives up to its name. In its designer's view, it is a real "spatial manipulation." The original and risky idea consisted of introducing an aggregate source into the accelerator and leaving it there for several months. It has to resist a hostile environment of electromagnetic storms and an insulating gas at a pressure of 9 bars, while obeying the commands relayed by optical fiber. Everything is done without the possibility of entering Tandem to carry out repairs. Serge Della Negra admits that "the risk was that no one could be sure that the aggregates would resist the acceleration and not split up." However, it was worth it. "At the end of the trajectory we bombard a point of material with a huge amount of energy generated by the weight of the new projectile." By switching from the ionic atom to the aggregate, in effect the physicists swapped a ball for an explosive shell. The first weapons used were C60 molecules, supplied in powder form by the CNRS's "Mr. Fullerenes," Patrick Bernier. In 1992, Serge Della Negra's team surprised everyone using a beam of C60. Introduced into the Tandem at 200,000 electron volts, this was then accelerated. It passed through a box of nitrogen like a kamikaze and ionized to come out the other side at 40 million electron volts! Serge Della Negra says: "It is true that we lose 999 out of 1,000 C60's in the process, but it is a world first, and no theorist could have calculated the interaction between C60 and nitrogen." If he sounds jubilant it is because the bombardment obtained opens up a whole new perspective. The largest known deposition of energy per unit of time and space was performed in the GANIL heavy ion accelerator in Caen, using uranium beams. With a beam of one billion electron volts, it delivers 3,000 electron volts per angstrom, but over hundreds of microns since atomic ions penetrate substances easily. On the other hand, C60 aggregates cannot slip between atoms and instead cause real explosions on the surface of the material. With this experiment, the Orsay physicists have nipped in the bud the theory that it is impossible to accelerate C60 aggregates in a machine such as the Tandem. However, the low yield obtained meant that the problem had to be reworked. They then attempted to use gold aggregates, so producing the first ever precious metal explosive shells. On 19 November 1993, the Tandem team in Orsay was therefore able to post another world first: the acceleration of aggregates of three or four gold atoms. Aggregate beams with an energy of 10 million electron volts bombarded silicon sheets, creating shock waves that changed the crystalline structure of the silicon. What can be done with this new technology? Apart from its interest from the point of view of basic research, Serge Della Negra is convinced that there are other openings: "Microelectronics, surface analysis and treatment, nanostructures, multipoint bonding, biochemical detectors, etc. A number of possibilities can be envisaged, as long as we are not restricted to the specific conditions of the physics experiment," and, a CNRS report stresses diplomatically, as long as French industrial groups do not continue with their "wait and see" policy. In the longer term, Serge Della Negra is also thinking about thermonuclear fusion. For some time, scientists have been searching for a way to prevent the deuterium and tritium nuclei from fusing by compressing them (by "inertial confinement") using converging laser beams. In a kind of heavy arms race, we are moving from photons to protons, and then to atomic ions, and finally to aggregates. The heavier the projectile, the more violent the impact. "We are still a long way off. However, we are getting ready for the time when we will be able to accelerate to 10 million electron volts molecules of 100,000 atoms ionized a hundred times, which would generate a billion electron volts in 1,000 angstroms, the scale required to achieve fusion." With the successes achieved at Lyons and Orsay, a number of teams are starting to perform this type of experiment. Researchers have been able to successfully apply the concepts of nuclear physics to aggregates. However, Serge Della Negra laments: "Divided matter does not have its De Gennes, like soft matter." Not yet. The Geometry of Aggregates Cuboid octahedrons, tetrahedrons, octahedrons, icosahedrons, etc. Freed from energy constraints and thus from the constraints of the crystalline networks of solid matter, aggregates have taken new shapes. The physicist invents assemblies of atoms in shapes encountered nowhere else in nature except in interstellar space. Michel Broyer has discovered that it is possible to alter the shapes produced by altering the pressure of the helium and the nozzles that supply it, generating effects that differ according to the melting point of the elements. Aggregates of more than 100 aluminum atoms prefer octohedrons. Gallium aggregates collect in the shape of a drop of liquid, with electronic layer effects such as would exist around an enormous atom. The Lyons researchers also hold a record: gallium aggregates with an outside layer of 7,200 electrons. Indium aggregates of less than 200 atoms take up this droplet shape, while they resemble aluminum when there are more atoms. Nickel, iron, or cobalt aggregates have more rigid shapes. Nickel and cobalt, in aggregates of 100 to 900 atoms, adopt an icosahedron shape. The aggregates of iron take a number of different shapes. Breeding Aggregates First take a thin bar, a few centimeters long by a few millimeters across. It may be made of ultra-pure iron, cobalt, carbon, silicon... in fact the whole of the periodic table is available. Placed in a vacuum chamber, this little bar is then spun round in the heat of a Yag laser pulsed at a frequency of 30 Hz. The power of the laser vaporizes some of the material. At the same time, synchronized with the laser pulses, a jet of helium is pulsed into the vacuum chamber. When it expands, the helium immediately cools the vapor which then "freezes" the aggregates formed, even if they are far from being in a state of energy balance. Carried along at supersonic speed, the ionized aggregates are sent to a "flight time" line, where they are identified by mass spectrometry. This is the field of research of Michel Broyer and his team. When production is known and calibrated, the deposition stage commences. After passing through a chamber sorting the number of atoms -- applying Cornelian selection: the more severe the sorting the fewer aggregates remain for deposition -- the aggregates enter a deposition chamber. The first type of chamber is used by Alain Perez's team in the materials physics department (CNRS-university), since their plates often have to withstand exposure to air. The second type of chamber, which includes a small vacuum "suitcase" protecting the deposit from chemical reactions, is used by Albert Renouprez at the Catalysis Institute. The only source of aggregates in Europe, this system is characterized by a high flow and the ability to deposit on a substrate aggregates that have been sorted by mass. It was financed by the CNRS, the Claude-Bernard University (Lyons), the French research ministry, and the Rhone-Alpes region for 10 million French francs (1989-1993). The second source, currently being installed, will benefit from an acceleration cavity making it possible to bombard a target with heavy aggregates with an energy of 1,000,000 electron volts.
