The document, which meets international standards, contains 11 articles. But to describe it you only have to cite one article: The parliaments will do everything to promote all forms of development of relations between the two republics. In other words the course elaborated by Askar Akayev and Boris Yeltsin has met with powerful parliamentary support. To judge by the situation which has taken shape, this is a very noble aim. The Union has collapsed but relations between Kirghizia and Russia have remained. The euphoria born of the romance of sovereignization is abating. And with it the illusions that the world would greet us with open arms. In both Bishkek and Moscow there is a growing understanding of the fact that no one will be able to replace long-standing partners, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian Federation Council, stressed when the agreement was signed. The agreement lays a good basis not only for restoring Kirghiz-Russian relations but also for bringing them to a qualitatively new level. Kirghizia now, and this is no longer a secret, is renowned for its unique high-tech production facilities, for instance for the artificial growing of crystals. But the almost completed complexes are standing idle. To resolve the problem what is needed above all is capital. The parliamentarians suggest a way out: organizing in the first half of June a meeting near Moscow between Kirghiz and Russian entrepreneurs and bankers. Let them investigate the existing situation, consider the matter together, and be convinced of how advantageous it is to invest capital in a most unique production facility. Who knows, perhaps the industrialists, bankers, and financiers will decide to create a multinational company. All these questions were the focus of attention of V. Shumeyko's meetings with Kirghiz President A. Akayev and Prime Minister A. Dzhumagulov. In the opinion of M. Sherimkulov, chairman of the republic's Supreme Council, Kirghizia and Russia have similar political and economic systems. Relations built on a basis of parity are the model. The main thing now is to ensure that the restored contacts become strong. The interparliamentary agreement is geared to a two-year period. If when this period comes to an end there has been no application from either side it will automatically be extended through the year 2000.
