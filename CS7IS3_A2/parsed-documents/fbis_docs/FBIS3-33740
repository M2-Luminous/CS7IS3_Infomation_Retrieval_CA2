FBIS3-33740 "drnes020_k_94001" FBIS-NES-94-020 Document Type:Daily Report 31 Jan 1994 IRAQ UN Arms Inspector Says Mission `Successful' NC3001174394 Paris AFP in English 1650 GMT 30 Jan 94 NC3001174394 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Manama, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The head of a 16-member UN arms inspection team said here Sunday [30 January] his just-ended mission to Iraq was a success, adding that Iraqi officials had promised to cooperate in setting up a monitoring system. "We achieved all objectives," said Russian team leader Nikita Smidovitch, who told reporters his 10-day mission to Iraq had been "successful." Smidovitch was inspecting Iraq's military arsenal under UN Security Council Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. "The Iraqis had a forthcoming attitude," Smidovitch said. "Iraq has promised to cooperate and said they will do what they can to shorten the period" needed to set the monitoring process in motion. He was to leave Manama, the United Nations' base for Iraqi missions, late Sunday. The long-term monitoring of the Iraqi arms program is crucial to Baghdad's hopes for an end to the embargo imposed after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. By accepting Security Council Resolution 715, Iraq hopes to at least have UN sanctions on its oil exports lifted. Asked how many missions were still needed before long-term monitoring could begin, Smidovitch replied? "Quite frankly, it will take time. We need more activities to set up the monitoring process." The surveillance program is the next UN step following the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf war of January-February 1991. Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting it for three years and has been lobbying hard for an end to the embargo. On Wednesday, the UN's deputy disarmament chief said long-term monitoring of Baghdad's weapons program was still some way off despite Iraq's efforts to have sanctions lifted. American Charles Duelfer, deputy head of the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) disarming Iraq under the Gulf war ceasefire resolutions, spent five days in Iraq preparing a visit there this week by his boss Rolf Ekeus. Ekeus is due to arrive in Baghdad on Tuesday to discuss monitoring, but has said he is unlikely to recommend a lifting of sanctions before the end of the year.
