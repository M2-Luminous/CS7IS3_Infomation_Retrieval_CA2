The projects will involve a total of 666 partners and will receive ECU31.4 million assistance in 1993. A large number of projects have already been supported by the Commission since the scheme was launched and these absorbed the full amount of ECU55 million earmarked for 1992. Those projects consisted in particular in the award of 2,531 study grants to researchers from the East, enabling them to spend an average of three months in some of the Community's leading laboratories and to acquire fresh knowhow to be put to use on their return home, while establishing valuable contacts for the development of networks in the future. Support was also given for scientific conferences, seminars and workshops and for projects to develop pan-European scientific networks and to enable Central and Eastern Europe to participate in Community research programmes or COST projects (European cooperation in the field of scientific and technical research).
