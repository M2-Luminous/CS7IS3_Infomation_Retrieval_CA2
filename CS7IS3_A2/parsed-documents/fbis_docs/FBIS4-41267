"Every sober- minded person understands, states the appeal, that the deployment of subunits of Ukraine's National Guard on the eve of presidential elections, the election of the chairman and deputies of oblast and rayon councils, and an opinion poll of citizens on the status of Sevastopol at a time when the talks with the Russian Federation on the issues of the Black Sea Fleet are entering a decisive phase, is a previously planned political act aimed at frightening the residents of Sevastopol. A protest by Ukraine's deputy procurator general against the holding of the opinion poll among the town's residents, which was recently received by the town council, also serves to confirm such a conclusion. Semenov considers that a decision by the town council to demand that the president, the chairman of the Supreme Council, and Ukraine's defense minister review the decision to deploy Ukrainian national guard battalions in the town, that they return them to their former place of deployment as soon as possible, and also that Ukraine's procurator general withdraws the protest by his deputy are legitimate.
