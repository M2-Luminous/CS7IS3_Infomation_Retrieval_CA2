"Kang Chu-il was appointed director of the Reunification Front Department last year, but not secretary for South Korean Affairs. Kim Yong-sun seems to be still in office," he said. "Usually, the party secretary is also a member of the party's Central Committee," another official said. "But since 1980, there has been no report that Kang was appointed a full member or alternate member of the Central Committee." Kim was retained as chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly Standing Committee, a post traditionally held by the secretary for South Korean Affairs, at the Sixth Meeting of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly late last year, according to the second official.
