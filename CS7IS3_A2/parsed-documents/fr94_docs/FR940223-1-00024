Any applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products received at the plant during the prior month. 17. Section 1124.61 is revised to read as follows: §1124.61 Computation of weighted average differential price. A weighted average differential price for each month shall be computed by the market administrator as follows: (a) Combine into one total the value computed pursuant to §1124.60 (a) through (c) and (f) through (m) for all handlers who filed the reports prescribed by §1124.30 for the month and who made the payments pursuant to §1124.71 for the preceding month; (b) Add an amount equal to the total value of the location adjustments computed pursuant to §1124.74; (c) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer settlement fund; (d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum, for all handlers, of the total hundredweight of producer milk and the total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant to §1124.60(j); and
