Villages in Abkhazian Svaneti [northeastern Abkhazia] were attacked, and villages in Zugdidi Rayon were shelled. People have been wounded and killed. How would you assess the aggravation of the situation in the wake of ideas expressed in the UN secretary general's report? Do you think it is an attempt by Abkhaz leaders to make a permanent border along the Enguri River? What will Russia's position be if the situation is aggravated? Will that big treaty with Russia be useful for us as a defense mechanism, considering that one of the paragraphs of the treaty prohibits training and sending combat units from the territory of one undersigned country to the other? [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. The aggravation of the situation in Abkhazia: We have to take any possible measures, and certain measures have already been taken, to protect the villages. Definite stabilization of the situation was observed yesterday. Some civilians, including the wounded, were led out. In connection with the aggravation of the situation, I appealed to the Russian president, as you know. This was followed by the Russian Government's statement. I am not able say what influence this statement has had or will have on Abkhazs or what practical action the Russian Government will take, but we can infer that the Abkhazian side has planned a fairly large-scale operation. The very near future will show whether this can be stopped and a state of stability can be restored. At least, the Russian Government's statement says that the sides should immediately stop any activities leading to further aggravation and new confrontation in Abkhazia. Now, what is my assessment of these events? We are facing an event that cannot be defined in words other than the following: Gudauta leaders are openly and publicly slighting both the United Nations and Russia because the appeal by Russia--the Russian Government's appeal--is not the first. If these appeals are sincere and if their mediation also has sincere aims, I mean aims for peace, this action carried out by those in Gudauta can be regarded as nothing but a slighting of both the United Nations and Russia. I believe this should considered at the UN Security Council and in Russia. In this connection, I must say that I do not understand what mission the UN observers are carrying out in Abkhazia. Back in Sukhumi [just before the city fell to Abkhaz forces in autumn 1993], I was also puzzled. I still do not understand the aim of their stay here. Expenses are rather high. Indeed, we favored the idea of their intervening from the very beginning. But as a new stage of the confrontation is beginning, and we are already facing this, and the observers do not utter a word or even make a statement, this should make us feel concerned. The United Nations and its leadership should think about it. Let them at least blame us. Most of all I cannot understand their silence when preliminary agreements to cease fire and not to aggravate the situation are openly violated. I am still convinced that the dialogue should be renewed, because the failure of a peace mission meets the interest of neither the United Nations nor Russia. We have been positive about the necessity of the peaceful settlement since the very beginning of the Abkhazian conflict. We still confirm our readiness for the renewal of negotiations. However, as I have already said, we also have to be ready for different measures. [Shevardnadze continues] Joint actions by the United Nations, Russia, and countries friendly to Georgia can grow into an extremely interesting precedent that can be used as a model or as an interesting example of the settlement of conflicts after the Soviet Union has disintegrated. This is a really unprecedented case when an international organization--the UN Security Council; one of its members--Russia; and four other countries, including members of the Security Council, are cooperating with the aim of settling a conflict. It is significant that this concerns one of the republics, one of the countries of the former Soviet Union. When all of this ends, it will be of the utmost significance for the future because the occurrence of similar conflicts cannot be ruled out in other countries. As for the significance of the treaty with Russia, I have talked about it repeatedly. I would like to reconfirm that we will not be able to reach any sort of peace in Abkhazia unless we have Russia's backing in our striving to establish peace. A few words about the commitments of the two sides. We, Georgia, are already implementing our commitments stipulated by the treaty and abide by every paragraph, every statement, every word. It is of great importance that we have signed an agreement on protecting state borders jointly. I believe that the Russian leadership aspires to the same thing, or something similar, in order to implement the whole package of agreements Mr. Yeltsin and I signed in Tbilisi and to implement it the way our peoples expect. You have mentioned a renewed conflict, the aggravation of the situation in the Zugdidi area. My representatives are there, and as far as I know they have gotten in touch with Gudauta. There is an impression that the incidents that occurred there and which had serious effects have been provoked by the lack of control. I have been told that by their observations the incidents were initiated by the militants deployed in the area. This can be regarded as proof that the Gudauta leadership cannot control the situation in all regions. This is my answer. [Oniani] Thank you. Last week, Georgia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program, and a NATO delegation arrived in Tbilisi. You appealed to them for active support and the strengthening of peace. Do you think that NATO can be more active-- I mean active involvement--as of a political organization, in order to prevent current events from becoming a source of new confrontation and new turmoil in Turkey, as a NATO country, or in Russia, which will apparently join the NATO initiative. These are the countries you have mentioned, as well as Iran. [Shevardnadze] The principal subject I discussed with the NATO delegation pertained to principles of cooperation between NATO and CIS, and NATO and Russia. You might ask me why the cooperation between NATO and Georgia did not attract principal attention. It did indeed attract attention, but I want to reiterate that NATO is not able to go far in its cooperation with us. A confrontation between NATO and Russia would lead the world to a situation in which relatively small countries would be harmed--and Georgia would be harmed first. Cooperation with NATO is undoubtedly promising in the long run. It seems very interesting. I, as well as the leaders of Russia and other countries, have given a positive assessment of the Partnership for Peace initiative, and it will be efficient if we are not led into a new wave of confrontation. I am still referring to relations between CIS and NATO and Russia and NATO. I believe that this very issue is central today. If these relations are normal, Georgia will gain a lot from this: As I once said, a commonwealth of commonwealths. [Oniani] One of the most important events of the past week was the parliament's endorsement of the Cabinet of Ministers. So far, one candidate for vice premier has been approved and another has not been approved. Do you believe that the Cabinet you have presented will receive support? [Shevardnadze] I will tell you the state of affairs. The Cabinet is working because the prime minister and one vice premier have been approved, although all this has taken a lot of time. I am going to meet the parliamentary majority today for additional consultations. I have had a contact, a dialogue, with the minority, and I would like to say that the dialogue was constructive. We must come to an agreement in the parliament as well as in the whole community that a policy of defiance will do no one good today. If the endorsement of the Cabinet drags out and grows complicated, the crisis will be aggravated because the country will be even more unmanageable. That is why I believe the endorsement of the Cabinet should be done quickly. This is in our common interests. Quite a few issues about the ways to conduct our work are to be considered during the meetings with both the majority and the minority. I would like to appeal to the parliament to work more intensely--on Tuesday and probably on Wednesday and Thursday--and we would be able to finish this task in three or four days. We should approve those whom we consider necessary. The ministers should be sure that their mission continues. If someone is not trusted, this is an issue that should be handled promptly. I cannot rule out that I will use my right to repeatedly present a candidate that the parliament has not approved. [Oniani] Here is the final question. Your visit to the United States, as well as the Ukrainian and Kazakh leaders' visits, has caused a complex reaction in certain circles in Russia. I would say it caused a remarkable irritation. I would not say that our opposition has reacted to this positively either. There emerged an idea that this visit was premature and could have affected certain processes negatively. [Shevardnadze] No, it was by no means premature. It was a little overdue for various reasons. Now, about our tasks in connection with this visit. I made explicit statements about it during my TV interview and addresses on the radio. The task of primary importance was to convey a message of the truth from a height like the Security Council, and I was able to stand on a high rostrum many times during the visit. I am referring to conversations with President Clinton and his associates, conversations in the Congress, and so on. I believe that a very useful and necessary job has been done. The second task was to secure the continuation of Georgia's relations with the West by making it more concrete and permanent. I regard this as a concern for Georgia's future, and my visit served to reinforce the basis of the relations. Apart from all of this, I had to go to the United States of America just to express gratitude for the assistance they rendered along with other Western countries. If we are still alive, we are alive because of assistance from the European Union. And you know the contribution France, England, and other countries render through the European Union. We have been getting constant assistance from the United States. This had to be said, and the gratitude of the Georgian people had to be expressed. I have announced that President Clinton promised aid of up to $70 million. Amplification is being done now, new programs are being added and I was informed the day before yesterday that the sum had increased to $80-85 million. [Shevardnadze] This will increase if we meet our commitments on securing stability in the country. Above all, these commitments are in our interests. I saw immense prospects for American business, and foreign businesses including Russia and other countries in general, to flow into Georgia. Georgia will only gain from this. Now a few words about that irritation you have mentioned. This visit was extremely interesting and useful in the context of relations between Russia and the United States and East-West relations in general. I do not think that Georgia and its leader are entitled to a distinguished mission as regards East-West relations, but every country including Georgia is capable of contributing to this. I believe that preventing a new wave of confrontation between East and West, between Russia and the United States, should be the main concern of all countries, big as well as small. I believe that normal relations between these two countries are of special interest for small countries, including Georgia. Any kind of confrontation would harm our national interests. Another thing: An independent state should not be worried if it acts in the interest of universal peace. Any kind of negative reaction to actions not contradicting the interest of universal peace can be considered as survival of imperialist thinking. Everyone has to get used to the idea that yesterday is over, and we have to deal with new countries, independent countries, who plan visits themselves. Incidentally, I would like to tell you that when the date of President Yeltsin's visit coincided with my visit to France... [Oniani interrupts] [Oniani] He postponed his visit... [Shevardnadze] This has proved again that the president is well aware that old times and the old system have passed, and he has postponed his visit for 10 days so that our planned visit to Paris, France, will not fail. So nothing terrible is happening. There will be negative opinions, too, but in general the visit has played its role and accomplished its positive mission for Georgia and not only for Georgia. [Oniani] Thank you. You have been listening to Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of state.
