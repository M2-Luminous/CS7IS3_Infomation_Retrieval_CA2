The Spanish prime minister said so this morning and the foreign minister as well as the minister of defense said so too. [Defense Minister Julian] Garcia Vargas came back this afternoon from Paris where he examined the situation with his French counterpart. [Correspondent Martinez Durban] Garcia Vargas says that the Serbs are slowly but surely withdrawing their artillery from the positions they have around Sarajevo. However, the same cannot be said about the mortars. All heavy weaponry sites are well known so that, if the NATO attack were to go ahead, it would be successful. However, the defense minister still believes in a diplomatic solution. If on Sunday [20 February] evening the conditions set out by NATO have not been fulfilled, the allies will not backtrack. [Begin Garcia Vargas recording] Taking into account how far we have gone in our decisions, we have to explain to the Russians as well as we can what our position is, mainly why we think that this has to be done. But we cannot do anything else. There is no going back, I think it is no longer possible. [end recording] [Durban] The fact that the blue helmets are now taking military positions under their control should keep the Bosnian Muslims from taking over the positions that have been under Serb control until now. According to Garcia Vargas, the security of our contingent is guaranteed although there are possible risks, the contingent is aware of them and keeps them under control.
