A noisy, rather unfriendly group of picketers met the Ukrainian delegation at the Supreme Council building, which is perhaps why the talks were held behind closed doors. However, at the news conference, journalists were assured that the range of questions were very much to do with day-to-day matters and that the conversation had been friendly. The sides discussed economic aid for Crimea, in particular for agriculture. Journalists, alarmed by rumors that more Ukrainian troops were being sent to Crimea, that there was a threat of direct presidential rule over the peninsula, and that the presidential elections in Ukraine may be disrupted, asked how far all this was true. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy gave a short reply: It is all a provocation.
