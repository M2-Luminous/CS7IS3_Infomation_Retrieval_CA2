"Because we do not have an army here in Kiribati I cannot call it a military coup, but I can call it an administrative coup," Tekire Tameura, the now deposed chairman of the interim council of state, told AFP by telephone from the capital, Tarawa. He said the acting police commissioner "dragged (me) from my chair". It is the latest turn in a growing drama in the Micronesian state which earlier this week saw parliament dissolved and administration handed over to a council of state. It took over within hours of the fall of the government of President Teatao Teannati on Monday. In the 36-seat Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu, or assembly, the ruling National Progressive Party suffered a defeat, 21-19, when the opposition moved to set up a select committee to investigate misuse of public funds. Tameura, who was also the head of the Public Service Commission (PSC), chaired the council along with Speaker Beretitara Neeti and Chief Justice Faqir Mohammed. But then it was found Tamuera's public service position expired on May 28 and that technically he could not continue with the council. He refused to stand down. "Only the president can ask for my resignation," he said Wednesday. There being no president, he could not be asked to resign. However former cabinet secretary Ata Teaotai was named by the other two as a replacement on both the PSC and the council. Tameura refused to accept the ruling and on Wednesday went to the PSC office. While he was there the police showed up. "I am now no longer chairman," he said. "On the orders of the chief justice I was dragged from my chair by the acting commissioner of police." He was taken to a car, driven to his council office, allowed to collect personal items and then taken home. Police had been placed at the council office to prevent his entry. "Of course I am offended, I am taking legal advice." He believed the action in removing him had nothing to do with his contract status but was "very political. "People here know what it all means, but Kiribati is a very peaceful country and it is very quiet." The country will go to the polls on July 21 (east of the international dateline) and July 22 (west of the dateline). July 29 has been set aside for second-round voting if results are not decisive. A month later, successful candidates will elect a president. The next election is not due until mid-1995. Details of the alleged corruption which bought down the government have not been made public yet, but relate to misuse in hotel accommodation, transport, entertainment and gifts. Kiribati, the former British colony of the Gilbert Islands, consists of 33 islands totalling 811 square kilometres (324 sq. miles), whose 68,000 population, known as "I-Kiribati", are predominantly Micronesian. Its capital atoll, Tarawa, was virtually flattened by the Americans when they landed marines their in 1943 to dislodge Japanese forces who had taken over most of the Gilberts. The largest coral atoll in the world, Kiritimati or Christmas, was used for atmospheric nuclear testing by Britain and the US in the 1950s and 1960s. The Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu includes a seat for Banaba or Ocean Island despite the fact that British phosphate mining all but destroyed it and the bulk of its people have been resettled in Fiji.
