We were presented by history with this unique opportunity to ensure a worthy place for our young independent state on the European continent at a time when the world has rid itself of the hostile standoff of military blocs and confrontation between West and East. It would be naive to overlook the fact that nowadays, the world is developing according to laws based on a new reality. Ever increasing economic, technological, informational, and cultural relations among states have already prompted us to redefine the notion of neutrality. Policies of all neutral European states are definitely shifting toward active participation in all-European processes sponsored by the United Nations and CSCE, as well as activation of links with the EC. The tendency toward the political unification of West Europe is all the more conspicuous. The situation east of Belarus is unfolding no less dynamically. Contrary to predictions, the CIS has not disintegrated but is developing, despite serious difficulties. The last year made a substantial impact on CIS member states, bringing their positions closer and deepening their all-around cooperation. Many republics redefined their position in favor of expanding integration within the CIS, which was evidenced by the meeting in Ashgabat on 23-24 December 1993. This meeting was attended by 11 of the 12 CIS defense ministers -- absent was the Moldovan minister. It was unanimously agreed that the CIS Allied Armed Forces General Command be replaced with the Staff for Coordination of Military Cooperation. All the states -- including Ukraine, whose position has until recently been reduced to observer status -- declared their intent to participate in its work. All defense ministers concurred in the opinion that it is easier to resolve problems connected with the building of military forces in cooperation and conjunction with one another. The newly created staff is designed to coordinate this process. I think everyone understands that the elimination of the CIS General Command put the idea of forming an Allied Armed Forces out of the question. From now on, issues connected with operational use of CIS national forces lie exclusively with the competence of their own governments. All speculations about the possibility of dispatching troops to "hot spots" proved unfounded. Not one single serviceman will ever be sent outside our country without the permission of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. We intend to participate actively in the activities of the Staff for Coordination of Military Cooperation. It will be staffed based on the coalition and equal-footing principle. Our representatives there will seek closer cooperation with other CIS countries in the military sphere, which is of vital importance to our Armed Forces at this time. Bilateral contacts do not offer as many opportunities for cooperation as we would like. Although we have concluded bilateral agreements with the Russian Federation and Ukraine, they do not work stably without a system of coordination. Everything comes down to financial relations and the system of licenses and duties. In our opinion, every concluded agreement must be part of a system of agreements among states, and the Treaty on Collective Security is absolutely essential to this system. The issue of Belarusian entry into the collective security treaty has been repeatedly debated at different levels. We are familiar with the opinions of our partners about conditions that Belarus put forward while joining the treaty. All agree that you cannot participate in it partially. As for the present conditions, they simply specify our understanding of Articles 4 and 6 without altering their meaning. I would like you to examine them once again. Out of 11 articles of the treaty, none encroaches on our Republic's sovereignty and its intention to achieve neutrality. To do this, one should ensure a reliable security for society and the state, lay the foundation for peaceful relations with neighbors, and receive security and support guarantees from friendly states in case of outside aggression. The idea of neutrality can be actually implemented after three problems are solved: In economy -- development of strong basic industries capable of ensuring the stable and independent operation of the economy; In politics -- recognition of our neutrality by other states and their guarantee to respect its existence; And finally, the third problem is a well-trained Armed Forces to protect sovereignty -- if need be, with arms -- and a comprehensive system of their support. As you can see, these problems have not been solved yet. All provisions of the treaty can serve as and are designed to be a security guarantee for Belarus. For example, the document's preamble is based on the sovereignty of independent states. Article 2 provides for the mechanism of joint consultations in the event of a threat, which also complies with the proclaimed principles. There are no corrections in the remaining articles, except for Articles 4 and 6. In Article 4, we propose to specify the passage "Providing necessary assistance, including military"; while in Article 6, we emphasize that the decision to use the Belarusian Armed Forces lies exclusively with the competence of the Supreme Soviet, and can only be executed in accordance with Belarusian law. These reservations do not run counter to the goals and objectives of the treaty, and I think will raise no doubts on the part of its participants, the number of which will now rise to nine. Close military cooperation with CIS countries will reduce our losses while reforming our Armed Forces, secure the civilized withdrawal of Russian troops from Belarusian territory, help maintain high combat readiness of the Army that would be equipped with modern arms, and create favorable internal and external conditions for establishing the state. This will also ensure a positive solution of the issue of Belarus' share of nuclear fuel produced from warhead uranium processing after the removal of nuclear weapons from Belarusian territory. Unfortunately, the need of the Armed Forces for material-technical supplies (production, repairs, armaments and equipment regulations, shipments of ZIP, AKB, [expansions unknown] etc.) and personnel training can only be met through military cooperation with other CIS countries. The Belarusian Republic has every right to benefit from the scientific and technical potential of the Soviet Armed Forces. Belarusian scientific and military-complex enterprises will not receive any orders from the CIS countries before we take a common interest in guaranteeing our own security. Today, the potential of Air Force equipment is practically exhausted; due to the lack of repair funds, design bureaus, etc., other equipment is on the verge of collapse, servicing equipment of air defense, rocket, and air forces. [sentence as published] A question may arise here: Could these three problems possibly be solved by signing the collective security treaty? Of course, we will not get anything for free. However, as an equal partner, we will enjoy privileges and benefits in the system of joint production, equipment repair and servicing, and exchanges of technology and military information. Common use of airspace, communication routes, airfields, and testing grounds promises substantial economic advantages. Let me also remind you that we need military cooperation with other CIS countries if only to maintain the combat readiness of the Belarusian Armed Forces at a high level. For us, joining the collective security treaty is economically justified. For example, unification of air defense forces, anti-rocket defense forces, intelligence, and other components would greatly enhance national security. We see no alternative here. Following the example of some European states, Belarus can join the collective security system reserving the right to participate in peacekeeping operations only in regions representing a threat to the security of our state. Germany, one of NATO's most active members, participates in the collective security system based on such principles. Besides, without our own military industry and a developed system of arms purchases, and without having solved all problems concerning international treaties on conventional arms reduction in Europe, we are forced to maintain the closest possible contacts with all CIS states. All these arguments -- and they can be much more expanded -- underline the need for explicit ratification of the Treaty on Collective Security that took Belarus so much effort to sign. Concluding, let me stress again that given the developing situation and the present economic situation, one should not see the status of neutrality as a goal in itself. I am confident that all of our neighbors, which want to see our state as a thriving and reliable partner, will understand this. It is not admissible to remain neutral to any integration processes that are rapidly gathering speed. Today, instead of its classical form, neutrality can assume a differentiating and selective nature. The true condition of the Armed Forces and a search for anti- crisis solutions force me to call upon you to ratify the Treaty on Collective Security.
