The person in charge of the Ministry's Computer Management and Supervision Department said: The promulgation and implementation of these regulations indicates that our work in security protection of computer information systems is being institutionalized, standardized, and modernized. He said: Computerization has been introduced for both economic development and social progress in China, as well as in other countries. All trades and professions have successively established a computer information system in a short time. According to an incomplete statistics, more than 500,000 computer information systems [ji suan ji xin xi xi tong 6060 4615 2623 0207 1873 4762 4827] of various types have been in use in various fields and departments of our country; and the trend of sharp increase continues. Computer information systems have become an important tool and means of scientific research, production, business, and state administration. He said: In the past, since there was no law or regulations governing the security protection of computer information systems, computer security was a very conspicuous problem. The number of criminal cases involving the use of computers or targeted at computer assets was rising. The largest amount of money involved in a single computer crime was as high as 14 million yuan. Computer viruses were spreading widely, and they were particularly serious in large and medium cities and in regions open to the outside world. According to an investigation conducted by the public security departments on some 40 computers across the country, 70 or 80 percent of them have been infected by viruses in recent years. In some universities and colleges, the computer virus infection rate was 100 percent. As the computer virus attack has affected the work of many departments and organizations, the security of computer information systems is becoming more and more important. He said: After these regulations came into force, the Ministry of Public Security will, on the basis of past experience, take a further step to raise its job skill level in computer management and supervision, prevent violation of regulations, and ensure impartiality in enforcing regulations.
