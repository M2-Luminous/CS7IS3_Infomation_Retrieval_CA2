Now the basic principles of the doctrine have been approved, but this has not removed any of the defense industry's concerns. And it will hardly provide any relief until priorities are defined for the development of enterprises of the defense complex, a state policy toward these enterprises is formed and an appropriate legal situation is established. What do I consider especially important in this area? First of all, there must be a flexible approach to the defense NII [scientific research institutes], KB [design offices] and plants. Some of them must unquestionably remain state, or "public," entities, while the rest must be told unequivocally that they are now "free" and have the authority to decide on their own how they want to continue to operate. The designation "public" certainly does not mean any constriction of rights, however. On the contrary, they should be given as much independence as possible, even to the point of allowing them to act as responsible state clients. That is, not just the right to fill state orders but also to develop and establish a program for the production, sale and servicing of this or that combat equipment or weapon system. If the enterprises are to act as a state clients, this will require that they set up an entire infrastructure around themselves for development, research, production, servicing and operation, the training of specialists, and so forth. In short, for the functioning of an entire area of the defense industry. These will be fairly efficacious structures. Take the Moscow Aviation Production Association, for example. During the past year and a half it has succeeded to some degree in setting up such a structure. It has learned how to set up new relations with its subcontractors, learned how not just to turn out products but how to sell them, and offered new approaches to the servicing of its products. Despite economic and financial difficulties, last year the association invested more than a billion rubles in science and as far as possible supported the design offices of its main subcontractors. Thanks in great part to this approach the enterprises retained its cooperative ties, its personnel and its capacity for producing extremely complex aviation systems. And this was despite the fact that it actually received no financing. Prominent economists and politicians of ours assert that a market economy presupposes certain bankruptcy for many enterprises and, they say, this should be regarded as something necessary. The budget today is indeed so small that it cannot lift up the entire defense industry. But does this mean that the process should be left to take its own course? We can and should point out that most of the enterprises have survived. There is no need to invest funds in and attempt to revive clearly unprofitable enterprises. We need to help the thriving, strong firms, but with the stipulation that they assume patronage over those which will not be able to survive on their own. For what reason should a thriving enterprise concern itself with a clearly unprofitable one, you will ask. And are there any thriving enterprises today? There are. I am not certain that they are known, to be sure. There is a universal cry, after all, that everyone today is engaged in commerce and no one is producing anything. Things are being produced. The fact that these producers are frequently stuck in rented space, do not have their own funds and bear an enormous tax burden is another matter. It is very important today to find people in a firm who have actually demonstrated that it is profitable to produce things. I have no doubt that others will follow in their footsteps. Only he who has made an enterprise profitable can teach others rapidly how to do so. If we want to revive Russia's economy, we should not anticipate large-scale bankruptcies--that is too harsh a measure--but orient ourselves toward the producer. This will not require much: Just to make the tax system not a hindrance but a production regulator. One approach should be taken to the producers, another to the commercial structures. That does not mean that the commercial structures should be pressured. It is perhaps no less important today to learn civilized trade than to learn civilized production. In order to develop trade, however, we must have goods. The producer must therefore still be in the front. The second problem which must be solved is that of improving the banking system. The banks today are actually over industry. Nowhere else in the world are people living with loan rates like ours, more than 200 percent. If the situation does reach the point of large-scale bankruptcies, the banks will find themselves the owners of those very unprofitable enterprises. Will they be capable of running them? I doubt it. It will most likely result in the collapse of the Russian economy, and we will have to go through the process of industrializing the nation once again. I am certainly not calling for state regulation of the economy. If we begin regulating prices, that will be the end of the market economy, since regulation is the jurisdiction of officials, and we already have more than enough of them. When I began studying marketing, I liked very much the principle of producing what is advantageous to the consumer and not producing what is not. What could be more simple? In Russia's situation, however, it has assumed some absolutely terrible forms. Essentially only two things are required of the state to make production advantageous. I would put in first place the principle: Do not interfere and do not do any harm. The second thing would be to set up a legal playing field in which all of the rules of the game are precisely defined. If we do not help ourselves, no one else is going to do so. And something has to be done rapidly. Rapidly and correctly. Otherwise, we risk losing the defense complex as such. Without creating anything to take its place.
