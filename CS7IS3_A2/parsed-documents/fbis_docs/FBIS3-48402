Han Sung-ui, a ministry policy planning officer, said, however, it would be difficult to bring in Russian weapons for the purpose of beefing up the weaponry of the armed forces. "If some Russian weapons were introduced, they would be used in their experimental studies, anti-air training and the study of Russian operational tactics and doctrine," Han said. He made the remarks before a group of reporters in connection with the recent Russian offer to repay credits Korea extended to Russia with their weapons. Han also said the time has come for the country to positively promote military cooperation with Russia and Japan mainly through the exchange of military students and top military leaders. The government's basic policy, he said, is to continue to place emphasis on military cooperation with the United States. "But, our policy also calls for cooperation with neighborly countries in the military area as well," Han said. He said stepped up military cooperation with these countries will help keep them from furnishing offensive weapons to North Korea, induce North Korea to reforms and opening, and contribute to laying a groundwork for stability and peace in Northeast Asia.
