The summit is scheduled to begin on Tuesday in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. GRANMA, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, pointed out that the time has come to efficiently and independently revive, reaffirm, and establish in concrete the course Ibero-America must follow. The newspaper underscored the fact that the conference will be held as a result of the U.S. Government's call for another presidential summit, which will be held in Miami in December, for the purpose of attacking, discrediting, and overshadowing the results of the Ibero-American movement that is under way. This situation creates for the presidents the undeniable need to reach a clear and definitive commitment in Cartagena that will strengthen the community of Ibero-American nations and establish a specific integration program, GRANMA said. Further on, the commentary stated that this commitment is the only way the countries attending the Miami summit can arrive as a group that shares strong bonds and common goals. GRANMA said that in Cartagena the presidents will not be able to avoid the issue of the U.S. economic and trade blockade against Cuba, including the Torricelli Law, regarding which a statement was issued at the past summit and two resolutions have been issued by the UN General Assembly. The commentary emphasizes that Cuba participates in these forums with the moral and political authority it draws from its huge efforts and social projects, which have achieved goals which, for many, still constitute dreams or hopes and its proven desire for integration. Ibero-America knows, the newspaper underscored, that our country is an unyielding champion of principles, such as nonintervention, sovereignty, and self-determination, which are not only deeply rooted but legally established and universally accepted in international relations. The Ibero-American countries, the commentary concludes, will once again have an opportunity to examine urgent regional problems and the effects and consequences that other worldwide problems have on this part of the world, because, for them, this fourth summit is their summit.
