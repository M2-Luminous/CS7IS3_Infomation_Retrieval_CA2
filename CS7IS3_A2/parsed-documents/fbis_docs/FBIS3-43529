The peace talks resumed there earlier this week, but they continue to be unproductive. The negotiators have reached yet another weekend and must now wait for next week. Our correspondent Joao Ligio had this to report by telephone: [Begin Ligio recording] UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye has not yet decided to give up, even after yesterday's failure to bring the two sides closer together. This suggests that Beye may be trying to devise a new plan to bring the two sides together. So far, the work has continued to concentrated on unfinished documents, both from the two warring sides and from the mediators. As far as we have been able to observe, there is still much to do: the national police must still be given the status of a civilian institution. The crux of the matter is whether it will be a military or paramilitary institution. This is one of the many differences preventing harmony reigning at the proceedings. This is the first hurdle that the UN special representative must overcome. The mediators have already identified the problem and hope to act accordingly when talks resume on 10 January. It is hoped that, after four days in Lusaka, the negotiators will again meet face to face on that day. It is not an exaggeration to say that slowness appears to be the motto of the talks. Between good morning and good afternoon greetings, we do our best to obtain fresh information. The result is always the same: nothing. But that is not what happens with some foreign media here. The announced meeting between the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] team and U.S. congressmen has not taken place yet, but UNITA sources have repeatedly said that it may occur before the next face-to-face meeting between the warring sides.
