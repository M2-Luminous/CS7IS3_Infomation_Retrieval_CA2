FR940106-1-00013 FR940106-1-00004 Section 324 establishes a statutory definition of an independent small business marketer, which is fully set forth in the TSD. The State has adopted the statutory definition of independent small business marketer in its regulations. The EPA finds the applicability requirements in the Texas Stage II rule to be acceptable. II. Implementation of Stage II The CAA specifies the time by which certain facilities must comply with the State regulation. For facilities that are not owned or operated by an independent small business marketer, these times, calculated from the time of State adoption of the regulation, are: (1) Six months for facilities for which construction began after November 15, 1990, (2) one year for facilities that dispense greater than 100,000 gallons of gasoline per month, and (3) two years for all other facilities. The Texas Stage II rule time schedule sets compliance dates of May 15, 1993, November 15, 1993, and November 15, 1994, respectively for the above three deadlines. Although Texas adopted its Stage II regulations on October 16, 1992, the EPA believes it is appropriate to accept the adoption date to be November 15, 1992. The EPA is proposing to approve the submitted time table for the following reasons. First, the CAA states that the adoption date must be used to calculate the compliance schedule for Stage II implementation at facilities. In this case, the EPA defines the adoption date to be the date when the regulation and the rest of the SIP was required to be submitted to the EPA on November 15, 1992. The compliance deadlines triggered by this date begin within the time schedule specified by the CAA. Secondly, remedying this deficiency by amending the compliance schedule would cause further delay in the implementation of Stage II in Texas. Lastly, the Texas rule otherwise fulfills the Stage II requirements and the EPA believes it will provide substantial air quality benefits to the regulated areas. Therefore, the EPA believes it is in the public interest to approve and make enforceable this requirement at the earliest time feasible. In the Texas program, independent small business marketers of gasoline, for which the monthly gasoline throughput is less than 50,000 gallons per month, may petition, no later than November 15, 1993, the State's Executive Director for an extension of the compliance deadline to December 22, 1998, or until on or more of the facility's gasoline storage tanks are replaced and/or equipped with corrosive protection, which is required by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. This extension provision for independent small business marketers of gasoline, for which the monthly gasoline throughput is less than 50,000 gallons per month, is acceptable because the CAA does not require Stage II systems to be installed on such facilities. III. Additional Program Requirements Consistent with the EPA's guidance, the State requires that Stage II systems be tested and certified to meet a 95 percent emission reduction efficiency. The EPA has indicated three acceptable methods of demonstrating a 95 percent emission reduction efficiency: (1) A method tested and approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB); (2) a testing program that is equivalent to the CARB program, that will be conducted by the Program Oversight Agency or by a third party recognized by the Program Oversight Agency, and submitted and approved by the EPA for incorporation into the SIP; or (3) a system approved by CARB. The State has chosen to use option three, a system approved by CARB. The State requires sources to verify proper installation and function of Stage II equipment through use of a liquid blockage test and a leak test prior to system operation and at least every five years or upon major modification of a facility (i.e., 75 percent or more equipment change).
