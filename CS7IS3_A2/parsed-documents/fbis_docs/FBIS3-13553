FBIS3-13553 "drnes051_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-051 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Mar 1994 SYRIA Press Ridicules Security Council `Farce' JN1503172294 Damascus SANA in Arabic 1550 GMT 15 Mar 94 JN1503172294 Damascus SANA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Damascus, 15 Mar (SANA)--The newspaper AL-BA'TH has stressed that based on its structure, nature, teachings, and ideology, the Zionist entity was established as a fascist entity and will continue to be based on the same firm and declared principles of the mythical Zionist ideology that considers its followers superior to the rest of mankind. In a comment today, the paper says: Beyond any doubt, old and new Zionist history proves the bloody and terroristic nature of this entity. The Hebron massacre alone provides sufficient proof of the Zionist thought prevailing in Israel. The paper notes: Zionist settlers did not appear in a vacuum. They have always been the realistic and true embodiment of Israeli policy, since the usurpation of Palestine. These settlers were armed and instructed to usurp Arab territories. Concluding, the paper says: It is regrettable that many sides in the world still refuse to open their eyes to the Zionist-Israeli fact. The proof is the current farce about the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which has been going on for more than two weeks at the UN Security Council. In its editorial today under the headline "The Hebron Massacre," the newspaper TISHRIN says: The holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has torn all the veils of peace behind which the Rabin government was hiding. The massacre exposed the true nature of this government. In the article written by its Editor in Chief Muhammad Khayr al-Wadi, the paper stresses: There is no difference between the policy of the Shamir government and that of the Rabin government. They are both hostile to peace, refuse to relinquish the occupied Arab territories, and each of them seeks to achieve the same goal, namely, the establishment of greater Israel. The paper notes: The whole world expected the international community to take practical and effective measures concerning the Hebron massacre to protect unarmed civilians and to deter aggressors. However, disappointment was great when it was proven that the powers dominating the Security Council are still using double standards every time the issue is related to Israel. Concluding, the paper says: What happened at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque is the logical result of the policy of indifference to Israel, and to spoiling it. The continuation of such a policy will lead to further Zionist massacres and to further disruption of the prospects of achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region.
