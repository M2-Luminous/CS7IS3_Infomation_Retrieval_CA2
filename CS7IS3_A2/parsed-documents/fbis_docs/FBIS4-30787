Marash Mirashi reports: [Mirashi] Today's hearing opened with a request by Chairman Celiku for silence, due to the extreme heat and the large number of correspondents in the courtroom. It could be said that this is also a moral trial being conducted against the former party state. [Begin former Interior Minister Simon Stefani recording] We should in no way forget that the Party of Labor [PPSh] at that time was not only a political organization, or rather the only party in power, but it was in fact a state party that performed state functions. [end recording] [Begin former Interior Minister Hekuran Isai recording] We were a party state. The party decisions had a state power that was obligatory for the state and for society. The role of party state relied on the constitutional law. That is how it was. [end recording] The defendants -- Simon Stefani, Hekuran Isai, and Ramiz Alia -- explained the indictment against them at today's hearing. It should be stressed that the defendants categorically negated everything as if they were inhabitants of an unexplored planet and not the main characters of an unprecedented dictatorship. While most of the trial proceedings were being conducted in the hall, the shivering victims were in other halls of the Tirana Court testifying to correspondents [passage omitted including indistinct recorded passages]: In his deposition, Stefani negated the charges, stating that his entire activity was in conformity with the law. According to him, nothing makes him responsible -- not the abuse of official position, the murders on the border, or his contribution to drafting the platform on state security. While the evidence points to Stefani for the assassinations of a number of citizens on the southern border, he declared at the trial that he had not given any order. However, a telegram states the contrary. This is a political trial, he said. Prosecutor Thana defended the indictment by building on authentic facts. Chairman Celiku then read the text of the telegram, which placed Simon Stefani in a very serious position. The defendant said that no one dared to oppose the Politburo. Chairman Celiku then asked him to recall several names of Politburo members during his time. Stefani named some 10 Politburo members, dead and alive, including himself. Chairman Celiku later requested some explanations from Hekuran Isai. He gave an extremely long speech of a theoretical character, which, at times, was mixed with a typical communist irony. He also admitted nothing. He said that the indictment is political. Meanwhile, the defendant, in general, expressed himself against the class struggle. I expressed my convictions against the class struggle even when I was interior minister, he said. I have never acted against the law. I have always applied decisions by the PPSh accurately. The defense counsel of Isai proceeded to say that his client should be thanked for his tolerance and soothing of the dictatorship. The chairman of the judicial body and the prosecutor asked Isai to explain the exiles and evictions. The defendant said that, while he was deputy chairman of this commission, he approved only 112 such decisions. The explanations by Alia, though at an hour of hot and muggy weather, were received with interest by the media. The former head of state declared himself to be a political prisoner and, consequently, innocent. The former president claimed no responsibility. On the contrary, he claimed several merits. The indictment does not blame me in a legal way, Alia said. I did not participate in a conspiracy and I did not abuse my position. I have not approved the movement against religion alone in the Politburo, but together with the others, after we were convinced in the youth's movement against the religious cult. The defense counsel claimed Alia to be innocent. We cannot judge on a former head of state. Meanwhile, Chairman Celiku and Prosecutor Thana told him that we are not judging and charging Alia as a former president but on the basis of stored charges. The next hearing begins at 0900 tomorrow.
