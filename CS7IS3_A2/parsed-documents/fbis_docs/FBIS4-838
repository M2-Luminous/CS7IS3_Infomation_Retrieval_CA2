FBIS4-838 "drafr074_c_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA NP Comments on Incident NP Comments on Incident MB1804114294 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network in English 1100 GMT 18 Apr 94 MB1804114294 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network English BFN [Text] The National Party [NP] has questioned the need for a political party to have a cell in its offices following last night's police swoop in which four injured men were found at the ANC's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] headquarters in Johannesburg. The four, some of whom claimed to be IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] members, were found in a barred cell after a fifth man summoned the police to the ANC offices at Lancet House. The fifth man also showed signs of serious assault and said he had escaped from the ANC headquarters. ANC officials told the police last night that they had detained the men because they were suspected of breaking into cars. The NP said this incident confirmed many people's suspicions about what went on in ANC offices, and raised new questions about the reasons why ANC President Nelson Mandela had stopped the police from searching ANC headquarters after shooting in the city three weeks ago.
