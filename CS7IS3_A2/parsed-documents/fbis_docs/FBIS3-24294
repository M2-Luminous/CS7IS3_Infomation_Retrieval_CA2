The treaty with Georgia, the policy of restoration of the presence in the Balkans in the Bosnian crisis, the agreements with Belarus and Moldova--these are merely recent events that have been at the center of the political skirmishing. The harsh criticism of the government's steps on the part of a certain section of public opinion and the deputies might appear somewhat inappropriate, possibly, but only outside of the context of the actual struggle for power. After all, from the viewpoint of basic values and orientations the foreign policy of the "collective Yeltsin," in the "near abroad," at least, is hardly much different from the growing imperial mood of the Russian political class. It needs to be clearly specified that we employ in this case the term "imperialism" and all that derives from it in a nonevaluative, "technical" sense--as a description of some complex reality of the hierarchical coexistence of ethno-state formations. In the particular sense (our short post-Soviet history affords ponderable grounds for this) that "empire means peace," and the "imperial" principle is objectively opposed to nationalism and signifies, at least, the preponderance of "nationalism of the soil" over "nationalism of blood." On the other hand, any pursuit of "national" (that is, state) interests by a great power inevitably incorporates such elements of the imperial principle as sphere of influence, sphere of special interests, and so forth. The great contemporary democracy, the United States, demonstrates a rational imperial policy in this sense. In this sense the statement of service of neoimperial achievements of the regime is relatively impressive. Real military control over practically the entire territory of the former USSR has been preserved--in the sense that in no republic (the Baltic republics included) are there any foreign forces or military facilities other than Russian. The war in Tajikistan, the indefinite billeting of the 14th Army in the Dniester region, the presence of military bases in the Caucasus enshrined by agreements, the retention of the Black Sea Fleet, preservation of the nuclear monopoly on one-sixth of terra firma and military facilities and forces in the Baltic, real military control of the situation along the CIS perimeter, and pressure on its post-Soviet neighbors, increasingly effective on the whole, in favor of the introduction of dual citizenship--"what more do you want?" The list could be continued, but even without this the story that Yeltsin is an agent inserted by the Politburo into the democratic movement for restoration of the USSR, which even recently seemed paradoxical, is becoming increasingly understandable. The difference here between the positions of the "collective Yeltsin" and the opposition (if the Duma majority may be so called) remains fundamental. Whereas the opposition is oriented, in fact, toward the simple retention of the territories of the former empire (and in the unrealizable maximum, toward its restoration), the policy of the Yeltsin leadership is perfectly manifestly aimed at the neoimperial modernization of Russia's sphere of influence in the former USSR and contiguous countries, within the bounds of the objectively constricted possibilities of the present Russia, what is more. If we are truly now observing the birth of Russian neoimperialism, a modernization of the sphere of Russia's interests in this logic would not signify either a restoration of the Soviet Union or an assembly of lands in the spirit of Ivan III. The "neo" suffix could mean primarily that influence should extend merely to the sphere of Russia's actual interests--military-political control, maintenance of the stability of interethnic relations, control over the main mineral resources, guardianship of local Russians, and so forth. At the same time, on the other hand, this control would not entail the restoration either of the unity of the legal space or control over the extent of the powers of the local ruling elites or Moscow's former responsibility for maintaining a living standard in Uzbekistan, an infant-mortality rate in Azerbaijan or an educational level in Tajikistan somehow on a par with Russia. Reality, however, is immeasurably more complex than our plans. The neoimperial trends in the policy of the Russian leadership are being manifested as a dotted line, residing alongside perfectly traditional approaches, which is strictly conditioned both by the pressure of the current crisis and the actual composition of the governing coalition. The victory of the traditional industrial establishment in the government has afforded its leader, Oleg Soskovets, an opportunity to busy himself with restoration of the production engineering chains of Soviet industry currently severed among different states. The latter will be possible only with the restoration of the chains of the series of payments for orders, which have been severed today even more hopelessly than the production engineering chains, which, of course, is not so much an economic as a political matter--the main grounds for reconstitution of the ruble zone. On the other hand, certain steps of the regime which seemed purely political (and even ideologically conditioned) have upon closer inspection an entirely material motivation. Participation in the civil war in Tajikistan is not simply a war for control over territory of the former USSR but also an aspiration to plug a hole on the border, the existence of which would require far greater outlays on the reconstitution of a nontransparent Russian border proper, and Tajikistan's admittance to the ruble space is the actual charge for this. And so forth. Let us not forget either the interests of Russian big business, the "sharks" of which have learned to defend their interests with the cudgel of the Russian Government. The Azerbaijani Government had only to attempt to organize a consortium for the development of oil deposits without the participation of Russian corporations for the Karabakh army to tear toward the Iranian border, occupying a further two areas of the country. The Lukoyl concern had to be urgently included in the consortium, after which the Azerbaijani Army was able to restore the lost territories in the course of a counteroffensive.... On the other hand, the motives of the regime's active policy in the near abroad are partially, truly, of the nature of a reaction to intra-Russian circumstances. The ideological vacuum in which the regime has found itself following the exhaustion of the potential of the liberal-market utopia is forcing it to seek ideological support in the deep-lying seams of the mass consciousness, which is in Russia imperial by nature. Essentially, under the conditions of the continuing unfolding of the economic crisis, only opposition to some external enemy can secure for Yeltsin powerful mass support within the country on the eve of presidential elections. In turn, it is just as necessary for the opposition to portray Yeltsin's foreign policy as insufficiently imperial, capitulationist, ideally. In the political struggle the arguments are directed not toward the opposite side but toward the public--and are not, therefore, required to be just. A deplorable illustration of this trivial observation were the closed hearings in the Duma CIS Committee devoted to the treaty with Georgia which had been signed not long before this. B. Pastukhov, deputy minister of foreign affairs, and representatives of other government departments, who presented the treaty in the committee, attempted to show that the treaty was in Russia's strategic interests, that Russia's departure from Georgia would signify the filling of the vacated niche by other powers, and that support for Shevardnadze was the best decision for Russia at this time. But the deputies' criticism of the treaty was of a clearly anti-Yeltsin and, consequently, anti-Georgian nature. Accusations against the Georgian (!) side that it had violated the Sochi agreements and had endeavored to obtain Russian weapons to threaten its neighbors were heard. It was proposed that Russia not guarantee Georgia's integrity but act as an arbiter, as it were, between Tbilisi and the autonomies, that is, de facto constantly keep its hand on the throat of the Georgian state. The proposal for the drawing of a permanent line of demarcation in South Ossetia along the line of the actual control of the Russian forces (that is, de facto annexation of part of the territory) was heard also. It is not important who personally gave voice to these sentiments--they are manifestly dominant in the political class and in society. A sociological survey of the Public Opinion Foundation on the attitude toward Belarus's affiliation to the ruble zone showed that a substantial portion of the Russian population is prepared to forgo to some extent its own living standard even for the sake of preserving a unified post-Soviet space. Criticism of the policy of the regime in the "near abroad" remains, in fact, within the framework of values common to both those doing the criticizing and the criticized. It is more a struggle between those nostalgic for the irrevocable Soviet times of Moscow's full control over the republics and those who--intuitively, perhaps--are attempting to operate within the framework of the new sociopolitical and geopolitical realities.
