All nationalist forces in the Yemeni arena, above all the General People's Congress [GPC], have explored every avenues to resolve the crisis. Toward that end, and in the interest of the country's unity, the GPC offered a series of concessions. In contrast, the other side has given its party's interests precedence over all other interests. However, the good faith inherent in these concessions was not enough to reassure the spiteful gang in the Yemeni Socialist Party as to its standing in a united, democratic, and pluralistic society. This is because, by virtue of its black and bloody history and its awareness of the manner in which the people regard the crimes it has committed against the country's worthy and struggler sons, it knew that it was bound to lose out and that the relapse into disunity was the only way for it to return to the iron-fisted rule that had ended with the proclamation of the blessed unity on 22 May, 1990. We had thought, along with all the worthy unionists on this good land, that 27 April -- the day of democracy -- would put a definitive end to the claims and absurd conditions that the separatist elements within the Socialist Party used to buy time before the right circumstances arrived for putting their secessionist blueprint into practice. The 27 April democracy introduced a new climate symbolizing a victory of the popular option of constitutional legitimacy. However, seeing that this new climate would frustrate their criminal scheme, the officials holding sway in the Socialist Party tried to think up new pretexts in a desparate attempt to create other conditions, at odds with constitutional legitimacy but suiting their separatist bent. Using its extortionist and exploitative approach to the pro-unity forces, the party extracted a fresh string of concessions that had no basis in legitimacy. When the secessionist gang found its plan had no chance other than through war, it sparked off hostilities without the least regard for national interests. At this critical moment in our history, the question arises as to whether this gang within the party will achieve its secession through the war it ignited. If the military situation as it stands is any guide, then unity is here to say. The Republic of Yemen's Armed Forces, with all its corps, are standing shoulder to shoulder, poised to defend the gains most cherished by the people. The coming few days will unmask the ugly face of the gang of apostacy and secession, which is now harvesting all the distress it has sown in our benevolent land. Death to them, life to the homeland and unity.
