We recently conducted an interview with Wang Guoqing, governor of the provincial People's Bank of China, on this question. Wang Guoqing said: In line with the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, the State Council defined the targets of the reform of the banking system as establishing a macro-regulation and control system of the central bank which is placed under State Council leadership and which implements the monetary policy independently; establishing a banking organizational system under which policy-lending business is separated from commercial banking and which takes state-owned commercial banks as the mainstay and allows the coexistence of diverse monetary institutions; and establishing a unified and open network of money markets which advocate orderly competition and are strictly managed. This is a complicated system engineering project of society, involving not only macroeconomic regulation and control but also microeconomic operation. We should implement it in an active and yet prudent manner. Speaking on the problems we have encountered in the process to attain the targets of the reform of the banking system, Wan Guoqing said: We are faced with a rare opportunity for our reform and development. We should seize this opportunity to promote reform with a firm confidence. We should also note, however, that the deep-seated contradictions that bring about loss of control of the total amount of credit and serious inflation have yet to be fundamentally resolved; that effective mechanisms for restraint and mechanisms for risk-taking have yet to be established by monetary institutions; and that the tasks to rectify the banking order have yet to be fulfilled. These are the unfavorable factors affecting the reform of the banking system. In view of this, Wan Guoqing urged: Hebei's banking departments should conscientiously implement the principles for banking work for this year, carry out the various reform measures in line with the unified arrangements of the state, and comprehensively fulfill the tasks of banking work. In particular, we should achieve success in the following work: First, we should continue to rectify the banking order to provide a good environment for the reform of the banking system. We should continuously expand the achievements on the basis of last year's rectification work. Monetary institutions of various categories and at various levels should make continuous efforts to clean up and collect all loans in violation of regulations, correct the business activities in violation of regulations, thoroughly separate themselves from the economic entities they have established, and solve their own problems in an all-round manner. We should continue to investigate and deal with all illegal monetary institutions and the illegal banking business and illegal collection of funds by nonmonetary institutions to safeguard a steady banking order in society. Second, we should bring the total amount of credit under strict control to ensure the smooth progress of the reform of the banking system. To bring the total amount of credit under strict control in the process of changing the old banking system to the new and avoid serious inflation is a need of the reform of the banking system and also a need in establishing the socialist market economy system. We must make it successful this year. In line with relevant state stipulations, monetary institutions of various categories and at various levels should phase in the method of management of the proportions of assets and liabilities under the guidance of quotas and try to use economic means to control the scope of loans. The method of management of the scope of fixed asset loans should be strictly carried out, and the scope must never be exceeded without approval. Conscientious efforts should be made to enliven the use of the loans available, tap the potential of funds, and raise more funds to support economic construction. Third, we should steadily promote the reform of the banking system and actively do a good job in the various preparations. The People's Bank of China, the various specialized banks, and other monetary institutions should make various preparations according to the unified arrangements of the state. 1) They should change concepts and consider issues from the viewpoints of the central bank and commercial bank. 2) They should strengthen their internal management and improve rules and systems to lay a solid foundation for reform. 3) They should do a good job in the calculation and analysis of date and other relevant report work so that they can implement reform measures as soon as possible. 4) They should conscientiously organize staff members and workers to study relevant policy regulations and intensify their training so that everyone will know regulations and how to operate. Fourth, we should conscientiously strengthen banking supervision and management and conduct the reform of the banking system according to law. People's banks of China at various levels should earnestly change their functions and strengthen banking supervision and management. When banking laws and rules are promulgated, we should step up efforts to formulate the detailed regulations for their enforcement and standards for operation. People's banks of China and various monetary institutions should learn to use laws as a weapon to safeguard the safe and effective operation of the banking system, ensure public interests, and defend social stability. Fifth, we should "attach equal importance to two tasks" and successfully build the infrastructure for the banking departments. Realistic improvement of the contingents of staff members and workers and strengthening of various fundamental work are the basic prerequisites for fulfillment of the tasks of the reform of the banking system. Focusing on this year's work stress, Hebei's banking departments should "attach equal importance to two tasks" and win achievements both in the material civilization and the spiritual civilization. Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China and all monetary institutions should do a good job in accounting, joint final accounts, cash receipt and payment, fund distribution, foreign exchange control, and business and security to lay a solid foundation for the reform of the banking system.
