What these acts of terror threaten is the existing communal peace between Muslim and Christian communities in Mindanao. The peace process is moving on its own momentum. It is unlikely to be seriously disturbed by random terrorism. MNLF spokesmen have come out immediately to pronounce the peace process safe. Misuari's movement has nothing to gain and everything to lose if the bombings precipitate an atmosphere of communal conflict. Secessionism has lost the luster it once enjoyed. By maintaining a hardline position for too long, the MNLF has been marginalized in the politics of Muslim Mindanao. Rival tribal leaders have stolen much of Misuari's former clout. The movement he leads has been excluded from the new framework of factional political positioning in the south -- the autonomous government. The MNLF leadership wants desperately to move closer to the mainstream. The movement seeks to recover the constituencies it once enjoyed when it promised prosperity through nationhood to the impoverished Muslim masses. It can begin to move out of the political doldrums only if it helps push the peace process forward. Misuari understands that. His supporters among the Tausog elite, elbowed aside in the struggle for influence over the autonomous government, understand that. But not all of the mass base of the obsolete secessionist movement grasp the necessity for systematically terminating the armed struggle to the satisfaction of all. A new virus has entered the already chaotic politics of the Islamic communities of the south. That virus is militant Islamic fundamentalism. Fundamentalism appropriated the romance that was earlier vested in secessionism. In its more moderate mode, this creeping fundamentalism has been expressed in the emergence of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) -- rival to the MNLF. The MILF has a more pronounced Islamic identity, distinguishing it from the distastefully secular MNLF program. Although controlled by the traditional aristocratic elites of the Maguindanao and Maranao communities, it has positioned itself as the expression of Moro self-assertion in an increasingly uncertain and fluid reality. But even the MILF cannot absorb the more militant variants of Islamic fundamentalism. Because of this, more militant minor sects have emerged, such as the notorious Abu Sayaf group. The more militant fundamentalist armed bands touch a dangerous chord among disenchanted young Muslims. They raise the new encroachment of Christian migrants into Muslim land as the source of misery for the Moros. They vow to rid the Moros of that encroachments. While the MNLF wallowed in the political doldrums, the more militant fundamentalist bands captured the imagination of the discontented in a series of bold and violent acts. Among these are the kidnappings of foreign missionaries. Note that one of the demands put forward by the kidnappers of Charles Walton, was the expulsion of all foreign (Christian) missionaries from Mindanao. For too long, however, the MNLF failed to clarify its own position against these rabid bands. They sheltered fundamentalist armed groups in their territories. They dealt with them with a fraternal soft glove. In the meantime, government forces were hesitant to deal forcefully with these bands for fear of damaging the peace process. Now the problem has blossomed to such an extent that the possibility of Muslim-Christian hostilities could not be discounted. Recall that during the kidnapping of Spanish priest Bernardo Blanco, Christians in Basilan offered to set up vigilante bands. That could repeat itself in Davao. If the situation worsens, government could find itself having to deal with a re-run of the violence between the "barracudas [Muslim group]" and the "ilagas [rats-Christian group]" that happened during the late '60s and early '70s. That insane cycle of violence was a prelude to full-scale war. Should tensions escalate and communities find themselves having to defend themselves with arms, the dance of peace between government and the MNLF will be rendered academic. There will be too many combatants in the fray to allow for predictability. The situation should have been nipped in the bud when the Basilan kidnappings began happening. Now the unhealthy situation is on the verge of bloom. The MNLF must do something more than issue press statements -- or else continue abetting the problem.
