The most important of them was the Agreement on Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments. The drafting of the document demanded maximum efforts on the part of the two sides and lasted for almost a year. Representatives of more than 30 ministries and departments participated in debates over this key document, all the preliminary drafts were discussed at the sessions of the Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers committees. [Grigorovich] Could you brief us on the legal basis of this document? Have there been any problems in drafting it? [Radkevich] The document creates a legal basis for the involvement and efficient use in Belarus of the vast potential of U.S. investments. Regardless of the firm and often uncompromising stance of the U.S. side, we managed to alter the text of the agreement adjusting it to the real state of affairs in the economy and to Belarusian laws. By the way, before signing the agreement with Belarus, the United States signed bilateral agreements on promotion and mutual protection of investments with Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova. [Grigorovich] As is known, according to the Belarusian-U.S. agreement on trade relations signed in February 1993, the sides granted each other the status of most favored nation. What effect did it have on our relations? [Radkevich] This in particular means that Belarusian enterprises and companies do not have to pay higher customs duty for exporting their products to the United States. In addition, our products enjoy all the privileges granted to other states. Belarus would receive other privileges had it joined the U.S. General System of Preferences, temporarily exempting certain categories of products from customs duty. Prime Minister V. Kebich once sent a letter to the United States regarding this issue. Unfortunately, for some reason, President Clinton made no declaration concerning Belarusian admission to this system. Yet, we are continuing to work in that direction. [Grigorovich] What is your opinion about other agreements and accords discussed and signed during Clinton's talks with the Belarusian leadership? [Radkevich] I want to underline that during the talks the U.S. side promised to increase financial aid to Belarus within the framework of the Nunn-Lugar Law to $100 million, although the agreement signed by the Belarusian defense minister and the U.S. secretary of defense stipulated $63. 56 million. This project envisions realigning military technologies and potential to civilian tracks and establishing an exports control system. The latter is to prevent the proliferation of mass annihilation armaments from Belarus to other states and to restore the environment at former strategic missile facilities. Belarus is to provide material and technical assistance and services necessary to establish a communications hot-line with the Republic. A further increase in assistance will depend on the progress of economic reform in Belarus, including privatization and denationalization. I would like to point out that Belarus will not receive these financial means in "monetary" form -- they will be apparatuses for discovering nuclear substances and narcotics, communication equipment for customs checkpoints, and the like. [Grigorovich] Will any joint structures and organs be formed to step up our economic relations? [Radkevich] Belarus and the United States have agreed to form a bilateral committee for promoting business. Its efforts will be directed at revealing and resolving problems hampering business activities. The committee will be headed by U.S. Department of Commerce Adviser Jan Kalicki and S. Atroshchenko, deputy chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations. A U.S. business center will be opened in Minsk. The project has been approved by the United States Agency for International Development. The opening of the center is scheduled for the first half of 1994. The U.S. Congress has already earmarked $7 million for establishing business centers in Russia and other CIS states. The share for Belarus is $1 million. [Grigorovich] On the eve of President Clinton's visit to Minsk, the Belarusian Ministry of Finance reportedly signed a general accord with the U.S. Exports and Imports Bank on stimulating projects. [Radkevich] The signing of this agreement was preceded by strenuous work. We are very grateful to the U.S. Embassy in Minsk for the assistance they rendered. All in all, our Republic may receive some $1 billion from the credit line opened by the Eximbank for Belarus. Only those projects will be subsidized whose priority meaning for the national economy will be confirmed by the Belarusian Ministry of Finance and the National Bank. [Grigorovich] How do you assess the general state of Belarusian-U.S. relations? [Radkevich] Relations between our states have been constantly expanding and developing. Preliminary data demonstrate that the aggregate products turnover between Belarus and the United States reached $126 million in 1993. The U.S. credit line has been fully utilized, which gives grounds to hope that it will be expanded in the future. U.S. business circles have been manifesting a growing interest in our Republic. As of today, U.S. companies have invested in 123 Belarusian enterprises; 18 firms have opened their branches in Belarus. Belarus feels the U.S. support on the international arena, especially in such influential economic organizations as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the IMF, which allocated $226.3 million to Belarus in 1993.
