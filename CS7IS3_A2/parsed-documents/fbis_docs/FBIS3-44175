In this solemn moment, I would like to sincerely thank him for fully trusting me--trust that I will strive to further serve. [passage omitted] I would like to stress that while accepting the functions of president of the high institution that President Henri Konan Bedie has assigned to me, I will automatically give up the post of deputy that I have been occupying. I cannot be a judge and parliamentarian at the same. My resignation is effective immediately. Similary, as of today I give up all my functions within the PDCI-RDA steering organs because of the neutrality demanded by my new responsibilities. [end recording]
