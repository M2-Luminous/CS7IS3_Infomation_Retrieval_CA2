This is due to the stupidity shown in the taking of many important decisions by ignoramuses who for various reasons found themselves at the top after the fall of the totalitarian regime in 1989, the general said. The destructive attitude to the military industry led to its almost complete rout, General Andreev said. The system of scientific technological intelligence has also been ruined, according to him. There are no guarantees that there will be no painful experimenting with the fate of the state by the method of trial and error in the period before and after elections, General Andreev believes. At a recently held meeting President Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov agreed to set up a centre for training civilian personnel for the army and for the military training of civilian specialists, General Andreev said at a briefing today. The centre will work with the assistance of the G.S. Rakovski Military Academy in Sofia. The Defence Ministry intends to invite for training at the centre officials of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church because of its important role in raising the morale of the Bulgarian Army, General Andreev added. From 6 to 10 senior officers will compete for a place in the one-year general staff courses which will start this autumn at the Military Academy, Major General Kiril Ermenkov, chief of the academy, said at the briefing. The training of Bulgaria's future strategists is an event of prime importance, General Andreev said. In this field too Bulgaria, whose generals were so far trained only abroad, is lagging behind the other former socialist countries, the Defence Ministry believes. The courses will be conducted by foreign and Bulgarian lecturers and leading specialists, politicians and scientists of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and of other institutes, the chief of the Military Academy said.
