Ch. Mungra in Paramaribo; date not given: "`The Recovery of the Surinamese Economy Should Limit Exodus'"] [Text] Paramaribo -- In Suriname they are already saying jokingly: Will the last person to leave please switch off the lights. Will that person be President Venetiaan? Or the former Army Leader Bouterse perhaps? It is estimated that last year another 10,000 Surinamese did not come back from a "holiday" in the Netherlands, like the year before. There seems to be no end to emigration. Many Surinamese are asking themselves in despair how long this can go on. The reasons why the Surinamese people decide to seek refuge abroad in massive numbers have varied: In 1975 it was uncertainty about independence, then it was the military government, and now it is the economic collapse. Foreign Minister Dr. S. Ch. Mungra also has concerns about emigration. Not that Suriname will empty suddenly -- in 1992 the General Statistical Office estimated that there were still 420,000 inhabitants. It is above all the departure of the top management which causes him real concern. "We are in the middle of an economic adjustment program," he said. "That means that purchasing power must be lost. That is a sacrifice. But many people do not want to wait for recovery. Our problem is that we want to consume like a western industrialized country but we produce like a Third World country. Unfortunately, we, the Surinamese, regardless of who is to blame, have been destroying our economy for the last 10 years. Just think about the war here, which led to a drastic drop in exports." The minister said that the distressing position of education also played a role. In addition to the problems with school transport and the regular strikes, lessons sometimes stop for weeks because a teacher has not returned from his holidays overseas. "That makes people leave too," he said. "They hope to be able to give their children a better education abroad." The Netherlands is not open to immigration, according to a cabinet decision, and therefore The Hague is sticking by the visa requirement. In contrast, the Paramaribo has been calling for the free movement of people for years. "Many Surinamese reason as follows: Once I have that visa, I will stay in the Netherlands," Mungra said. "But if you are free to travel, then the urge to stay is far less, because people know that they can always return to the Netherlands. And in my view the Netherlands can build in enough guarantees so that people do not stay unnecessarily." Abolishing the visa requirement is not a point of discussion between the two countries: Their positions are diametrically opposed. "But I still think that special family links justify the free movement of people," he said. Wage differences Despite all the optimism about the start of the Venetiaan Government, very few immigrants return with a bonus to Suriname. "The difference in salaries is too big," Mungra said. "We can never pay them what they earned in the Netherlands. Here a minister earns U.S. $150 , when the salary is converted. That is less than a cleaner receives in the Foreign Ministry in The Hague." Figures from the Migration Institute in Paramaribo show that the number of people using the scheme annually has varied between 55 and 155 for years. Around half of them are on social security or receive a pension and therefore make no active contribution to constructing the country. It is also estimated that round 50 percent of the returning immigrants are back in the Netherlands after two years. The minister wants to make a priority of giving upper management a salary bonus in hard Netherlands guilders. The money for this was to come from the development cooperation funding. "We want very much to prevent more management from leaving and encourage well-educated countrymen in the Netherlands to return," he said. "After all, it is they who sustain development. I do not expect any jealous faces in the Army and middle management: We have other support measures for them in prospect." People were inclined solely to material welfare, Mungra said. "But welfare is not well-being," he added. "In the Netherlands everyone lives on top of one another, you have 1,001 rules and you have to work a whole year for 21 days under the Spanish sun. Here it is easy-going, there is space, a clean environment and there is fine weather every day." Hopeless Although the crisis seems to appear more hopeless every day, the minister is strikingly optimistic about the chances of the tide turning. "First of all, we are busy with restoring and -- even more so -- maintaining the rule of law and democracy," he said. "Because of course those are also important for citizens. I cannot see any new dictatorial movements forming here. ``Also I am hopeful that the development relationship with the Netherlands can be restored in the second half of this year,'' he said. "Then the industry fund can start up so that production gets going. That will cause an uplift in the economy. That would be an important psychological factor. ``So far we have not been able to impose the price increases because the economic measures were not implemented simultaneously,'' he said. "You cannot make cutbacks first and only afterwards do something for the productive sector. But we can already see that a large number of investments are getting off the ground: The bauxite sector, the gold and wood sectors, and the oil refinery, which is to be ready in 1996. Also this year we will join Caricom, the Caribbean Community, with a market of 250 million people. You certainly cannot say that Suriname has done nothing to make its economy healthy." Nevertheless the Netherlands, the Antilles, the United States, and neighboring French Guiana remain irresistibly attractive. Many people have plans to emigrate. But do Surinamese in the Netherlands get what they thought they would find? [passage omitted]
