Under the headline "Marines Know How To Radar"--a play on the Spanish words equivalent to radar and swim, which sound similar in Spanish--LA PRENSA says the United States will install radar sites which will be connected to the radar network already installed in Central America. The arrival of between 120 and 150 U.S. soldiers, who, according to the Colombian Government, started to arrive on 28 December as part of a civilian project construction agreement, has aroused a lively controversy among political leaders. The government says the U.S. soldiers' presence deals with the construction of schools, health posts, and several kilometers of roads in Juanchaco on the Pacific coast. LA PRENSA, however, has reported: "The U.S. Marines in Bahia Malaga intend mainly to conduct preliminary studies for the construction of a complex network of radar sites at a place regarded by the U.S. Government as the most strategic on the Pacific Ocean, near the Panama Canal." Citing a report from its special correspondent Fernando Cortes, LA PRENSA, an opposition conservative paper, says the first radar site would cover from Bahia Solano on the coast to Panama and would link up with radar sites installed in Central America and the Caribbean, including Colombian-owned San Andres island. The paper continues to say that with these sites the Pentagon seeks to curb drug trafficking in the Pacific because the Governments of Colombia and the United States have for a long time been aware of the growing number of Cali Cartel routes in this area. LA PRENSA further adds that 36 U.S. engineers are already in Bahia Malaga and that others are scheduled to arrive aboard several Black Hawk helicopters today. "They will be flown in directly from the Southern Command in Panama, and along the Humboldt current, in very covert flights to avert new incidents with the public if Colombian radar discovers them," LA PRENSA said.
