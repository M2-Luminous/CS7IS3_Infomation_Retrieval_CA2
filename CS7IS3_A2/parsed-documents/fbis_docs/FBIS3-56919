The letter details the conditions which allow the signing of the Lithuanian-Polish interstate treaty. "We are greatly surprised by the authors' proposal for the Polish Government to resolve such issues which are the prerogative of our domestic policy, and which we have solved since the very restoration of our independence," reads the statement by Lithuanian lawmakers. "This demonstrates that the authors of the letter are not well informed about the current situation of ethnic minorities, including the Polish one, residing in Lithuania. Experts from international organizations have concluded that the rights of ethnic minorities and their possibilities to preserve their ethnic identity meet the requirements of international conventions." "We express hope that the statement by a group of Polish Sejm members will not become an obstacle to signing a Lithuania-Polish interstate agreement and declaration in the near future," concludes the statement.
