The statement reads: Recently, the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) submitted to the UN Security Council a wrong report related to the core refueling operations at the five megawatt experimental nuclear power plant in the DPRK, misrepresenting facts as if the method of the core refueling operations employed by the DPRK would offer slim technical possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods, and the UN Security Council, accordingly, adopted posthaste a "presidential statement". As is known, our five megawatt experimental nuclear power plant had no other choice but to begin the core refuelling operations from early May for technical or safety reasons. Since we are in a unique status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the [Nuclear] Non-Proliferation Treaty, we are not under obligation to accept routine and ad hoc inspections under the safeguards agreement but are obligated only to ensure the inspection for the continuity of safeguards knowledge. The selection and securing of some fuel rods requested by the IAEA with regard to the core refueling operations is activities for the verification of the completeness of the initial report. In the long run, this activity falls under the category of ad hoc inspection. The selection and securing of some fuel rods, therefore, can never be allowed before our unique status is removed. But, we are doing the core refueling operations in such a manner that we fully preserve technical possibility for later measurement of such fuel rods as requested by the agency in token of good faith, anticipating a dissolution of our unique status. At present, the operations of the core refueling and all the fuel in the transfer channel, spent fuel pond and damaged fuel dry storage are under strict containment and surveillance by the agency. Two surveillance cameras installed by the agency at the reactor hall where refueling is going on, are monitoring the core area, fuel channels and equipment hatch and movements of the refueling machines. And the IAEA spent fuel rod counter system with a silicon semi-conductor detector, a fission chamber, an ionization chamber and a position sensor has been installed in the spent fuel discharge channel to constantly measure and count the spent fuel rod being discharged into baskets. The agency has planted thermoluminescence detectors and seals in all the channels which may be considered to be diversion paths and two surveillance cameras in the building of the spent fuel pond, to monitor and control the flow of nuclear material. Notably, at the time of the inspection in May, in order to make efficient use of the surveillance devices of the agency during the refueling, we provided all the conditions requested by it, such as the replacement of computers and their parts in the spent fuel rod counter, the installation of uninterruptable power supply to the IAEA surveillance devices and lighting system for spent fuel pond building. Thus, the non-diversion of nuclear material during the refueling, is firmly guaranteed. This is admitted by the inspectors of the agency now observing the whole processes of refueling. Our core refueling operations is being done in such a manner that we preserve technical possibility of later measurement. The fuel rods have been unloaded from the reactor core by the refueling machine channel by channel, channel group by channel group in sequence in the reactor hall, and all the spent fuel rods from four channels have been discharged into one basket. Baskets of spent fuel are placed in their own positions of the spent fuel pond. Accounting and operating records concerning all the operation of refueling, including the basket identification number, the channel identification number, the sequence of fuel rods in channels, and the position of baskets in the pond, are being kept at facility. Also the identification number of baskets and their positions in the pond are being strictly ascertained by the agency's inspectors now present during the operation of refueling. This shows that the refueling operations are now being conducted in the presence of IAEA inspectors in such a manner that we preserve technical possibilities of their future measurement. So, it is possible to reconstruct the channels of the fuel rods in baskets and the sequence of rods in the channels in any time if necessary. The channels of fuel rods and the sequence of fuel rods in them can be identified by means of the measured value of the gamma rays for the fuel rods and the calculated value of the distribution of neutron flux along the channels. This method has been fully proved through experiment under wet and dry conditions. When this method is applied, the working amount of measurement may slightly be larger than that by the method of selecting fuel rods in the reactor core. But it is the only rational method in our present situation. It is a scientific method proposed by the operators in the spirit of cooperation, out of the sincere desire to demonstrate the transparency of our nuclear activities. At the consultation held in Pyongyang a few days ago as regards the refueling, the head of the IAEA delegation, too, said that the DPRK-proposed method was reasonable from the theoretical point of view and that he would study it back at the agency, and inform us of the results. This notwithstanding, some officials of the IAEA Secretariat hurriedly submitted to the United Nations Security Council a report based on their unilateral, wrong judgement that the technical possibility of a future measurement of the fuel rods is insufficient, on May 27 when the negotiations were under way, before the consultation team arrived in Vienna, not waiting for the results. Since the agency promised us to study our proposal after going back to Vienna, it should have given us a scientific and technical clarification. Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council did a very irresponsible and unfair act according to a scenario written by some member nations beforehand, claiming that the core refueling operation must be made in accordance with the standards of the agency and, if not, the technical possibility of later measurement of the fuel rods might be lost. Such an unjustifiable behavior of the agency Secretariat and the UN Security Council was by no means fortuitous. The agency Secretariat deliberately avoided presence at the refueling ignoring our just proposal for its presence from the beginning, and hindered the normal operation of our nuclear facilities. When we were compelled to start the refueling operation for technical or safety reasons, it charged that we started the refueling in the absence of its inspectors. The unjustifiable pressure campaign launched against us by the IAEA and some member nations of the UN Security Council with regard to the core refueling operation in our country bears close resemblance to the previous pressure campaign based on the results of the inspection in March. It is their trite method to lay deliberate obstacles in the way of the solution to the nuclear issue by unreasonably taking the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK to the United Nations and internationalizing and politicizing it each time some progress was made in its solution by the DPRK's sincere efforts and flexible position. Facts clearly indicate that the agency Secretariat has pursued a sinister political purpose of stifling the DPRK from the beginning according to a ready-made scenario, far from taking a stand for a solution to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. If some officials of the agency Secretariat declare that the technical possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods is gone, we cannot but take a decisive countermeasure. If the IAEA Secretariat truly want a solution to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, it must not continue expanding its partiality with such unreasonable acts as hurriedly submitting a report based on a wrong judgement to the UN Security Council as it did this time, but squarely look at the situation and return to its original, fair position befitting an international organization.
