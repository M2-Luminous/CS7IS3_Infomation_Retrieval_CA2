In other words, mountains cannot meet, whereas people can. This saying or proverb is reiterated on occasions when adversaries, estranged people, and people in disagreement meet, especially when the desire or ambition to meet exists. This idea comes to mind when one sees and hears what millions saw and heard via the live television relay of the meeting between U.S. President Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva last Sunday. Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, which must have been drafted in advance because it is not for nothing or just to drink a cup of coffee together that prominent leaders meet--regardless of the outcome, we say that this meeting in itself gives a good idea of the developments occurring in the current policy. Each of the two men who met amid strict security measures in Geneva came from a different land, different time, with a different legacy, and also with a different dream. But they met, and in this contrast lies the essence of the harmony that will perhaps dominate the political logic of the post-cold war world. In this contrast lies the fall of the ideological givens and the collapse of the old guard in today's, and perhaps in tomorrow's, world At the press conference held after the meeting, President Clinton said that he had heard about the Syrian president's endurance and that he became certain of this endurance through the discussions which lasted more than four hours between the two of them and after which he had to take a break to rest. President Clinton added that despite this, the two men were able to discuss numerous issues. This reference shows not only what news agencies reported on the eve of the meeting about the personal qualities of each of the two presidents but also indicate, if we dive beyond the surface of the words, the degree of difference in the makeup and aspirations of each of the two presidents. But despite this, the meeting went on and continued. It did not break up the way the Reykjavik summit in Iceland between Gorbachev and Reagan near the end of the cold war broke up. The world has changed to such a degree that decisionmakers in all parts of this world seek to meet, in spite of their differences. Reports, the likes of which President Clinton must have read before meeting with al-Asad, say that the Syrian president is the last Arab radical, that he is the "cunning ascetic" who is characterized by "patience, cunning, and the determination to maintain a vital role for himself in the regional and international arenas." The reports add that he is an "Arab nationalist with a penetrating insight and one who always clings to the long-range view of affairs." On the other side, the U.S. President seems to be the antithesis of his partner at the meeting. In addition to the difference of generations to which each of the two presidents belongs and the nearly two-decade difference in their ages, Clinton is as far from radicalism as can be. He is closer to the impetuosity characterizing the members of his generation, which was raised in the embraces of the boundless U.S. liberalism and of the pragmatism that hallows no particular tactic or strategy and that emanates from the dynamic U.S. spirit which moves with extraordinary flexibility within the framework of the immediate moment and interest. It may be said that personal dimensions are nothing but a narrow margin on the cards of the major players at the political table. What is fundamental and more important in their cards lies in the legacy of government in their countries and in certain strategies that are not determined by individuals, regardless of the degree of their influence, but by their countries' major interests. Even in this regard, the distance was immense between the two leaders at last Sunday's summit in Geneva. Al-Asad went to Geneva, carrying in his quiver arrows aimed at certain targets, which have been defined by observers as: refraining from bargaining on any pan-Arab constants, especially land. Land is sacred in the political education that was received by the Syrian president's generation and which has continued to be disseminated among subsequent generations, especially in Syria. This is a pan-Arab strategy. The Israelis are aware of this. Gad Ben Ari, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's spokesman, has said, "I don't expect any flexibility to develop in the Syrian position and I don't expect Syria to reduce the price it demands in return for peace." The same view is reflected in a statement made by Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to Washington, who said prior to Sunday's summit, "There is a difference between the hopes that Syria and the United States attach to these meetings. Of course, there is a difference between the Syrian hopes and Israeli hopes." It is well known that Rabinovich heads the Israeli delegation to the bilateral talks with Syria--talks which have been running in place for more than a year. So, the Golan is not just a strategic Syrian plateau from which it is difficult for Israel to withdraw. Rather, it is a symbol of the immense disagreement within the meeting and a stumbling block on the path of the peace negotiations. It is also evidence of the new logic that calls for continuing the dialogue despite the evident impossibility of reaching agreement. Even though the new Israeli Government accepted the principle of withdrawal from the Golan Heights for the first time in September 1992, it said that this withdrawal would not be a complete withdrawal. A week before the Clinton-al-Asad meeting, Rabin declared, "To date, I have only talked about withdrawal from the Golan, not from the entire Golan. This is my position." Yosi Beilin, the Israeli deputy foreign minister, has said within nearly the same context, "I am convinced that the establishment of Jewish settlements in the Golan Heights or in any other territories after the 1967 war was a mistake. But now that the settlements exist, we cannot erase them from the map so simply." The Golan, where 12,000 Israeli settlers live in 33 settlements next to 16,000 Druze citizens, continues to create obstacles. Israeli settlers have sent Clinton a message through the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to ask him not to pressure Israel to withdraw from the heights. Sammy Bar-Lev, a leader of the settlers in the occupied Syrian heights, has said, "The U.S. diplomat who received the message has asserted that the U.S. policy is based on not pressuring Israel." So, the obstacle is huge. But the endeavors have not ceased, especially when we learn that those who have taken over the Middle East dossier in the Clinton administration are friends of Israel, which Clinton characterized in his election campaign as the "strategic and democratic ally." In one of his messages to voters, Clinton said, "Yes, Israel and the United States are at a turning point.... We ask you for generous financial support. Will you help me restore logic to the U.S.-Israeli relationship? Please, answer today and be generous. I swear that if I am elected president, I will never disappoint Israel." Figuring prominently among those who have taken over the Middle East dossier is Martin Indyk, an ex-chairman of Washington's Middle East Policy Institute, which is close to AIPAC [American-Israel Public Affairs Committee]. He was asked to draft an analysis to help formulate Clinton's Middle East plan. Indyk was helped in this regard by Les Aspin and Samuel Lewis. The former is a member of the advisory board of JENSA [as transliterated], a Jewish institute, and the second was a U.S. ambassador to Israel and then worked as chairman of the Israeli Bank Leumi. For the negotiations, Indyk proposed a U.S. policy that would embrace the Israeli viewpoint to the letter, whether on bilateral or regional negotiation issues. Indyk also insisted on rejecting the PLO and the idea of a Palestinian state and emphasized the need to besiege and pressure Syria and to give absolute priority to Israel's needs. [20 Jan p 15] [Text] In view of all of these circumstances, it may seem to those who experienced the old-style politics that any meeting between Clinton and al-Asad would be futile and a waste of time. But there are new considerations that become revealed when matters are viewed from a new angle. For Syria, and we mean President al-Asad here, there are fundamental developments that make the world one that is different from the world in which Syria set the ceiling of its pan-Arab aspirations. The main support for Syria's military capability, and we mean here the Soviet Union, has nearly evaporated. The Arab system in which Syria formed a main axis has disintegrated and broken down since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and since the subsequent breakdowns, as a result of which the Arab system has nearly collapsed. All these developments make the Syrian determination to cling to patience and obstinacy some sort of a miracle, especially Syria's rejection of 'Arafat's performance in the Gaza- Jericho accord. Syria bargained on the meager chances of success of the big hopes attached to this accord. It won the wager when the day for withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Jericho arrived without the accomplishment of this withdrawal. This point was added to the miracle of the Syrian obstinacy which borders on being some sort of extraordinarily sensitive political intuition or some sort of lucky strikes that come only to those who deserve them. So, there are changes in the shape of the world around Syria. Despite its proficient intuition or its good luck, Syria is aware of the dimensions of this change. As for Clinton's United States, there is something new here too, despite the U.S. strategic constants. Peter Tarnoff, U.S. undersecretary of state, has said, "Washington's international role will diminish because of the end of the cold war and because of the domestic U.S. economic crises." Even though U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher hastened to refute his deputy's statements, saying, "The United States holds, and will continue to hold, its distinguished place at the top of the new world order," Tarnoff's statements are profoundly significant. They are similar in nature to facts revealed by a slip of the tongue and they provide an indication of dimensions of the crisis experienced vis-a-vis the developments which the new Democrat U.S. administration is trying to absorb after a long absence from the White House. In addition to the strategic surprise embodied in the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, a collapse which has put the United States in the labyrinth of one who is looking for his next foe after the disappearance of a stubborn foe--in addition to this state of political ambiguity, the new administration lacked young cadres capable of keeping up with the consecutive developments emanating from the disappearance of the foe who had determined the power of the United States itself and who had mobilized its latent strengths. This is why Clinton has been compelled to rely on numerous figures from Carter's administration. Moreover, the Democrats have had to give up many of their conventional ideas and to adopt some Republican ideas and, consequently, they have had to deal with the U.S. foreign tendencies selectively and on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, it has become possible to ignore conventional constants in the Democrats' policy (such as sovereignty, democracy, human rights, and the UN's role) to adopt some sort of interventionism, which is called in the Democrats' new literature a "new kind of international intervention." But this intervention is indebted essentially to the Republicans' conventional tendencies. Between the constant and the changeable in the new U.S. strategies, there arises to the surface a question about the Middle East's place in this state of affairs. The answer is summed up in that the United States will not confine itself to dealing with Israel as just a strategic ally, but will also deal with it as a "strategic partner," according to Dr. Muhammad al-Sayyid Sa'id, an expert on Arab strategy, who has added that the U.S. view of Israel as a strategic ally in the Middle East "means large possibilities of expansion in concluding joint weapons development programs, especially anti-rocket missiles. The important difference here is that the doves in the U.S. international military strategy are hawks where Israel is concerned, and they are loyal allies of Israel in particular." All these circumstances make the observer who examines what is below the surface closely realize that Israel's strategic weight is increasing, not decreasing, in the body of the U.S. policy. But the careful observer must also realize that the Arabs' refraining--especially by Syria which stands on the frontline with Israel--from dealing with this state of affairs represents silence on a tumor that grows and spreads until it becomes able to devour the entire body or it represents silence on a benign tumor that could become malignant if precautions are not taken to avert its further transformation. It seems that the Syrian president has chosen to deal with this condition without delay. Meanwhile, the U.S. President seeks to move efficiently with his administration beyond just rearranging the affairs of his house to dealing with the world outside this house. It is no coincidence that Sunday's summit in Geneva came as a stop in a trip that took Bill Clinton to the den of his old foe to peacefully clip this foe's last claw in return for a few billion to be paid in installments. Clinton succeeded in wresting and disassembling the Ukraine's nuclear missiles and in purchasing the uranium they contain. He also succeeded in staging a scene that is of profound significance to the Americans--a scene embodied in turning the direction of the nuclear missiles of the former Soviet Union, which are found in Russia currently, away from U.S. cities. Perhaps at his meeting in Geneva, Clinton sought to eliminate the threat from a region that is of fundamental concern to the U.S. strategic interests. At a time when the new U.S. administration views Israel, according to its advisers' vision, as a strategic ally, it realizes that the ignition of any fires in the region will burn some of its interests. This is why the endeavor to launch a state of peace in the region is a sincere endeavor, even if it has been coupled with securing the "highest ceiling" of conditions or price in favor of Israel. Yes, there are conflicting and intersecting interests in the Arab-Israeli condition. But by changing the perspective and taking the new developments into account, the examiner can find fine threads of joint interests if peace is accomplished, even if at the highest ceiling of the conditions of the parties concerned. The worsening danger of religious radicalism is something that all can see, be they Arabs, Americans, or Israelis. Transforming the battlefields into open markets provides numerous or some opportunities, even to the weaker parties within these markets, provided that the will to be industrious is there. It seems that "Syria's merchants" are confident of their skill and aren't afraid of opening these markets. The world has changed swiftly in recent years, and it is still changing at an accelerating pace. It seems that all have developed the conviction that woe will befall those who fail to catch up with this train. Sunday's meeting in Geneva between al-Asad and Clinton was some sort of catching up with the train of the speeding changes. All concealed results not withstanding, it suffices that this summit has produced a declaration of readiness to come out of the old fortresses and an acceptance of the logic of change. The U.S. President stated most explicitly that Syria is the key to comprehensive peace in the region and President al-Asad expressed his readiness to shoulder all the consequences of peace with Israel. Truly, mountains do not meet, but people do. Mountains collapse if they move. But the outcome of every endeavor by men is an addition, or at least an addition in which there is no loss. We are confident that the meeting was a gain for all, or so we hope.
