The visit of the leader of the revolution came as the children were (?soon) to leave the Great Jamahiryah upon the request of the Bosnian Government which confirmed that the areas the children will return to have become safe areas. During the visit, the leader of the revolution met with these children in an encounter which showed the human interest extended by the leader to them and their well being and provision of all the necessary resources and comfort in the Great Jamahiryah. On this occasion, the leader of the revolution made the following speech: "Firstly, we are pleased that you are returning to your families who are now in safe areas. But we are sad to see you go for you are our children [words indistinct] too you were in your home and with your fathers and mothers who are Libyans. Now you have mothers and fathers both in Libya and Bosnia. Your home is Bosnia and Libya. Also we are happy at your return to your families. We are sad at the plight suffered by the Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is a hard lesson not only for the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina but to the international conscience. A bitter lesson for all mankind. But this bitterness leads us for further struggle against religious and racial discrimination. This was responsible for this tragedy hence we must fight for the eliminaion of the enemies of mankind. We fight against those who enjoy the suffering of children. The killing of fathers and mothers of these children constitutes a horrific crime and so was the separation of a little child from his mother and father in Europe which fooled us with the its [as received] claim of being civilized while it was without any conscience. The whole peaceful population of Yugoslavia was subjected to an ugly crime. This people was united and Yugoslavs were living next to each regardless of their religion. Muslims were living with Christians. It was one people living in one country. However, criminal power and influence seekers did not hesistate to torture you and render you homeless. What is the value of any new action if only achieved on the dead bodies of these children? What is the worth of any objective if achieved only at the expense of these children and as a result of torturing them? You were not the only victims of torture. Human conscience was tortured and all honourable peoples in the world felt your pain. You have provided a history lesson. You showed the consequences of war and religious discrimination. You have rendered a service to mankind for by being separated from your parents and the torture you endured you showed that war is a harmful and renounced act and that religious and racial discrimination is a despicable [word indistinct]. We are sad at your leaving and God willing, we will meet with you when you are older and stronger when you would have forgotten this difficult period. We hope to see you when you are happier."
