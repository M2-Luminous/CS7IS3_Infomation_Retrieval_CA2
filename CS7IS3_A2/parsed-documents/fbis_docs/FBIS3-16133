Alongside the leaders of the Samoobrona National Front, which invited him to its first congress, waiting for Zhirinovskiy at Warsaw's Okecie Airport were a group of young people described by commentators as belonging to an "antifascist organization" of the capital's university. As Zhirinovskiy left the airport terminal, these young people joined the rush of reporters towards him, shouting "Black Pig," "Go Away," and "Get out of Poland." Uniformed men of the so-called Polish legion, Samoobrona's youth organization, their faces concealed by their caps, leapt to the defense of their guest. A police squad had to wield truncheons to break up the melee. Reporters involved in the scuffle, some of them tenderly touched by the truncheons, made indignant mention in their dispatches of the tough conduct of the squad that dispersed them. However, they were unable to find out from the airport authorities to which police unit it belonged. Reporters also noticed that for three quarters of an hour, border guards failed to let Zhirinovskiy and those with him through. The guards claim that this was because their guest's bodyguards had no visas, although Poland and Russia are known to operate an agreement on visa-free travel. The arrival of the LDPR leader was preceded by an unprecedented campaign in the Polish press and political circles. Calls to ban him from entering the country were voiced even in the Polish Sejm, on Friday. A special opinion poll was published here on the eve of Zhirinovskiy's arrival. According to its authors, 66 percent of Poles believe that the LDPR leader "is a threat to Poland."
