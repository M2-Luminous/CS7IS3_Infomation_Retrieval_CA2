General Nuamann is in Russia on an official visit at the invitation of the chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces. Grachev spoke against the use of force in resolving the Bosnian problem. According to him, the experience of U.S. military actions in Vietnam and of the Soviet Army in Afghanistan proves that one must find political ways for resolving international disputes and overcoming armed conflicts. Grachev thinks that if the bomb strikes are still carried out, no good will come of it. The Russian defense minister pointed out that, in any case, the Russian peacekeeping forces would remain in the former Yugoslavia and would continue their peacekeeping mission there.
