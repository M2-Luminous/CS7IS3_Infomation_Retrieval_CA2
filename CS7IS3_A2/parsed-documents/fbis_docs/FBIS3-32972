The foreign minister indicated that during a meeting in Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told him about "the willingness for an opening and that countries which have implemented economic reforms take precedence." Di Tella stressed that the United States has sold the Skyhawk fighter planes to Argentina, despite British opposition, because "it has admitted that our country is a reliable country, even from a military viewpoint." He encouraged the United Kingdom "to review this new event." The minister denied that the sale of Skyhawk planes satisfied the British. He pointed out that, quite the contrary, the British authorities "staged a stubborn and systematic opposition because, from a military viewpoint, Argentina did not seem to be reliable." During an interview with Radio Mitre, Di Tella said the sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands "represents an issue that is systematically discussed" with the British. He stressed that before making any decision, the British should consider the islanders' will.
