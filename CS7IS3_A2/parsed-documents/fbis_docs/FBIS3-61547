Only `Yabloko' Is Prepared To Think About Basic Science''] [Text] Perhaps, the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) has become one of the few organizations that are not taking an active part in the election campaign. Of course, individual representatives of it are members of various parties and blocks. But here they are directing attention not at all to the interests of their colleagues. As for candidates directly from the RAS, it as a public organization does not have the right to nominate them. In principle such a situation is very convenient for the leadership of the academy, which does not tire of repeating at every opportunity that the RAS is far from politics. Nevertheless the academy simply needs to have "its own" people in the new parliament. In its present financial situation and given the uncertainty of the future of many institutes and associates it is important as never before to have a lobby in the legislative body of power, and not simply good relations with its representatives. Therefore, the traditional conservatism of the RAS and the reluctance to take part in the political struggle in this case exceed a certain bound and can be interpreted as passivity, which subsequently can adversely affect its fate. Of course, no one is making an appeal to break laws and to nominate candidates from the academy. However, the members of the Presidium, who are very tempted, cannot but know of other possibilities. An attempt was also made to use one of them. At the meeting at the Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry of the RAS Vice President Oleg Nefedov and Chief Scientific Secretary of the RAS Igor Makarov presented to the associates the candidate from the Universitetskiy District of the capital for the State Duma, Vice Premier of the Government of Moscow and Chairman of the Science Council of Moscow Aleksandr Braginskiy. The 45-year-old candidate (in recent times he has been known as a person, who was in the captivity of the supporters of Rutskoy and Khasbulatov during the events of 3-4 October) has already done much for the RAS. In many respects the adoption of the program ``Science for Moscow,'' under which the city authorities are financing projects that are of interest for them, depended on him. This program has already been in effect for several months and has yielded a profit both for scientists and for the capital. Moreover, owing to the efforts of Aleksandr Braginskiy the rent for a number of scientific institutions was fixed at the level of the operating expenses, preferential terms for the payment for electric power were introduced, several scientists received apartments, and new health care institutions were put into operation. The channeling of state budget assets not only into ``the reform of the judicial and law enforcement system and the army and the support of culture,'' but also into ``the strengthening of basic science and education'' is mentioned in Braginskiy's election program. Therefore, such a member of the State Duma is very important for the presidium of the RAS, although he will devote not all of his time to the defending of the interests of the academy. For the present it is not clear how in the future the RAS will support Aleksandr Braginskiy. However, one member of parliament, of course, is not enough for the academy. Some more global actions are needed. And what is the most amazing thing, they have been carried out, true, not by the leadership of the RAS. Candidate of Physical Mathematical Sciences Aleksey Zakharov, deputy chairman of the council of the trade union of workers of the academy, prepared proposals on the preservation of Russian basic science during the period of economic reforms, in which he evaluated the present situation and examined the problems of financing, property, legal space, and personnel. This document was sent by the author to all the election blocs. However, only the ``Yablinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin'' bloc agreed to use it. There now appear in the draft of the election program of this bloc: ``the establishment of a fixed share of the revenues of the state budget as the lower limit of the financing of science, using the mechanism of the coordination of the interests of all budget-carried sectors; the use of the selective support of scientific collectives during the competitive selection of projects and their independent examination; the adoption of a special program of the privatization of state property in the sphere of science; the introduction of the preferential taxation of the assets, which are channeled into funds for the support of science and the higher school (including from abroad).'' One question arises: Why is the chairman of the trade union, who, though he is defending the interests of scientists, does not supervise them, preparing his own proposals on how to preserve science? Why has the presidium, in whose hands are power and a large number of other opportunities, thus far not taken the same or a similar step? What is this--indifference, the loss of hope for the solution of problems at the parliamentary level or, through inertia, the desire as before to stew in one's own juice and in necessary instances to use personal contacts?
