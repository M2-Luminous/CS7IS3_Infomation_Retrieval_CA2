An advertisement seeking a general manager for a commercial center was published in January in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province -- offering a record annual salary of 150,000 yuan (about 17,240 U.S. dollars). This medium-sized business had suffered losses for 14 consecutive years of its 15-year life, with 13 managers coming and going. The position finally went to Zhuang Zongping, former deputy manager of the city's Gulou Department Store, after an open selection contest held by relevant authorities. Experts described the move as a great change from the usual practice of officials being appointed by higher authorities. Bai Meilin, director of the city's Commission for Restructuring the Economy, said that a new leadership system is important for a smooth shift to the modern enterprise system. Jiang Yu, a general manager of the Xinjiekou Department Store, said that advertising for talent with high pay is an effective way to get qualified persons for posts which they want. At his inauguration ceremony, Zhuang handed in a risk pledge of 16,000 yuan to the parent company, which won't be refunded if the center fails to produce an annual profit of 1.6 million yuan under his administration. According to the contract, he has decision-making power in areas such as employment, direction-setting, personnel assignment and resources distribution. Zhuang, aged 43, was considered daring in the city's business circles, as he had made the sales volume of the Gulou Department store jump from 30 million yuan to 250 million yuan within three years. This time, with his good business sense and his practical and bold plan, he defeated six rivals, who were selected from quite a few officials, private bosses and agents for foreign companies. His measures to invigorate the center include improving the shopping environment, restructuring commodities, distinguishing its promotions from neighboring stores and strengthening its internal management. Qian Hao, general manager of the Gulou Department Store, said the store will not be affected by Zhuang's leaving, because it has a group of experienced personnel and a healthy management system. Relevant leading officials pledged that Zhuang will be given full power to enforce his program on his new post. Now Zhuang is setting about renovating the center, which will reopen on April 8.
