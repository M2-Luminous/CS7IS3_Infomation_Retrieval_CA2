Issues of confirming the results of elections in multiseat districts were examined at the sitting. The commission's chairman Viktor Alsufyev read out a statement by the political council of the "Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea" [Soyuz v podderzhku Respubliki Krym] party, in which are given -- in the opinion of the statement's authors -- facts of violations in the course of the election campaign and the elections, in particular the call by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov on the eve of the elections to vote for the "Russia" bloc, and also the holding of a poll of Crimean citizens at the same time as the elections. In connection with the numerous violations, the political council of the Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea is demanding that the elections be recognized as invalid and that a new time-scale for holding elections be set. It has become known that practically all of the autonomy's parties of a centrist tendency supported the statement. Having examined the statement, the Central Electoral Commission decided to hand over the materials to the judicial bodies for examination because, as the resolution notes, "only the Republic of Crimea's Supreme Court can recognize the elections as invalid." The results of the elections in the multiseat district for political parties were examined. According to the election results, the Communist Party of Crimea got two seats out of the 14, the "Russia" bloc 11 seats, and the Party of Economic Revival of Crimea one seat. In the opinion of observers, supporters of Crimea's President Meshkov can reckon on 60 of the 98 seats in the Crimean Parliament. Results of the elections in the Crimean Tatar multiseat national district were also examined. In all, 76.18 percent or 102,379 electors of Crimean Tatar nationality took part in the voting. Some 90,959 votes were cast for the kurultay of the Crimean Tatar people. Thus, the kurultay got all 14 seats. Commenting on the results of the voting to a UNIAN correspondent, Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the majlis of the Crimean Tatar people, who is first on the list from the kurultay, said: "This is even more than we expected, and I am pleased that our people showed wisdom in voting for candidates from the kurultay." In a conversation with a UNIAN correspondent on the election results in the multiseat district for political parties, Volodymyr Shevyev, cochairman of the Party of Economic Revival of Crimea, who was confirmed as a deputy from the Party of Economic Revival of Crimea by the Central Electoral Commission on 31 March, noted: "The people supported the president in the elections. I think great prospects are ahead for Crimea if there is unity of judicial, legislative, and executive power." The results of the election in single-seat national districts were also examined at the sitting of the Central Electoral Commission.
