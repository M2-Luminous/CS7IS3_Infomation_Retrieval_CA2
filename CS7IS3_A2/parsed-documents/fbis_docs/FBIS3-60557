Dr Douglas Fleming, director of the College's monitoring unit, said 127 cases per 100,000 population had been reported this week, three times the normal rate. However, the Government is seeking to play down fears of an epidemic and, with the A Beijing 92 flu strain sweeping southwards from Scotland, Dr Kenneth Calman, Chief Medical Officer, said vaccine would be available for all who need it. The College's figures, based on findings at 92 ``spotter practices'' cross the country, suggest there were 65,000 new cases of flu reported this week. ``I don't like to use the word epidemic because it can frighten people,'' Dr Fleming said. ``Although we are not in as bad a situation as 1989, I would say that we have an epidemic.'' His figures show that flu reports have more than doubled in the Midlands and South in the past week and increased by more than 50 per cent in the North. The Duchess of Kent was among the flu's latest victims yesterday, cancelling a prize-giving engagement in Clerkenwell, London. In Yeovil, a 35-bed orthopaedic ward at the district hospital had to be closed this week after patients and staff were struck down by the illness. In Hampshire an infection control team was called in to the Botley Ward of Knowle hospital, where psychiatric patients were taken ill. In 1989, when the infection rate reached 580 per 100,000, more than half a million cases were recorded in a week and between 20,000 and 25,000 died. A spokesman for the Public Health Laboratory Service in Colindale, North London, said the latest version of Beijing flu, which was first identified last year, was not particularly severe, though it was classified as an ``A'' -- or more virulent -- strain. The current strain is seen as a minor variation of previous versions. The latest vaccine is also considered capable of dealing with two other types of flu: A Singapore and B Panama. General practitioners are expected to vaccinate those whose lives could be ``at risk'' from flu, though they do not receive a special payment. These include elderly people, diabetics, those with heart, kidney or lung disease and those whose immune systems are weak. The Department of Health said that there is not a shortage of vaccine. A spokesman said that 4.3 million doses were available already, only 400,000 fewer than last year. Another 460,000 doses are expected to be ready for distribution shortly, the spokesman added. Dr Calman has also recommended that vaccine should be provided for residents of nursing homes, old people's homes and other long-stay facilities where flu can spread rapidly. He said: ``It is not possible accurately to predict the impact of influenza at this time of the year, but it would be reasonable to expect rates of illness to increase over the next few weeks.'' The Department of Health is expected to buy almost five million vaccine doses over the coming weeks from three suppliers. The main symptoms of the new strain are the usual flu symptoms: fever, headache, aching limbs, coughing, sneezing and a runny nose.
