They are testimony to the immense U.S. domination of the UNSC's operating mechanisms and decisionmaking process. In an article published today, the paper adds: The U.S. moves to obstruct the passage of a resolution condemning the Zionist entity and authorizing the deployment of international observers in the occupied Arab territories to protect the Palestinians show the immense U.S. domination of the world body and the UNSC, and demonstrate the urgent need to restore balance to the UNSC-- something impossible to achieve as long as the UNSC remains hostage to U.S. wishes. BABIL goes on to say: The U.S. treatment of the UNSC is a clear message to all those who expect the "cosponsors of the conference" to find a solution to the Palestinian people's ordeal. For the judge is the very culprit, whose hands are stained with the blood of our people in both Iraq and Palestine. BABIL recalls the rapidity with which the UNSC passed its anti-Iraq resolutions in August 1990, when it passed three resolutions in a single week. Together, these resolutions contained 18 paragraphs, the implementation of which is mandatory. The paper concludes by saying: This is how the United States handled the Iraq issue and pushed the UNSC to pass a series of unfair resolutions in an unprecedented manner.
