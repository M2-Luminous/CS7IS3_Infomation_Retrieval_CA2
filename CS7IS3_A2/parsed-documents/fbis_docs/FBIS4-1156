It was organized by Tutsi Army officers. The Burundi Army chief says the coup has failed. Other reports say it is still in progress. The Army is still controlled by the minority Tutsi people in Burundi. All members of the Burundi Government have gone into hiding, probably in a Western embassy. This was confirmed to the BRTN [expansion not given] by the interim president, Ntibantunganya, last night. Meanwhile the Army has taken action against three rebellious Hutu districts in Bujumbura. These are surrounded. The Tutsi military want to disarm militias from the majority Hutu people. The minister of defense has asked all inhabitants of the Hutu district to leave to prevent innocent victims. The Belgian Embassy has asked all the Belgians in Bujumbura to stay inside. Some Hutus formed military militias in the last few days. This followed reports from the Hutu party, Frodebu, that the Army is preparing for violence against the majority Hutu people.
