Lillevyali] The State Duma is in its own way a microcosm of our society and we went there today to put a question to some of the elected representatives: How do you feel about the president's edict on new means for fighting crime? [Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of Communist Party of Russia] "I take a dual position here. On the one hand, I would support any measures aimed at stopping gangsterism. But on the other hand, they must be within the law." [Yekaterina Lakhova, leader of Women of Russia faction] "The president's edict cannot exceed the Constitution and cannot exceed federal law. All those who drafted the edict, and I understand that it was the president who drafted the edict, the people who drafted the edict, drafted a completely unconstitutional edict. I am very concerned by some of the individual formulations -- the legislative committee discussed them yesterday -- that tally directly with 1937 formulations." [Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] "They should have added our program. An emergency should be introduced in certain regions of the country. In certain cases, we should resort to the court martial system and throw the Armed Forces into the fight against crime. The militia cannot cope. It needs to be given the right to hold additional weapons. The right of the citizen to bear arms should be defended. That is the only way. It would be temporary. The country's leadership introduced such an edict in 1947. It was very effective." [Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of Yabloko faction] "Introducing the atmosphere of a free-for-all and giving some people the chance to break all sorts of laws in order to tackle other criminals will not in any way solve things." [Lillevyali] We would like to finish with the point of view of a professional lawyer -- the chairman of the State Duma Security Committee, Viktor Ilyukhin. [Ilyukhin] "It is first unconstitutional and contradicts the Constitution. Second, it torpedoes the complete judicial system now in existence. As a lawyer, I have every reason to question the ability of judicial bodies, which have always been guided only by the Constitution and only by the law, to implement it. What will the reaction of the court be when a sentence is passed on the basis of the edict and not the law?"
