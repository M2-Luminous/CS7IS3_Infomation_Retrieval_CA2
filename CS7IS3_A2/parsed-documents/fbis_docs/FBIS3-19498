In an address to the Institute for European Studies, he said it was too early for the European Union to take countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania, and Bulgaria into the Union. But Van den Broek urged the European Union to set a date -- "1997 seems reasonable" -- for reviewing the applicants' progress towards membership. In the meantime, he said, the European Union should help prepare them for membership with carefully targeted economic aid and faster lowering of trade barriers against their exports. The European Union has already negotiated European agreements with the six countries which aim at a single market and state membership of the Union as an ultimate goal. But they give no dates. The Union is negotiating similar accords with Slovenia and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The European Union last year set several conditions for membership, including a market economy, stability, democracy, respect for human rights, acceptance of the Union's rules and the ability of Brussels to absorb the newcomers. Earlier this month the European Union also announced a programme for closer political cooperation with the six applicants. Van den Broek urged the European Union to go further by setting up a "multilateral political and economic relationship which would be a true precursor of membership." But he warned that any attempt to add new membership conditions would be unpopular in East Europe. His speech coincides with increased pressure from the region for incorporation into the European Union. Hungary and Poland have said they will apply formally for membership very shortly. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said last week that he wanted his country in the European Union well before the turn of the century. Looking further east, Van den Broek urged urgent aid to stabilise the Ukrainian economy. He added that Russia was not being left out of the developing web of European economic and political cooperation. The European Union's executive European Commission is to hold a special meeting next Wednesday to consider all aspects of the enlargement of the Union into East Europe.
