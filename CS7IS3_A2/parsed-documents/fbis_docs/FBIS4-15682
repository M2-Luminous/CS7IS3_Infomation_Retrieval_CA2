Granatskis told Ulmanis that the recent directives that demand strict coordination of all Home Guard actions with state institutions make quick actions impossible. Commenting on financial issues, Ulmanis said that he and Staff Cmdr. Juris Eihmanis would decide on the distribution of state budget funding for the needs of the Home Guard. Home Guards should be allowed to perform private guarding orders in addition to their direct service duties, said Granatskis. Ulmanis said he planned to tour all Latvian Home Guard battalions soon to acquaint himself with the work and problems of Home Guards.
