Neither his or [Minister of the Interior] Vano Siradeghyan's press conference was unexpected. This is the logical continuation of domestic politics, that is everything that has been done in the country in the last few years. When Levon Ter Petrosyan became president, a triumvirate--which stood out even within the Karabakh Committee--came to power. The triumvirate is: Levon Ter Petrosyan, [speaker of the parliament] Babgen Ararktsyan and Vano Siradeghyan. It appeared that all the conditions existed to unite the people and to implement a state and national policy, but that did not happen. On the contrary, everything was done to divide the people and to prevent the presence of any independent individuals or forces in the country. Meanwhile a wave of gossips spread, and mutual accusations, justified or not, began to be leveled. Had that triumvirate chosen to pursue national goals, it would have taken a different posture. But apparently its main goal became to retain power at any cost. Generally, when a group wants to retain power without an ideology it tries to mislead the people to prevent it from uniting and usually relies on armed force to do that. In order to accomplish that it is necessary to give an incentive to the armed force so that it becomes dependent on and associated with the government. To that end the armed force is generally given the right to "plunder" (are the quotation marks necessary?) the people. In such circumstances, any change of government not only means material losses for such a force but also becomes a question of life and death, because it has allowed itself that which will never be forgiven. In Armenia, the police became that force. From this standpoint, I sometimes think that another nation has come and conquered our state and our people. Sometimes I think that I am living in the days of Mongol rule. Thus what is happening in the country today can be explained from this standpoint. Siradeghyan's press conference was one of the steps of that policy. Perhaps it was not a very successful step, perhaps it could have been taken more subtly as was done in the past, but nevertheless the step has been taken. Ironically, I see a positive point in all this. This may become the last straw which may help or force the public to see or to take an interest in what is happening in the government's kitchen, to open up that kitchen and to lead to a certain amount of housecleaning. This must not be done in the streets and at the level of gossiping. It would be appropriate to create a multiparty commission of the Supreme Council that includes representatives from public organizations and worker unions from enterprises. [passage omitted] [HAYLUR] It has been said that this confrontation between the two branches of government is so dangerous that it may lead to civil war. What do you think? [Manukyan] First, I do not see a confrontation between two branches of government, because even in the "good days" Ashot Manucharyan was part of the second level of government even though he had many levers of power in his hand as part of his responsibilities. I repeat, it is the triumvirate that is the government. Manucharyan is an individual who stood with the government, and now he is outside it. As for the prospect of a civil war, I do not see any such danger. We, the Armenian nation, are different from our neighbors. [HAYLUR] Then, in your opinion, what course may these events take? [Manukyan] It is hard to say. In any event, if the commission I proposed is created and these issues are examined in a normal manner, many things will surface. We will learn the kind of government we have and what type of government we want to have. Also, the people will be able to participate in politics to some extent. In the last few years, Armenia did not have real political rivalry. Rather there was a practice of gossiping and mutual attacks. From that standpoint, we may come out of all this cleaner and ensure that political rivalry is waged not through gossips or by misleading the people but through extensive debates over serious political and economic issues. [HAYLUR] Vano Siradeghyan said during his press conference that there were no disagreements between you and Levon Ter Petrosyan. He said that it was the "komsomol" wing of the Karabakh Committee, led by Ashot Manucharyan, that worked to create such disagreements. [Manukyan] Of course we had disagreements, and it is ridiculous to think that it was Ashot Manucharyan who created them. We did have several disagreements but that is the subject of a separate discussion. It is not proper to mix everything together. Let me say that from the time of the Karabakh Committee and after we became a government I engaged in debates with Ashot Manucharyan continually. He and I argued more than anyone else in the National Security Council. However, those were all debates of a political nature. [HAYLUR] You have accused the government of pursuing an antinational policy. You said that the said triumvirate stood out even in the Karabakh Committee, that is, even in the Armenian Pannational Movement [APM]. You were also a member of that Committee. Then you became prime minister and later defense minister and controlled certain levers of power. What did you do to prevent the said triumvirate from pursuing an antinational policy? [Manukyan] At the beginning they probably got together out of friendship. During the time I was prime minister, they became a political force which gained control of a powerful political machine, the APM. I must say that they had to mislead certain members of the APM to achieve that. Not all of APM was aware of that ploy. The office of prime minister was quite burdensome, especially since we were not prepared to become a government. Of course there was a general program of independence, democratization and privatization, but, except for these approaches that specified general directions, there were no detailed programs. Also we had a serious problem of cadres. We had to cope with Armenia's economy in those conditions. That took all of my time, leaving me no opportunity to focus on the internal politics of the APM. National Policy [HAYLUR] How would you define or describe what you call "national policy"? How do you see the resolution of the Karabakh problem? [Manukyan] For many, the word "national" has a mystical meaning and appears to be a complex phenomenon. In reality, national policy is a very simple concept. For example, the conclusion of the Karabakh war is closely tied with the fate of our people. I think that if we lose Karabakh we lose, as a nation, something much bigger and more important than a few thousand square kilometers of land. Of course it is Karabakh that is at war, but what type of Armenia stands beside it has a very big significance. This war should have been transformed into a pannational war. Indeed, it was like that. You recall how the entire nation wanted to help and contribute to that liberation struggle. But everything was done to ensure that the people stand aside. This is not how one runs a national liberation struggle. Transforming that struggle into a pannational struggle is a truly national objective. Novice government officials think that they can solve this or that problem only by state means and that there is no need to incorporate the people in policymaking. [passage omitted] When the president of the republic tells the people that this situation will last for many decades, he is once again pursuing an antinational policy. In addition, I do not agree with what he says. Also, I do not know any leader of any country who allows himself to say something so cynical to his people--especially when that does not correspond to the truth and when the only purpose of saying such a thing is to justify and to consolidate his own rule. [HAYLUR] During his press conference Ashot Manucharyan urged the creation of a government of conciliation and described it as a coalition of parties, organizations and individuals around a prime minister. What do you think about this issue? [Manukyan] I do not find the present structure of government, in which the president appoints the prime minister and all the ministers, very meaningful. During the time Khosrov Harutyunyan was prime minister, we had an absurd situation: the prime minister did not agree with the government program. When this issue was being discussed in the National Security Council, my position was that such contradictions may arise again if the government is not formed by the prime minister, does not consist of a group of people who agree on a common policy and is made up of people who are appointed by the president even though they have different economic and political views. I proposed to the president that, in the future, he submit his candidate for prime minister to the Supreme Council for its approval. In that event the Supreme Council would be more participatory and more responsible. Then let the prime minister appoint the ministers. I stated that the president has ample powers even without that authority, and that this concession would only help his work. But the president did not agree. This is the first point. About the issue of a coalition government: the president of the republic is always formally correct on these issues. For example, in a recent Supreme Council session he said that if 123 deputies vote for a bill, it means nothing for him, but if 124 vote for it then it is a law. From a standpoint of fairness this is wrong. The leader of a state that is not fully established must be much more careful in expressing such opinions (how many voters are there behind 123 deputies?). In other words, this issue cannot be treated like chess with its indisputable and immutable rules. In France, which has a government structure somewhat similar to ours, various mechanisms as well as financial, economic and political bodies have been created over many years. If the game is played by those rules then it is meaningful. In our conditions, when everything is being created from scratch, a group of individuals who have risen to power can exploit the situation in the absence of other mechanisms and keep the power in their hands for decades to come. But if that group has a national mentality it must help the creation of those mechanisms. The president of the republic must see even the development of opposition parties as one of his own objectives. That is how high the president of a newly created state must stand, instead of doing everything he can to block and break the development of mechanisms opposing him. [HAYLUR] Let us generalize and summarize. [Manukyan] I am most distressed by the fact that our nation appears to have lost its self-confidence and its faith in its own strength. People are leaving this country; they do not believe in the future of this state. I think that we can come out of this situation. We do not need decades for that; we can do it in a very short time. It is possible to achieve peace without giving away Karabakh and to develop the economy. [passage omitted] [HAYLUR] To do that it is necessary to have a government that pursues national objectives. Do you think that the present government is capable of doing that? If not, what is your assessment of the idea of a coalition government which has been proposed by the opposition? [Manukyan] I think that this government cannot realize those goals, because the people no longer trust it. We already discussed the term "national": it means thinking about the people and the state, uniting the Diaspora and the entire Armenian nation. As for the idea of a coalition government, formally it is possible to bring together those parties in the Supreme Council whose votes add up to just over half of the total and thus to form a government. But in our conditions we cannot pursue that path. It would be more natural if the leadership brought together representatives of different parties in the government, regardless of the number of votes they have in the parliament, so that everyone becomes responsible for what is done. I think that the time has come to elect a new parliament. We are slowly moving toward the practices that determine the internal life of a state. In these conditions government leaders are required to engage in nonstandard thinking. The people in the most senior positions today did not rise to those offices with such practices. It would be very dangerous if their posture encourages the formation of a movement that attempts to change the government by the same methods [that they they used]. [passage omitted]
