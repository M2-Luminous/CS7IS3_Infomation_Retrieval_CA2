In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that public accord is achievable on the basis of the memorandum. He expressed bewilderment over the attempts by some politicians to set up a new political bloc, "Accord for Russia." The participation of Constitutional Court member Valeriy Zorkin in this bloc revives the dispute about his inappropriate political activity which has already cost him his post of Constitutional Court chairman. "There cannot be two consensuses. There can be only one consensus," Filatov said. Additionally, the idea proposed by Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, Zorkin, former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy and others looks "militant." "One has to dislike his nation particularly strong in order to whip up fear in society," he added. President Boris Yeltsin's senior adviser Georgiy Satarov said that a joint team of experts will hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the memorandum. On Thursday, the text of the document will be handed over to Yeltsin who is expected to return from vacation by the end of the week. "The achievement of civic accord is not a one- time process," he said. It is open to all who want to join it, Satarov said.
