Panfilov: "Russians Have Nowhere to Go nor Money to Do It. They May Become Hostages of Diplomacy"] [Text] A high-ranking diplomat of the Russian Embassy in Dushanbe indicated to an Interfax correspondent that the flow of the Russian-speaking population out of Tajikistan decreased sharply. He believed however, that this is connected not with stabilization of the situation in the republic, but with the fact that Russians remaining in Tajikistan have "nowhere and no one to go to nor money to do it," primarily because the bulk of the population lacks money for the most essential products, to say nothing of renting a railway container. At present it is also difficult to sell an apartment inasmuch as those wishing to acquire housing have done so long ago or occupied vacant apartments which cannot be denied even by the authorities. Robbery is so common that, as the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told, people may be robbed in broad daylight in Dushanbe having their shoes or a suit someone liked taken. As underscored by the Russian diplomat in his interview with Interfax, around 368,000 Russian-speaking citizens left Tajikistan over a four-year period. According to the census there were 495,000 Russian speakers living in the republic in 1989, of whom 288,600 were ethnic Russians. Thus around 100,000 Russian speakers now remain in Tajikistan 80 percent of whom reside in the Leninabad Oblast, in the north of the republic, where combat operations have never taken place. Almost no Russians at all remain in the south of Tajikistan, for instance in the Khatlon Oblast, except for those in mixed marriages. According to the diplomat practically all of the Russian-speaking population of Tajikistan would like to leave for permanent residence in Russia, but lack of money "is an insurmountable obstacle." The revelations of the Russian diplomat differ sharply from what was just recently announced by Andrey Kozyrev, the Russian Federation Minister of Foreign Affairs and General Colonel Boris Pyankov, former commander of CIS Commonwealth Peacemaking Forces in Tajikistan. In explaining Russian military presence they constantly recalled that they are performing a noble mission in protecting the Russian-speaking people against oppression by "Islamic fundamentalists." Tajikistan officials usually exaggerate figures in listing Russian-speaking citizens thereby gaining the support of both diplomats and the military. But the admission made by the Russian Embassy representative may evoke sympathy even among observers since, if the diplomat is to be believed, only around 20,000 Russian speakers, who are prepared to leave given the opportunity, remain in the main part of Tajikistan (beside the northern Leninabad Oblast isolated by two mountain ranges). This evidently explains the apparent slowness of Tajik authorities in adopting the law on dual citizenship and granting Russian the status of a second state language, which was promised by Emomili Rakhmanov back in the spring of 1993, when the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual aid between Tajikistan and Russia was being prepared for signing. It is true, even then it was clear that the new regime would be unable to retain the Russian-speaking population, inasmuch as instead of stability there came crime--robberies, brigandage, murders. The Russian Embassy did not complain when Russian citizens--journalists or businessmen, were assaulted. It appears that the Embassy never did lodge a strong protest concerning the murder of a Christian Baptist family and a deacon of the Nikolsk Orthodox Church--at least it was never reported by any of the news agencies represented in Tajikistan. The Embassy remains silent as militant people's front members rape Russian girls (on 8 December of last year, for instance, two female friends were raped and murdered in the basement of House No. 36 on the 6th Driveway on Gafurov Street in Dushanbe). If the revelations of the diplomat were disseminated on purpose then could Russian diplomacy change its attitude to events in Tajikistan at all? Extending political and military support to the Dushanbe regime the Russian government most probably intended preserving the even then considerably thinned out Russian-speaking colony. The Russian community, which has externally preserved a position of neutrality for a long time, is suddenly becoming active, at first declaring that military presence of the Russian army must be continued as long as possible and two months ago demanding a quota of Russians in the Tajik parliament. The first demand is also quite explainable by the fact that architect Valeriy Yushin, chairman of the Russian community, is a member of the Russian National Council, whereas the second one diverges somewhat from what was said by Emomili Rakhmanov concerning the status of the Russian language and dual citizenship. Can a citizen of Russia and Tajikistan simultaneously be a member of the Legislative Assembly of Tajikistan. The language parity is preserved somewhat by the fact that three Russian-language republic and one oblast (Leninabad Oblast) newspapers are still published in Tajikistan even though with a limited circulation. The amount of television and radio programming in the Russian language has not increased. At the same time, as strange as that may appear, the opposition "Voice of Free Tajikistan" is broadcasting in Russian and Uzbek (and, of course, in Tajik) from the territory of Afghanistan. The shortage of Russian teachers in secondary schools and instructors in the higher educational establishments is already being felt in Leninabad Oblast as well. The failure of Russian policy aimed at preserving Russian-speaking colonies in former Soviet republics is quite evident. It is likewise clear that resolution of internal civil strife by military means is not a panacea for the political impotence of diplomacy. In several months when the number of Russian-speaking citizens of Tajikistan decreases further, the presence of Russian troops waging a struggle against "Islamic fundamentalism," may acquire a different coloration.
