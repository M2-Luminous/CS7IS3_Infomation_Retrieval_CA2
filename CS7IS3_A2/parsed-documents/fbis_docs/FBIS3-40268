Monkey Wrench in the Works of Slovak Foreign Policy"] [Text] There are areas, in any at least somewhat organized state, where party interests or other particular interests should not come to the fore. Foreign policy is definitely one of these areas. Unfortunately, irrespective of foreign policy considerations and Slovakia's interests, the exact opposite is the case. With haughty baseness, we are using even the diplomatic field to settle domestic accounts and fighting for who should play the first fiddle on it. Is it a miracle that, when one diplomatic faux pas follows the next, foreign partners are turning away from us? We can afford things that would be unimaginable in other countries -- to disparately interpret at the highest level the problem of the dismantling of [bilingual] road signs; to arrive late, without any reason, for a visit to a neighboring country; not to see off the head of state, out of sheer spite, when he departs for an official visit to Germany, as would be appropriate; or to vie for who will play the first fiddle at the meeting of representatives of the Visegrad Four countries with President Clinton. We can afford to first make threatening gestures at Radio Free Europe and, thereby, indirectly also at the U.S. Congress, in a display of world power manners, only to quietly put the tail between the legs later on and reverse the original decision, as if suffering a fit of asphyxia from smoking too strong a tobacco. We are unable to send out on time, by 15 January, our official response to the recommendation of European Union experts on how to divide the Danube water at Gabcikovo [between Slovakia and Hungary] or to complete, prior to President Michal Kovac's visit to Poland, agreements that are practically ready to be signed. We can even afford the luxury of [Economy] Minister Ducky's absence in the delegation accompanying the president and of putting the host country out of countenance in this way. And all that is aired to journalists, and at home in parliament, still during the official visit, all "in the interest" of improving Slovakia's positive image abroad. An ordinary citizen who, for all the flowery diplomatic rhetoric, does not have the chance to hear the monkey wrench in the works of Slovak foreign policy, does not understand these blunders and acts of defiance of the highest constitutional officials. He cannot concede to himself the possibility of personal or political feuds being carried from the home kitchen to the hosts' living rooms and public lounges. After all, we all learn to try to leave in them a good, and not a bewildered, impression, let alone arouse some piquant scandal there. We will have to learn to carefully distinguish where is the source, and who is the originator, of these elephants' moves in the diplomatic china shop. We will either have to accept the prime minister's claim about the government's accommodating approach toward the preparation of the president's trip to Poland, or the diplomatic tact of the president, who, when questioned in Warsaw by inquisitive journalists about Minister Ducky's absence, noted that the motives were not of a political but of a technical nature. Since even the decision to terminate Radio Free Europe broadcasts on medium waves was presented as a technical problem, it is obvious even to a layman that this was not the case. In the background is the struggle, which is becoming increasingly difficult to camouflage, for the unrivaled dominance of Slovak politics and, hence, also the steadily growing strains in relations between the government and the Castle [seat of the president]. A tough struggle between the prime minister and the president for primacy was waged even over the composition of the delegation for [the Visegrad leaders' summit with Bill Clinton in] Prague. A thorn in Vladimir Meciar's side was Pavol Demes [former minister of foreign affairs and President Kovac's current foreign policy adviser], whom the prime minister refused to include in the 12-member delegation and who, as Vladimir Meciar suggested, should go and have a nice beer during the talks with President Clinton. On the other hand, since the U.S. side and the representatives of the Visegrad Four states came to the talks with their ministers of defense, Imrich Andrejcak's absence would have been embarrassing, also in view of the discussion of NATO's Partnership for Peace offer. The tug-of-war over whether the president or the prime minister was the real number one or number two during these negotiations of the year has, unfortunately, resulted in the fact that they did not consider it necessary to brief one another about the contents of their talks. If, in the final analysis, Jozef Moravcik, the chief of our diplomacy, will have to foot the bill for this, it will be clear to everyone who is Muhammad and who is the mountain.
