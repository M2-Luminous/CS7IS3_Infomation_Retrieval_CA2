Applicability and Principle 1.1␣Applicability. This method is applicable for determining the vapor pressure of waste samples which represent waste which is or will be managed in tanks. 1.2␣Principle. The headspace vapor of the sample is analyzed for carbon content by a headspace analyzer, which uses an FID. 2. Interferences 2.1␣The analyst shall select the operating parameters best suited to the requirements for a particular analysis. The analyst shall produce confirming data through an adequate supplemental analytical technique and have the data available for review by the Administrator. 3. Apparatus 3.1␣Sampling.
