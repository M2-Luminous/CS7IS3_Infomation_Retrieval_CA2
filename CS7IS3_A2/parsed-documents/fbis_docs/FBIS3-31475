In the coming period, Hungary's main tasks are to preserve the changes in foreign policy orientation that have taken place in the past years and, within this, to reintegrate into Europe, according to parliamentary deputy Jozsef Szajer, chairman of the National Committee and the Foreign Affairs Cabinet of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. Szajer presented his party's foreign policy program as part of a series of lectures organized by the Foreign Affairs Association. At the first forum held in the conference room of the Political and Legal Sciences Faculty of the Lorand Eotvos University of Sciences, parliamentary deputy Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, member of the Management Body of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the party's foreign affairs spokesman was the other lecturer. Szajer explained that the Fidesz's foreign policy concept rests on three inseparable principles, namely joining the European Union [EU], establishing regional security, and satisfying national minority policy. Out of these, preference has to be given to the process of European integration, and Hungary's domestic stability and solid constitutional system are the main preconditions for this. As a second condition, the Fidesz attributes special importance to establishing lasting conflict-free relations with the neighboring countries. In the Fidesz's view, preparing the country for EU membership is the task of the country's future leadership. The preparation includes, among other things, grass-roots development that will result in organizational compatibility, new economic legislation, and legal harmonization. Szajer pointed out that the supervision of European affairs must be in one hand in Hungary; therefore, the Foreign Ministry should take over the leading role within a moderately decentralized structure. A realistic time for joining the EU must be set out and the program must be designed accordingly. Talking about the other two pillars of the Fidesz's foreign policy concept, namely the national minority and regional policy, Szajer said: It is vitally important to form a delicate balance between the legal protection of Hungarians living beyond the borders and establishing good-neighborly relations. He emphasized the importance of legitimate national minority organizations -- the authentic representatives of the given areas -- and maintaining relations with them. On the issue of the borders, the Fidesz is firmly convinced that changing the borders cannot be a solution to any problems. The essence of the party's regional policy is that it firmly supports all cooperation in the Central Eastern European area, including joint action by the Visegrad countries in the interest of integration into Europe. Szajer's report was preceded by Szent-Ivanyi's summary. Szent-Ivanyi again expounded that the SZDSZ had drawn up a strategic program that has realistic and achievable foreign policy goals.
