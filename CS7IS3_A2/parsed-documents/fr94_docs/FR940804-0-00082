FR940804-0-00082 FR940804-0-00022 (4)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applies, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 18 months but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if EPA's proposed or final action finding the deficiency has not been corrected occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan, and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected. (5) Any sanction clock started by a finding under paragraph (c) of this section will be permanently stopped and sanctions applied, stayed or deferred will be permanently lifted upon a final EPA finding that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. For a sanctions clock and applied sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur by letter from the Administrator to the State governor. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the Federal Register fully approving the revised SIP. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the Federal Register finding that the State is implementing the approved SIP.
