At the suggestion of Deputy Viktor Pokhmelkin from the "Russia's Choice" faction the chamber decided to analyze the head of state's document at a plenary session, having studied the edict beforehand in the relevant parliamentary committees. In Viktor Pokhmelkin's opinion the edict contains violations of a number of legal norms. During the discussion of the motion as to whether the question of the president's edict should be put on the agenda, State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin stated that this document "must be accompanied by the relevant changes and additions to the criminal and criminal procedure codes" and by a relevant State Duma decree. At the same session the deputies voted to hold a meeting of parliamentarians of Russia, Ukraine, and Belorussia [Belarus] on the question of the Belovezhskaya agreement and its results. The motion on this subject was submitted by Deputy Oleg Mironov in the form of a decree supplementing the agenda. A decision was also made to invite Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to the Duma on Friday to explain Russia's actions in fulfilling its peacekeeping mission in Georgia and Abkhazia and also Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to explain the situation surrounding North Korea.
