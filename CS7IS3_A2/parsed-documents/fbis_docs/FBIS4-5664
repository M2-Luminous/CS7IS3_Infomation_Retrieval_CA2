Social Democratic Party (SDP) Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference that the coalition executives will seek approval of their accord from their party leaders and resume negotiations on Wednesday afternoon. Kubo, the No. 2 man in the largest coalition contingent, also revealed that the executives agreed the coalition party leaders have the final word on the choice of a successor to exiting Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the lineup of a new cabinet. The eight-month-old coalition, an alliance of seven parties spanning a wide political spectrum, moved to avert split on Tuesday after days of wrangling over procedures to select a successor to Hosokawa, who announced Friday he was resigning. The governing parties on late Tuesday moved toward maintaining their unity and staying in power together. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata has emerged as the favorite for the premiership, political sources said. "Mr. Hata is the most likely candidate as new premier," Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, who is also the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters Wednesday morning. The coalition may also agree to nominate kubo of the SDP as new chief cabinet secretary, who serves as the top government spokesman and chief of staff for the premier, the sources said. Both houses of the Diet are expected to vote on a new premier early next week after Hata returns home from an international trade meeting in Morocco, they said. Hata, who heads Shinseito, a major component in the coalition, left Tokyo on Wednesday and will return home on Sunday. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the head of new party Sakigake, however, said Wednesday the coalition leaders must first discuss the shape of a new coalition government before talking about the choice of a new premier. Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has given up the idea of defecting from the main opposition party and running for the premiership, according to LDP sources. Watanabe, who has signaled his readiness for such a move, failed to muster a sufficient number of followers from among LDP members, the sources said. He is scheduled to meet LDP President Yohei Kono later Wednesday to compare notes on the selection of an LDP candidate for the premiership, they said.
