Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), also said in Washington that it was wrong to begin the talks that collapsed Friday [11 February] while leaving the definition of "numerical targets" vague. The U.S. had sought such targets as a way of gauging progress in import penetration into the Japanese market. Hiraiwa was speaking at a reception for Japanese and U.S. business leaders held in preparation for a conference between them slated for this summer in Tokyo. Some 30 business leaders from the two countries attended the reception, with the Japanese side led by Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan-U.S. Economic Council, and the U.S. side by Joseph Gorman, chairman of the U.S.-Japan Economic Council. Kobayashi is chairman of Fuji Xerox Co. and Gorman of the Ohio-based high- technology firm TRW Inc. The councils are to hold a joint meeting starting Monday to discuss political and economic issues, including the chronic trade imbalance between the two countries. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is scheduled to give a speech at the meeting.
