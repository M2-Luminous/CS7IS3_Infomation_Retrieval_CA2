Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today described the meeting as a sure success, stressed that Vance understands the Greek positions, and announced that the talks between Papoulias and Vance will resume. It is not ruled out that Vance's associates will meet Greek Government officials. The government spokesman also announced that a Skopjean delegation has been called by the European Union [EU] Commission and the European Parliament to participate in a pan-European transport conference in Crete on 14-15 March organized by the EU Commission and the European Parliament with the participation of the responsible Greek ministers who also preside over the respective EU councils. The Skopean delegation will be headed by the Assembly President Stojan Andov. The government spokesman noted that the Skopean delegation will participate in the conference under the conditions that recall the practical signs [of goodwill] that Greece demands from Skopje. Venizelos clarified that the Skopjean delegation will come to Greece with a visa on a plain piece of blank paper with no Star of Veryina in sight and with the use of the term FYROM. Venizelos added that no issue outside the conference framework will be raised and said it would not be proper for Andov to hold a news conference on Greek territory on issues concerning Greek-Skopje relations. Referring to yesterday's meeting in Geneva, the government spokesman also said that Vance submitted ideas that Greece will study and reply to with relevant comments within 15 days. Asked if Vance's ideas include the proposal for the name, Venizelos said these ideas refer to all the topics. He added that Greece remains firm in its positions on the need to formulate the preliminary conditions for resuming the dialogue. Referring to the resolution adopted by the European Parliament, Venizelos expressed the Greek Government's satisfaction and noted that, given the climate at the European Parliament, the resolution was the best possible. He also stressed the contribution of PASOK's [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] deputies who participate in the European Socialist Party, the draft from which formed the basis for the resolution.
