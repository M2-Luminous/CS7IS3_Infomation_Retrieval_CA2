According to ROK and U.S. sources, the ROK Government, via a diplomatic channel, has officially asked the United States to approve of the ROK's sale of military equipment to other countries, However, the United States has showed no reaction so far. Under the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] on the defense industry signed between the two governments, in principle, the ROK has to have U.S. approval in order to sell military equipment manufactured with U.S. technology to a third country. Pointing out that the details of the MOU were eased in 1982 and 1989 to pave the way for the ROK to more readily export military equipment, the sources said that the recent official request was based on this adjustment. The U.S. Government was originally scheduled to respond to the ROK Government's request on sales in some 15 fields, including artillery of various types and armored personnel carriers, to Southeast Asia and Latin America by last February, but has yet failed to respond, added the sources.
