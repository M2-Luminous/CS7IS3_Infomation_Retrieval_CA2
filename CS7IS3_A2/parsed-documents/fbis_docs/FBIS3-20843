Surrounded by war, with a large portion of the labor force at the front, with sanctions, hyperinflation, and -- in the last two months, with no payments being made, a majority of the firms in Srpska republic (formerly Bosanksa Krajina) have been brought to a point where they are producing only just the amount of goods necessary to cover the payroll and maintain equipment, since by working more than that they are only producing losses. Nevertheless, under these conditions, when all production has not been put on a war footing, and when a state of war has not been officially declared, the people of Srpska republic, like the Serbs in the West, accustomed as they are to troubles and various shocks, are not inert. On the contrary, businessmen are displaying awesome energy and resourcefulness. Raw materials are being procured in almost all parts of the world. The extent of their success in trade with the world is indicated by how well stores and open-air markets are stocked here, not just by the assortment of products in the economy. Food Industry the Leader You can find everything in the stores here, from kiwis, bananas, oranges, and cherries to Italian furniture and Japanese television sets in all makes and sizes. Twice the output heretofore is expected in the first half of the year, when payments with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia resume. This was explained by Sveto Mudrenovic, president of the chamber of commerce. "Our own hyperinflation and the explosion of inflation in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and the absence of payments for the last two months have been an obstacle to survival of the economy here. We expect that the resumption of payments with the FRY and the restraint of inflation will increase production by at least half of what it is at present and then an even larger growth," Mudrenovic says, explaining that the economy has survived in spite of the wartime conditions. "So far the food processing industry has recorded the greatest success under these wartime conditions, since in this area it has sufficient raw materials coming in, and there is also a large market here. The largest processor here is the Banja Luka Dairy, which has an output of between 30,000 and 35,000 liters of milk per day, in addition to well-known processed products like the famous Trappist cheese and other products. Then come Vitaminka, which also is utilizing capacity at slightly more than thirty percent, and Fruktona," Mudrenovic said. Businessmen there do not want to talk in detail about all the places their exports are going to, ranging from Greece to England. Although a surplus of livestock has been recorded at the moment in Srpska republic, and prices are falling, the food manufacturing industry, represented by Levita in Gradiska, does not mind at all processing the famous purebred meat hog from Nova Topola, the "Topola Landrace," which is raised on the farm there. Exports in Spite of the Sanctions The red-streaked bacon from Levita and other products meet world standards. Rich Lijevce, with its exemplary farmers, is feeding an entire region, about 60 percent of the Srpska republic, which is the size of Krajina territory. As a matter of fact, in now the fourth year of war on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, the main support for survival in these parts has been food production from Lijevce. Although capacity has been cut back, the economy gets by in various ways; the textile industry, for example, has been operating rather successfully. The firm 22. decembar has been maintaining 100 percent of its output, since it is making uniforms, but also other things in demand on the market. Blik of Banja Luka, Svila of Celinak and Medjugorje of Glamoc, which makes sweaters and T-shirts, are adjusting well. The leather industry is operating at one-third capacity, exporting even to Switzerland, and the wood manufacturers are supplying their customers in Europe. Thus the forest products firm Kljuc is unable to make Cherry dining room sets for the domestic market, since they are exported to England, with difficulty at the moment it is true, but the demand for this dining room furniture is still keen, although its price ranges between 3,000 and 5,000 German marks. This is well-designed furniture made from the highest-quality wood, taken from Srpska republic forests. The forest products firm Sapa in Sanksi Most, Borja in Teslic and Radnik in Gradiska also have quality products, and there is an extremely high demand for products of the furniture factory in Gornji Podgradci, which is on the slopes of Kozara, not far from Gradiska. "Next year we celebrate the 140th anniversary of woodworking and furniture manufacturing in this region," says Lazo Sinik, director of the woodworking factory in Gornji Podgradci. "The first water-driven sawmill in these parts was set up back in 1855, and soon there was one driven by steam. We are woodworkers and furniture makers with a long tradition." Payments to the Rescue In Gornji Podgradci they make solid wood furniture and dining room sets (tables and chairs in various shapes and designs), mainly from oak [Q. sessiliflora] from the slopes of Kozara and some English oak from the plains, as well as beech from the slopes of Kozara and Grmec, whose quality ranks very high in Europe. "While the war was going on, we won the Gold Plane, which is the first prize at the International Furniture and Equipment Fair in Leskovac, in May of last year for the Petronija solid oak set of table and chairs," Sipik said, explaining why there is such a demand for the products from Gornji Podgradci. This factory also makes oak parquet flooring and saws lumber for the market. Within proximity of the Kozara forests and the Slavonian plains, it makes furniture of interest to customers abroad, where now it is difficult to export because of the sanctions. Incel of Banja Luka, according to Milorad Serval, marketing director, is at present making toilet paper and other products and selling them from Benkovac to Vrsac and Leskovac, but only as much as is ordered, they are not operating at full capacity, since they lack imported sulfur and other ingredients, as well as domestic pulp wood. Serval says that hyperinflation and the suspension of payments have cut production to the minimum, but a shortage of the new dinars was felt on the very first day payments were resumed with the FRY. There are not many Avrams, and merchants here are raising prices of their products, as though their intention is to have marks "circulate" from hand to hand in gray payments, in order to purchase goods abroad for foreign exchange, while the dinar is being held back for use to meet minimum needs and obligations. The situation here is the reverse of that in Serbia, where prices dropped when the Avram appeared, while in Srpska republic they have risen. "The main thing is that payments are possible. This is salvation for business people here," says Vukasin Basic, director of Veleprehrana in Banja Luka. "Now our economy also has a chance to do business normally." One other piece of good news is coming in from the Srpska republic economy. On Saturday Elektrobosna in Jajce went into operation; it makes ferrosilicon, a strategic material used in the raw state in Smederevo and Niksic, that is, in the steel mills there, to make special steel alloys. Incidentally, before the war silicon processed from ferrosilicon was imported at $55 per kilogram, while a kilogram of ferrosilicon was being exported for a dollar. One gets the impression that wartime conditions have altogether 'purged' the Srpska republic economy of its inert bureaucracy, that the situation has now brought new people into the economy who are nimble and persistent, who do not have the feeling that "some things just cannot be done," people who know what they want and, most importantly, who can make on-the-spot decisions. This kind of economy, one gets the impression, will be very important and successful on the territory of the former Yugoslavia when the war is over and the sanctions are removed.
