He did not even refer to the main issue (the price of cotton) that made peasants decide to march today. Wasmosy made several promises when he said his government is already "promoting solutions to the unjust structure of land possession and ownership as shown by the latest agricultural census: the drop in production of basic agricultural products, distorted credit coverage, and the limitations of technical assistance." He labeled as an achievement the implementation of economic measures aimed at ensuring producers access to appropriate and fair credits, and to technical assistance adjusted to our needs. In relation to the promises made, he said: "The executive branch proposes a policy of expropriation of unproductive land; therefore, it will ask Congress for the creation of a bicameral committee to establish the necessary legal regulations. Also the reorganization of public administration to end corruption and impunity, which is something we are doing that will be expedited." [sentence fragment as published] He added that within 90 days, in consultation with the involved groups, the general guidelines for a medium- and long-range action plan will be adjusted to determine measures in two main areas: A) the national agricultural policy and B) reforms of the institutions in charge of agriculture within the framework of state reform. President Wasmosy strongly defended dialogue as the mechanism for solving the current crisis, and within this context he said the Coordination Council for Social Development is one more testimony that the doors of dialogue are and will remain open as a commitment to consolidating democracy. Wasmosy also made several appeals. He appealed to all sectors of the population to act with moderation, calm, talent, and great responsibility. He also appealed "to agricultural exporters, industrialists, and the middlemen to become more active in the national effort to give the rural sector better conditions, and especially to contribute with preferential treatment for those producers who have not yet achieved adequate production and to pay the highest price for products in accordance with market rules. Wasmosy also said: "The many problems inherited by this democracy shows a serious picture that we are identifying with the firm decision to find the appropriate solutions without falling into the deceiving demagogic and populist formulas of very sad memories of the past. Wasmosy also said: We cannot ignore that we are in a difficult political, economic, and social situation caused by our internal limitations and by the demands of the new international situation that have a direct impact on the population, especially those linked to the economy's weakest sector.
