On 20 November, they succeeded in obtaining Carbon-11 and Fluorine-17 radioactive nuclear beams from the beam line. This achievement greatly expanded the scope and depth of nuclear physics research in this country; it also made China one of the world leaders in this field. According to reports, researchers at the Tandem Accelerator National Laboratory used Boron-11 and Oxygen-16 produced by the accelerator to stabilize the nuclear beam, then used the newly constructed secondary beam line to separate, transport and focus the nuclear beams of different mass and energy; finally, the desired Carbon-11 and Fluorine-17 were obtained in the target chamber at the end of beam line. The test results indicate that the performance of this facility meets the expected performance indices. It is believed that currently only two or three large laboratories in the United States and Japan have constructed similar radioactive secondary facilities to carry out these experiments. Today, the radioactive nuclear beam is an active area of research in nuclear physics. The knowledge base accumulated in nuclear physics has been built on the foundation of experimental research where more than 2,000 nuclides have been produced by bombarding a target with stable nuclear beams. But we have reached a point where it is very difficult to produce new nuclides using stable nuclear beams. Radioactive nuclear beam provides a possible means for producing thousands of yet undiscovered new nuclides; it also provides a unique opportunity for studying the evolution of celestial bodies, nuclear structures, and new phenomena and basic laws of nuclear reactions. As a consequence, the scope and depth of China's nuclear physics research will be significantly expanded. This tandem accelerator has an end voltage of 13 million volts; it is located in the Tandem Accelerator National Laboratory of the Chinese Atomic Energy Research Institute. In the past, this accelerator has played an important role in China's nuclear physics research where it has been used to perform mass spectral analysis of beryllium-10, to simulate the single-particle effect in large integrated circuits, and to study the time of flight of abnormal fast neutrons. This project is supported by the National Foundation of Natural Science and the Chinese Nuclear Science Foundation.
