The surprise potential is zero. We are speaking of a ready, available, and burning fuel that has enabled the country to produce electricity, cement, and other goods to an extent unprecedented in the history of Cuba--1.1 million tons of oil extracted in the critical year of 1993. This is an undeniable record that can be attributed only to the integrity of the workers in the sector, who are laboring with materials in short supply and with badly worn technical facilities. These workers began production in January of this year at a steady rate of 25,000 barrels per day, an absolute record that is also unprecedented. The domestic recovery of oil, spurred by the shortage of imported fuel, was thus pushed beyond the high-water mark of 936,000 tons achieved in 1986 under better technical conditions. By way of reference, the UNO-UNO [expansion not given] campaign in 1992 set the previous record. In that year the total reached was 882,000 tons, although by then we were already short of replacement parts and without foreign technical aid. In 1993, modern techniques for stimulating wells were effectively introduced by the foreign oil companies operating in Cuba. But only 16 percent of the total extracted in the country (about 170,000 tons) can be ascribed to "enhanced production," as these methods are called. Nor can there be talk of new wells (which could almost be counted on one's fingers) or of spontaneous "miracle" gushers, nor of any sensational discoveries by these foreign firms either. Since this is the case, and given such difficult conditions, what explanation can there be for the 26-percent increase in oil extraction in 1993, as compared with that in the preceding year? The skill and experience of these workers, apart from their honor, played a role in these results. Also, the effects of a series of measures set forth in the oil program previously approved by the highest Cuban Government bodies began to make themselves felt. These measures included substantially increasing wage rates and linking wages with labor-productive yields; improving working and living conditions (nutrition, camps, protective gear, clothing, transportation, housing, etc.); and careful rationalization of personnel strength, which was reduced to the indispensable minimum, among other things. Efficiency increased, and only in this way would it have been possible to cope with the difficulties. The oil workers are aware, however, of the inadequacies--their own and those of others, which were seen in 1993, despite the achievement of the UNO-UNO goals. The workers say that there were also technical-organizational problems unrelated to the geology of the deposits, which have a greater extraction potential than the level reached (the production program for this last year had even been set at 1.3 million tons). Thus the shortage of vessels for shipping crude oil through Cardenas was again a factor in 1993, although it was less important in that year, and some notable records were even set in the transportation process. Nowadays almost all of the fuel extracted from the so-called Varadero deposit (which is not in Varadero, but south of the beach that bears the same name) and in the fields surrounding it converges on this port in Matanzas. All of these fields belong to the Central Petroleum Drilling and Extracting Enterprise (EPEP), which achieved the highest production level in its history--825,000 tons--in 1993. If a vessel reaches port late, this contributes to keeping the storage tanks on land full, which in turn makes it necessary to shut down wells. Once a well has been shut down, it sometimes takes 15 days to regain the previous extraction level. It is true that the use of an old oil pipeline, which has inadequate capacity and is in poor condition, was also a factor in this situation. The operation of the "ship-pipeline" process of taking oil out of Matanzas was also affected by the unavailability of the steam needed to liquefy the oil to some extent for easier handling. In the past, this steam came from the boilers of the nearby Jose A. Echeverria Distillery. In 1993, there was also a shortage of solvents, such as the cutter stock used for the same purpose of reducing the viscosity of this crude oil, which is very dense. There were technical problems of all kinds, most of which were overcome, one after the other. It can be said that the lack of supplies, in particular replacement parts for the old Soviet technological apparatus still in use, was a constant factor. Replacement equipment and other imported materials were in short supply, as were masks, gloves, boots, and other protective gear. It was necessary to employ inventiveness to find substitutes and to impose stricter disciplinary and organizational measures. The exploitation of the wells and oilfields became increasingly efficient. The least productive wells were shut down in the course of the process, and the operation of the others was guaranteed. They were even protected against power failures. The battle to increase production was very dramatic. A decisive role was played by geotechnical measures. At many sites, the method used was the recirculation underground of injected light oil beneath the productive zone, so as to clean it, leaving more space for the influx of the crude oil (this technique is called "PPG," [expansion not given] an analogical reference to the famous Cuban medicine). In 1993, pumps were installed at wells that had initially operated on the basis of spontaneous gushers and had later ceased to produce. Extraction pumps were also installed at other previously inactive wells that promised good yields. Also, the Cuban oil workers, on their own account, made successful use of the "enhanced production" technique, which they assimilated rapidly. But the principal guarantee was provided by the workers. Lazaro Campoalegre emphasized what many people in the Central and Western EPEP zones had told me. "The effort made by the workers has been decisive. The nation's limitations have made it necessary to be inventive in order to keep the old equipment operating and to extract from each well all it can produce, so as not to lose a single gram." Campoalegre, who is the deputy director of human resources in the Western Zone, is contemplating the rehabilitation of the Soviet A-50 trucks for use in well repair, aeration, and circulation. "This struggle depends on man, and even technology will not work if the human effort is lacking. Perseverance and the systematic checking of each well are basic. Thus more than ever, man provides the primary guarantee," Campoalegre says. The people anticipated the difficulties. In the Central EPEP zone, problems developed with the seals and gears on the pump used for our heavy oil (the seals alone cost between $10,000 and $15,000). A solution was sought and found, working jointly within the Cupet [Cuban Petroleum Enterprise]. Now there is production here and there, ranging from nuts and washers to small-capacity extraction pumps. There was a positive reaction to the difficulties, apart from the encouraging effects of the wage-scale reform implemented. The workers began to receive basic wage increases, as well as premiums based on the fulfillment of the production plan (the average monthly wage of 238-240 pesos increased to more than 300). The technicians and administrative directors also benefitted from income adjustments based on the progress made in the programs. The existing jobs and the duties involved were studied, interchangeable tasks were introduced, and the organizational structure was simplified. The work force was reduced and the oil enterprises began preparations for the introduction of the system of self-financing in foreign exchange. Beginning in 1993, all of this led to a substantial increase in efficiency, and first and foremost, in the production rates. The oil workers adopted a labor regime wherein attention to the human element began to make itself felt. They began to build housing for themselves. Hundreds of bicycles were given to them. Farm plots for food self-sufficiency were established in order to improve the dining-room menus and to provide additional nutrition, from which the workers directly involved in production have benefitted. Transportation points inside and outside the oil-producing zones were organized. The Black Gold contest helped to mobilize this great effort. The Central EPEP The Central Petroleum Drilling and Extracting Enterprise (EPEP), which covers the provinces of Matanzas and Villa Clara, is credited with 75 percent of domestic hydrocarbon production, obtained essentially from its approximately 170 active wells. They constitute a part of the Varadero deposit, the largest source of heavy crude oil in the country, located south of the beach that bears the same name, and the peripheral areas--Cantel, Serpentina, Caliza, Camarioca, Varadero South, and Guasimas, as well as other smaller ones. Today it is within the area of this MINBAS [Ministry of Basic Industry] enterprise, which is also a part of Cuba Oil, that there is the most collaboration with foreign oil firms. This has helped somewhat to alleviate the material shortages. In the year that has just begun, the employees of this enterprise, who are in the main the protagonists in the efforts made in the sector in 1993, are faced with new challenges. They will now continue their decisive investments and extend their efforts to increase the yields of more wells. In this way, they will be able to come close to 1 million tons. This is an attainable, and not a distant, goal. The challenge in 1994 will in addition include assimilation of new technologies, and the continuation and development of exchanges of mutual aid with the oil companies operating in the various areas. The Western EPEP The second EPEP in Cuba is that in the western region. Its interests extend to Pinar del Rio and Havana, although the deposits are located in Boca de Jaruco (the largest one), Yumuri, Puerto Escondido, and Martin Mesa. This EPEP has about 180 operating wells from which it extracted 25 percent of the total 1993 domestic hydrocarbon production (almost 300,000 tons). The oil produced here is of medium density. It is sent to the East Havana Thermoelectric Power Station (in Santa Cruz del Norte) and to other nearby points. The technical base of this EPEP lies in the Caribbean--Boca de Jaruco--zone, from which 90 percent of this oil is extracted. The gas and oil pipelines soon to be linked up with the electric power station mentioned above originate at these oilfields. This will make the current transfer of the fuel in drums unnecessary (at present, for example, there is one well there producing more than 100 tons per day thanks to a spontaneous gusher, so that constant rotation of the tank trucks is required). Foreign companies also operate within the territory of this advanced western oil enterprise. They are mainly engaged in "enhanced production," and excellent cooperation has developed in this connection. These relationships will be continued and extended in 1994 to keep pace with the productive goals. According to realistic predictions, new historic records will again be set. It is not only the magnificent brigade responsible for capital and subterranean well repairs, entrusted with the task of keeping the wells operating and stimulating production, that merits special mention in connection with the 1993 results. It is reported that almost every one of the men participated in this extraordinary effort, despite the shortage of resources, suitable clothing, and footgear, and the extensive technical difficulties.
