Come in, Dario. [Hoyos] President Gaviria, I can see you are very upset with the Council of State. In light of the ongoing political campaign, don't you think that this issue, which could turn into a confrontation between the executive and the judicial branches, will prove detrimental for the country? In addition, could it be that your election plans for the OAS are being thwarted? [Gaviria] I will not discuss the last portion of your question. I know the State Council does not think along those lines. Anyway, we did not discuss it. I am concerned about what the Council of State did and the lack of specific legal documentation. If we were talking about a judicial ruling, it would be easier to study and consider the scope of what happened. But we are dealing with an opinion, a simple statement. I am not looking for trouble but I (?stick) to my convictions and do not allow myself to be intimidated by any decision or argument. I fight for the things I believe in. But I am not upset. I normally do not get upset, but my convictions are strong. What you are hearing indicates firmness of conviction. I think the legal arguments that we sent to the Council of State are valid.
