FBIS4-52509 "dreas091_a_94036" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan More on Testimony on Stock Deal More on Testimony on Stock Deal OW1105081594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0705 GMT 11 May 94 OW1105081594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- An investment consultant, testifying before the Diet on Wednesday [11 May], described as a "lie" former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remark that his father-in-law asked the consultant to help him buy shares in the world's largest telephone company, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). Shuzo Fujiki, the 60-year-old president of the Tokyo-based stock consulting firm, Random Walk, told the House of Councillors Budget Committee that the Hosokawa side asked him in 1986 to act as an intermediary in securing a huge loan to buy NTT shares. "Telling a lie is outrageous as the truth is the truth. We must not allow lies to go unchallenged,'' Fujiki told the session. Fujiki said Hosokawa asked him through Yusei Kuwahata, their common acquaintance, to help secure the loan to buy the 300 NTT shares. Kuwahata, former president of a computer information magazine, earlier told a news conference that he went to the southern Japan city of Kumamoto around August 1986 to invite Hosokawa to buy the shares during a meeting at a golf course clubhouse restaurant. "Mr. Kuwahata told me that then Kumamoto Gov. Hosokawa expressed his desire to tender his bids at a NTT share bidding, if only he can raise the (necessary) funds, as he has the collateral to put up, although he does not have the money," Fujiki said. "Following that conversation from Mr. Kuwahata, Mr. (Masatoshi) Miyama (Hosokawa's chief financial secretary) contacted me, asking me to introduce a financial institution to lend money, as Hosokawa has collateral, but not money," he said. Fujiki said he complied with the request by introducing the Tokyo Shoken Kinyu financing company to Hosokawa and then arranging for Miyama to meet the "responsible person" of the financing company in Fujiki's presence. After the financing deal was struck, Fujiki said, "Mr. Miyama asked the Tokyo Shoken Kinyu executive if it would allow Hosokawa to use the name of a person other than himself in borrowing the money, as Hosokawa is renowned as the Kumamoto governor." "The senior executive replied the firm will accept it (the other person's name)," he said. The executive made a "bold decision" to lend as much as 418 million yen to Hosokawa in view of his prestigious social standing as the Kumamoto governor despite the fact that the collateral was worth only 180 million yen, he said. "Tokyo Shoken Kinyu would never have extended the loan if Mr. Hosokawa had been a person without any credit worthiness," he said. He said he did not know the name of Hosokawa's father-in-law until his name was reported by the media, as the Hosokawa side proceeded with the loan deal without informing him, once the loan arrangement was made. Fujiki's testimony contradicts Hosokawa's own earlier statement to the Diet that his late father-in-law, Shohei Ueda, and not Hosokawa himself, initiated the investment deal, asking Hosokawa for help in securing the necessary loan. Hosokawa's father-in-law died last May. Hosokawa repeatedly told the Diet he pledged his condominium in Tokyo as collateral to take out the 418 million yen loan from a stock investment financing firm and offered the money to his father-in-law. Hosokawa dropped his bombshell resignation announcement on April 8 to take the blame for a "fresh suspicion" on his personal finances, which he said is different from the NTT deal. NTT listed tenders for its shares from corporate and large-lot individual investors willing to purchase more than 100 shares Oct. 4, 1986, before offering the shares for smaller-lot public subscription. The Hosokawa side succeeded in acquiring all 300 NTT shares for which he had submitted bids on professional advice from Fujiki, the investment consultant said. Hosokawa reportedly made a capital gain of 200 million yen by selling off 199 out of the 300 NTT shares in two installations in February and March 1987 at an average price of 1.38 million yen. The remaining 101 shares are still in possession of his wife, Kayoko Hosokawa. According to Fujiki, Hosokawa reneged upon his promise to pay 10% of the net proceeds from any sell-offs of the NTT shares as a "consulting fee." Hosokawa also broke the promise to allow the consultant to dictate the timing of the sell-offs, he said. Later, Miyama visited Fujiki's Tokyo office and asked for Fujiki's consent to lower the sum of the consulting fee to 10 million yen, he said, adding he accepted the request. In a related development, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) joined the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japanese Communist Party in demanding the Diet summon Miyama as a witness to clear up the suspicions. SDP Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Koken Nosaka told a news conference, "We cannot help demanding the summons of former Secretary Masatoshi Miyama as a witness. If necessary, we should also demand the summons of Mr. Hosokawa." (endall) 110705 macdonald bm131105.001 st 11/0816z May
