The MAINICHI SHIMBUN has received answers from 34 of the businessmen polled, and 60 percent of the respondents clearly indicated a preference in the direction of banning corporate contributions. More than 90 percent of the leading businessmen surveyed supported the Keidanren's decision to stop arranging corporate contributions. Asked to which political parties they wanted to contribute, a majority of the businessmen surveyed chose a plurality of parties from among the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New Party, and Sakigake [Harbinger]. In general, the leading businessmen surveyed supported the four political parties. The results of the poll revealed the position of the business community, which has no choice but to deal with the realities of funding requirements, while acknowledging the need for a change in the relationship between politics and money. Asked to comment on Keidanren's decision to halt the arrangement of corporate contributions, a majority of 31 leading businessmen "supported" it while two leading businessmen, including an executive of Keidanren, "did not support" it. In the poll, 25 key businessmen said that the "cause of corporate contributions to safeguard freedom and a market economy," which the business community has advocated, "is still valid, but has lost significance." Five business leaders said the "cause has disappeared completely." In this way, nearly 90 percent of the key businessmen said "the cause has either disappeared or lost significance." Asked whether corporate contributions should be abolished or continued, a total of 21 key businessmen, or 60 percent of the leading businessmen polled, said that "corporate contributions should be abolished immediately," or "they should be abolished after a certain period of time has elapsed." But eight leading businessmen said the "business community should make a certain amount of corporate contributions." The rest said they wanted to reserve comment. Asked how political funds should be raised in the future, 21 leading businessmen said they should be raised through a combination of public fund raising and individual contributions, whereas 13 key businessmen said they should be raised by "a combination of public fund raising, individual contributions, and corporate contributions." Asked which political parties they supported, about 70 percent of the leading businessmen polled said they supported a plurality of parties from among the LDP, Shinseito, the Japan New Party, and Sakigake, but only two leading businessmen supported the LDP, with eight businessmen declining to answer the question. Thus, the results of the poll showed that with the emergence of new conservative parties, it has become difficult for the businessmen to support one specific political party. Twenty-five key businessmen, or more than 70 percent of them, expressed their support for the Hosokawa cabinet. Asked to which political parties they would contribute for the time being, 10 businessmen said they would contribute to the LDP and Shinseito, whereas eight businessmen said they would contribute to the Japan New Party and Sakigake, while seven businessmen showed their eagerness to contribute to the Democratic Socialist Party. Almost no businessmen expressed an intention to contribute to a plurality of political parties; 17 businessmen "declined to answer the question." Asked what they thought of the future of corporate contributions, a majority of 30 businessmen believed they would decrease. Asked about the transparency of corporate contributions, four leading businessmen were pessimistic, saying "their transparency will remain unchanged."
