FR940504-0-00047 FR940504-0-00013 By contrast, the economic effects of denying manufacturers' requests to delay the effective date would be significant. Most of the school buses which are currently being manufactured or which will be manufactured during the extension period have already been ordered. Because it is common practice to order school buses by competitive bidding, manufacturers will have to sell these school buses at the price quoted when ordered. If a manufacturer based the price on installing fewer exits than required to comply with Standard No. 217, the manufacturer would have to absorb the cost. In addition, if an extension were not granted, manufacturers would have to stop production until changes could be made to designs, which could take several months. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' This action has been determined to be not ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. As explained above, this notice merely extends the effective date of the final rule of November 2, 1992, which amended Standard 217. There will be no additional costs associated with this final rule. Rather, this final rule extends the date of compliance with the amendments of Standard 217 to September 1, 1994. Regulatory Flexibility Act NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this final rule under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Since this notice merely extends the effective date of a previously-issued notice, no costs are associated with it. Accordingly, the agency has not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), there are no requirements for information collection associated with this final rule. National Environmental Policy Act NHTSA has also analyzed this final rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it will not have a significant impact on the human environment. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) NHTSA has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined that this rule will not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Civil Justice Reform This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571 Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles. In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR 571.217 is amended as follows: PART 571_FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS 1. The authority citation for part 571 continues to read as follows: Authority: 15 U.S.C. 1392, 1401, 1403, 1407; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. §571.217 [Amended] 2. Section 571.217 is amended by revising §5.2.3 and adding a new §5.2.3.4, to read as follows: §5.2.3␣ School buses. Except as provided in §5.2.3.4, each school bus shall comply with §5.2.3.1 through §5.2.3.3. * * * * * §5.2.3.4␣Each school bus manufactured before September 1, 1994 may, at the manufacturer's option, comply with either §5.2.3.4(a) or §5.2.3.4(b) instead of §5.2.3.1 through §5.2.3.3. (a) Each bus shall be equipped with one rear emergency door that opens outward and is hinged on the right side (either side in the case of a bus with a GVWR of 4,536 kilograms or less); or (b) Each bus shall be equipped with one emergency door on the vehicle's left side that is hinged on its forward side and meets the requirements of §5.2.3.2(a), and a push-out rear window that provides a minimum opening clearance 41 centimeters high and 122 centimeters wide and meets the requirements of §5.2.3.2(c).
