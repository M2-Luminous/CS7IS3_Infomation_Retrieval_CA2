"Even if there is an external plot it is the duty of the state to protect its citizens," said Samir Ja'ja' of the disbanded Lebanese Forces, at a press conference at his fortified home in Ghidras, north of the capital. "The Lebanese government is responsible for this crime," he said, referring to Sunday's bomb attack in Our Lady of Deliverance Church, in which 55 people were also injured. "The Lebanese people have been greatly deceived because they have realised that the security the authorities promised to restore is still a mirage," Ja'ja' added. Information Minister Michel Samahah and several other Lebanese officials blamed Israel for the bombing and linked the blast to Friday's massacre of 52 Palestinian worshipers in Hebron on the West Bank. "By blaming external factions these officials are trying to cover up for their own impotence," Ja'ja' said, stressing that the authorities had no tangible lead on which to base their accusations. Displaced Persons Minister Walid Junblatt said Monday he feared a wave of attacks against places of worship in Lebanon by supporters of partition backed by Israel. The Druze leader, who heads the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP), called for "radical steps against those who undermine our security." He rejected claims of a link between the church bombing and the Hebron massacre, saying the theory was "unconvincing" and Israeli agents were "well known in Lebanon." Prosecutor Tarabay Rahmah said on Sunday that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the blast, but he had been seized days before it happened. The blast was the second against Christian targets since a December bomb attack on the right-wing Phalange Party headquarters killed three people and wounded 100. Relatives of the victims held a mass funeral in the church on Monday. President Hafiz al-Asad of Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon, pledged in a telephone call to his Lebanese counterpart Ilyas al-Hirawi late Sunday to help track down the bombers.
