"These financiers have substantal investment in Guyana and are known to be negotiating further investment with the government," the party said. It accused the government of "compromising their ability to best serve the interests of the country." The opposition Working People's Alliance (WPA) and the Guyanese Organisation of Indigenous Peoples (GOIP) earlier said it was inappropriate that South Korean and Malaysian investors in the Barama Company Limited should underwrite part of the cost of President Cheddi Jagan's near month-long tour of China, Malaysia, Singapore and India which ended January 1. At a press conference last Friday, Jagan admitted the financing received through Barama to augment limited public funds, but said he was unable to say at the time the amount of the funds from the Barama investors. Barama officials here have referred queries about the extent of the financing to the government. Barama, a manufacturer of plywood for export, has been touched by controversy over the level of concessions it received from the former Desmond Hoyte administration, and the impact of its forestry operations on the environment and on hinterland Amerindian communities here. The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) also commented, indirectly, on the matter in a statement Tuesday expressing concern that linkages with the newly-industrialised Asian economies opened Guyana to an "aggressive form of exploitation." "It requires no great leap to imagine several powerful Asian conglomerates ensuring domestic legislation protects their interests when one, Barama Company Ltd, is so profoundly influencing foreign policy," the GHRA statement said. Former Prime Minister Hamilton Green, at a press conference Wednesday, described the financing of the presidential tour as "unorthodox and inappropriate funding by a private group."
