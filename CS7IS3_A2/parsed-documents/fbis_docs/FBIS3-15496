Motivating its position exclusively by "goodwill," Tallinn invited Moscow to conduct consultations "at a high political level" (at foreign minister level, as Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik explained). Having assessed the Estonians' decision as "reasonable," Aleksandr Udaltsov, deputy chief of the Second European Department at the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry (he is in charge of the Baltics), in a conversation with KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent noted that Moscow in fact planned to halt the negotiating process. Yet the Estonians are to back up their "goodwill" by no less good deeds, and for the time being the date for a final withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia remains open. Moscow's position is based on three fundamental principles: the provision of social guarantees to the Russian military pensioners living in Estonia (10,500 people), the dropping of claims for compensation for "ecological damage from the troop presence" in exchange for the real estate left over by them ("zero option"), and the granting by the Estonians of $23 million to build housing for the withdrawing troops. According to Mr. Udaltsov, last November the Estonians themselves proposed the above sum together with the "zero option," at the same time offering concessions on the issue of military pensioners. Given this, Moscow promised at the time to move the pullout date to August 1994. Yet signs are that the Estonians' promises were just a tactical ploy aimed apparently at the Western public, which is sensitive to Baltic issues. In December, it became clear that the pensioners agreement can hardly be reached: Estonia adopted a law whereby being "potential enemies of the Estonian people and statehood," they cannot count on getting citizenship in the republic or any other political and property rights. Soon Tallinn's position on the payment of the $23 million also changed. The Estonians stated that Moscow simply misunderstood them: apparently they meant... "the Vancouver package," more specifically the $160 million allocated by the United States within its framework to provide for the retirees. True, in a hurry to share these outside funds, Estonia failed to notice that those monies were not meant for active duty officers. According to Mr. Udaltsov, in spite of Russia's interest in getting the troops out of Estonia as soon as possible ("there is no point in their further presence there"), it cannot be entirely ruled out that the last Russian soldier may not leave the republic by 31 August. Moscow will not allow a repetition of the "Lithuanian precedent" and will not withdraw the troops until corresponding agreements have been reached. Mr. Udaltsov is sure that the Estonians will not succeed in appealing to the United Nations or the CSCE because their resolutions say that the pullout of troops should proceed on the basis of such agreements. One is only left to hope that Mr. Udaltsov's certainty will meet with understanding in international organizations and that they will not violate their own decisions.
