Wishing to lend credence to the idea that the figures of the Ceausescu era were inflated not one or two times but 10 times, the postrevolutionary government, with its spearhead, the Ministry of Agriculture, began to systematically reduce the areas sown to crops and to resort to massive imports through specialized firms -- that is, by means of a network of a few magnates with an influence on some parties in power. The result is well-known. The individuals concerned became rich in defiance of the people, who were subjected to a slow but certain process of starvation. In 1992, the grain yield was only 10.5 million tons. The technique perfected by the importers is simple: the reduction of the sown area from more than three million hectares to less than two million hectares, under conditions in which sowing was executed only after the best period. At the same time, the merry-go-round of imports was accelerated by an average of $1 billion a year! Wheat was imported -- from one West European country, in particular -- at $155-160 a ton. When there was no need for wheat -- in 1990, for example -- the magnates contented themselves with importing fodder, for which $800 million were paid. This is how they arrived at the incredible amount of $3 billion, which was paid by the Romanian state for wheat and fodder in 1990, 1991, and 1992 alone, a sum which represents 80 percent of the total accumulated foreign debt. This debt paid by the Romanians was for commissions of about 5-10 percent, which went into the bottomless pockets of the big importers and their accomplices who governed the country in the respective years. Instead of being held responsible for this pillage and for the deliberate destruction of agriculture, these people still occupy important positions or comfortable seats in Parliament where they continue to boycott agriculture. A bank director who was recently removed from his position has begun to make statements in various newspapers about the pressure exerted on him to initiate letters of credit for the import of millions of tons of grain, which were not needed, as he maintains now and as was well-known then. However, it seems that no one from the General Parquet or from the government or the Parliament paid any attention to such statements. Instead, there has been a lot of talk about some more or less obvious abuses occurring in some hamlet or some former agricultural production cooperative for which the current leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture is blamed! The fault of the minister is indeed great in the eyes of those who make such claims since the current minister of agriculture, with the support of the prime minister, has categorically refused to take into account the blackmail, exercised by all economic and political means, for continuing the import of grain and further indebting the country's treasury. In addition, he has undertaken to increase the areas sown by more than a million hectares, resulting in grain yields of more than 15.5 million tons in 1993, over 5 million tons more than in the year, which was most profitable for the mafia of importers. In this situation, which was so disastrous for it, the importers' union, which has as its eminence grise the father-in-law of an influential politician who is highly regarded by the voters, was fully mobilized by some trade union organizations and by the lobby in Cotroceni Palace [presidential office] and Victory Palace [headquarters of the government], with a great chance of success. Last year, this trade union of the grain mafia, presenting data collected by American satellites, called upon the Government of Romania to import 1.5 million tons of wheat, but when it realized that it could not force the hand of the government it brought tractors into Victory Square and unleashed a wave of protests by means of a "peasant" trade union composed of city-dwellers. The current mobilization of the grain mafia has been prompted by the obstinacy of the government officials who have decided to double the area sown to sugarbeets, making it impossible to import sugar, which has brought so many millions of dollars of profit to these greedy racketeers. These gentlemen also received support, intentionally or not, for the destruction of the country's agriculture, from the banks, which loaned money, in dribs and drabs, at an exorbitantly high rate of interest. As a result, interest fees represent 60 percent of the cost of a ton of agricultural product and the animal husbandry sector has been destroyed. What is under discussion now is not the exchange of one team for another but the return to the rudder of agriculture of those who have shown that they have no other interest besides driving agriculture to the ground. In future issues of the newspaper we will provide documents and name the people involved.
