"The mourning ceremonies were used for the sake of rude historical falsification", Kostikov said in a statement on Monday referring to opposition rallies held over the weekend to mark the six-month anniversary of the October 3-4 armed revolt. "People who had nearly unleashed a civil war in Russia, including the recently freed rebels, tried to pose for innocent victims, moreover, for judges accusing the president", Kostikov said. Hopes that the amnesty to anti-Yeltsin rebels would sober them up do not come true, according to Kostikov. "In this connection it is especially urgent to consolidate all sound political forces around the unifying idea of the agreement on civic accord. Extremism must be stopped", the statement reads.
