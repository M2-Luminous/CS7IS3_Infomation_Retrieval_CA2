Probably sensing a decline in his popularity, President Iliescu probably hurried to do what was possible for the former members of the Political Executive Committee. As could be noted, the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] recorded a decline compared with September 1992; only 24 percent opted for it while, according to IMAS, the Democratic Convention [CDR] has recorded a tremendous rise, winning approximately 35 percent of the population's options. CDR President Emil Constantinescu is the most favored leader of the opposition, winning 49 percent support; thus he surpassed Nicolae Manolescu [president of the Civic Alliance Party] (33 percent), Sergiu Cunescu [president of Social Democratic Party] (26 percent), and Petre Roman [president of the Democratic Party] (41 percent). With 55 percent of the options, Adrian Nastase [executive president of the Social Democracy Party of Romania and president of the Chamber of Deputies] is a dangerous opponent for President Ion Iliescu (44 percent). If Ion Iliescu decides for a new mandate, he is not going to let Adrian Nastase (who has firmly taken over the leadership of the unrelenting faction within the PDSR) run in the future elections, and thus a strong conflict could develop within the ruling party. There are signs that the president of the Chamber of Deputies is impatient to get to the top. The affirmation by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu that the standard of living has improved is contradicted by the opinion poll results. If 45 percent affirm that the current incomes of the family are enough just for what is strictly necessary, while 27 percent think that incomes are not even enough for that much, only 2 percent are coping with everything they need, without any savings. The government's activity, its economic policy, its anti-corruption measures, the level of wages, the standard of living, and its actions against crime generate massive dissatisfaction among the population. The hope that a completely compromised government will be able in the future to take the country out of the economic crisis, that it will be able to do something to improve the standard of living has been shattered.
