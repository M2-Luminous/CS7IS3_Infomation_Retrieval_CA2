According to Aleksandr Panov, Moscow and Tokyo stand for strengthening of the regime of nuclear non-proliferation and for the Korean Peninsular becoming a nuclear-free zone. Both sides, he noted, consider it necessary to maintain a constant mutual contact, continue negotiations on the nuclear problem of North Korea, and probably look for some other approaches as the present ones proved to be insufficiently effective. Asked about what joint contribution Moscow and Tokyo could make to the ensuring of security in the Far East and in the Asian-Pacific region as a whole, the Russian senior diplomat said both sides had earlier expressed the coincidence of views on this problem. Russia and Japan consider it important, while maintaining the existing treaties and agreements, to move towards cooperation on a subregional level. The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that such a subregional mechanism could be created in particular in the basin of the Sea of Japan.
