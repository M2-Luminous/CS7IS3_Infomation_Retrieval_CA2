Ye said that the CPPCC Eighth National Committee, based on the work experience of the previous national committees, has probed new ways to engage in political consultations and exercise democratic supervision. It has tried to make CPPCC, a unique form of democratic politics in China, meet the requirements of the country's socialist modernization since its first session last March, he said. Ye made the remarks when delivering the work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC Eighth National Committee at the opening of its second session. In the past year, Ye said, the National Committee held five standing committee meetings and discussed a wide range of issues including the national economic situation, measures to solve economic problems, the international situation, establishment of a socialist market economy in China, measures to ensure a clean government and the fight against corruption. Zhu Rongji and other leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) delivered reports to the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee put forward many good opinions and suggestions on the issues, according to Ye. For instance, the economic sub-committee of the National Committee raised suggestions on strengthening macro-economic controls and keeping inflation at bay, which were adopted by the CPC Central Committee and the central government. The sub-committee has therefore contributed to strengthened macroeconomic controls and a continuous, fast and healthy development of the national economy. Last year, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, successfully visited Nepal, India and Pakistan. It was the first visit to foreign countries by a chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and has important significance in CPPCC's international exchanges. The national committee organized 15 delegations for visits to more than 20 countries and established ties with organizations and parliaments of 14 host countries. So far, the CPPCC National Committee has established friendly relations with 46 organizations and parliaments in 36 countries. Subcommittees of the CPPCC National Committee also made surveys on some important issues and put forward 24 reports. They attracted attention from the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, government departments and local authorities. Many suggestions contained in the reports have been adopted. In addition, the national committee has also made new progress in expanding domestic and overseas friendship ties, promoting the reunification of the motherland, participating in the anti- corruption campaign, helping state organs build clean government, improving inspection work of its members, raising suggestions for reform and development, improving the handling of proposals raised by CPPCC members, and revising the constitution of CPPCC. On this year's work, Ye Xuanping said that the CPPCC National Committee will uphold the banner of patriotism and socialism, focus on the central work of CPC and the state, actively engage in political consultations and exercise democratic supervision, improve its work efficiency, seize favorable development opportunities, and make further contributions to the country's economic reform, open policy implementation, economic development and social stability. Ye said, the CPPCC National Committee in the New Year will make systematic and in-depth investigations on issues concerning economic development, reform, the open policy and people's life, put forward policy proposals and report them to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. CPPCC, Ye said, will make better use of itself as a pool of talented people, its extensive information sources and its wide contacts. In the New Year, Ye said, the CPPCC National Committee will continue to develop friendly exchanges with parliaments and non-governmental organizations of foreign countries, promote the reunification of the motherland, urge direct and two-way exchanges of mail, air and shipping services as well as trade between the mainland and Taiwan, devote itself to maintaining the stability and long-term prosperity of Hong Kong, and work for a smooth hand-over and transition of the sovereignty of Macao in accordance with the basic law of the territory.
