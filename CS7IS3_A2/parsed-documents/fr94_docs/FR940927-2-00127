The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(2) of title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(b) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion of this matter is exempt from the open meeting requirement of the Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information relating to internal personnel practices. The Board further determined that the public interest did not require that the Board's discussion of the matter be open to the public. In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting may properly be closed to public observation, pursuant to section 552b(c)(2) of title 5, United States Code; and section 7.3(b) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations. Requests for information about the meeting should be addressed to the Secretary for the Board, David F. Harris, at (202) 268&hyph;4800. David F. Harris, Secretary.
