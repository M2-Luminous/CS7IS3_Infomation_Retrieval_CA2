The proposals are expected to be endorsed by the committee, thus paving the way for some key changes in Taiwan's political operations. Associate members of the committee and ranking party officials are also attending the meeting to air their views. The meeting, which will conclude Sunday, is being held at the Chungshan Building in Yangmingshan, a Taipei suburb. Speaking at the opening ceremony in his capacity as KMT chairman, Republic of China [ROC] President Li Teng-hui reiterated his idea of a country run by the people. "This is a meeting to tell the people of the nation the ruling party's determination to push ahead with constitutional reforms so as to realize the idea of, 'the power belongs to the whole of the people.'" He urged the committee members to build consensus during the meeting so as to help accomplish the mission of constitutional reform. If endorsed by the meeting, the proposals will be formally submitted to the National Assembly, which is scheduled to convene later this month. In the draft proposals, the KMT will recommend several key changes, including election of the president and vice president by popular vote, rather than by members of the National Assembly, as has been done in the past; installment of a speaker and vice speaker in the National Assembly; and a restriction on the premier's right to co-sign the laws promulgated and mandates issued by the president. The ruling party will also seek to extend the legislative term from three years to four, [words indistinct] limit legislator, right of immunity from prosecution for speeches delivered during legislative sessions, and to change the official name of the "Shanpao (mountain) people" to "aborigines."
