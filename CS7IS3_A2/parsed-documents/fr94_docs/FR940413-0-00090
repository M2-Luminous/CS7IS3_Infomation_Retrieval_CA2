FR940413-0-00090 FR940413-0-00026 (ii) Identify the building(s), floor(s), or unit(s) to be designated and their location, or if specific units are not designated, the number to be designated; and (iii) State the reasons the building(s), floor(s), or unit(s) were selected for designation. (2) Identification of groups and persons consulted and comments submitted. The PHA must: (i) Identify the groups and persons with whom the PHA has consulted in the development of the allocation plan; (ii) Include a summary of comments received on the plan from the groups and persons consulted; and (iii) Describe how the plan addresses these comments. (3) Profile of proposed designated project in pre-designation state. This component of the plan must include, for the projects, buildings, or portions of buildings to be designated: (i) The total number of families currently occupying the project, and (A) The number of families who are members of the group for whom the project is to be designated, and (B) The number of families who are not members of the group for whom the project is to be designated; (ii) An estimate of the total number of elderly families and disabled families who are potential tenants of the project (i.e., as the project now exists), based on information provided by: (A) The waiting list from which vacancies in the project are filled; and (B) A local housing needs survey, if available, such as the CHAS, for the jurisdiction within which the area served by the PHA is located; (iii) An estimate of the number of potential tenants who will need accessible units based on information provided by: (A) The needs assessment prepared in accordance with 24 CFR 8.25, and (B) A housing needs survey, if available, such as the CHAS or HUD-prescribed successor survey; (iv) The number of units in the project that became vacant and available for occupancy during the year preceding the date of submission of the allocation plan to HUD; (v) The average length of vacancy for dwelling units in the project for the year preceding the date of submission of the allocation plan to HUD; (vi) An estimate of the number of units in the project that the PHA expects to become vacant and available for occupancy during the two-year period following the date of submission of the allocation plan to HUD (i.e., if the project were not to be designated); (vii) An estimate of the average length of time elderly families and non-elderly persons with disabilities currently have to wait for a dwelling unit. (4) Projected profile of project in designated state. This component of the plan must: (i) Identify the source of the families for the designated project (e.g., current residents of the project, families currently on the waiting list, residents of other projects, and potential tenants based on information from the local housing needs survey); (ii) For projects proposed to be designated for occupancy by elderly families an estimate of the number of: (A) Units in the project that are anticipated to become vacant and available for occupancy during the two-year period following the date of submission of the allocation plan to HUD; (B) Near-elderly families who may be needed to fill units in the designated project for elderly families, as provided in ยง945.303(c); (iii) Describe any impact the designation may have on the average length of time applicants in the group for which the project is designated and other applicants will have to wait for a dwelling unit. (5) PHA occupancy policies and procedures. This component of the plan must describe any changes the PHA intends to make in its admission policies to accommodate the designation, including: (i) How the waiting list will be maintained; (ii) How dwelling units will be assigned; and (iii) How records will be maintained to document the effect on all families who would have resided in the designated project if it had not been designated. (6) Strategy for addressing the current and future housing needs of the families in the PHA's jurisdiction. The PHA must: (i) Identify the housing resources currently owned or controlled by the PHA, including any mixed population projects, in existence, as provided in 24 CFR part 960, subpart D, that will be available to these families; (ii) Describe the steps to be taken by the PHA to respond to any need for accessible units that will no longer be available for applicants who need them. The PHA has a continuing obligation under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) to provide accessible dwellings even if the project designation removes accessible dwellings from the inventory of possible dwellings for non-elderly persons with disabilities; (iii) If a project is being designated for elderly families, describe the steps the PHA will take to facilitate access to supportive services by non-elderly disabled families. The services should be equivalent to those available in the designated project and requested by non-elderly disabled families. If the PHA funds supportive services for the designated project for elderly families, the PHA must provide the same level of services, upon the request of non-elderly disabled families. (iv) If a project is being designated for elderly families, identify the additional housing resources that the PHA determines will be sufficient to provide assistance to not less than the number of non-elderly disabled families that would have been housed by the PHA if occupancy in units in the designated project were not restricted to elderly families (one-for-one replacement is not required). Among these resources may be:
