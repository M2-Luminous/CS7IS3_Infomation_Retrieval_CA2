Then, most groups criticized the Lebanese Government but as time passed, the opposition decreased and ultimately the issue was relegated to oblivion. This is because every government that comes to power in Lebanon is subservient to the policies of Damascus and should have some coordination with Syria. If al-Hariri's government fires a hail of bullets on the opponents of the Rabin-'Arafat accord or resists them in parliament, it is solely because of its affiliation with Damascus. This government faces danger, as it has passed its expiry date and should make way for another government. The straits the government is in also relate to Syria. If, in the early days of the signing of the Gaza-Jericho autonomy accord by 'Arafat and Rabin, Damascus reined in the various groups and promised the United States that it would prevent them from subversive activity, it was because the White House had pledged Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Syria's promise was endorsed by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and other Syrian officials. Syria also asked Lebanon to rein in opponents' activities and this was why the demonstrations were dragged into blood and dust. Time has shown that the United States does not intend to honor its pledge to Syria, so Syria has revised its policy. Syria has hardened its stance on the Rabin-'Arafat accord, which was proven during the recent meetings between Warren Christopher and Syrian officials, which necessitated a review of the stance on the opponents of the Gaza-Jericho Accord by the al-Hariri government. It now appears--in view of change and the crisis that has engulfed Lebanon--that the al-Hariri regime has reached the end of its tenure and should make way for a new government. There is talk of a former minister coming to power who leans more toward Syria and coordinates better with it. In such circumstances, the opposing groups, particularly the Islamic Resistance in south Lebanon, will extend their activity and escalate their attacks on Israel and Antoine Lahd's forces. This will continue until Damascus officially joins the peace trend and the problem of the Golan Heights is solved. Until then, Lebanon will follow the policies of Damascus and oppose the peace trend.
