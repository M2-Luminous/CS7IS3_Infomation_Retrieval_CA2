Petersen agreed with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in a dinner meeting on the need to reorganize the Security Council, the officials said. Petersen, who arrived in Japan Thursday on a four-day visit, was quoted as saying it is necessary to reorganize the council to "reflect reality." In talks which covered a wide range of topics, Hata told Petersen Japan is very concerned about North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons, the officials said. Hata and Petersen agreed it is necessary to seek a solution to the problem through dialogue instead of placing pressure on North Korea, they said. On trade, Petersen said European nations are concerned that Japan and the United States might reach a bilateral agreement from which other nations might not benefit. He called on Japan to keep other nations informed of the results of negotiations with the U.S., they said. Petersen is to leave Japan on Sunday.
