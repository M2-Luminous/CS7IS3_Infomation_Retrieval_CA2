A group of scientists from Nanjing Shipping Institute and the Shanghai Navigation Channel Bureau has drawn this conclusion after a year's study. Their study found out that if the channels were properly dredged, 50,000-ton ships, including fourth-generation container vessels, could sail into Shanghai port. By riding the high tide, the scientists said, even 100,000-ton vessels could reach the port. At present, the water at the river mouth is only seven meters deep, which allows ships larger than 10,000 tonnage to enter the port only by riding the tide, while large container vessels are completely denied entrance to the port. This situation is hindering the development of Shanghai, Nanjing, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Zhangjiagang and other major ports on the Chang Jiang River, said officials from the Chang Jiang Navigation Administration. The officials believe that the result of the study will have a significant impact on the the development of the Shanghai Pudong New area, the Three Gorges power plant and even the whole basin of the Chang Jiang River. Preparations to clear the channels will start soon by the Shanghai Navigation Channel Bureau, according to the Ministry of Communications.
