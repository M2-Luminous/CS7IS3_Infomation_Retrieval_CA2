The commission consists of the minister of the Armed Forces and the chiefs of staff of the Army and the Navy. The president's decree says the commission "is authorized to request logistical and technical support from the United Nations and its corresponding agencies to better fulfill the commission's mission." However, this decision by Balaguer, who always opposed the embargo, seems to be a response to the demands of 48 U.S. Democratic congressmen for a more active role in checking the fuel contraband that "oxygenates" the Haitian military. According to the Dominican press, fuel is smuggled through the very same border checkpoints manned by the military. A U.S. State Department official, during a visit less than a month ago, clearly advised Balaguer to check this operation. According to reports from Washington, the State Department expects Balaguer to ask the United Nations for observers to help Dominican troops watch the border to prevent the smuggling of gasoline, diesel, and other products sent to the Haitian military. Balaguer and his assistants oppose the embargo because they think it harms the Haitian people more than it harms the military who overthrew President Jean-Betrand Aristide. It has been pointed out in official circles that, despite Washington's firm position, the transactions between Haitian businessmen and U.S. businessmen increased last year. Analysts recall that Balaguer had hostile relations with Aristide when the latter was president and that Aristide accused Balaguer of permitting thousands of Haitian sugar cane cutters working at Dominican sugar mills to be treated as "slaves." Aristide even reported these lowly workers were denied the right to go to their villages, where they lived in barracks-like dwellings with no potable water, no electricity, and no social assistance. Aristide also reported that these workers worked more hours than allowed by Dominican law and that they worked for extremely low salaries. Balaguer reacted to these charges by ordering the sugar cane cutters out of the country. The result was a "cooling" of relations with Port-au-Prince. When Aristide was deposed in September 1991, however, Santo Domingo accepted the Haitian ambassador and others as exiles. Months ago, Balaguer and Aristide formalized their "rapprochement" when the ousted Haitian president visited Santo Domingo.
