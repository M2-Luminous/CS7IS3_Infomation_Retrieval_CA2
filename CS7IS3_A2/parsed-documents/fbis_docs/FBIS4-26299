In a more fundamental sense, however, security means safety from some more common threats to human existence: hunger, disease, crime and repression. It means protection from sudden and damaging disruptions in the pattern of our daily lives whether the disruptions strike our homes, jobs, communities or the environment. This is the wider concept of "security" embodied in the Human Development Report '94 of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). At a recent UNDP workshop on the report held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, some 50 participants from East and South Asia maintained that the search for human security lies in development, not in arms. Participants, including delegates from Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Pakistan, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, discussed the new role of the United Nations in meeting humanity's agenda not only for peace but also for development. According to the report, development co-operation, which has tended to be limited to financial aid, should be broadened to include technical assistance and marketing strategies. Dr. Mahbub ul Haq [name as published], special adviser to the UNDP administrator in New York, said the report is aimed at widening the UN's attention from only economic development. Soaring Population In consideration of the graver challenge threatening human security, a new development pattern is required that puts people at the centre of development and regards economic growth as a means, not an end. According to the report, despite all of man's technological breakthroughs, he still cannot meet primary needs in many parts of the world. A fifth of the developing world's population goes hungry every night, a quarter lacks access to potable drinking water and a third lives in a state of abject poverty. With these massive problems unresolved, the critical question of humanity's ability to survive on an environmentally fragile planet has become ever more urgent. The world's soaring population only adds to the urgency. Demographers forecast in the report that by the middle of the next century, the world population may double while the world's economy quadruples. At the same time, it is estimated that productivity of food production needs to triple since the source base for sustainable agriculture is being eroded. The world's increasing energy requirements also must be met. But even at today's level of usage, the burning of fossil fuels threaten the global climate. The devastation of the world's forests and the loss of fauna wealth and diversity continue relentlessly. "Against this backdrop of human distress" the report says, "we must seek a new concept of human security in the decades ahead." The report attempts to propose a new model of sustainable human development that can guard the expanding frontiers of human security and provide a new framework of development co-operation that unites humanity with a more equitable sharing of global economic opportunities and responsibilities. The report also put forward suggestions for the World Summit for Social Development scheduled for March 1995 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The establishment of an Economic Security Council within the United Nations is a new, ambitious idea of UNDP. Further, the UN agency "urges the international community to undertake a comprehensive review of the existing framework of international development, and, in this connection, to undertake studies on the practicability of such measures as establishing a global social safety net, introducing a world income tax, and creating a tax on foreign exchange movements as a potential source of financing for a more effective United Nations." According to a UNDP official in India, China has made the most rapid progress in human development in Asia, followed by India and Bangladesh. Over a long period of time, China has invested considerably in human development. Despite China's relatively low per capita income, it falls into the medium human development index (HDI) -- ranking 94th in the world in 1992. HDI takes longevity, education and standard of living into account in its evaluation. Yang Qingwei, a Chinese participant in the workshop, said that the picture of social development in developing countries is more or less the same. "The solutions to their problems, however, is not necessarily the same," said Yang, deputy director of the Social Development Department under the State Planning Commission. Robust Growth The poorest of nations should depend on their own domestic economic reforms, supported by foreign aid. Alluding to China, Yang reported that the past 15 years of reform and opening to the outside world have witnessed robust economic growth. The social sector, unfortunately, has developed slowly. Regional economic imbalance has increased. Furthermore, the access to education varies from region to region. On average, 97 per cent of the nation's school-age children go to school. But the figure is low in the remote, poverty-stricken areas. "China's social development mechanism fails to facilitate the transition to a market economy," Yang said. He maintained that carefully directed State intervention will be required to ensure steadier human development and equitable distribution of social services because the market often doesn't do a good job directing resources in the social sector. Yang called for reform of such social sector systems as pensions, unemployment compensation and industrial injuries compensation in order to achieve an improved level of social integration in the market economy. China is sketching a blueprint for social development from 1995 to 2000. Local governments, for example, are required to define their lowest level of poverty and minimum wage. Yang also reiterated that the demands of human development today should be linked with the exigencies of development tomorrow. He said governments should consider how decisions affecting the environment and natural resources will impact future generations to ensure they have opportunities similar to the ones previous generations have enjoyed.
