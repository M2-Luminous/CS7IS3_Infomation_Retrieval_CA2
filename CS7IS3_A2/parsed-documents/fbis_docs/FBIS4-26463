"This report is not true," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press briefing. In a front-page article published Thursday, Wen Wei Po said Deng's trip took place recently and quoted the 89-year-old Chinese leader as telling local officials in Qingdao that China "must not have a multi-party system." The official rejection of the detailed report, which quoted what were described as authoritative sources, was unusual given the fact that the Wen Wei Po is backed by Beijing and often used by the Chinese authorities. Asked to clarify Deng's present whereabouts, Wu said simply: "Mr. Deng Xiaoping is wherever he is." Deng's last public appearance was at Lunar New Year in February when he appeared on Shanghai television looking frail and physically supported by his daughters. The ailing leader's health is a constant source of intense speculation.
