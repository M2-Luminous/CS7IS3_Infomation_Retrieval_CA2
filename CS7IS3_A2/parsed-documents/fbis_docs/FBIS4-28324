FBIS4-28324 "dreas111_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-111 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 North Korea Atomic Energy Chief Sends Letter to IAEA Atomic Energy Chief Sends Letter to IAEA SK0806001394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2109 GMT 7 Jun 94 SK0806001394 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2109 GMT 7 Jun 94 Korean BFN ["Letter" from Pak Yong-nam, director of the DPRK Atomic Energy General Department to Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency -- date not given] [Text] Pak Yong-nam, director of the DPRK Atomic Energy General Department, sent the following letter to Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], responding to the hurriedly made conclusion that it is impossible to confirm if nuclear material has been diverted [haengmulchil yuyongul tambohalsu omnundusi sodullo kyollonul naeringotkwa kwallyonhaeso], insisting as if the technical possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods [nosim yollyo] at our five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant has been lost. [machi sangsildoengot chorom chujang hamyonso]. I regret very much [maeu yugamsuropke saenggak handa] that you hurriedly made the conclusion that it is impossible to confirm if nuclear material has been diverted, insisting as if the technical possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods at our five- megawatt experimental nuclear power plant has been lost. We have recently asked the agency to give us a scientific and technological response to the method for later measurement of fuel rods that we proposed, while agreeing to the agency's deputy director-general's proposal for negotiations by telex on the core refueling. However, you, with no intention to respond to our proposal, picked a quarrel with us, acting as if we had made no answer, and even submitted to the UN Security Council an absurd report that distorted facts [sasirul chondohan tangchiannun pogo]. What we cannot help but call in question is that you ignored our special status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Our special status was created by the United States and the IAEA. Based on their acknowledgement of our special status, the United States and the agency agreed on the inspection to guarantee the continuity of safeguards, and the agency has carried out inspections to guarantee the continuity of safeguards, not routine and ad hoc inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi sachari anira] under the safeguards accord. The fuel rods replacement at the five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant is being carried out in the presence of inspectors from the agency and under the agency's supervision [kamsi] and surveillance [pongswae] in accordance with this principle. Inspectors of the agency who are observing the replacement of the fuel rods admit there is no diversion of nuclear materials. Problems on the verification of the history of the fuel rods [nosim yollyoui kyongnyok komjung munje] raised by the agency will automatically [chayonhi] be solved when our special status is resolved [haeso]. We are now doing the refueling operations in such a manner to guarantee fully the technical possibility for later measurement of fuel rods, anticipating a dissolution of our special status. The fuel rods are being replaced channel by channel and area by area in due sequence, and all the fuel rods from four channels are discharged into one basket. All the refueling operations, including recording the identification numbers of baskets and fuel rod channels in the baskets and positions of baskets in the tub, are being correctly recorded in accounting and operating books and are confirmed by the inspectors of the agency daily. This plainly shows that the procedure fully guarantees the possibility of repeating [chaeyon] the sequence of fuel channels and fuel rods in channels, if necessary. Our method of guaranteeing the technical possibility, which we notified the agency by letter, is not only theoretically possible, but also has fully been proven experimentally. This is the only rational [hamnijogin] method suitable to our special status. All the facts show that when our special status is resolved, the agency can scientifically verify there has been no diversion of nuclear materials in the past. Nevertheless, it was referred in your reports to the UN Security Council and the IAEA Board of Governors that any future measurement of that fuel would have no practical value because it would not be possible to reconstruct the configuration of fuel rods and because the measurement would have to be based on operators' records, which are unverifiable. This shows that you seem to have no interest in a fair solution to our nuclear problem, in keeping with your preconceived prejudiced political view. Our practical experience from the past inspections shows that the more we accepted the agency inspections with our maximum goodwill and generosity, the more artificial obstacles the agency made to the solution of the problem, leading the situation to a graver phase by attaching unreasonable conditions every time. We made it clear during the Board of Governors meeting in February 1993 that the inconsistencies could be clarified by a verification of the fuel rods during the core refueling operation. At that time, however, the agency Secretariat objected to our proposal, saying that the inconsistencies could not be clarified in such a manner, and made the Board of Governors adopt the resolution on special inspections for two military sites. After completing the activities sufficient to guarantee the continuity of safeguards last March, the agency referred to the UN Security Council the issue of additional inspections, saying that it is necessary to carry out the smear-taking from the glove boxes and gamma mapping in the building No. 3 at the radiochemical laboratory in order to verify nondiversion of nuclear materials. When we allowed the agency to conduct additional inspections as a special exception, it then said that it is necessary to measure the fuel rods from the core, which was a matter already denied by the agency in the past. On the one hand, the agency inspection team removed the archive samples for clarification of the inconsistencies during the past inspection, and on the other hand, the agency says that it is necessary for the agency to make special inspections of two military sites to verify nondiversion of nuclear materials. This shows that the agency Secretariat continues to join the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK to make our military sites open one by one under the pretext of the inspection. The development of current situation regarding the core refueling operations bears resemblance to the IAEA's pressure commotion at the beginning of 1993 when the agency cooked up the nonexistent inconsistencies on the basis of the false intelligence information provided by a third country and imposed on us the so-called special inspection of two military sites on the basis of the inconsistencies. I think such unreasonable acts of the IAEA are unprecedented events in the history of safeguards. I would like to remind you that, for these reasons, we could not help but withdraw from the NPT last year. In light of the facts described above, we cannot help but doubt if our nuclear issue can indeed be resolved through further consultations with the agency Secretariat. Recently, the agency Secretariat has laid obstacles to our normal nuclear activities concerning the refueling operation at the beginning of the campaign by intentionally avoiding the presence of its inspection team. On the other hand, it is now preventing a smooth solution of the nuclear problem by making a hasty conclusion that it could not verify the nondiversion of nuclear materials. This is very irresponsible and hasty behavior that misrepresents the objective reality. Accordingly, the agency Secretariat will have to be entirely held responsible for all the consequence arising from this wrong conclusion. If the agency Secretariat takes our nuclear issue to the United Nations and continues to adhere to only pressure on the basis of a hasty conclusion that the technical possibility for later measurement of the fuel rods has been broken, widening its unfairness, we will no longer feel the need to be subject to the unreasonable binding of the agency Secretariat and will have no choice but to proceed to the next step of our peaceful nuclear activities.
