Zhao, also chairman of Pudong's Administrative Committee, told a press conference that 2.5 billion yuan will be invested in ten key infrastructure projects in the area, including a 1.5-sq-km park, the expansion of schools, and a boulevard in the Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone. Unmarked on a sizable map only three years ago, the Pudong area, covering 518 sq km on the east bank of the Huangpu River, has become a symbol of and a bridgehead for Shanghai's comeback as an economic and financial center for the Asia and Pacific region. Therefore, construction of its infrastructure has to be top-flight from the very beginning, Zhao said. Statistics show that in 1993 the area recorded an output value of 16.4 billion yuan, double that for 1990. The figure is also up 30.2 percent over 1992, and 15.3 percentage points higher than the growth rate for the area on the river's west bank. Last year Pudong had 16 billion yuan-worth of fixed assets, far surpassing the 7.5 billion yuan for 1992. Its revenue growth was 60 percent, and 924 foreign-funded projects were approved by the local government in the same year. So far, with a total investment of 15 billion yuan, the first ten projects, involving transportation, energy and telecommunications, have been completed, two years ahead of schedule. Thanks to this, the skeleton of a modern metropolis has taken shape, especially on the 50 sq km of developed land which embraces the Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao Free-Trade Zone, Jinqiao Export-Processing Zone and Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Zone. In 1.7-sq-km Lujiazui, which aims to become the largest business center in China, construction of 50 financial and commercial office buildings has begun, with a total floor space of over two million sq m, and work on another 30 buildings designed to be up to the world advanced level will start within this year. According to the blueprint, by the end of this century 150 large buildings will come into existence in Lujiazui. So far, 20 out of the top 100 world conglomerates have set up branches in Pudong. In the Jinqiao District there are 202 foreign-invested projects, financed to the tune of an average of some 13 million U.S. dollars each. Zhao said that by the year 2000 Pudong will expand its development area by another 60 sq km, with the urbanized area reaching more than 100 sq km.
