The analyst says: The South side said it had no objection to the proposed early exchange of special envoys, yet it took exception to announcing the agreement on it in a joint communique. It also refused to accept the North side's reasonable proposal on the mission of special envoys, including the question of the North and the South observing the principle of national independence. This is a mockery of the fellow countrymen and an act utterly lacking faith as a dialogue partner. What the South side really seeks is to drag on the working-level contact for an indefinite period and delay the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South and thereby to cast a shadow on the soon-to-be-held third round of DPRK-USA talks. It is an unjustifiable anti-national criminal act for the very one who is blocking an early exchange of special envoys to create an obstacle in the way of the third round of DPRK-USA talks by laying the blame for the failure of exchange of special envoys at the other's door. The South side must bear in mind that a good opportunity does not present itself any time and stop playing tricks to block the exchange of special envoys. And it must effect a fundamental switchover so that the agreement may be finalized without fail at the next contact. We will watch the South side's attitude hereafter.
