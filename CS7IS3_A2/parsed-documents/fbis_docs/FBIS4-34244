Although Balaguer acknowledged the existence of anomalies during the elections, he stressed that it will be up to the Central Electoral Board (JCE) to decide the issue. He stated that no authority, whether domestic or foreign, is entitled to interfere with the JCE's announcement of election results, as the U.S. State Department did this past Wednesday. Balaguer's statements drew an immediate response from the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo, which reiterated the U.S. commitment to democracy in America. Despite his criticism of the request, Balaguer agreed to stage complementary elections in those communities in which voters were excluded from voting lists. The United States praised Balaguer's decision to repeat the elections, leaving the final decision to the JCE, adding that "such a decision will pave the way toward resolving the controversial results." Balaguer explained he supports some of the recommendations made by the United States, but he added that he opposes any domestic or foreign interference in the JCE's decisions. He also reiterated that the JCE is the organization that will decide which measures will be adopted to resolve the issue. On Wednesday, State Department spokesman Michael McCurry released a document sent to the Dominican Government which called for an investigation and clarification into charges of irregularities reported by international observers. The document notes: "The United States strongly urges the release of the actual documents that were used at the voting tables on Election Day." The balloting is being protested by the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), which contends that at least 200,000 voters were excluded, mainly supporters of this party's presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez. Balaguer stated that the past elections were the cleanest and most transparent ever staged in the Dominican Republic, as well as in Latin America. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that following the elections, the Dominican economy has been paralyzed by the JCE's delay in announcing the winner, although he pointed out that the economy will recover once the election process has concluded. Balaguer also blamed the opposition for the electoral tribunal's delay in announcing the winner because the number of challenges that have been filed, particularly by the PRD, are preventing the JCE from proclaiming a winner without first concluding investigations into the charges.
