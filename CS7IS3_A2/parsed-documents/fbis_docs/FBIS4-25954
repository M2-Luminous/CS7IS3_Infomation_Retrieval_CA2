"This will be much better than expected," said officials from the State Economic Commission (SEC) in an exclusive interview with XINHUA. China's economy has been growing fast and steadily over the past months and remains sound thanks to effective price controls and further implementation of macro-economic regulation measures, the officials said. Latest statistics indicate growth of retail commodity prices is falling and industrial production of state-owned enterprises going up. China's inflation rate was 18.9 percent in May over May last year, with the increase rate down 0.6 percent from the previous month. The added value of Chinese industries totalled 619.6 billion yuan in the first five months this year, up 16 percent over the same period last year. The officials also predicted a bumper harvest of summer crops, based on favorable weather condition and farmers' growing enthusiasm. Government statistics show that investment by state enterprises was 204.4 billion yuan for the first five months this year, up 34.2 over the same period last year. The growth rate of these investments was down nearly 30 percent, with the number of new projects under control, and more money going into the key national projects, the SEC officials said. The first five months saw steady growth in government income, 24.3 percent up over the same time last year, with the volume of taxes collected up by 22.6 percent. Because of more state bonds issued and more bank savings, the country's banks withdrew more currency from circulation in the first five months. New bank savings in the five months amounted to 422.4 billion yuan, and a total of 8.5 billion yuan was withdrawn from circulation in May alone, the statistics showed. The country's export growth outpaced the import growth, according to governmental figures. In the first five months, China's imports were 18.1 percent higher than in the same period last year, while exports jumped by 24.1 percent. The trade deficit in this period was down to 1.79 billion U.S. dollars. The SEC officials called for continued efforts to rein in price rises, implement the macro-economic control measures, and maintain the balance of overall supply and demand. They also warned that more attention should be paid to the rising gap between sales and industrial production, to promote the efficiency of industrial production. The proportion of output sold in this period was 92.38 percent of production -- a ratio of 1.75 percentage points lower than in the same period last year. The SEC believes that with such healthy trends continuing and the above problems solved, the planned 9-10 percent annual growth rate for the national economy is beyond doubt.
