He even said that "it is contradictory to say that the Joint Declaration indicates that Britain will have no moral responsibility and interest toward Hong Kong beyond 1997." This was the "grounds" Patten created when he played the "international card" in Australia. Patten's remark was in open disregard of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and also thoroughly exposed the British colonial rulers' intention to prolong their colonial rule and influence in Hong Kong. The Joint Declaration explicitly specifies that Britain will return Hong Kong to China on 1 July 1997. Before that, Britain will be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong. It is self-evident that after the transfer of government in 1997, the Hong Kong issue will be purely China's internal affair and no foreign countries will have the right to meddle in Hong Kong's affairs. Britain is naturally no exception. The so-called "moral responsibility" has no foundation in the Joint Declaration. Although Patten repeatedly stressed Hong Kong's international status and tried to turn Hong Kong into an "international asset," this was just a trick played by the British in an attempt to solicit the help of the international forces to prolong the British colonial interests in Hong Kong. In fact, before the signing of the Sino- British Joint Declaration, the British did not allow other countries to have a hand in Hong Kong affairs. Now, because the Hong Kong issue has been solved and Britain will have to withdraw from Hong Kong and the Chinese Government will resume exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong, Britain finds it necessary to encourage other Western countries to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and step up the process of "internationalizing" Hong Kong politically. This fully shows that the British side has no sincerity toward implementing the Sino-British Joint Declaration and is still unwilling to withdraw from the Chinese territory it forcefully seized more than 100 years ago. Patten's emphasis on Britain's "moral responsibility" to Hong Kong precisely reflects such a mentality. The so-called "British moral responsibility toward Hong Kong" after 1997 has no legal foundation at all. Patten himself also could not utter any tenable argument to justify this. As everyone knows, Hong Kong was occupied by old British colonialists in a predatory way. The signing and implementation of the Joint Declaration should help Britain terminate its shameful history and enable China and Britain to bring their old grudge to an end so that the two countries may thus furhter consolidate and develop their bilateral relations on a new basis. However, as Hong Kong will soon be returned to its motherland, the British have talked a lot about their "moral responsibility" toward Hong Kong beyond 1997. This sounds like a burglar continuing to claim "moral responsibility" after the thing he stole has been taken back by its owner. How shameless such people are! In the past, many places in North America, Asia, and Africa, including the United States, were subject to colonial rule by the British Empire. Would it not be ridiculous if Britain now continued to claim "moral responsibility" toward so many countries? If they really want to talk about some "responsibility," then Britain's "responsibility" exists before rather than after 1997. That is, in the transitional period, Britain must honestly abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and provide sincere coopertion for China's resumption of its sovereignty over Hong Kong. The British side bears unshirkable historical "responsibility" for this. To put it more accurately, this is not just "moral responsibility" but the British side's duty which it must perform according to the norms of international law and the Joint Declaration. It is regrettable that the British side erroneously assessed the situation, broke its own promise, and suddenly changed its policy toward Hong Kong. In particular, Patten, on taking office, undermined the foundation for Sino-British cooperation, wantonly violated and trampled upon the Joint Declaration, impeded China in reexercising sovereignty over Hong Kong, and tried to turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity so that Britain can continue to control Hong Kong from behind the scenes and extend its colonial rule beyond 1997. By analyzing the essence of the "political democratization" program pursued by Patten, the so-called "Hong Kong freedom and values" he advocated were only a synonym for Hong Kong's "politial independence or semi-independence." Hong Kong has never experienced such "independence or semi-independence" in the past; still less is this allowed by the Joint Declaration and the "one country, two systems" policy. This is just a sinister plan which the British side is trying to impose on the future special administrative region through changing Hong Kong's existing political structure. Fundamentally, it goes against the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and it unfavorable to Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. Therefore, it is doomed to be short-lived.
