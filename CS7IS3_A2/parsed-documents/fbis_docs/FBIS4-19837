As many as 26 percent of voters do not know which party they will vote for on 3 May. Even more voters (29 percent) have recently changed their minds on how they will vote. These are the findings of the NSS survey bureau in The Hague. The survey bureau attributes the high percentage of undecided voters to great restlessness and uncertainty among voters. At present, it is the Center Democrats (and CP86 [Central Party 86]) and the Elderly People's Party which are benefitting most from this uncertainty. The latest opinion poll conducted by NSS gives them respectively, six and five seats . According to the bureau in The Hague, the main reasons why people are switching parties are the reports and developments regarding social security and problems concerning foreigners and asylum-seekers. The PvdA [Labor Party] can expect 33 seats, the CDA [Christian Democrat Party], and the D66 [Democrats 66] 28 seats each, while the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] could grow to 27 representatives, the NSS poll indicates.
