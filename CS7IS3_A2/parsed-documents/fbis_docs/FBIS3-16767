The ex-mayor's supporters estimated his removal from the post as a "gross violation of human rights, non-observation of the Russian constitution and laws and the return to 1937". The rally attended by several hundred persons adopted a resolution to demand that the higher instances remove Maritime governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko and Maritime procurator Valeriy Vasilenko from their posts. A reason for the demand of Vasilenko's resignation is "the lack of the territorial procurator's office control over lawfulness and permission of the eviction of the legitimately- elected mayor from his study with the use of force". According to reliable sources, Viktor Cherepkov has gone on a hunger strike and is staying at home. As for ex-mayor's Deputy Vladimir Gilgenberg, pushed out from the mayor's office, he has not been produced any documents to substantiate his removal from the mayor deputy post. Asked about reasons for this situation, senior assistant of the Maritime Territorial Procurator Veniamin Chichayev told ITAR-TASS "It is not the business of the procurator's office, and acting Vladivostok Mayor Konstantin Tolstoshein has the right to choose his deputies himself". Criminal proceedings instituted against Viktor Cherepkov on charge of major bribe-taking in February 1994 have been taken over by the Russian procurator general's office.
