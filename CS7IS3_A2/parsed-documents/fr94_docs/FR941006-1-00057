FR941006-1-00057 FR941006-1-00013 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Highway Administration 49 CFR Part 391 [FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;91&hyph;1] Qualification Of Drivers; Vision Deficiencies; Waivers AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of Determination; request for comments. SUMMARY: The FHWA announces a Determination which will extend, for thirty days, waivers issued to certain vision-impaired drivers as part of a study instituted in July, 1992. The purpose of the study is to gather information and data to determine whether there should be a change in the current vision standards for operators of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) in interstate commerce, or provision for individualized waivers. This action is directed solely at those drivers who had been granted temporary waivers to participate in the previously authorized vision waiver study, who numbered 2,411 as of September 30, 1994. This Notice also proposes to revalidate the waivers, allowing the aforementioned drivers to continue to participate in the study until its conclusion, which will occur on or before March 31, 1996. This revalidation would be based upon the Determination made in this document. This action follows, and is consistent with, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the case captioned Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety v. Federal Highway Administration, 28 F.3d 1288, D.C. Cir. 1994, which vacated the rule authorizing the temporary waivers and remanded the matter to the agency for further action not inconsistent with the Court's ruling. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written, signed comments to FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;91&hyph;1, Room 4232, HCC&hyph;10, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. All comments received will be available for examination at the above address from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. Those desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed, stamped postcard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The FHWA has established a special telephone number to receive inquiries regarding this notice. The number is 1&hyph;800&hyph;832&hyph;5660. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. No Further Waiver Applications Are Required To Be Submitted, Nor Will Any New Waiver Applications For Participation In This Study Be Considered As A Result Of This Action. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 206(f) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984, (MCSA) Pub. L. No. 98&hyph;554, 98 Stat. 2832 (codified at 49 U.S.C. 31136(e), formerly 49 U.S.C. app. 2505(f)) allows the Secretary of Transportation to grant waivers from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations only after a determination that such waivers are not contrary to the public interest and are consistent with the safe operation of CMVs. Historically, except for a limb-handicap waiver program established in 1979 (49 CFR 391.49), the agency had granted no individual waivers to drivers who did not meet the physical qualification requirements set forth at 49 CFR 391.41. Current Vision Standard The current Federal vision standard for CMV drivers requires: Distant visual acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in each eye without corrective lenses or visual acuity separately corrected to 20/40 (Snellen) or better with corrective lenses, distant binocular acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in both eyes with or without corrective lenses, field of vision of at least 70 degrees in the horizontal meridian in each eye, and the ability to recognize the colors of traffic signals and devices showing standard red, green, and amber. 49 CFR 391.41(b)(10).
