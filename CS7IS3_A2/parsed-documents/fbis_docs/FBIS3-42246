Three people died, and seven were injured. If the explosion had happened some 20 minutes earlier or later, the scale of the tragedy would have been more considerable. By a lucky chance, however, by the time the delayed-action mine placed in the second car went off, the passengers who had just arrived on this train from Kislovodsk had already gotten off and all those who were to set out in it for Astara at 2307 hours had not yet had time to get on. Nevertheless, material damage (considerable damage!) was caused: In addition to the two cars blown to smithereens, windows were blown out in the nearby Baku-Tbilisi and Baku-Ganja trains. A. Bagirov, the republic's transport prosecutor, has said that an investigation has started. "This is not the first act of terrorism," he remarked. "Whereas in previous instances we were dealing with explosive devices with a clockwork mechanism restricting their operating time to 12 hours, a mine has now been used which, thanks to special chemical fillers, can be set off two or three days after being put in position."
