The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from Mashhad, Kermanshah, Chenaran and Tarqobeh spoke as pre-agenda speakers. Then the Majles took up its agenda. We direct the attention of our respected readers to the detailed proceedings. Qodsiyeh Seyyedi 'Alavi, Deputy From Mashhad The security the women in our country have under the shelter of Islam is unequaled in the world. The first pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Ms. Seyyed 'Alavi, deputy from the Mashhad electoral district. During her speech she offered congratulations on the birth anniversary of Imam Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him) and also the birth anniversary of His Holiness 'Ali (peace be upon him) in the lunar month of Rajab to the followers of those great one. Continuing, she said: Now, as we are about to compile and approve the Second Five-Year Plan in the Majles, it is appropriate, in view of the guidance from the exalted leader, with a proper view to the future and a study of the nation's existing resources, that we move in such a way that the real principles of the Islamic revolution will not be crushed under the wheels of economics, especially by the extravagance and dissipation of the executive officials and their programs. Continuing, the speaker said: Explicit attention has been given in the Constitution to women and their value and dignity. Now that the respected government has presented the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill and the Second Five-Year Plan to the Majles, it is the duty of the deputies, and especially the specialist commissions, to consider the guidance from the exalted leader. When compiling and allocating the budget, they must keep in mind the articles in the Constitution that pertain specifically to women and the family, especially with regard to the law enacted by the Majles concerning women and children without guardians. This year a suitable budget for that must definitely be provided. In view of the measures taken so far to achieve social justice, reduce poverty and alleviate deprivation, the government, and especially the judiciary, must take serious steps to redistribute wealth and to stop parasitical behavior and hoarding. Continuing, the deputy from Mashhad said: Another issue is the evolution and growth of the Muslim woman since the revolution. With regard to the claims being made in the world in an attempt to damage the revolution, especially by the so-called human rights organizations concerning the lack of freedom or the failure to observe the rights of women in Iran, it must be said that world imperialism and these organizations who work hand-in-hand with America have not understood the issue. The real issue is the the evolution, which has taken place since the revolution thanks to the blood of the martyrs, the guidance from the Imam of the nation, God's mercy be upon him, and the real and righteous positions taken by the exalted leader in Iran's revolutionary society, especially among Muslim women. She discussed the high divorce and abortion figures in the Western nations, as well as the lack of security for women in Western societies, figures that increase every year. She added: This summary shows the image of women in some Western nations and their behavior and how they are dealt with. Now let these people making false claims about human rights and this Mr. Galindopol come and make a realistic study without dependence on the world's empty world-devouring powers. Our respected women have great dignity and high standing in Iran's Islamic society. If they do not regard as a violation of human rights the implementation of divine limits and commands, Almighty God's commands in the Glorious Koran and the sacred religious law, which penalize deviant individuals to prevent the growth of social corruption, the security the women in our country have under the shelter of Islam is unequalled in the world. If some of our women are subject to a small amount of oppression by the men, this has nothing to do with Islam. She also called on the Ministry of Guidance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to use the relevant cultural centers and embassies to acquaint the world with the true Islamic revolutionary image of the sacrificing and loyal Muslim women. Continuing, Seyyedi 'Alavi said: Now, as the rights and honor of women are being trampled in many societies and her only salvation is to turn to the orthodoxy of Islam, let us permit the Muslim Iranian women to remain a complete and proper model and example for the world. Let us not permit an incorrect interpretation of Islam to be made in some of the statements that come from the sacred Majles. Abuses of the terms "human rights" and "women's rights" to settle international and purely political accounts are taking place in circumstances where the disgraced supporters of human rights have fallen silent on the crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel, and other parts of the world. This has brought about aversion and repulsion in every nation. It is incumbent upon Muslim women to try to foster their own intellectual growth and productivity and to achieve their rights through greater understanding and awareness, and to make it possible for themselves to participate more in society while strengthening the position of families and family ties. Continuing, she asked the officials in the judiciary to implement Article 49 of the Constitution and to cut off the leeches and economic terrorists and to punish them. She also asked the Medical System Organization to exercise diligent supervision over the writing of doctor and clinic prescriptions and signs, and to aggressively prevent the writing of sometimes false propaganda which misleads patients, using the necessary guidelines. In conclusion the deputy from Mashhad added: Some of the things discussed by some of the brothers are not worthy of the Majles, which is at the head of the government. It is necessary in many cases to observe international and social concerns, although we are all Muslims and we also accept Islamic regulations and laws. However, each one is situated in spacial and temporal circumstances. Issues related to corruption in society and the cultural invasion cannot be studied and reasoned about solely from the point of view of multiple spouses and temporary marriage. In a society where many people are unable to marry once, how can multiple spouses be the solution to the above problems? In conclusion, she added: If we are Muslims, let us take as our example His Holiness Mohammad (peace be upon him), who did not take another wife as long as Her Holiness Khadijeh was alive, and Imam 'Ali (peace be upon him), who did not take another spouse as long as Her Holiness Faseleh was alive, and who truly regarded his spouse as his friend, companion and comrade-in-arms. Akhtar Rokhshandeh, Deputy From Kermanshah The best way to fight the enemy cultural invasion is to keep the Islamic veil on our women. The second pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Ms. Rokhshandeh, deputy from Kermanshah. During her speech she offered congratulations on the birth anniversary of His Holiness 'Ali (peace be upon him). She said: Using comprehensive and future-oriented policies, one can stand up to the cultural invasion and American imperialism. If this policy is based as much as possible on a deep understanding of the history of the culture of traditions and national alertness in the country, it will be very important and much more valuable. Preservation of the Islamic veil for Muslim women, which bespeaks the high position of the powerful culture of the women in our country, is the best way to fight the imperialist cultural invasion. The culture of American imperialism is incapable of understanding the concepts of the Islamic revolution. It creates war in the name of peace. In the name of knowledge it spreads ignorance and unawareness. It fights religious activities in the name of religion. We must fight the policies of the culture of imperialism using the weapon of enjoining good and prohibiting evil. Continuing, she discussed Salman Rushdie's meeting with the American president. She said: America must realize that nothing will be achieved in doing this other than provoking disgust in most Muslims and affirming their determination to carry out the order from our late Imam, may God have mercy on him, to execute Salman Rushdie. Continuing, the deputy from Kermanshah said: Unfortunately, because of the imposed war the government has not invested in the western region, especially the province of Kermanshah, which has been ignored to a great extent. As a result, the youth of this province are suffering from unemployment and a shortage of welfare and educational resources. As you know, the greatest danger to youth, who are a matter of concern for the president of the republic, is unemployment. Therefore, government construction and startup of factories for production and mother industries is a necessity in order to create employment. She called upon officials to start up the paper plant, expedite the province gas delivery project, internationalize the airport, and to carry out the project to study the nation's western railroads. She then made the following points regarding the Second Five-Year Plan: The exalted leader's commands focus on the creation of social justice in society. We are now faced with the upheaval of the population increase. Since these societies must give priority to making educational, economic, social and political efforts in order to evolve, rapid population growth will prevent growth of the public social and welfare scales. I am therefore asking that this important issue in society be dealt with. There are problems evident in the nation's administrative systems which are causing anxiety. In the Second Five-Year Plan it is necessary that changes be made in the government's administrative and executive systems, and there must be real planning and supervision combined with the proper implementation of the laws. Ahmad Moradi, Deputy From Chenaran and Tarqobeh Have the economic planners yet achieved the goals of the economic adjustment? The final pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Moradi, deputy from Chenaran and Tarqobeh. During his speech he said: It is not logical and just for us constantly to invite the public to fight imperialist military and cultural assaults, while a group of godless people and merchants are guiding and controlling the nation's economy and taking advantage of this disorderly situation. The government must not stand by and watch the perpetual growth in prices and the instability of the price of foreign exchange caused by profiteers and opportunists. The people are waiting for revolutionary and decisive measures and the removal of these individuals. He added: Economic insiders and planners must give a satisfactory answer to the question of whether or not they anticipated this kind of situation in the framework of the theory of economic adjustment and unification of the foreign exchange rate, and whether or not they have yet reached the goals of the economic adjustment. Can they claim that unification and stabilization of the foreign exchange rate has been achieved? On what justification have those who know about the resources for procuring foreign exchange set up lines of foreign exchange brokers, and used the wealth belonging to future generations as a source of revenue? Those who have the slightest acquaintance with the basics of economics know well that the goal of this science is the best allocation of limited resources and making the most of minimal of resources for the purpose of answering to the nation's important and basic needs. It is thus clear and obvious that oil revenues must be spent on infrastructure investment and the nation's economic and industrial prosperity. They must not be spent to buy various kinds of consumer goods. Continuing, the speaker said: One of the government's basic problems is extremism in economic and social policy. In a country where until recently all of what is needed for the lives of the people and for industry was controlled and supervised by the government, deregulation in this form means wasting several years of experience and effort. Currently many economic and social policies are not coordinated with each other, and this has caused unreasonable profiteering brokerage services to come into play in investments in the various economic sectors, and even investment in industry has been made to stop. In conclusion, the deputy from Chenaran and Tarqobeh said: The new changes and developments illustrate the bitter reality that in some cases we are still doing our economic planning using old, experimental and mistaken policies. Legislation The only item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was continued consideration of the details of the Proposed Law on Procedures for Punishing Individuals Who Engage in Unauthorized Activities in Audiovisual Affairs, whose articles were approved by the Majles.
