The seizure has alarmed all drug traffickers, mainly due to the large sum of money involved. The cocaine consisted of 1,771 individual packages, which were camouflaged to resemble spools, and was found in a warehouse in Maracay. Another 60 kg in 48 additional packages was found in a warehouse belonging to Expriven Company in Guarenas. Finally, three more kg in six packages were seized in an apartment in the Santa Cruz neighborhood in Maracay. [Begin recording] [PTJ Chief Orlando Jordan Petit] There are some spools around which one can wrap anything, such as wires, paper, and so on. A number of rolls, for lack of a better description, of the drug were wrapped around it ... [Gonzalez, interrupting] To make it resemble what, Chief? [Jordan Petit] The idea is to place the drug there to make it pass for the content of a spool, normally something else, any other product. This is perhaps one method they used nationwide to export the drug from Colombia and to distribute it nationally. This was also perhaps the mechanism they were using to ship it to the United States. [end recording] The names of the six persons who were arrested are: Agustin Leon, a Venezuelan businessman; (Minges de Leon Janit), an American citizen and manager of Baduca Company; Pedro Julian Rosas, a Venezuelan driver for Expriven Company; Erlis Delgado, a Peruvian woman in charge of that company; Pedro Jose Rosas, an employee; and Carlos Ordones, businessman and local drug distributor. [Begin Narcotics Division Chief Nerio Rengifo recording] This is one of the most important cases the PTJ, specifically the Narcotics Division, has worked on. It is the result of long months of hard work and follow-up and surveillance operations by members of the division. Their investigation of a number of companies with prior drug trafficking records in the United States led us to identify its members, and later, led us to discover and seize this large amount of cocaine. [end recording] Thus, the Narcotics Division of the PTJ dealt a heavy blow to international drug trafficking. To finish dismantling this organization four persons belonging to one family are also being tracked down. They are Aurelio Carmelo, Ivan Mauricio, Harold, and Nabal, all members of the Villamizar family. They carry Colombian, Venezuelan, and U.S. identification documents.
