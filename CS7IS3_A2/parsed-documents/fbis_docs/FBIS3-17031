On the Evening of 16 March, Viktor Cherepkov Was Relieved of the Position of the Mayor of Vladivostok, and Konstantin Tolstoshein Was Appointed Acting Mayor"] [Text] Yesterday's issue of VLADIVOSTOK reported rumors circulating in the city concerning the inevitable removal of Viktor Cherepkov on Wednesday, 16 March. Our prediction turned out to be accurate. On 16 March, at approximately 1800 hours, Deputy Governors Igor Lebedinets (the acting supreme official of the kray in view of Yevgeniy Nazdratenko's attending a meeting of the Federation Council in Moscow) and Alfred Gartman appeared at the building of the administration of Vladivostok. They announced the removal of the mayor of Vladivostok, Viktor Cherepkov, from his position and the appointment of Konstantin Tolstoshein as the acting head of the administration of Vladivostok. The latter has previously held the job of chairman of the committee for industry of the kray administration, and prior to that--head of the administration of Pervorechenskiy Rayon of the city. From this moment on, the events began to develop that were witnessed by a team of VLADIVOSTOK journalists who worked between 1800 and 0400 hours in the area of the White and Gray Houses, as well as Cherepkov's apartment. Upon returning to his office, Igor Lebedinets informed a VLADIVOSTOK correspondent that at 1700 hours, Deputy Procurator of Frunzenskiy Rayon Aleksandr Vysotskiy had signed a decree to relieve Cherepkov from his position. This document had been ratified by Kray Procurator Valeriy Vasilenko, as well as cleared by the kray court. The latter procedure was legally necessary in view of the fact that Viktor Cherepkov is a candidate for deputy of the kray duma. As far as the decree itself is concerned, it said the following on the basis of the records of criminal case No. 474731 on the charges against V.I. Cherepkov under Article 173, part 3, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (taking a bribe): "V.I. Cherepkov has been charged with accepting from citizen V.N. Volkov a bribe in a particularly large amount, in the form of a Swiss-made Omega wristwatch worth 2,762,100 rubles [R], while working as the head of the Vladivostok administration, on 6 February 1994, in his official suite No. 1001 at the building of the city administration at 20 Ocean Avenue, for a positive decision in favor of Volkov concerning the transfer to him under a lease of premises from the nonresidential stock of municipal property for an office of the Vikhr Moscow association of internationalist soldiers. ....On 10 February 1994, V.I. Cherepkov received a bribe in a particularly large amount from Volkov in the form of R3 million for the previously rendered service in transferring the office premises under a lease...." The document also stresses that it became necessary to remove V.I. Cherepkov from his position given that the position held by him may interfere with establishing the truth in the case. From 1800 hours on, the building of the city administration was blockaded by UVD [Internal Affairs Directorate] functionaries. They began to clear the building of staff employees and visitors. Some of the latter locked themselves in their offices, and for this reason some doors were broken down. The militia also had to break down the door to the mayor's office, which had prudently been locked from the inside. Nonetheless, as the spouse of the mayor, Valentina Cherepkova, and the former city manager Vladimir Gilgenberg testified, Alfred Gartman, who entered the office first, behaved in an exceptionally proper manner, stating that he had come there primarily as a physician. Between approximately 1800 and 2100 hours, the key supporters of Cherepkov--V. Gilgenberg, S. Dolotov, T. Romanenko, S. Shokolenko, G. Petrachkov, and V. Kalenik--left the building on a coercively voluntary basis. By this time, no more than 50 people were gathered on the grounds and the steps in front of the Gray House; half of them were activists of the so-called "Association of Vladivostok Voters," and half were journalists. All attempts to break through into the building were stopped by UVD functionaries who, in the estimation of observers, operated mainly within the bounds of the law "On the Militia" (including the use of force to put an end to unlawful actions and actions interfering with the performance of official duties of the militia). At approximately 2130 hours, it became known that the newly appointed mayor had demanded that V.I. Cherepkov leave the office and the building by 0030 hours. However, this event occurred at 0115 hours, when the door swung open, and people in plainclothes, flanked by a group of baton-wielding militia functionaries, carried the dismissed mayor out of the building. The hysterical condition of the elderly admirers of Viktor Ivanovich, who suspected the worst, rose to its heights. A wild crush and swarm and shouting ensued--all of this went on for five to seven minutes, until Cherepkov was placed in an ambulance, which was immediately cordoned off by a double circle of OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment] combatants. Several minutes later, the wife of the former mayor, who was holding up quite courageously, got into the car, and the ambulance moved almost right away in the direction of Cherepkov's house on Kalinin Street. Upon arrival at the destination, Galina Gordiyenko, the physician of the ambulance team who had observed Viktor Ivanovich for a few of the last hours in the office, stated in a conversation with a VLADIVOSTOK correspondent that Cherepkov had a pronounced stress condition and stenocardia. She categorically denied information disseminated in front of the Gray House concerning an infarction that the "retiree" had supposedly had. * * * * At approximately 2030 on 16 March, City Manager Vladimir Gilgenberg, by then the former city manager, left the Gray House. However, he did not do so on his own, but rather with assistance from militia functionaries. One hour to an hour and a half later, a VLADIVOSTOK journalist met with Vladimir Andreyevich among his supporters, next to the building of the city administration and asked him a few questions. [Journalist] Has violence been used by the militia against you? [Gilgenberg] Of course, I was not beaten up, but I was driven out of the office. I was not allowed to remain by the side of the legitimately elected mayor and was bounced off the premises. [Journalist] They say that you called Moscow. [Gilgenberg] Yes. I notified the leadership of the State Duma; they promised to take up our issue as early as Thursday. I talked to the leader of one of the factions, but for now I will not say which one. [Journalist] Did you foresee the forthcoming events? [Gilgenberg] Yes, in principle. Backstage scheming had begun as early as Monday. Incidentally, it was precisely on Monday that I became acting mayor; after all, Viktor Ivanovich took sick leave, apparently on account of microfocal myocardial infarction. The kray administration picked the time quite fortuitously. Yeltsin was in Sochi, Nazdratenko was in Moscow, and who was procurator general was altogether unclear. * * * * The newspaper VLADIVOSTOK became the first publication to which the new leader of the city administration, Konstantin Tolstoshein, gave an interview. This happened at 0300 hours on 17 March. [Journalist] Konstantin Borisovich, when did you learn about your appointment? [Tolstoshein] In all honesty? On Wednesday, at 1730 hours. I was working at the kray administration (Tolstoshein's previous position was that of the chairman of the committee for industry of the kray administration) when it was proposed that I head the municipality of Vladivostok. [Journalist] Did you agree right away? [Tolstoshein] Yes, I did not hesitate any on this point. The city needs to be rescued. Look what they have done to Vladivostok-- it is a pain and a shame. There is dirt, lack of care, the breakdown of the economy and transportation, lack of social protection for many of the almost 800,000 inhabitants of the city, and other woes. [Journalist] What will you work on first of all? [Tolstoshein] Four areas will have priority: a cleanup in the city with the hygiene and disease control service, housing and communal management, and other subdivisions participating; the operation of public transportation, especially in conjunction with the coming of the recreational season; an analysis of the operation of the committee for property management and assistance to low- income citizens, families with many children, veterans of the Great Patriotic War, the war in Afghanistan, and those in other hot spots. Finally, we should begin preparations for the forthcoming winter heating season as early as Thursday, including financing, material and technical supplies, and solutions to similar problems. [Journalist] Attention will certainly be paid to personnel policy, will it not? [Tolstoshein] It goes without saying. The city administration was bloated to an impossible size and, accordingly, wages claimed a tremendous amount of funds from our budget. We will emphasize professionals rather than political scientists, disc jockeys, and historians along with psychics. Some five or six deputy mayors will remain instead of the current 13, although nobody intends to make this into a dogma. As early as 2000 hours on 16 March, I signed a decree on firing the city manager and similar officials. Knowledgeable people will come to replace them. For example, Vladimir Terekhov, the chief of the organization and inspection directorate of the kray administration, will become a deputy mayor. The institution of rayons will be restored, with greater independence being granted to them, but also with greater requirements. We had to dismiss the old heads appointed by my predecessor. Viktor Pletnev and Sergey Zhurmilov have returned to replace them in Pervomayskiy and Leninskiy Rayons. Viktor Goncharov and Aleksandr Avdeyev have been appointed to Pervorechenskiy and Frunzenskiy Rayons. For now, Deputy Head of the Administration Tamara Vadilyeva will discharge the responsibilities of the head of Sovetskiy Rayon (Sergey Fil is studying at an academy). [Journalist] Who put the functionaries of law enforcement organs at your disposal? [Tolstoshein] Militia functionaries were provided through the channels of the kray and city UVD's. Legality was fully upheld, especially as far as the removal of the former mayor from his position is concerned. [Journalist] Why was City Procurator Vyacheslav Yaroshenko absent? [Tolstoshein] I invited him that evening. However, he said he was sick and did not show up at the Gray House. [Journalist] How would you comment on the fact that Viktor Cherepkov was hand-carried out of the office? [Tolstoshein] I tried to explain to Viktor Ivanovich and his wife, Valentina Petrovna, that the office of the head of the city administration does not belong personally to Cherepkov, Tolstoshein, Ivanov, or Petrov; it is the place where the mayor works. If one is sick, he should receive treatment at home or in the hospital. At first, Valentina Petrovna asked for three hours, and then until the morning. An ambulance had to be called three times. In summation, I would like to say that the time of political demarches and a confrontation between the city administration and the kray administration is over. The time of tedious work has begun.
