Is this what the U.S.-China trade is all about? Observers here said no, arguing that America's commercial interests are at stake if the Clinton administration misunderstands the real nature of trade scene. While U.S. officials, in discussions with the Chinese, assumed that the U.S. trade deficit with China is largely the result of an insufficiently open Chinese market, many observers thought otherwise. "The U.S. should abandon using the bilateral imbalance in its trade with China as a meaningful indicator of the state of their relations," the University of Washington scholar Nicholas Lardy said. When introducing his new book "China in the New World Economy", Lardy argued that China is "fundamentally different" with Japan, and this should be the starting point for decisions at the White House. Last year, Washington's trade deficit with Beijing was 22.8 billion dollars, according to the Commerce Department. The Treasury Department predicted in November that China will surpass Japan as America's largest deficit trading partner by the year 2000. It seems certain that America's absolute trade imbalances with China, as measured by the U.S., will widen significantly for several years, but this is not the whole picture, observers here noted. China's trade, they said, is following a pattern increasingly consistent with the principle of "comparative advantage", supplying more of the U.S. demand for garments, textiles, toys, footwear and sporting goods. Meanwhile, the country's imports accounted for industrial products which embody higher levels of technologies have risen sharply and by 1993 accounted for almost 90 percent of total imports. On economic openness, according to a recent World Bank report, China is "significantly more open" than the U.S., Japan and other East Asian countries, with "extremely high" import penetration in some sectors. As an obvious contrast with Japan, China is the only country with which the U.S. has run a trade deficit that has not been a global trade surplus country as well. "China has run a systematic global trade and current account deficit since reform began, its external debt has grown continuously," Lardy said. "I believe China is likely to be a net borrower over the mid-term." According to the U.S. Government, U.S. exports to China grew 54 percent in 1991-92 and 21.5 percent in the first three quarter of 1993, roughly twice the speed of that to Mexico, Singapore, Hong Kong and China's Taiwan. China's position in U.S. exports has been underestimated, observers said, since U.S. goods re-exported to China from Hong Kong were not treated as exports to China. If accounted otherwise, as they should be, China is the fifth largest export market for the United States. David Richardson, author of "U.S. Export Disincentives", estimated that U.S. exports to China in 1989 would have been five to 10 billion dollars higher in the absence of national security controls on the U.S. side. Most of the shortfall in exports to China, exceeded only by exports foregone to the Soviet Union, was in chemicals, industrial machinery, electronic and electrical equipment, transportation equipment, instrument and related products. "The U.S. cannot afford economically costly symbolism, especially when the costs are borne by its most dynamic, technologically competitive sectors," wrote Richardson, professor at Syracuse University. As to export credits, observers said, American firms seeking to sell in China are provided with far less export credits by the administration than those provided to European and Japanese firms by their governments. The U.S., the only industrial country without a concessional loan or mixed credit programs for China, has only a few modest trade promotion programs to China. Washington, for example, does not guarantee the investment involving transfer of resources to China. Concessional finance and export credits, observers here noted, will be unusually effective sales tools for American companies if they are willing to be involved in China's infrastructure projects like electric power generation, telecommunications and transportation. "U.S. policy towards China," Lardy said in his book, "ignores the factors that contribute to China's unique combination of a global trade deficit and a bilateral surplus in trade with the U.S.."
