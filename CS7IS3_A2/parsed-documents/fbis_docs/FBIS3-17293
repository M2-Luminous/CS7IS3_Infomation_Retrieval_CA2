A centrist position is one that views the central question of the construction of the state." Irakli Shengelaia [leader of the Christian-Democratic Party (CDP]): "The chief characteristic feature of a centrist force, apart from political tactics, is political language. A centrist never operates using such concepts as `traitor to the nation,' `agent,' and `turncoat.'" Davit Berdzenishvili [leading member of the Republican Party]: "The democratic center is creating more problems today for Georgia's leadership than the radically-minded wing." Tedo Paatashvili [leader of "Charter-91"]: "In a war situation, the country's political center cannot be viewed as the center according to the traditional meaning of this word. The situation that has taken shape in the country is definitely pushing it toward radicalis. [Passage omitted] As can be seen, new elections are not far off. Probably, the most well-defined centrist forces are the Republican Party and the Popular Front that will again contest the elections together. Realistically speaking, however, there are four forces amongst whom seats will be distributed at Georgia's future elections. These forces are: The Union of Georgia's Citizens [led by Shevardnadze], the Liberal-Conservative coalition, the Republican Party, and the National-Democratic Party [NDP]. The Republican Party is today creating serious problems for Shevardnadze's government. It is opposing the latter more fiercely than the radically-minded wing. Davit Berdzenishvili, one of the leaders of the Republican Party, explains the mechanism that has come to power today as follows: "After 9 April [1989, when Soviet soldiers forcibly dispersed a peaceful demonstration killing some 20 civilians], opposition to the communist regime was conducted in the name of Gamsakhurdia. The communist regime in those republics of the former Soviet Union where it was impossible for the Communist Party to remain in power gave way to such forces that were unable to govern the country and, following their collapse, a transformed communist nomenklatura assumed the reins of power. It was not possible for such a scenario to be played out in the Baltic states, but it was implemented with great success in Georgia. Therefore, the fresh victory for Brazauskas does not signify the strengthening of the pro-Russian orientation in Lithuania. However, Shevardnadze's arrival in power in Georgia means precisely this. Moreover, he has confirmed this by his own actions." It could not happen in Lithuania because of the strength of the democratic centrist wing and the existence of social strata supporting it. Reform really got started there and the principles of a market economy were put into action. The country gradually distanced itself from Russia and integrated itself with the West. Therefore, both the success of Brazauskas in Lithuania and the success of leftist forces based on the former Communist Party in Poland in no way create a threat to the sovereignty of these countries. As regards their foreign policy and relations with Russia, they are as principled as, say, Walesa and Landsbergis were. Events in Georgia have developed differently. Centrist forces and the social strata supporting them are in the process of being formed. The political spectrum is now being cleansed and extended. From this point of view, the creation of the Union of Georgia's Citizens has fulfilled a certain positive role. The Republican Party assesses this event as a normal political process. Davit Berdzenishvili: "The creation of a political organization around the figure of the head of state will contribute to the cleansing of the political spectrum. Belonging to such a political organization, which, to all intents and purposes, is leading the country, determining cadres policy, has a monopoly on the mass media, and has brought the youth movement under its influence, places certain responsibilities upon its members. If the Shevardnadze factor were to lose its appeal tomorrow, a certain number of his supporters would follow him. Such is the logic of the political process. It is only unfortunate that a large number of the leaders of our (?student) movement [word indistinct] nourished in both the material and political sense of this word. It is some consolation that this does not apply to everyone." The creation of the Liberal-Conservative coalition has also contributed to the tidying-up of the political spectrum. The coalition views itself as a centrist formation, although it is difficult to say how centrist the Merab Kostava Society is, which is part of the coalition. The Republican Party does not view the coalition as belonging to the center although it recognizes that the organizations within it -- the Ilia Chavchavadze Society and "Charter-91" -- clearly manifest centrist tendencies. The Union of Traditionalists, however, will not oppose the center. The view exists that the "coalition" will form itself as the right wing. It is not excluded that this political union will split into two. As always, the political steps taken by the NDP are interesting and original. The National-Democrats expressed the wish that the NDP declare itself as a centrist organization. They have said several times that the NDP occupies the center of the political spectrum. It is clear to everyone that the NDP, given the mentality, tactics, and political language and skills that characterize it, will never attach itself to the center. This party's situation will be quite complex at the next elections. The NDP is not detached from the Shevardnadze factor. Naturally, the NDP will try to appear as an independent political force and it will try, during the election campaign, to use those steps that the party took to disassociate itself clearly from Shevardnadze's policy. During the last few months, the National-Democrats have been less active in Parliament and Giorgi Chanturia himself appears as the party's leader. [sentence as published] This is probably a tactical step. As can be seen, the National-Democrats want to preserve their equilibrium before the new elections. They will try to ensure that the NDP is not perceived as the alternative to Shevardnadze so as not to inflict a major blow upon themselves. However, at the same time, it is not in their interests to appear once more in the role of the young friends of the central figure, Eduard Shevardnadze. If a change of positions and partners is not alien to the National-Democrats, they could propose the next metamorphosis to their own electorate after the new elections. In general, as my respected colleague would have said, the NDP and its leader (we will not specify which) are amazingly principled and aggressive in their lack of principle. Therefore, it will be quite difficult for the electorate to trust this party and its leaders. The CDP was formed as a centrist force. It is centrist both in its mentality and tactics and in its attitude toward key questions concerning the construction of the state. It is another question how effective this force is. There is no doubt that the efficiency of centrist forces would have doubled, if they had united in a form acceptable to each one of them. The CDP leader Irakli Shengelaia does not deny that a weakness of these forces is their fragmentation. There is almost no question on which the CDP and the Republican Party would not be able to reach a consensus. Batoni Irakli Shengelaia says that they have to move toward one another. It would be better if these steps were taken right now. The attitude of the Union of Traditionalists toward centrism is very interesting. It is difficult for us to deny that this political force is not centrist in its origins. However, it is also difficult to deny that the Traditionalists' wing is, according to its tactics, almost moderate policies, and constructivism, satisfying a whole number of serious demands of the center. "Charter-91" is clearly perceived by the Georgian political spectrum as a centrist-oriented political organization. This organization has more than once been given the chance to affirm its centrist reputation. However, Tedo Paatashvili, the leader of "Charter-91," believes that, in a war situation, the country's political center is permitted to manifest a certain radicalism. The fragmentation of centrist forces in Georgia has its internal logic and is due not only to subjective reasons. The self-declared center is more radical than forces that are recognized as being radical and is creating far more problems for the authorities than the latter. Certain right-wing forces are displaying moderation and the desire to cooperate of which the center is envious. The centrist forces differ according to their political origins, mentality, and world outlook; they also differ according to their attitude toward a whole number of questions concerning the construction of the state. In spite of everything, there is probably no alternative to the unification of centrist forces. The future of the country depends on these forces as there are no other reformist-minded forces in Georgia. There centrist reformist forces have a single social base, more precisely, the embryo of a social base -- business circles that, no matter by what means they have collected their capital, are in need of assistance and protection as far as their own financial and economic activities are concerned. As regards the elections, it is very difficult to make any forecasts concerning the Georgian population. However, one thing can be said without difficulty: The centrist forces will have a future provided they realistically propose something to the electorate and show that their own activities hold some prospects.
