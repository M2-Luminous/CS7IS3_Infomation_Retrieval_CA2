The second such aircraft will be handed over there a week later. [passage omitted] The details of this unique deal were recounted by A. Brylov, Aeroflot's deputy executive director: "The need to take out a five-year lease on the Boeing 767's was brought about by the fact that the number of transatlantic flights has increased considerably of late, there will be even more of them in the very near future, and our route network to the United States is expanding. We simply do not have the aircraft to service all these routes. After all, routes to San Francisco or Chicago have to be flown by modern, highly comfortable long-haul airliners -- the distances involved are considerable and the passengers want a nonstop service. Otherwise they will use another carrier -- all the more so as the choice of airline on these routes is getting wider and wider. "The appearance of U.S.-made aircraft in the Aeroflot fleet will make our airline more competitive. These are reliable aircraft from the safety angle. They burn far less fuel than the obsolete Il-62's and the not very suitable Il-86's. It is also an important factor that American passengers traditionally place more trust in their own equipment, so this will make them more willing to fly with a Russian carrier. "All this," A. Brylov continued, "is going to allow us to turn flights from the United States from today's loss-makers into a profitable operation -- provided that the government authorities meet Aeroflot halfway and allow it to use the Boeings for five years without having to pay huge customs duties or import tax. During the five years of the Boeing lease, the Russian aircraft industry will be able to substantially increase the number of long-haul Il-96-300's it produces, and the U.S. airliners will be returned to their owner. For the time being, they will be beginning regular flights between Moscow and New York in July."
