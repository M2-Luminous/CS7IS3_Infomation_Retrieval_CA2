The two transportation chambers and the two transportation federations -- Fetracanic [Federation of Nicaraguan Cargo Carriers] and Fetracolnic [Federation of Nicaraguan of Passenger Carriers] -- are holding a meeting on the second floor of the Presidency in an effort to reach agreements to put an end to the problems caused by this strike. Journalists outside the Presidency have been denied access to the meeting on instructions from the Presidency's Public Relations Office. The journalists, however, are waiting for results of the talks. Nevertheless, the strike will not be resolved, at least today, because of the National Transportation Commission's absence. The vehicles that had been blocking the nearby streets were removed this afternoon. Talks are expected to be resumed tomorrow. [passage omitted]
