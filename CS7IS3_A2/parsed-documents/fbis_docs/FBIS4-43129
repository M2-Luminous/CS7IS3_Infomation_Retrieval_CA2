The agreement is scheduled to be signed by EU leaders with Russian President Boris Yeltsin during a European summit on the Greek island of Corfu on Friday and Saturday next week if two last-minute hitches are overcome. "This means that President Yeltsin should be ready to come to Corfu next week to sign," the chairman of the European Union's Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, said. Officials here said that the ministers had reached an "essential political agreement" to wrap up the accord, but that two hitches remained. The Netherlands said it was still waiting for confirmation in writing of a Russian assurance that two Dutch banks already licensed to operate in Russia would be freely allowed to gather Russian clients. And the diplomats said there might not be time to translate the agreement into the European Union's nine official languages and Russian by the time of the summit. In that case, a French official said, President Yeltsin would probably be invited to the Corfu summit to endorse a declaration saying that the agreement was settled and would be signed later when the translations were complete. The sole outstanding problem of substance concerned the European Union's insistence that five EU banks be exempted from a Russian law restricting their right to attract Russian clients in Russia. Two of the banks are Dutch. A Dutch diplomat said the Netherlands was not satisfied with a Russian assurance at the weekend that the exemptions would be granted. "We want it in black and white," he said. The partnership agreement, under negotiation for two years, is a key part of Western attempts to bolster the Russian economy. It offers Russia greater access to the EU market and more political dialogue. It also holds out the prospect of a Russia-European Union free trade zone after 1997 if Moscow has made enough progress towards a market economy by then. Meanwhile, the European Union confirmed that it would sign a similar partnership and cooperation agreement with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on Tuesday. Two accords will be signed -- an overall agreement which faces a lengthy ratification process in Russia, all EU countries and the European Parliament, and an interim economic pact which will come into effect immediately. In separate but related negotiations, the European Union is also trying to persuade Ukraine to close down the dangerous Chernobyl nuclear power station, the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear accident in 1986. The European Union has pledged to help mobilise Western countries to pay the costs of closing down the plant, and partly finance two new nuclear power stations to replace the Chernobyl output. But the two sides have not yet reached agreement on the cost of the Chernobyl closed-down, or the share of the bill to be met by the West.
