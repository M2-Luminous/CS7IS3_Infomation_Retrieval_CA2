FBIS3-49118 "dreeu001__a94038" FBIS-EEU-94-001-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX SLOVAKIA Alliance of Democrats Backs Hofbauer Dismissal AU0301205394 Prague CTK in English 1933 GMT 3 Jan 94 AU0301205394 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava Jan 3 (CTK) -- The Alliance of Slovak Democrats (ADSR), at the forthcoming parliamentary session, will support a Christian Democratic Movement's (KDH) request for the resignation of Minister of Transport and Telecommunications Roman Hofbauer, ADSR Deputy Igor Gazdik told CTK today. Gazdik said the reason for this was Hofbauer's bad performance, especially his callous approach to the removal of bilingual road signs for towns and villages in southern Slovakia and the termination by his ministry of an agreement with Radio Free Europe to broadcast in Slovakia. He said that opposition parties have discussed their course of action in connection with Hofbauer's dismissal as they did in the case of former Health Minister Viliam Sobona. ADSR Deputy Chairman Rudolf Filkus told CTK that the broader government coalition which Slovak President Michal Kovac pleaded for in this New Year's address was a "precondition for the joint resolution of the decisive questions in Slovak society." He said it was not just empty talk that foreign capital was waiting for unambiguous signals of political stabilisation in Slovakia, and that the stability of the government was a necessary step towards political stabilisation. Filkus ruled out the possibility of forming a broader government coalition under the leadership of the current Slovak premier and chairman of the ruling Movement For a Democratic Slovakia, Vladimir Meciar. He said the results of the 1992 parliamentary elections should be taken into consideration while forming a new multi-party coalition. He also said a member of the HZDS would be charged with forming a government in such an event, and that current Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik or Deputy Premier Roman Kovac would be the most appropriate candidates.
