Expressing his sincere wishes for achievements and happiness in the coming year, the Chinese leader points out that 1993 has been a year of success for the Chinese people. "We have seized opportunity, deepened our reforms under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the Party's basic line," Jiang says, adding that great progress has also been made in establishing a socialist market system, as formulated by the 14th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. China is now enjoying a period of economic growth, political stability, national unity and social progress, Jiang says, adding that the policy formulated by the Party and government to develop the economy has proved to be correct. Though China still faces new challenges as she marches ahead, she is determined and confident about overcoming all the obstacles, the Chinese leader tells listeners around the globe. "We begin the new year and face the future with greater confidence and enthusiasm." Looking ahead to China s tasks in the coming year, Jiang says that building socialism with Chinese characteristics demands adherence to the policy of reforms and opening up to the outside world, because "this is the only way to build a modern socialist China, and transform our motherland into a strong, prosperous, democratic and civilized country." The whole Chinese nation hopes to rapidly transform China into a prosperous land, free from poverty and backwardness, Jiang stresses in his speech, adding, "We are an Asian country with 5,000 years of history and a population of 1.1 billion citizens. A prosperous and strong China will not only contribute to the happiness of the Chinese people, but also to all of humanity." China's stability and development cannot be separated from peace, development and prosperity throughout the world. "This relationship is obvious to most of you, I am sure," says Jiang. Turning to the international situation the Chinese leader cites the accelerated process of multi-polarism and the popular wish for co-operation and relaxation of tension. He points out, however, that the Earth is still far from peaceful. "The contradictions in some areas have intensified, resulting in turmoil and armed conflict. Hegemonism and power politics are still a big problem, challenging world peace and development." Under these circumstance, the Chinese Government and people firmly adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy and have contributed to world peace and development, he points out. Noting that China's international prestige has risen remarkably, the Chinese President says, "We have friends all over the world." China will never seek hegemony, he goes on, and its development will not constitute a threat to any country. Jiang pledges that China will continue to develop friendly and co-operative relations with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. "It is the sacred mission of the whole Chinese people including our Taiwan compatriots to complete the unification of the motherland. Unification is also the way China's history is going. "People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are longing for this. Any attempt to create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," and "one China, two governments," goes against the aspirations and fundamental interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. "It is our hope that the Taiwan authorities take all this into consideration, put national interests above all, strive to unify the motherland and, together with the mainland create a more prosperous China," Jiang says. In the speech, the Chinese President notes that the dates when Hong Kong and Macao return to the motherland are approaching. Due to the fact that the British side persists in its wrong stand on the Hong Kong issue, the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong have broken. This is something that the Chinese Government did not want to see. "But no matter what happens, we share the feelings and aspirations of the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. Our policy of 'one country, two systems' will not change, our principal stand of adhering to the Basic Law on Hong Kong will not change, and our resolution to restore China's sovereignty over Hong Kong will not change. "We are fully confident that we have the ability to keep Hong Kong prosperous and stable for a long time to come." Jiang invites more overseas friends and compatriots to visit China in the coming year. Quoting an old Chinese proverb, "It is better to see once than hear a hundred times," Jiang notes that 1994 is the 45th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. "In the coming year, we invite all of you to come to China and see for yourselves. Such contacts will promote mutual understanding, trust and friendship." Jiang concludes his speech by wishing his listeners around the world very Happy New Year.
