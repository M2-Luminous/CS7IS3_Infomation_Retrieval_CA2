We do not set any pre-conditions. I do not think this is a renunciation of our position," Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists at the close of his talks with U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry on Friday morning. The two countries' cooperation in the conversion of the Russian Defence Ministry to civilan production and matters connected with nuclear disarmament, including that of Ukraine, were discussd, Chernomyrdin said. Mr Perry pointed out that Russia would declare its joining NATO's Partnership for Peace programme at the end of March. "This will be a major event in NATO", because its programme will be virtually realised, he said, adding that "Russia is a great nuclear power and it will play a very special role in the Partnership for Peace". The supply of technology to Russia for the manufacture of prefabricated houses for servicemen and for the elimination of chemical weapons was also discussed during the talks with the U.S. defence secretary, Chernomyrdin said. "We have approached closely the problem of eliminating biological weapons as well," the premier noted. Chernomyrdin called for more active cooperation between the two countries under the auspices of the Russian-U.S. Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation Commission which is co-chaired by the Russian premier and U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore. The premier said the commission's regular session is to be held in the U.S. in May.
