We have also believed that settling the crisis can only be achieved by turning a new leaf of national accord, forgetting the past along with all its negative points, and restoring cohesion to the Constitutional institutions in the capital of the state of unity in order to begin the implementation of the clause and provisions of the document in accordance with the timetable and the mechanisms of implementation included in the document. Regrettably, as all the masses of our people know, we were surprised that our brothers in the leadership of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], only few hours after the signing of the document, began to escalate the crisis, militarily, and politically. The military escalation was represented by suspect military moves by the members dominating the YSP leadership toward lofty Abyan Governorate without any justification. Citizens in Abyan were also attacked, particularly in Mudiyah, by the forces moved by the YSP from the Aden and Hadhramaut governorates to Abyan Governorate. The military attack was only stopped by sincere nationalist efforts that led to the joint military committee taking an action, in accordance with an authorization from the president, the GPC secretary general, and the vice president, which was embodied by supervising the return of all the military units to their positions which they were at before 19 August 1993. The military repercussions abated, and the military committee began the implementation of a great part of its agenda. The political escalation was represented by the YSP leadership's refusal to return to Sanaa to assume their responsibilities in order to achieve the cohesion of the political leaderships with their various institutions. Instead of doing so, they began to carry out divisionist actions, to weaken the pledge and accord document, and to circumvent the dialogue committee by setting new impossible and unilateral conditions, demands, and concepts. Today, we were all surprised by the YSP leaderships adopting a new serious course of escalating the crisis politically and militarily. The commander of the central axis in Shabwah, along with the YSP organization's first secretary, issued a warning to the brothers Colonel Dirhim 'Abduh Nu'man, Shabwah governor, and Colonel Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin, director of the Shabwah security department, to quickly leave their offices in the governorate and to return to Sanaa, considering this a party decision, or, otherwise, they shall be held responsible for rejecting this decision. As the brother governor and the brother director of security represented the Constitutional institutions in the region and as decisions to appoint and relieve them are usually made by these institutions and not by the party, they rejected that threat-like warning. On Wednesday morning, the residents of the city of 'Ataq, the capital of the governorate, were surprised when they saw a column of tanks and armored vehicles of units commanded by the renegade and separatist forces in the YSP besiege the governor's office, the Security Directorate, and the entrances to the city with a group of hireling agents led by Ahmad Bin-Farid al-Suraymah. The siege was an attempt to put pressure on these officials. While the GPC regrets annoying our people's sons, who are still enjoying the blessed 'Id al-Fitr holiday, with this disturbing news, it wants to put the people's masses and all its political forces in the picture of what is going on so that they can see by themselves the complicity of the YSP's separatist forces in carrying out the separatist plans. The GPC leaders in Shabwah informed the Military Committee of this regrettable development and urged it to move quickly to lift the siege imposed on the city of 'Ataq, the governor's office, and the Security Directorate; to quickly withdraw the military units taking part in this escalation; and to punish those responsible for sending them. The GPC leadership in Shabwah also urged the Military Committee to withdraw the military units that are still stationed in Shabwah to their original bases in Hadhramaut Governorate and al- Mahrah Governorate. The responsible source added: Thus, it is clear that every time the crisis approached a detente, the YSP aggravated the situation. It has also become clear through the YSP's recent behavior that it is planning to get rid of officials who represent the Constitutional legitimacy in the eastern and southern governorates and to tighten its iron fist on these governorates, which have become a stumbling block in the face of its separatist plans. We in the GPC condemn this behavior and urge the unionist leaders in the YSP to stop these practices, which harm the party in its capacity as a principal partner in the unity, as well as unity itself. We also warn the adventurous and influential leaders in the YSP against continuing their provocations and escalations, and we hold them fully responsible for the consequences of their separatist behaviors. We urge the masses that protest in the various governorates and subdistricts to denounce this new escalation by the YSP.
