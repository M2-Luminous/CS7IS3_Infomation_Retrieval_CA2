FR941004-2-00151 FR941004-2-00087 As of September 15, 1994, the closed-end funds comprising the Index ranged in market capitalization from a low of $118.63 million to a high of $1.294 billion. The average capitalization as of that date was $313.35 million. The closed-end fund accounting for the largest percentage of the total weighting of the Index on that date was the Chile Fund Inc. (16.64%), while the smallest was the Argentina Fund Inc. (5.65%). Calculation The Index is price-weighted and reflects changes in the prices of the components relative to the base date of December 31, 1991. The Index value is calculated by summing the prices of the component securities and then dividing by a divisor that yielded an index value of 100.00 as of that date. The value of the Index at the close on September 15, 1994, was 168.07. The Index will be calculated by CBOE or its designee on a real-time basis using last-scale prices and will be disseminated every 15 seconds by the Exchange. If a component closed-end fund is not currently being traded, the most recent price at which the closed-end fund traded will be used in the Index calculation. Maintenance The Index will be maintained by the Exchange. To maintain continuity in the Index following an adjustment to a component security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to, certain rights issuances. The Exchange states that the Index will be reviewed on approximately a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The Exchange may change the composition of the Index at any time or from time to time to reflect the changes affecting the components of the Index or the emerging Latin American markets generally. If it becomes necessary to remove a component from the Index, every effort will be made to add a closed-end fund that preserves the character of the Index. In such circumstances, the CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement closed-end fund. The Exchange will most likely maintain nine closed-end funds in the Index at all times. Long-Term Index Options In addition to Index options on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange also proposes to list long-term Index option series (``LEAPS'') as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9, and reduced-value Index LEAPS for which the underlying value would be computed at one-tenth (1/10th) of the value of the Index. The current and closing Index value of any such reduced-value Index LEAPS will, after such initial computation, be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Other than the reduced value, all other specifications and calculations for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will remain the same. Exercise and Settlement Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning of the rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules. 9 The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 24.9 to refer specifically to Emerging Latin American Markets Index options. The Exchange states that the proposed Index options would expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus, the last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the expiration date. 9 Under CBOE Rule 24.9, A.M.-settled index options are settled based on an index value derived from opening prices on the last day of trading prior to expiration. Exchange Rules Applicable Except as modified in the proposal, the Rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's Rules regarding narrow-based indexes will be applicable to Index options. 10 Pursuant to Exchange Rule 24.4A, Index option contracts based on the Emerging Latin American Markets Index will be subject to position limits of 7,500 contracts. 11 For purposes of position and exercise limits, Index LEAPS will be aggregated with Index options on a one for one basis. Under the proposal, ten reduced-value Index LEAPS contracts will equal one full-value Index option or Index LEAP for purposes of aggregating positions. The Exchange represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support new options series that would result from the introduction of Index options an Index LEAPS. 10 See Amendment No. 1, supra note 3. 11 Id .
