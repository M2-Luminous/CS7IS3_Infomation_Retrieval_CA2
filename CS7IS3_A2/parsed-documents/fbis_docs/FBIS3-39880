This year, they hope to maintain personnel costs at the level of 19.5 billion German marks (DM). Early in 1993, personnel costs in the east German municipalities were still expected to increase, but this did not happen because many incorporated towns reduced the number of employees at a rate faster than had been anticipated. According to a report on municipal finances by the Deutsche Staedtetag (DST) [Congress of Municipal Authorities], positions were cut primarily at social facilities, particularly day care centers for children. The DST does not anticipate any further salary alignments beyond the present 80 percent of salaries in western Germany. The east German municipalities anticipate per capita personnel costs of DM1,355 or 136 percent of similar costs in western Germany, as heretofore. In all, east German municipalities have budgeted DM62 billion in expenditures for 1994, an increase of 4.5 percent. They anticipate revenues of DM56.5 billion, an increase of 5 percent which represents a DM5.5. billion deficit equal to that in 1993. In 1993, the "German Unity" fund, one of the primary sources of income of the east German laender and municipalities, was increased by DM3.7 billion. The DST criticizes the fact that 40 percent of these funds were not turned over to the east German municipalities as required by law, but instead were given to the new laender for already planned allocations. This also applies to the DM1.5 billion government investment fund. Expected tax revenue of DM5.8 billion for 1994 is likely to equal just 30 percent of the west German level. This is due primarily to the fact that per capita small-business tax revenue is equal to only 15 percent of that collected by west German municipalities. In the case of income tax revenue and real estate taxes, the corresponding ratios are 35 and 53 percent respectively. The report notes a slight increase in current allocations (DM24 billion) and no change in investment allocations at DM9 billion. Current allocations per capita in 1994 are almost twice as high, and investment allocations are three times higher than in western Germany. Estimated income from fees and other charges is expected to decline to 6 percent from the sharp increase of 16.1 percent in 1993. The cities and towns in the new laender are planning for a 5-percent increase in current material costs. Expenditures for social services are expected to rise sharply (71 percent) but will still be appreciably lower than in western Germany. The DST fears that social welfare, the lion's share of social expenditures, will become the "explosive issue in the government budgets" of the new laender during the next few years as it has elsewhere. In contrast to 1993, east German fiscal experts believe that expenditures will grow at a higher rate than revenue this year. As a consequence, eastern Germany's own potential for investment will be reduced and, since more substantial federal and laender subsidies are not expected, they fear it will be impossible to match the high rate of investment of years past. This year investments will total DM18 billion, as against DM18.5 billion in 1993. But in view of the "accelerated decline in investments" by municipalities in western Germany, per capita expenditures for construction in eastern Germany will be twice as high as in the west. After 1994, the east German laender will receive substantially higher transfer payments from the augmented "German Unity" fund of the old laender, since they will be included in the laender financial redistribution program and will also be receiving supplementary federal aid as of 1995. In addition, as provided under investment aid legislation for eastern reconstruction, they will be getting more than DM6.6 billion. In contrast to the legislation governing the "German Unity" fund (which calls for allocating 40 percent to the municipalities), it is up to the land governments to decide how to share the substantially increased income with the municipalities. The DST calls for retaining the 40-percent quota. After all, the west German municipalities are also required to contribute 40 percent of the transfer payments.
