Japan will take suitable steps at the appropriate time, Fujii told a press conference after the day's cabinet meeting. But he denied that Tokyo has contacted other members of the Group of Seven leading nations to discuss the matter. Fujii said the yen's sharp upswing reflects "speculative movements" by currency dealers. Any currency's exchange rate should mirror the country's economic fundamentals, he added. The yen began soaring against the U.S. currency after the collapse of the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks last Friday between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. It surged by 2.56 yen against the dollar in Tokyo on Monday and by a further 2.84 yen to finish Tuesday morning in Tokyo at 102.85 yen to the dollar. Fujii said the government's latest 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package could not produce desired effects unless the yen-dollar rate stayed at levels reflecting each country's economic fundamentals. The G-7 countries had agreed during their gathering last September that rapid exchange rate fluctuations are not desirable for the global economy, he said. Fujii said he had heard nothing about possible U.S. sanctions against Japan in the field of autos and portable telephones. Tokyo should do its utmost to dispel U.S. "misunderstanding" about Japan's trade stance, he said. The finance minister confirmed a newspaper report that he received 10 million yen in political donations from a salt industry group last August. But he said a receipt was made following due accounting procedures.
