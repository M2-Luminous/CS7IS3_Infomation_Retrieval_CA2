Officials in Shushkevich's headquarters told Interfax that the setting up of a monetary union of the two countries would be a major issue the two men will discuss. Observers note that Shushkevich and Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich have significant differences over the economic integration of the two countries. Valery Tsepkalo, an adviser of the Supreme Soviiet chairman, told Interfax that Shushkevich largely shared the views of Stanislav Bogdankevich, Chairman of the National Bank of Belarus, who opposes the signing an agreement on the merger of the monetary systems in the form it was drafted by a bilateral ad hoc team of experts. Valery Dashkevich, an advisor of the National Bank of Belarus (NBB) chairman, told Interfax that his chief "thinks that before a monetary union is established an agreement should be reached on common prices of fuels and basic raw commodities. ... If his view is ignored, the NBB chairman may resign." According to Dashkevich, the NBB chairman will accompany Shushkevich to Moscow. Asked by Interfax whether Shushkevich intended to coordinate with Yeltsin his position in talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Tsepkalo doubted the need in this because, in his view, "Belarus does not have differences with the U.S.A. or Russia."
