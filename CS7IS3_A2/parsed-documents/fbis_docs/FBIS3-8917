Churkin met at the Russian Embassy with Croatian Serb leaders Milan Martic, Slobodan Jarcevic and General Milan Celeketic, declaring afterwards that they had agreed to peace talks in Zagreb next Tuesday [22 March]. Martic, however, said he had agreed to attend the meeting on condition that that the Croatian delegation to the talks be headed by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. The peace talks would mark the first time Serb leaders from the breakaway Krajina region travel to Zagreb since clashes between the two sides began in 1991. The Russian Embassy in Zagreb said Churkin was expected back in Zagreb Wednesday afternoon to discuss the matter with Tudjman. Before leaving Belgrade, however, he was scheduled to hold separate meetings with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency said Karadzic had indicated he would be willing to discuss a proposed federation plan linking Croats and Moslems as long as it did not go counter to Serb interests. The plan calls for Bosnia's Moslems and Croats to merge their territories in a loose Bosnian federation that could eventually be linked with Croatia. Attempts to convince the Serbs to join the U.S.-brokered plan and end more than two years of bloodshed in Bosnia have so far proved fruitless. Churkin, who is Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, and Milosevic met Monday to discuss possible Serb involvement in the proposed federation's constitution. Churkin earlier this week also met Bosnian Serb leaders Momcilo Krajisnik and Nikola Koljevic. The Belgrade daily BORBA said the U.S.-brokered federation plan would be discussed at a meeting here Wednesday involving Milosevic, Karadzic and Martic.
