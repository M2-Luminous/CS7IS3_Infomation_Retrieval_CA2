FR941012-0-00004 FR941012-0-00002 Analysis of Comments A total of 19 entities responded to the proposal. Generally, each respondent supported the proposal and stated that, if adopted, the proposal would eliminate unnecessary and redundant paperwork for both Customs and the trade, would expedite the movement of cargo within port limits, and would be a positive step in simplifying Customs procedures. Of the 19 commenters, seven fully supported the measure. The remaining commenters, although generally supportive of the purpose of the proposed amendments, suggested some changes. Some sought clarification regarding the types of cartage authorized to be performed by the operators of foreign trade zones, centralized examination stations and container stations. Specific comments requesting changes and clarifications and Customs responses are set forth below. Comment: Seven commenters requested that the measure be expanded to include transfers between foreign trade zones and subzones, whether within or adjacent to the same port of entry. Response: The regulations currently provide that cargo movements carried out outside the port limits but within the district boundaries may be accomplished by a bonded carrier. This applies to transfers between foreign trade zones and subzones. The final regulation set forth in this document provides that cargo destined for a foreign trade zone or subzone may be picked up within the district by the operator of the foreign trade zone or subzone to which it is going. This is specified by the new language for §112.2(b). Comment: One commenter requested a more liberal wording of the proposed language for 19 CFR 112.2. The language for 19 CFR 112.2 reads, in part: ``Cartage *␣*␣* may be done under the bond of a cartman, *␣*␣* or, if approved by the district director, a bonded carrier *␣*␣*.'' The commenter felt that the proposed language would still require companies with extensive route systems to submit an application of some sort in every Customs district where they anticipate performing the cartman function. Response: In the future, approval of the bond of a bonded carrier by the district director would indicate approval by Customs for the bonded carrier to engage in cartage. The rule would permit bonded carriers to transfer merchandise within port limits without the need for an application or a cartman or lighterman license; therefore, there is no need to further amend or adopt a more liberal wording of the proposed language in 19 CFR 112.2. Comment: Three commenters requested that 19 U.S.C. 1565 be amended to eliminate the requirement for cartmen licenses for cargo movements into bonded warehouses. They suggested that such an amendment could be accomplished through the Customs Modernization Act. Response: As noted previously in this document, section 666 of Title VI (Customs Modernization) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182) amends 19 U.S.C. 1565 to eliminate the requirement for a cartman's license for cargo movements into bonded warehouses. Any carrier designated as a carrier of bonded merchandise may cart merchandise destined for entry into a bonded warehouse. The final regulation has been amended to reflect the statutory amendment.
