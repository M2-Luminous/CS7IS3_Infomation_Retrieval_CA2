"No matter what economic and other agreements may be signed by the executive, they are difficult to translate into life without a legislative basis which provides a firm foundation," Shumeyko said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS. "This foundation can be created only by the parliaments of the Commonwealth member states. If we learn to consider coordination of legislation of all CIS states at IPA sessions, we shall be able to remove unnecessary barriers hampering the development of market economies and combine the national economies of the Commonwealth member states quite soon. I mean legislation concerning taxes, export/import duties and the customs union," Vladimir Shumeyko said and added that much work was lying ahead. As concerns IPA's political significance, it is also great, according to the assembly chairman. Interparliamentary assemblies have long existed in Europe and Asia, he said. Now an Interparliamentary Assembly has also appeared on the territory of the former Soviet Union. "It must have a significant weight in the world because is has brought together countries which have embarked on the path of democratic reforms," Shumeyko said. He stressed the need of establishing contacts with other, older interparliamentary assemblies.
