Speaking in the State Duma (the lower house of the Russian Parliament) Panov said his ministry was implementing plans to strengthen bilateral ties with China and bring Russian-Chinese relations to a level of constructive partnership. Panov, who is in charge of Asian affairs and a former ambassador to South Korea, dwelt at length on problems in Russian-Chinese relations, cautioning about the massive Chinese immigration into Russia. He noted that a current agreement drastically cuts the number of people entitled to a visa-free entry to Russia. In the light of the acute border issue which exists between the two, a joint Russian-Chinese commission is now actively working to resolve questions on ownership of disputed islands on border rivers. Panov also told the State Duma that talks are in progress to agree on cutting the strength of Russian and Chinese troops in border areas. He said he believed the infrastructure of the Russian-Chinese border should be further developed to promote trade and economic cooperation, adding that the turnover of border trade totalled 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. The deputy minister also stressed the need to help the modernization of Chinese industrial enterprises built with Soviet assistance in the 1950s.
