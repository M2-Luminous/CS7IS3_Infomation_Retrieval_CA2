Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says: What they are doing is a disgusting act of a political charlatan who causes illness and then administers medicine. Since the puppets declared rice market opening, they must take measures to block the unrestricted flooding of American agricultural products such as building a higher customs barrier, if they want to prevent losses from it. But a "meeting of ministers concerned" of the puppet administration did not discuss such active measures but put on the order of the day "support" to agriculture through the collection of a new "special tax" and establishment of an "advisory body". What effect would such "measures" of the puppets have? In fact, this is an act to cut the lifeline of the 6 million peasants by market opening and kill all the people by forcing a "special tax" on them under the pretext of "support" to them. It is impossible that the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a top- class flunkeyist who did not hesitate to open the rice market of South Korea to win the favour of his U.S. master, takes a measure to defend the South Korean peasants and agriculture in disregard of the interests of his master. The Kim Yong-sam group's talk about "measures" and the like is aimed at creating the impression that it is concerned over the peasants suffering losses and thus lulling their ever-growing grievances and bridging over the worsening crisis of its rule.
