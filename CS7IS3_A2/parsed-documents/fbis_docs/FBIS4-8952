A new mid-size L-610 aircraft for 40 passengers has been developed since 1983 in these companies, which, according to the aviation industry restructuring program, are not expected to remain in the Aero holding. The cost of the development to date amounts to approximately Kc3-4 billion, and experts estimate that overall completion, including U.S. international certification, would cost another Kc1.5 billion. In this instance, it would be possible to start aircraft deliveries to potential customers in 1996. At this time, there are two prototypes of the "610" tested--the L-610 G, with General Electric CT7 engines in Let Kunovice, and the L-610 MX05, with Walter M602 engines from Prague Motorlet being tested by the Czech Army. The civilian aircraft manufacturer, Kunovice Let Co., cannot afford to operate this prototype. If development of the Czech civilian aviation continues in the direction taken, both prototypes will end up in the same place---the Kbely Aviation Museum. If the military part of the aviation industry (the L-39 and L-59 production) is referred to as one with good marketing prospects, it is, above all, because of the initiative of Aero Vodochody management. If the official material finds that the civilian part of the aviation industry has no chance of survival, it is because no one has thought of an aggressive marketing policy. At the same time, many experts believe that the marketing prospects for civilian production are at least as good as for the military one, and it is economically more effective. According to marketing surveys conducted outside the official management structures, there are realistic chances for a long-term workload of the civilian aviation firms based on the sales of large series of L-420 or L-610 aircraft in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and on the traditional markets of the former Soviet Union. According to the estimates of the firm Saab, until the year 2000, the world demand for midsize aircraft is approximately 1,300 units. This most likely does not include the potential marketing possibilities in the republics of the former USSR, where the service lives of approximately 2,000 Jak-40 and An-24 aircraft are coming to an end, so that the overall demand comes to approximately 3,000 machines. There is no manufacturer in the world that could independently satisfy this demand. Moreover, in the difficult operational conditions in these territories, no competition can stand up to the Czech aircraft. In addition, thanks to the comparative advantage of the Czech economy provided by the cheap labor and the production input, in comparison with the world standard, the development cost comes to about one-quarter. The preliminary sales price of the L-610 comes to approximately $9 million, while the comparable Regional Jet costs $14-15 million and the Saab-Scania-2000 more than $12 million. (If we add the cost of the operation of the aircraft, which includes the price of engines--because their lifespan is shorter than that of the airframe--the instruments, spare parts, and complete overhauls, the total purchase price of the aircraft comes to approximately two and a half to three times as much). With annual sales of 30 L-410 or L-420 aircraft and 12 L-610 M or G Let, Kunovice and Motorlet Praha can show profit and begin to pay off their debts. From this vantage point, the debt burden does not appear to be so tragic, although it amounts to Kc1.31 billion debt to banks and Kc1.85 billion to the Aero holding in the case of Let Kunovice, while its equity totals Kc1.07 billion. And, in the instance of Motorlet--an equity of Kc1.55 billion--the debt has reached Kc0.8 billion to banks and Kc0.1 billion to the holding. Even if we also take into account the debt to the state treasury and suppliers (they are partially covered by the unfinished production), both firms could be paying off their debts beginning in 1996. Moreover, it would mean the preservation of the production opportunities and, by extension, jobs in cooperating enterprises. The views have been voiced in expert circles, including managerial ones, that, except for the interests of the Investicni a Postovni Banka (IPB), or, as the case may be, other creditors of Aero holding from the banking sector, who logically are not interested in a business venture with aviation production but, rather, in a speedy return of the missing hundreds of millions to the bankers' parental care, there is no real reason for one of the few areas in which Czech industry is absolutely capable of competing in the world markets to be sold abroad below value and with uncertain results. Because the aviation industry has been and still is, above all, in the hands of the state, there is no need to search laboriously for the bearer of specific responsibility for the present situation and ignorance of what is coming. The government that recommended the implementation of the conclusions from the 8 March 1994 meeting of economy ministers on restructuring the aviation industry in fact only officially endorsed what has been happening for the past nine months on the initiative of the IPB, which, although not a shareholder, has a majority on the aviation holding board. No other principal decision on the part of the major owner has been adopted. The situation in the aviation industry after 1990 can be described as waiting for privatization, which, in turn, with respect to the current knowledge, can be termed jumbled. Under these circumstances, the decision to sell certainly is a welcome opportunity for the government to rid itself of a hot potato, but, except for the so-far-uncertain amount to go to the creditors' pockets, it does not solve the problem. Even though the decision to capitalize the Aero holding debts may not be ideal, it certainly represents a possibility of further development for its military part. This chance was denied to the civilian sector, although no real argument has been given explaining why this sector should not have just as good prospects and why the property of the coupon privatization investors, who invested in the first wave of privatization in aviation as a whole, should not thereby appreciate. While the decisionmaking on the future of Czech breweries, the auto manufacturing industry, and china production took place or is taking place with media--and thereby public--participation, the demise of civilian aviation production in the Czech Republic should most likely be quiet and without pathos.
