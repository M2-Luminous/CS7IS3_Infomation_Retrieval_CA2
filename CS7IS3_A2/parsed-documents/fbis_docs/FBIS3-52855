Major General Dani Rothschild, coordinator of government activities in the territories, presented the ministers with a gloomy report on the territories. The economic situation there is deteriorating, Arab laborers are not being employed within the Green Line, there are difficulties in exporting agricultural produce, and the promises to send funds to the territories have not been met. The clear outcome of all this is an erosion of support for the Israeli-PLO agreement. We must remind you that the Taba talks resume tomorrow against that gloomy background, and they will be extensive, at least according to Minister Yosi Sarid: [Begin Sarid recording] I heard optimistic evaluations by PLO spokesmen about the talks lasting two or three weeks. I would gladly join in their optimism, but knowing all the problems from close up, I am not so sure that we are talking about two or three weeks. I would be very pleased if that happens, but I believe that six to eight weeks is more reasonable. If I am proved wrong, I will be the first to be pleased. [end recording] Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer hopes an agreement will be reached in Taba. [Begin Ben-Eli'ezer recording] The message that emerges from the cabinet meeting is that we welcome the resumption of the talks, and hope with all our hearts that this time the Palestinians will realize that time is critical and that Israel is not prepared to give up one iota on security-related issues. At the same time, however, we want to enter into talks which will lead to the implementation of the agreement. [end recording] We should recall the remarks made by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres a week ago. He said that Israel will not bank on the issues on which agreement was reached in Cairo -- the scope of the withdrawal in Jericho and the procedures for border crossings at the bridges. Shim'on Shetrit referred to the bazaar atmosphere that characterizes the negotiations and makes progress very difficult. He said the Palestinians do not understand that a handshake and oral agreements are binding. [Begin Shetrit recording] In the future, I hope that those who conduct the negotiations will understand that we are dealing with an eastern bazaar, in which the other side tries to extract as much as possible all the time. Second, in reference to the formal procedure of approval by the other side, we need Yasir 'Arafat's signature on the document, otherwise he will say it is not binding. [end recording] To return to Minister Sarid, who referred to the reports about an intention to uproot settlements, and specifically the plan to uproot Netzarim. [Begin Sarid recording] I do not know what will happen in the future, but I know -- and say so in the most authoritative way -- that in the current Jericho-Gaza First negotiations there is no talk about transferring or uprooting settlements. Therefore, any report that says otherwise is baseless. [end recording] In other words, the government plans to leave Netzarim where it is at this stage. Something else raised in the cabinet meeting were trips to China, which has become the most attractive destination for ministers. Foreign Minister Peres criticized his colleagues for going there en masse. Those who have so far been there are Rabin, Peres, and Ben-Eli'ezer, while those planning to go are Mikha Harish, Avraham Shohat, and Shim'on Shetrit. We will wait and see if Peres' call works.
