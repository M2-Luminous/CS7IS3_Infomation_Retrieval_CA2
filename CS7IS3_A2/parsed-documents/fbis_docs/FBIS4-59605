Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and southern forces backing Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid were locked in a grim struggle for al-Dali', which lies near the former border between the old North and South Yemen. The Sanaa authorities announced Thursday said the town had fallen, and a military spokesman said here Friday that "pockets of resistance" were being mopped up. Northern reinforcements had been dispatched to al-Dali', which lies 90 kilometres (50 miles) north of Aden on a key road to a southern air base. But military sources in Aden said southern troops had launched a counter-offensive and recaptured some positions around al-Dali'. There was also another battle underway in the Kharaz region, 120 kilometres (75 miles) west of Aden. The defence ministry in Sanaa said northern forces were advancing and had inflicted heavy losses on a rival armoured brigade. But as the rival communiques continued to fly, southern commander Colonel 'Ali Qasim Talib said that the northern offensive through Kharaz had been beaten back and the region was controlled by al- Bid's men. And as the fighting raged on, an Arab League mission was due to hold urgent talks with Salih. Muhammad Bayraqdar, the league's military affairs chief, urged Yemen's leaders to "immediately halt" the fighting and open a dialogue, which they have so far refused to do. He was to give the president a message to that effect from the League secretary-general, Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. Salih and his northern leadership decided to oust al-Bid as vice president last week and sacked several southern ministers, branding them "secessionists" who should be put on trial. Al-Bid's side in the meantime has demanded the withdrawal of northern forces from the south. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd has spoken by telephone with both Salih and al-Bid, and Gulf states have issued appeals for an end to the fighting, which has shattered the fragile unity of Yemen, an impoverished country on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula.
