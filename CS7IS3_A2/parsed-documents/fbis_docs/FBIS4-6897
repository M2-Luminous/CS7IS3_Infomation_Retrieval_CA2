"We've established very good relations with Japan. If there are any changes, it should be for the better," she said. Hata, foreign minister under Morihiro Hosokawa, was elected Monday by the Diet to succeed Hosokawa, who announced April 8 he was quitting over his personal financial dealings. Rafidah said she has met Hata several times, most recently at this month's signing of the Uruguay Round world trade pact in Marrakech, Morocco, where "I remember teasing him about being the next prime minister." She said she felt Hata is fully aware of the ramifications of the Uruguay Round's policies to Free World trade and all other elements of international trading matters. Asked if she hopes Hata will back the idea of an East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC), proposed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, Rafidah said he should not be "burdened" with the issue so soon in his term of office. But she expressed confidence the EAEC will be seen "favorably" in Japan if it is recognized as a loose, consultative forum to enhance regional economic cooperation. The six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Malaysia, is anxious to get Japan, as East Asia's economic powerhouse, into the EAEC. But Japan and such other potential members as South Korea are noncommittal in the face of a cool response from the United States, which would be excluded and which views the EAEC as a trade bloc.
