Duma Not Yet in Session, but Confrontation Already Growing"] [Text] It looks as if the renewal of parliament is not going to bring about a reconciliation. Reports are filtering through, little by little, about the maneuverings and dealings being conducted by the leaders of political parties and blocs on the eve of the State Duma's commencement of work. This was discussed in the item headed "Party Sword Hangs Over Duma" (ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA for 4 January). Since its publication the independent deputies' fears have been confirmed, and they are being excluded from the formulation of major decisions on the Federal Assembly organizing committee. And now the newly formed Interregional Association of Independent Deputies has issued a trenchant statement. The editorial office asked Gennadiy Kalistratov and Sergey Voskholov, members of the organizing committee of the association of "independents," to comment on this move. "The statement was prompted by the fact that, for some reason, only the eight parties that crossed the 5-percent barrier have voting rights on the Federal Assembly organizing committee which is currently in session in the Kremlin making organizational preparations for the first steps in the State Duma's work. Our association, which was formed back in December, not only has no voting rights, but is being totally ignored, as if we did not exist. Absurd views are being expressed: that the political ideas and guidelines have already been formulated by the parties, while the independent deputies elected in the regions for single-seat districts are, so to speak, deliberately outside politics; your job, they tell us, is to work in the committees. "Readers may think that we are inflicting petty parliamentary squabbles on the public. But no, this is a serious matter. This public denigration of the status of independent deputies compared with those who got in on the party lists prompts great anxiety. "It is ridiculous to hear it said that the 'independents' are apolitical. True, they did not support a single political doctrine, but they are united on another, politically significant principle: 'The revival of Russia through the revival of the regions.' It is no accident that S. Shakhray has begun to show a keen interest in us, with his fundamental principle of emphasis on the regions. "The parties' leaders realized that by uniting, the independent deputies -- there are 140 of us -- would become an influential force that could decide the passage of questions in parliament. The subsequent actions, alas, bordered on foul play. The parties' electoral associations described themselves as factions and declared that all other associations of deputies can be nothing more than groups. What a ludicrous initiative! It cannot be so, because factions have substantial procedural advantages over other types of associations of deputies, beginning with the power of diktat in the formation of the Duma's leadership organs. And that, of course, is the plan -- to secure those advantages. Therefore our association of 'independents' has firmly declared its intention to register as a faction (of course, the faction of 'independents' will be distinguished by the absence of any kind of internal discipline or compulsion for the deputies belonging to it). "When we 'independents' were elected, we never even thought about uniting to form some kind of wing. But in the light of this turn of events, more than 50 deputies from the regions (and 15 more have confirmed their desire to join us) got together and decided not to be fragmented in the parliament hall, but together to defend the stability of the Duma against unilateral party actions. "Hand on heart, we say: This is really no time to engage in this struggle. Some 150 laws are already being examined, and must be seriously studied and adopted. It is necessary without delay to establish cooperation between parliament, the government, and the Central Bank, so as to continue to pursue economic reform, but without shock. "Hence our statement. We demand that the formation of the Duma's leadership and working organs proceed not on the party principle, but on the faction principle, and that an obligatory secret ballot is used, ruling out the system of voting by 'packages' of proposals and lists of candidacies, as they are now trying to compel us to do."
