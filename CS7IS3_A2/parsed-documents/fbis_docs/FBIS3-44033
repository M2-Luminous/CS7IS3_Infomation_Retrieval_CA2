Diplomats attributed the lull in the fighting to heavy overnight rains, but said they believed the factions were still holding their positions. Meanwhile South Africa's foreign minister, Mr. Pik Botha, has ruled out his country's immediate military intervention in Lesotho, where rival army groups have been engaging in sporadic fighting for the past 10 days. This follows an appeal by Lesotho's prime minister, Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle, to President Frederick de Klerk to send in a peace keeping force to help stabilize Lesotho. But in a radio interview in Johannesburg today Mr. Botha said while South African troops had been asked to keep a close watch on the border in case of a spill over effect, there were no immediate plans to cross into Lesotho. He said the sending of troops to Lesotho would reduce the number of security forces which are needed more inside South Africa. He said in the meantime he had sent reports to the secretary generals of the United Nations, the Commonwealth, and Organization of African Unity to make sure they realize the situation may deteriorate and may eventually end up as another Somalia.
