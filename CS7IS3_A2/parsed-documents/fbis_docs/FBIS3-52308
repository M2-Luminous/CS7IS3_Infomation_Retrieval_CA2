In an interview with AL-AHRAM today, Tuesday, she said: As a sign of goodwill, we gave Egypt a map with details of the huge resources that are hidden under the Sinai sands, but we found out that Egypt has a similar map and knows everything about the Sinai's resources. She expressed pleasure at the telephone links between Israel and all the Arab countries and noted that any citizen in any Arab country can talk directly to anyone in Israel. On the failure of starting the planned Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, she said: We are actually ready to implement our obligations in the Gaza-Jericho Accord and for the Palestinians to begin to handle their affairs in the self-rule areas by themselves. But she noted differences in views on this issue between the government, which wants peace, and others who do not want peace, as she put it. She said she accepts giving up all the territories occupied after the 1967 war and that the Palestinians have the right to establish their state in the West Bank and Gaza. However, she remarked that this is not the government's view. Replying to a question on reports that Israel and Jordan have reached an unannounced peace agreement, she said that an agreement in principle has actually been reached with Jordan and that King Husayn is awaiting developments in the negotiations with Syria before announcing the agreement. The Israeli minister said negotiations with Syria will begin very soon. She affirmed Israel's readiness to give up the Golan if President Hafiz al-Asad is willing to establish a genuine peace.
