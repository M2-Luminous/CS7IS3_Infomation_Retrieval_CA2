Amid the roaring explosions, perhaps caused by the bullets and shells fired from various light, medium, and heavy weapons, the streets of the city and the surrounding villages became empty of pedestrians and citizens, who sought refuge in their homes. As a result, panic prevailed in the region. It was later discovered that the source of the explosions was the Ba-Suhayb camp, south of the city, and that forces in the camp arbitrarily fired shells toward the inhabited mountains and some government departments in Dhamar, including the Dhamar governorship, the governorate's security department, and other government offices. The shelling also included the headquarters of the Central Security Forces and the Republican Guard, whose personnel maintained complete calm and self- restraint to avoid any escalation. When, after more than an hour, the powerful explosions and firing of bullets stopped, and in light of the contacts and investigations that were held by competent authorities in the govenorate, it was revealed that guards at the camp's gate had been arbitrarily fired at by an unidentified speeding red sedan. None of the guards was injured. Immediately, the camp's troops mobilized their armored vehicles, various types of machine guns, and a tanks battalion, which assumed an offensive posture. Then, the region was set alight when the troops fired hundreds of shells, as explained above. The security source added: According to all the available information and contacts that have been held by competent authorities there was no acceptable justification for such an irresponsible act by the Ba-Suhayb troops. The source added: We warn against the gravity of that act which aims at disturbing the national security, stability, and social and political safety. We warn against the gravity of committing such provocations. We demand that the joint military committee expeditiously investigates all the circumstances of this incident and informs the people of the entire truth. God testifies to our true intentions.
