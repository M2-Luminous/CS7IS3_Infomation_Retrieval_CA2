He spoke as he was entering the talks here, and said he would tell the Bosnian and Croatian delegations his conditions for proceeding. Karadzic looked drawn as he entered the UN headquarters. The Bosnian Serbs were threatened Wednesday with NATO air strikes if they do not withdraw their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo by February 21. "I just want to say that we are not going to go on with the conference until we get an international investigatory body to investigate and resolve the Sarajevo massacre," Karadzic told reporters as he went in for talks with mainly Moslem Bosnian Government and Bosnian Croat delegations. UN forces in Sarajevo have said a bombing Friday in Sarajevo that killed eight people was carried out by Serb artillery but have not determined who was responsible for the Saturday attack in a Sarajevo market that left 68 dead and aroused the ire of the international community. "I would remind you that Moslems have stage-managed the killing in the bread queue killing 18 of their own people," he said, referring to a previous civilian bombing in Sarajevo for which the Moslems and Serbs each blame each other. He also said the Moslems were responsible for shooting down an Italian plane in September 1992. Karadzic said the problem was that only Yugoslavia "got sanctions" after these incidents. "We don't have any reason to go on with the conference until we get a commission to investigate evidence in single circumstances and to say publicly who is responsible for this massacre," Karadzic said. He said he would tell the Bosnian and Croatian delegations: "We are going to tell them we demand an investigatory body to get findings and to make this public."
