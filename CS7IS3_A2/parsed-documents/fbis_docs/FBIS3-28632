However, on the other hand, it has brought about an adverse effect of triggering North Korea to excessively adhere to its nuclear development. In other words, this points out that the Team Spirit exercise is not always advantageous for the long-term security of the Korean peninsula. Such a notion has been brought up not only by the Chinese authorities but also by ROK and U.S. officials stationed in Beijing. Even though the notion is a minority opinion, it points out the need to map out a new view on security to countermeasure the changing situation in Northeast Asia. A U.S. official, who has closely watched the North Korean situation, said: "Ever since the nuclear issue has come to the fore, many discussions and analyses took place among U.S. defense and intelligence authorities over the background behind North Korea's adherence to the nuclear weapons and the actual capability of the North Korean nuclear arms," and added that "During the course of those discussions, some believed that the Team Spirit exercise, a ROK-U.S. joint exercise simulating actual warfare, is not always beneficial to the Korean peninsula's security." He then continued saying: "After seeing the United States, a super power, staging a three dimensional exercise simulating actual warfare staged annually with its main land forces and materials, North Korea may have figured out that it must have nuclear weapons even it means sacrifice," and pointed out "The Kim Il-song group is afraid of the U.S. power since it experienced a serious defeat from the United States in the Korean war which it provoked." A ROK official, who is well informed of the North Korean situation, said: "After the ROK normalized ties with China, it gave me a better chance to observe North Korea `more closely' via China and, through my observations, I came to realize how much North Korea is afraid of the Team Spirit exercise," and added that "I think the newly established situation in Northeast Asia propels us to think about a regional security group that includes North Korea, or at least a type of security that does not provoke the other party so as to prevent it from coming out with a more fierce counteroffense." The Chinese side has also expressed to the ROK through various channels that "As regards to the nuclear issue, the biggest stumbling block for China to persuade North Korea is a joint military demonstration, such as Team Spirit exercise."
