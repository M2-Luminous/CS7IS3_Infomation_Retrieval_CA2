FBIS4-30080 "dreas121_a_94027" FBIS-EAS-94-121 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Tax Commission Presents Report to Hata Tax Commission Presents Report to Hata OW2106143994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1419 GMT 21 Jun 94 OW2106143994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- A government advisory panel issued a report Tuesday [21 June] that offered no specific figures, but broad options to enable the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to decide quickly on globally promised tax reform while avoiding unnecessary political disputes. Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, handed the report to Hata, leaving sufficient time for the government and the ruling coalition parties to keep promises made in the March market-opening package. The promises were to detail tax reform, including continuation of 5.5 trillion yen income tax cuts, now limited to the current year, by the end of this month. Enactment into law is seen by the yearend. The report calls for a net revenue surplus to fund an expected increase in welfare spending amid a graying society in the 21st century by raising the consumption tax to more than offset "permanent" tax cuts. On specific figures and dates, the advisory panel to the prime minister indirectly endorsed "mechanical calculations" prepared by the Finance Ministry on revenue estimates in fiscal 2001 under the proposed tax reform. The estimates, also provided to the ruling parties, showed that only a tax increase to 7 percent or more would secure extra revenue. The figure is based on income from tax cuts worth 6.2 trillion yen and 10-to 20-year redemption for stopgap bonds for a three-year lag between the continued cuts and a tax hike in April 1997. But the panel also offered tacit acceptance of a tax hike below 6 percent, saying that specific figures and dates rest on efforts to conduct fiscal and administrative overhauls to win taxpayers' support. "The limit under the current fiscal condition is a rise to 7 percent, and most panel members agreed on this," Kato told a news meeting after handing over the report. But he added a tax increase of 6 percent or less is an option if the prime minister can come up with a strong plan for fiscal and administrative reforms. The report also notes some panel members would accept a stage plan of limiting the tax hike and leaving the issue of net revenue surplus for further discussions. "That's why we made unusual commitments as the Tax Commission to external discussions led by the fiscal and administrative reforms," Kato said. The report urges the government to map out "medium-term numerical targets and programs" on such reform and to review the income and consumption tax systems for more fairness. The panel's inclination to exclude concrete figures apparently stemmed from mounting uncertainties on the political side, with the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party poised to launch a no- confidence motion against Hata's minority government. Moreover, the tax hike is an extremely delicate issue for the Social Democratic Party, which split from the ruling coalition in April, resulting in a minority government. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said his ministry wants the government and ruling parties to include concrete figures and dates for the tax hike and to write the reform into bills by the end of the month. Meanwhile, the ruling coalition's tax forum issued its tax reform report, also leaving out specific figures for the cuts and hike while calling for a heavier burden on taxpayers to cope with the aging society and administrative reforms. The forum handed the report to the coalition's policymaking group of top representatives. As for ways to cut income taxes, both reports call for easing burdens on the medium-income brackets of 7 to 10 million yen, but differed on whether to lower the ceiling for the maximum tax rate. As for a regional consumption tax, both reports put it aside for further talks.
