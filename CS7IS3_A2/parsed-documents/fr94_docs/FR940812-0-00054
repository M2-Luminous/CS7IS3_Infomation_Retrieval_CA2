FR940812-0-00054 FR940812-0-00016 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 41 CFR Part 101&hyph;38 RIN 3090&hyph;AF49 [FPMR Amendment G&hyph;108] Motor Vehicles AGENCY: Federal Supply Service, GSA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This regulation adds the license plate code EC for the United States Enrichment Corporation, implements the Standard Form (SF) 149A, U.S. Government Fleet Credit Card, and removes illustrations of forms. The new license plate code was requested by the U.S. Enrichment Corporation and approved by the General Services Administration. The SF 149A was developed to take advantage of electronic technology at vehicle fleet service activities. Illustrations of forms in this regulation have been deemed unnecessary by the General Services Administration in most circumstances. These actions will allow the U.S. Enrichment Corporation to procure motor vehicle license plates showing the code designation EC, allow for the use of SF 149A, and remove unnecessary material from the regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael W. Moses, Fleet Management Division (703&hyph;305&hyph;6273). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this rule is not a significant rule for the purposes of Executive Order 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act This final rule is not required to be published in the Federal Register for notice and comment. Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply. The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 as a wholly-owned Government corporation with the mission of managing the Government's Uranium Enrichment Enterprise (formerly a part of the Department of Energy). On September 14, 1993, the USEC requested that license plate code EC be approved for use on all license plates assigned to their motor vehicle fleet. This request was approved by the General Services Administration on October 1, 1993. The SF 149A is a magnetic stripe credit card issued by GSA under a single source, requirements contract. The SF 149A will be accepted at Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) authorized vendor electronic point of sale (EPOS) terminals throughout the United States (48 contiguous States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico). The SF 149A contains an encoded magnetic stripe read by electronic point of sale terminals that activate fuel pumping equipment. EPOS vendors will provide the date and place of purchase, purchase type, fuel and non-fuel type, and service level codes ( i.e. , full and self service) in addition to the dollar value of each transaction. Federal agencies with motor vehicles managed by the GSA Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS) will be issued the SF 149A automatically as part of a mass re-issue beginning in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 1994. GSA will continue to issue the SF 149, U.S. Government National Credit Card, to non-IFMS agencies. Credit card charges for the SF 149 will continue to be processed manually at vendor facilities. GSA intends to gradually phase out the SF 149, but will maintain the SF 149 and the SF 149A until all non-IFMS fleet managers are participating in the EPOS program using the SF 149A. Federal Government agency fleet managers that manage their agency-owned fleets may obtain the electronically accepted SF 149A by notifying the General Services Administration, Attn: FBF, Washington, DC 20406.
