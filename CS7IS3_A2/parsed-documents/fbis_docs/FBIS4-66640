Or, is she a spokesperson for Pakistani terrorists? One cannot but help entertain such doubts going by the authoritative, often contradictory, statements issued by her. It is totally unbecoming of a representative of the world's most powerful country to ape Jack Nicholson, the Joker. Ms. Raphel, by her intemperate and totally immature utterances is playing havoc with the destinies of millions of citizens in the subcontinent. Ms. Raphel feels that a "lot of human rights abuses are still occurring in Kashmir both on the part of the militants and the security forces. While recent steps by the Government of India had increased accountability, the improvement has yet to be reflected on the ground". Her concern for human rights is most touching. We too feel concerned at the impunity with which human rights violations take place in the so-called land of global democrats, the United States of America. Ms. Raphel's obsession with matters Asian seem to preclude her understanding of naked home truths. The Human Rights Watch, an American human rights organisation, rapped in its report recently the United States for `non-compliance' with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The report, a joint undertaking of the major US Constitutional Rights Organisation and the largest US-based international human rights group, regularly quoted by the state department when it criticises other countries, was prompted by the ratification of the ICCPR by the US in 1992, 25 years after its adoption by the United Nations. The Human Rights Watch executive director, Mr. Kenneth Roth, had this to say: "The US government regularly condemns human rights abuses in other countries, but has done little to apply international human rights law in the country. We issue this report in the hope of breaking the cynical view of international human rights law as a source of protection only for those outside the US borders. This report demonstrates that violations are happening on the US soil as well". The report identified nine substantive areas in which the US `falls short of international standards'. For the benign education of Ms. Raphel, some of the sticking points of the report are: the US routinely violates Article 10 of the ICCPR which requires that all prisoners and detainees be treated with humanity and respect to the inherent dignity of the human person; Article 10 is also violated by many of the techniques and punishments of `super-maximum security' facilities where for example, prisoners may pass years without breathing outside air or may be forced to eat their meals like a dog, with hands tied behind their backs; the anti-discrimination requirement of Article 26 is violated by the unequal treatment of women prisoners, who receive fewer recreational, vocational and educational opportunities than their male counterparts; although US legal protection against race discrimination is generally adequate by ICCPR standards, in practice legal safeguards go largely ignored. Educational segregation and unequal conditions of schooling persist. Public and private housing are rife with segregation and discrimination. The report says that it finds "significant shortcomings in the US record, from the summary repatriation of Haitian Boat People (refugees fleeing to the US from Haiti in leaking boats) to the brutal treatment of prisoners in the US". So much for Ms. Raphel's concern for human rights! If the Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia has been making a spectacle of herself, the contribution to such humour has been quite significant from India's leadership. We have been defensive all through. Any Tom, Dick and Harry can level accusations against India and get away with it. All that we seem to do is defend, defend and defend. The inability of the foreign policy makers to come out of cocooned non-alignment thinking, and their inability to define India's self-interest clearly has led even terrorist exporting countries like Pakistan and habitual offenders of human rights like Iran to mouthings on human rights. Recognition of this fact, belated though, has come in the form of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's bold statement to recast India's defence policy if Pressler Amendment is dropped against Pakistan. Only the naive and ignorant will be fooled by the US stand that a one-time waiver of Pressler Amendment is not harmful. For the United States, the bottomline of Lockheed Corporation manufacturing the dreaded F-16s is more important than the welfare of India, Pakistan or its one billion humans. That is the truth, fair and simple.
