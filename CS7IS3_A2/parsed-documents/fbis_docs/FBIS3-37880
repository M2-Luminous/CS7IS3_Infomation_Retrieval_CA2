What is your attitude toward it? [Karpenka] The decision to initiate a strike belongs to the workers and strike committees. If they believe that this can change the government's policy and improve the lives of their families, they are free to choose any form of fighting for their rights that does not contradict the constitution. There is hardly anybody today who believes that working people have no cause to worry about their current and especially their future situation. Prices are growing; social guarantees equal zero; pensioners are poverty stricken; the economy is on the verge of collapse. Once we presume that this is a normal state of things, then of course strikes are groundless. In my opinion, it is very bad that some political activists and officials who have been paying lip-service to protecting people's rights, reacted very negatively to workers' actions and resorted to indecent and rough attacks against those who, unlike these officials, are living through hard times. At the same time, I feel sorry that people from various political parties have been trying to win control over just and rightful action launched by the workers, and "reap profits" for their own needs. With regard to the eventual scenario of the strike, I believe that if the economic decline is accompanied by officials' passiveness, as has been done thus far, the number of those dissatisfied will continue to grow. [Syarhiyevskiy] Today, the Belarusian leaders do not conceal that they believe a union with Russia is the only possible way to overcome the crisis. What is your opinion? [Karpenka] Three and even two years ago we could have chosen alternate ways of building an independent economy. However, the Supreme Soviet overtly ignored economic problems and this, along with a certain inactivity on the part of the government, has led to stagnation and then, a crisis that may become a catastrophe. The issue is very complex and that is why I would like to be brief. We will not be able to do without a close economic union with Russia. Here are two examples from my work as chairman of the Molodechno City Council. By means of direct "negotiations" with Russian entrepreneurs, we received fuel and the city was able to live through the winter. It is quite warm in houses, schools, and hospitals. Now, we are thinking about the future and again, Russians are our only hope, because we are holding talks on purchasing flour from the farmers of Kuban. By projecting the problems of Molodechno on the entire state, we come to the conclusion that Belarus is closely intertwined with Russia. However, while signing any agreements and joining any unions, we should first of all think about the nation and not ourselves, and remember that our state is the only place that we have and that was given to us by God. Our grandchildren will not forgive us if we give up independence and sovereignty. Meanwhile, we see that certain political groups in both Belarus and Russia, including some Duma deputies, want this to happen. [Syarhiyevskiy] What does the session have in store for us? [Karpenka] I believe that it will put an end to senseless confrontation that has undermined the electorate's trust in the deputies' corps. We should honestly analyze the results of our work, adopt a constitution, and dissolve the legislature.
