FR940303-2-00069 FR940303-2-00054 Submission of Proposed Information Collection to OMB Proposal: Request for expedited approval of a survey needed to complete a report to Congress on the use of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds in promoting the development of microenterprises. Office: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. Description of the Need for the Information and Its Proposed Use: In the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550), Congress directed that HUD report on the effectiveness of CDBG funds in promoting the development of microenterprises [Section 807(C)(4)]. This report is due to Congress the end of April, 1994 (within eighteen months after date of enactment of the Act). The report is to contain not only an analysis of the effectiveness of the use of CDBG funds in promoting the development of microenterprises, but a review of any statutory or regulatory provisions that impede such development. A review of information available with the Department of Housing and Urban Development indicates that insufficient information is available to effectively respond to Congress' request. Two survey instruments have been prepared to be administered via telephone to the entire universe of CDBG grantees (both entitlements and states) and to a purposive sample of microenterprise intermediary organizations. This survey approach is expected to provide useful and usable data regarding both entities that fund microenterprises and those that do not as well as provide greater insights into an existing statutory and/or regulatory impediments. Respondents: Units of general local governments and states receiving CDBG funds in Fiscal Year 1993 and a selected sample of 20 microenterprise intermediary organizations (taken from the 1992 Membership Directory for the Association for Enterprise Opportunity). Frequency of Response: This is a one-time information collection effort.
