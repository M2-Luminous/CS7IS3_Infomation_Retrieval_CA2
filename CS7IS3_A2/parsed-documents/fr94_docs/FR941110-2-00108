According to applicants, the consolidation of BN and Santa Fe would be almost entirely an end-to-end transaction, which would create new single-line routes and increase, not reduce, competition. In terms of both geographic configuration and commodities handled, applicants indicate that their existing rail operations are essentially complementary to one another. BN's routes are concentrated in the Upper Midwest, the Northern Plains and the Pacific Northwest. From this defining core, BN's lines extend into the south central region of the country, but with much less market coverage than in the North. Santa Fe serves the area from California through the Southwest, reaching up through the Midwest to Chicago. The principal commodities handled by BN are coal and grain. A primary focus of Santa Fe's business is intermodal traffic.
