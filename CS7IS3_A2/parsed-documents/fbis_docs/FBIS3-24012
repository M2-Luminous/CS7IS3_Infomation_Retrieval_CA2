Who Is Next?"] [Text] The situation developing in the Crimea puts the question to Kiev point-blank: What is to be done, since television remains the last bridge linking Kiev and Simferopol? On 18 February the president of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, suggested that the president of the Krym [Crimea] Television and Radio Company, Valeriy Astakhov, go into "voluntary-compulsory" resignation, explaining this only by saying that it is unlikely they can work together successfully. Although Yuriy Aleksandrovich himself seems to have no complaints against Valeriy Nikolayevich. Maybe he does not, but then among those who do are some people's deputies who hold positions in the RDK [expansion unknown] and even the chairman of the fairly well known association "Impeks-55 Krym", Valeriy Averkin himself, who played a very effective role in shaping Yu. Meshkov as a politician in the first stages of his giddy career. But today Mr. Averkin, who has become involved in publishing activity, is already trying to influence the shaping of public opinion among all the Crimean petty bourgeoisie. In MESHCHANSKAYA GAZETA, which he owns, V. Averkin on 16 February advised the government how to "spank" the president of the television and radio company, V. Astakhov, whom he has always disliked, you see, and now, it is becoming clear, simply can no longer stand because of the pro-Rukh spirit on the screen. "Crimea television," the chief petty bourgeois of Crimea categorically alleges, "in its present form is a slap in the face to Russian-speaking Crimeans, regardless of their nationality... And it will be so until," V. Averkin stresses, "Mr. Meshkov begins to fulfill his pre-election promises, including those concerning television." As is evident, he has already begun. But this "beginning" immediately raised some questions. First, is it reasonable to change the leader of the most popular and influential information medium at the height of the pre-election campaign? Secondly, how is it that the president of the teleradio company of Crimea, which is a part of Gosteleradio Ukrainy [State Television and Radio of Ukraine] and is financed from the state budget, works under a contract with this organization which will not terminate for 3 years? Thirdly, is putting the question in that way proper when today there is no legal mechanism to allow the president of Crimea to decide it on his own? The Supreme Soviet now has the deciding word; I hope it will be guided not by personal sympathies and antipathies, but by the norms of laws. Valeriy Astakhov refused to accept Yuriy Meshkov's suggestion and intends to defend his rights in accordance with the law. The Crimean branch of the Helsinki Civil Assembly was the first to defend the rights of the journalist. The Assembly's announcement says, among other things, that such a development of events at the height of the election campaign for the parliaments of Crimea and Ukraine opens up the way for political censorship in Crimea and to the expulsion from television and radio of journalists who have an independent opinion. Out of fairness, I must say that it was precisely when V. Astakhov became the head of the television and radio company that it became possible to express various points of view, including ones which differed from the official point of view. With Astakhov's support, national editorial desks were set up and are operating: Crimean-Tatar, Armenian, Greek, and Bulgarian, plus the Si-Ay interethnic information service which works in four languages, and the new channels. This enabled television broadcasting to be increased from 6 hours a week to 36. Even now the pressure of the Rossiya Bloc is appreciable; it is not hiding its desire to obtain an absolute majority in the Crimean parliament and realize its main task--to join the peninsula to Russia. The arrival of a new leadership in television will undoubtedly make this majority overwhelming. The situation taking shape puts this question point-blank to official Kiev too: Television in Crimea remains essentially the last bridge linking Kiev and Simferopol, since the Ukrainian newspapers have been reaching Crimea irregularly and very late for a long time now. Incidentally, this is unlike the example of the Russian newspapers, which appear in subscribers' boxes and at kiosks on the day that the papers come out.
