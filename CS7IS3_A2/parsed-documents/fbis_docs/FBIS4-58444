Last night's session was very contentious. It was fraught with mutual accusations about reneging on decisions and earlier positions, and with demands to reopen issues which had already been finalized. At times, the atmosphere was one of near-crisis. Occasionally, there were loud verbal exchanges, and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher had to intervene to calm 'Arafat down. At 0215 [2315 GMT], Nabil Sha'th and 'Amr Musa came out of the room to face the press, and Musa announced: There is an agreement. The sides held discussions and finalized all the details of the agreement. Following are the outstanding issues the draft committees left to Rabin and 'Arafat to finalize: Jericho's autonomous area: The area from which Israel will withdraw has been expanded to 62 km, far less than what the Palestinians demanded. However, the size and fate of this area may be brought up for further discussion at a later stage. In other words, this issue remains open. Positioning a Palestinian policeman on the Allenby Bridge: Israel refused to accept this demand, and a policeman will not be positioned on the bridge. This issue may also be brought up for further discussion at a later stage. Releasing prisoners: This was one of the toughest problems. Israel refused to release more than the 5,000 prisoners that had been agreed earlier. As may be recalled, the Palestinians had demanded the release of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad members who would in exchange undertake a commitment to stop engaging in terror and to support the Declaration of Principles. These terrorists will not be released at this point, but their case may be brought up for further discussion by the security liaison committee to be established at a later stage. Territorial waters: The area to be given to the Palestinians has been expanded from 3 to 6 miles. They will also be given fishing rights in another 6 miles further out to sea. Security activities: This is a very important issue which could cause problems and disputes in the future. The area of activity has been increased to 75 meters on each side of the east-west roads. In any event, the Palestinians will not have the right to detain or imprison Israelis, and they will have to summon a joint patrol. The Palestinian police force will not be allowed to detain uniformed Israeli security troops and vehicles. Israel will have the right and prerogative to any immediate reaction -- or engagement [last word in English], as this is defined in the agreement -- to any operation or incident which might endanger lives or property. However, the aim will be to end the incident and to defer its handling to the Palestinian police force as soon as possible. [passage omitted] [Raz] Another decision made last night was to append several letters to the agreement. One letter deals with an issue which had been finalized, but the Israeli delegation nevertheless pressed to put it in writing: Yasir 'Arafat will not be able to enter the area bearing the title of president, but that of chairman of the PLO. Another issue spelled out in a letter has to do with the talks about the early transfer of power in other areas of the West Bank other than Jericho, which will begin at once. This issue had been in dispute for many months and was raised in Washington more than once. [passage omitted]
