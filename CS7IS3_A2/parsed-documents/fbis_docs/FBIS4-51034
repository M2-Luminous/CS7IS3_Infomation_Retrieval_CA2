The U.S. frigate Antrin encountered a Panamanian-flagged ship, called "Leonese," off the north coast of Haiti and ordered the ship to lay to, but it did not, Pentagon Spokesman Dennis Boxx said at a news briefing. The U.S. Navy ship fired 10 50-caliber warning shots across the bow of the Leonese, and the ship did lay to, said Boxx. Boxx also said another incident occurred on Sunday. A Bahamian- registered seagoing tug, called the sea search, ignored instructions from a U.S. Navy ship to stop and warning shots were fired across the bow. Two additional U.S. Navy ships have been ordered to help enforce the sanctions against Haiti after President Bill Clinton signed on May 21 an executive order participating in the tougher sanctions authorized by the United Nations. That brings ships involved in the sanctions enforcement to a total of 8 U.S. Navy ships and two other ships, one Argentine and one Canadian frigate, Boxx said.
