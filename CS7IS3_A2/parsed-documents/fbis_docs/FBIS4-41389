He said that as a first stage, it was important to curb inflation so as to strengthen the entire infrastructure of the market economy. "If we fail to do this quickly, there will be a new round of inflation leading to most dire implications," Snegur said. The president spoke against emergency economic measures calling instead for calm and regaining public trust. At the same time, he admitted that initial conditions for implementing the government program were bad: there was a further slump in production, widespread stoppages and very low investment activity. Snegur named budgetary, financial and crediting policies, industrial reorganization, privatization, utilization of the workforce and social security safeguards as key problems facing the government.
