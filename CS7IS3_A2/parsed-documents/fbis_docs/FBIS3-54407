Acting Speaker of the Lower House of Parliament 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Tubayshat called the meeting after some deputies demanded that the House hold an emergency session to discuss the minister's statements that first appeared in a weekly tabloid Thursday [20 January]. About 30 other deputies demanded that the House hold a general discussion of the government's regulations on the entry of food and medicine to the market. Dr. al-Tubayshat told the JORDAN TIMES Sunday that the meeting would agree on the steps that the House would take to investigate the minister's allegations and whether an extraordinary session will be held. He said the issue would be on the agenda of the house when it meets Wednesday. Parliamentary sources said the House was divided on whether a parliamentary investigation committee should be set up to look into the minister's statements that appeared in a lengthy interview in SHIHAN Arabic-language weekly. The sources said that some deputies wanted to hear the government's response to the minister's statements before a course of action is decided, with some arguing that the issue should be handled by the judiciary. "The issues addressed by the minister, if proven true, means that the health of people is in grave danger. They point to real financial, administrative and political corruption that require the government to take immediate, firm and fundamental measures. They also require that the representatives of the nation support the minister," said 30 deputies in a request to hold a special session to discuss the minister's allegations. Dr. Malhas told the JORDAN TIMES Friday that there was a deficiency in laws governing the sale of food and medicine in the market, pointing to the need of laws that would protect consumers. He charged that a "mafia" of food and drugs merchants were violating the few existing laws that regulate the distribution of food and medicine. He said these merchants were resisting the new regulations the Ministry of Health has introduced to ensure that food and drugs sold in the market meet certain standards and specifications. SHIHAN quoted Dr. Malhas as saying that a good quantity of food and medicine that reach the market "is the garbage of the industrialised world and is unfit (for human consumption)." But Dr. Malhas told the JORDAN TIMES Friday that the weekly "blew (his remarks) out of proporition." He said SHIHAN "sensationalised" his statements. President of Pharmacists Union Husam al-Din Mismar Sunday denounced the Minister's allegations and urged the government and the House to investigate remarks he made "against pharmacists." In a front-page newspaper advertisement, Mr. Mismar sought to assure people about the safety and efficiency of drugs sold in the country. Mr. Mismar, a former director at the pharmacy and medicine control directorate at the Ministry of Health, said the directorate examines and registers all drugs before they go into the market. Dr. Malhas told the JORDAN TIMES that some of the ministry officials who are supposed to inspect drugs are pharmacists who own private pharmacies, pointing to a conflict of interest. Former Minister of Health and serving Deputy Muhammad 'Addub al-Zabn said that all drugs that go to the market were examined by specialised committees at the Ministry of Health. "The Ministry of Health is a scientific institution and it can never allow the importation of medicines unless they meet certain specifications," said Dr. al-Zabn. Dr. al-Zabn said Dr. Malhas should have asked Parliament or the government to initiate laws if he saw a need for such laws. The pharmacy and drug control directorate was established in the early 1980s by the then minister of health, Dr. Zuhayr Malhas. Conflict between the ministry and the phamacists' union goes back to 1987 when Zayd Hamzah, then minister of health, insisted that pharmacies be attended by registered pharmacists. Dr. Hamzah also banned the sale of medicine without prescriptions, except for "over the counter" drugs. Informed sources said the ban was introduced to limit the sales of addictive drugs. In his interview with SHIHAN, Dr. Malhas said that "pressure was applied," to overrule a Higher Court of Justice verdict that said pharmacies should be run by pharmacists in whose names they are registered. The council for the interpretation of laws has overruled the court's verdict on the basis of a 1975 ruling that says pharmacists should not be in charge of their own pharmacies. Dr. al-Zabn said that food shipments were also examined by specialised committees before being allowed into the country. Other sources familiar with the situation, however, said that the inspection of food was the responsibility of various government ministries and departments and that that allows for confustion and inefficiency. One source said that there were previous attempts to have one agency responsible for the examination of food "but unfortunately there was a power struggle (among the various bodies) and the effort never succeeded." Sources pointed to the controversy over cooking fat shipments that did not meet specifications but were sold in the market in 1989 as evidence of the inefficiency of some of the departments entrusted with inspecting food sold in the Kingdom. "Only a thorough investigation can end the controversy created by the minister's statement," said a source familiar with the issue on the condition of anonymity. "What the minister said is dangerous," he said. "it has to be investigated." "Parliament is taking the matter very seriously. It will take the proper action on it," said Dr al-Tubayshat.
