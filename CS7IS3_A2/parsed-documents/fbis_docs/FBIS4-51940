The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks lie at the center of the overall readjustment of the post-Cold War relationship between the two countries; however, the talks remain bogged down with no set schedule for their resumption. Washington predicates such resumption on Japan's pledge to establish a long-term plan to cut its trade surplus, carry out an income tax cut, and augment its public works program. As a minority regime, the Hata cabinet is likely to face difficulties in complying with U.S. demands to map out tangible measures for implementing Japan's "economic reform outline" by the end of June. Thus, it will be very difficult to fully rehabilitate U.S. ties by the time the G-7 summit meeting is held in Naples in July. We urge Prime Minister Hata to strive to prevent Japan-U.S. ties from deteriorating, despite these difficulties. As he stood at the forefront of economic talks as foreign minister, he knows the core issues, and is acquainted with his U.S. counterparts. However, among those Americans, Hata has a negative image as a politician having close relations with the Japanese bureaucracy which they dislike--in contrast to former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who was welcomed with a measure of personal trust by President Bill Clinton. Thus, the United States is likely to make even more drastic demands on Hata. Hata needs to emphasize to the nation that we stand at a dangerous crossroads in our relationship with Washington. Also, he should demonstrate good faith to the United States in his quest for better ties. Some executives in the Japanese private sector maintain good communication channels with American business and political leaders. Instead of allowing himself to remain the puppet of bureaucrats, Hata should utilize his own counselors to build a communications network with the Clinton administration. And he should avoid exclusively depending on the Foreign Ministry for intelligence gathering and negotiating strategy. At the same time, Hata is urged not to be unduly hasty about attaining success. During the G-7 summit in Tokyo last year, the then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yielded too much to Clinton over the framework talks, giving the latter inflated hopes for numerical targets and sowing the seeds of calamity in the subsequent negotiations. Inasmuch as Hata is regarded by many as a short-term caretaker premier, he should be prepared to leave the knotty problems to his successor. The DPRK (North Korea) nuclear controversy remains a time bomb in the Japan-U.S. security relationship. Whereas Japan, the United States, and the ROK are keeping pace, they have potential problems involving sanctions and otherwise dealing with this crisis. On this question, Hata is called upon to seek a national consensus, within the Constitution and on the basis of the security treaty with the United States. The situation is fluid, requiring possible emergency measures. In the meantime, the prime minister should urge Washington to continue patient diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang toward a peaceful settlement and avoid sanctions, keeping in mind that China has the strongest card to play in allaying the dispute. On the diplomatic front, in addition to home affairs, Hata's job dovetails with reform in this country. At the heart of this endeavor lies deregulation. There is a dire need for Japan to increase imports, simplify national administration and finances, and inspire entrepreneurship among medium and small business through deregulation. Frankly, however, a strong and stable political process to make such reform possible is still not likely emerge in the immediate future. More likely, Hata will be forced to adopt a realistic course to respond to immediate challenges as they arise. As such, Washington is called upon to treat the Hata administration with understanding and flexibility.
