For the second consecutive day, the office of the Chamber, including Chamber President Frantz Robert Monde, met on 19 April, first with media directors, and later with Army authorities. The consultations were begun on 18 April by the Chamber of Deputies in an effort to find a solution and fill the political vacuum at the head of the executive. Edner Jean filed a report: [Begin recording] [Jean] All the major media in the capital were present at this meeting. In their tete-a-tete with the office of the Chamber of Deputies, the representatives of the fourth power stressed their concerns, first as citizens, and further as journalists. They expressed their apprehension with respect to the future, whether the press would even exist, given the difficulties of functioning in such an environment. One of them pointed out that recent predictions regarding the complete disappearance of the press are being realized. Accustomed to reporting on the divergent positions of politicians, the media are well placed to understand that the solution to the crisis will not occur tomorrow. President Frantz Robert Monde clearly expressed this on Tuesday, 19 April, while insisting on the increasingly urgent need to fill the vacuum in the post of prime minister. From this consultation, the representatives of radio, print, and television emerged with the clear impression that the political decisionmakers are feeling hot and cold, while expecting the worst. Despite this pessimistic vision, the meeting was reportedly very fruitful. Let us listen successively to Max Chauvet from LE NOUVELLISTE, and Mario Viau Signal FM: [Chauvet] Without being pessimistic, I would say there is still no opening for a solution. [Jean] Did you make proposals to the president? [Chauvet] No, we did not really make proposals to the president. We spoke more as Haitian citizens. We expressed our feelings. It is a very complicated problem. We tried to consider the problem from various points of view -- from the political, economic, humanitarian, and other points of view. Frankly, I believe that the president of the Chamber wanted the feedback of what we thought. He received feedback from us, but I cannot say... [pauses] We did not discuss a particular plan. We would like the political sectors involved in the crisis to meet in order to defend the children of this country who are dying. It is necessary to do something, so we are asking that the antagonists, to save this country, hold a meeting about lifting the embargo on Haiti. [Jean] Beyond these wishes, the media representatives refrained from giving their opinion on the current political debate in the country, a debate stuck between the parliamentary plan -- application of Article 149 of the Constitution, as recommended by the office of Senator Bernard Sansaricq; or Article 148 of the Constitution. The media have other questions to ask: [Viau] The question is not which is the best solution, but which project will be accepted by the concerned parties. If it is not accepted by the concerned parties, it is difficult to implement. First of all, it is necessary to find a project that could get the approval of the concerned parties. That was our viewpoint. It is not a matter of finding that solution A is better than solution B, but which one will be accepted by all the parties, because finally, we had some proposals for a solution. They were all rejected. [end recording] There are the directors of conscience, speaking after listening for too long to politicians.
