Gallup conducted the survey May 29 at the request of the Information Ministry. A total of 1,000 people above 20 years of age were queried over the telephone on "public consciousness of national security." The poll revealed that 85.1 percent of the respondents felt North Korea triggered the Korean war while a mere 0.8 believed the reverse. The remaining 14.1 percent replied that they didn't know. Asked their opinion on national unification, 31.4 percent responded that it should be accomplished at any cost, representing a diminished rate in absolute public support for national reunification. Meanwhile, 38.5 percent supported the present state of peaceful co-existence while 26.3 percent replied that "if unified, it's good but if circumstances do not permit, there is no need to realize it unnecessarily." Just 3.8 percent favored the present status quo "as unification would bring about a great deal of confusion." With regard to paying for unification, 49.8 percent of the pollees cited inter-Korean economic relations and Southern assistance for the North in opening its economy. Another 29.6 opted for public donations.
