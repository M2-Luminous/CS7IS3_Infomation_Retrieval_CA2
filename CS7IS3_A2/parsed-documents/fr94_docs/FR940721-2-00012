FR940721-2-00012 FR940721-2-00009 [A&hyph;247&hyph;003] Revocation of Antidumping Finding on Portland Cement From the Dominican Republic AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of revocation of antidumping finding. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping finding on portland cement from the Dominican Republic because it is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joe Fargo or Michael Panfeld, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, telephone (202) 482&hyph;4737. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 3, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (59 FR 22822) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping finding on portland cement from the Dominican Republic (May 4, 1963). Additionally, as required by 19 CFR §353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke this antidumping finding on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the last day of the anniversary month. Scope of the Order Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of portland cement from the Dominican Republic. This merchandise is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 2523.29.00. The HTS number is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The Department may revoke an antidumping finding if the Secretary concludes that the finding is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping finding when no interested party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested party objects to revocation (19 CFR §353.25(d)(4)(iii)). In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested party, as defined under §353.2 (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping finding on portland cement from the Dominican Republic is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping finding in accordance with 19 CFR §353.25(d)(4)(iii). This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of portland cement from the Dominican Republic entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after May 1, 1994. Entries made during the period May 1, 1993, through April 30, 1994, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR §353.22(e). The Department will instruct the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after May 1,1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR §353.25(d). Dated: July 14, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
