Shirokorad: "Automatic Ship Mounts"] [Excerpt] Powerful rapid-fire weapons were required to arm small ships at the end of the 1960's. A decision was made to develop light 57-mm and 76.2-mm single-gun mounts. The designs of these automatic mounts were developed at the KB [design bureau] of a machine building plant (since 1970 -- "Burevestnik" TsNII [Central Scientific Research Institute) and they also manufactured experimental models of automatic mounts there. The 57-mm mount received the model number A-220 and the 76-mm mount received the model number A-221. Ship tests of the A-221 were conducted from 23 through 30 November 1979 in the area of Baltiysk Naval Base on an R-5 design 1241-1 missile boat. Based upon their results, the automatic mount was recommended for acceptance into the inventory which occurred on 22 June 1979. The A-221 automatic mount received the designation "AK-176". As for the A-220 57-mm automatic mount, it successfully underwent ship tests in 1977-1978 on a design 205PE boat but only that design was accepted into the inventory. The barrel of the AK-176 was designed under the ballistics of the AK-726. The automatic mount's operating principles and the barrel's internal mechanism are primarily the same. In contrast to the AK-726, continuous external cooling of the barrel by passing seawater between the barrel jacket and monobloc has been introduced. Feeding is continuous from two sides and without cartridge holders. The basic load (152 projectiles) is located vertically on lower platform transporters. Loading time of the 152 projectiles by a crew of four men totals six minutes. Shells are fed from two sides and therefore all of the feed system's mechanisms are divided into two identical groups -- right and left. They are linked into a single kinematic chain and have a drive from a common electric motor. The system itself consists a deck upon which are located two horizontal transporters (left and right) with cartridge holders for 76 shells each, two chain elevators with receivers and two pendulums with drives. From the transporters, piston rods feed the shells into the vertical elevators. The pendulum transfers the cartridge from the elevators into the receiver of the tipping part. Guidance of the automatic gun is carried out: automatically -- using the servo drive from the "Vympel-221" Radar; semiautomatically -- from the "Kondensor-221" gunsight; and, by manual drive. Two men are in the turret during firing: The automatic gun chief and the artillery observer who carries out semiautomatic laying in the event the PUS [Fire Control Direction] malfunctions. A bulkhead separates the local command post from the remaining portion of the automatic gun. At the present time, 76 mm automatic guns have found widespread use in the majority of the world's navies. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tactical-Technical Specifications of USSR's AK-176 Shipborne Automatic Gun | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year accepted into the inventory |1979 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Number of barrels |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Caliber, mm |76.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Barrel length, calibers |59 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Elevation angle, degrees |-10, +80 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Traverse angle, degrees |+/- 168 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Elevation speed, degrees per second |30 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Traverse speed, degrees per second |35 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight of the tipping parts, kg |2,796 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight of the automatic gun without t-|approximately 10,100 | |he crew and basic load, kg | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rate of fire, rounds per minute |120-130 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Length of continuous burst |up to 70 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Basic load ready for firing, units |152 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Automatic gun crew, men |2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Projectile weight, kg |5.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Muzzle velocity, meters per second |980 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Firing range, km |15.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ceiling, km |13.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: The AK-176 has two types of projectiles -- antiaircraft and high-explo-| |sive-fragmentation.
