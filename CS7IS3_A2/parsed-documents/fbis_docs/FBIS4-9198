As he himself puts it: "From the mud of Usora I ascended to the White House," suggesting that he was a protagonist and cosignatory of all the relevant talks and undoubtedly historic documents, be it in Mostar, Sarajevo, Vienna, Geneva, and finally -- in Washington. This unobtrusive 47-year-old politician has returned with his aides from Sarajevo, where he took part in a new round of talks with the Bosniak-Muslim side regarding the successful implementation of the federal constitution, of which he is himself a cosignatory. [Zubak] We went to Sarajevo following my telephone conversation and agreement with Silajdzic. That meeting was necessary because we had to discuss the reconstruction of the government, who will put whom forward as candidates for the offices of president, vice president, prime minister, and deputy prime minister of the federation. The highest officials of Herceg-Bosna also accompanied me to Sarajevo: Jadranko Prlic, prime minister; Ivan Bender, chairman of the chamber of representatives; Mariofil Ljubic, vice-chairman of the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina; Mile Akmadzic, minister in the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina; and Zoran Buntic, chairman of our Judicial Council. We prepared a series of questions for our Muslim colleagues that should be answered. The most important thing was to distinguish which institutions are, actually, authorized representatives of both peoples, which institutions are authorized to sign political agreements on the highest level. [Marijanovic] What is your stance in that respect? [Zubak] Clearly, those are the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] and the Party of Democratic Action [SDA], because the Assembly had been constituted on the grounds of the 1990 election results, and these two parties, each among its own people, had won an absolute majority. That fact makes the authority of those parties' officials unconditional. I stress this because certain individuals and newly founded political institutions are pushing themselves as legal and legitimate representatives of one or the other people, so people from those and such organizations are being put forward as presidential candidates. In Sarajevo it was determined that we, the Croats, should ensure as great a degree of political unity as possible within our national-political corps, and within our deputy's club in the parliament. Which is to say, we shall include in our talks not only HDZ deputies and political representatives of the Croatian people, but also those from other Croatian parties represented in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina, while additionally, we shall involve also the Croats who are independently politically organized. HDZ Sets the Rules of the Game [Marijanovic] It seems that Croats have much more problems with their political unity in Bosnia-Herzegovina than other peoples, particularly Muslims. At the first session of the Assembly, that fact could not be denied, and the most novel thing is that the Croatian National Council [HNV] is putting forward Dr. Ivo Komsic as its presidential candidate. [Zubak] At that session we also held a meeting of all Croatian deputies, we failed to constitute a compact club of Croatian deputies, but we were quite unified regarding our voting for the constitution. Our deputies voted for the proposal anticipating me as the president of the federation. According to the constitution of the federation, the Croatian deputies' club is the only competent body to put forward candidates, and no other body. If the HDZ has a majority, in that case it is the HDZ that sets the rules of the game. So, there is that much about the legality. However, we have nothing, absolutely nothing against the HNV. Our orientation is democratic, and any individual or party should be allowed to express its political stance, to organize itself, and call itself by whatever name it wants. There is nothing we can deny the HNV in that respect. What we do deny is the right assumed by the HVN to claim that it is the only political body of the Croatian people that represents it legitimately. And we think that the HVN does not have such an authority. The platform on which the Washington agreement is based is also the platform of the HDZ, and nobody can lay claim to it. We simply shall not allow that. The content of the frequently ignored issue of Livno, when the Croatian people decided that it would support the independent and sovereign Republlic of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a complex state, is basically founded on the political platform of the HDZ, and the results of such an attitude cannot be denied now by individuals who held quite opposite political views at the time and long afterwards. If that is so, then we rightfully deny the right of the HNV to politically influence the Croatian people in such a way, to choose and appoint its own people to government posts. It is not fair, and according to the new constitution the HVN is not competent to propose its own candidates at all. [Marijanovic] Did you definitely confirm the aforementioned legitimacy at the latest meeting with Muslims? [Zubak] That was one of the issues. We were present there as the delegation of Herceg-Bosna, involving its most responsible officials, and according to the HDZ Statute, all those who perform highly official duties are at the same time members of the party's council. The Bosniaks also had a highly competent delegation, headed by [Prime Minister] Silajdzic, who is, at the same time, the vice-chairman of the SDA. Also, all of his aides who took part in the talks with us, his ministers, are for the most part engaged in the leadership of the SDA. Komsic was also present when we declared, so to say, the verbal legitimacy of the two delegations, he also agreed with that, but later on, he still opposed it. Now it is clear to me that his candidacy was being prepared. New Times, New People [Marijanovic] The choice of candidates for president and prime minister of the federation is eliciting a great interest in the public, however, most probably an agreement on that issue also failed to come about this time, did it not? [Zubak] We think that the president of the federation must be a Croat. We acquainted our partners in the talks with legal and political reasons for that. In that case, the Bosniaks would designate the vice president and the prime minister, while we would have a right to designate the deputy prime minister, who would be defense minister at the same time. When I say political reasons, I refer to the fact that, for four years already now, the president of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been a Muslim. On the other hand, in view of the fierce clashes raging between Serbs and Bosniaks-Muslims, we think that the Serbs might be more willing to accept the association with a Croat at the head of the federation. As for legal reasons, we refer to the existing constitution, that, in wider terms, may be applied to this situation. The constitution stipulates that successive presidents cannot be of the same nationality. Since Izetbegovic has been the president so far, then everything is clear.... We do not want, by any means, to complicate the implementation of the constitution, we are even ready, if Silajdzic happens to be put forward by the Bosniaks as a presidential candidate, to accept and discuss that combination as well. Not because we are against Izetbegovic, but rather because it is understandable that new times, new circumstances suggest new people. [Marijanovic] What did you agree upon regarding the government? What will it eventually be like? [Zubak] As for the government, we made an agreement regardless of any other documents. It will be reconstructed on the basis of the new constitution of the federation, and in that case we shall avoid parallel, dual governments. At that stage, our opinions slightly collided, because our views did not automatically harmonize, so we turned for help to experts. Their Minister of Justice Kasim Trnka is also an expert on the constitutional law, so we agreed that he works out an expert opinion in the form of a legal document. Because, we also proposed that the government could involve nine departments, while the existing government in Sarajevo involves more than 20 members at the moment. I think we shall reach an agreement on that issue next week as well, and when we finish that, then we shall discuss which ministerial office is to be performed by a member of which people. One has to keep in mind that the government will have to involve representatives of other ethnic groups in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well. [Marijanovic] Did you discuss military issues as well? [Zubak] We have not yet completely tackled that question. I have already said that in the new government the deputy prime minister will also be the defense minister. We assessed that the current heads and commanders of both armies have been quite successful in their cooperation, so it is also they who should state their views and opinions on the situation. True, we also discussed the special purpose production in war conditions, and some other things. Regarding those issues, we have not yet reached the phase when conclusions are to be made. So Far, So Good [Marijanovic] Is there a little truth in some unofficial information according to which General Ante Roso of the HVO is a candidate for the commander in chief of the federal army? [Zubak] There will be no federal army. At least at this transitory stage. There will be a joint army composed of the two existing army structures. A joint staff will be established, but we have not yet discussed who could possibly be its commander. Like all other things, that will depend on a solution of the issue of defense minister. You see, everything, the entire national chain, is bound up with who will be elected president of the federation. Which means, if the defense minister happens to be Croat, then the commander-in-chief of that joint staff cannot be Croat. But the chief of the staff can be Croat. In any case, we have proposed General Roso for all the highest military functions in the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Marijanovic] What will happen with the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina in view of these changes? [Zubak] It will function as usual until the next elections, just as Herceg-Bosna will, in political terms. New elections should resolve that issue, they are expected to take place in six months, but I personally doubt that the deadline will be met, in view of everything that is happening in the field. [Marijanovic] What are the most concrete results of the latest talks? [Zubak] There are many. The best results have been achieved in terms of guarantees given that all kinds of communication through the territories controlled by the HVO and the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina will be made possible. In addition, we shall establish customs and monetary systems quite soon, the media war is already abating, the refugees and displaced persons will return to their homes, prisoners on both sides are already being released. A lot of such things have been agreed upon, and results can already be seen in the field. Some things are developing unbelievably smoothly. Principles had already been established at the ministers' meeting in Mostar, before the Sarajevo meeting. So far, so good, but now it is impossible to enumerate all the fields that we discussed. [Marijanovic] What currency will be used in the federation? [Zubak] For the time being, the valid currencies in Herceg-Bosna are the Croatian dinar and German mark. The government of Bosnia-Herzegovina has accepted the German mark as their currency. [Marijanovic] There is frequent speculation about the possibility that, if the kuna becomes the official currency in Croatia, and if the possible confederation between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina comes about, then the kuna may also become the official currency in the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Zubak] Financial affairs will be the most sensitive issue. As for the official currency, that will depend on agreement between the federation and the Republic of Croatia. Everything is regulated and foreseen by the confederal agreement. Among other things, it also foresees a common monetary policy, and many other common things. We, Croats, would like the kuna to become the official currency in the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as well. [Marijanovic] When will the constituent Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina resume its work, and who will chair its meetings in the future? [Zubak] The Assembly will meet again on 28 April, and by then we shall have settled all the questions we have discussed so far. In the first place, those connected with the election of president and prime minister. That will not be so difficult a job if political harmony functions. At that meeting we expect a formal confirmation of everything that we have politically agreed upon so far. Tudjman's Historic Visit [Marijanovic] Pressures that were put on the Croatian representatives, and also some publicly stated insults, particularly on the part of the representatives of the Bosnian political opposition, have left a rather bad taste in the Croatian public. Do you expect such things to happen further? [Zubak] Well, some unpleasent things happened, that is true. I guess it is the war that caused them to happen. We have settled all that. Actually, it is only the bad examples that the public has been familar with. There are Bosnian representatives who were very happy to see us in Sarajevo, even though we carried the flag of Herceg-Bosna. Safet Isovic, the famous singer and SDA deputy, publicly acknowledged that. [Marijanovic] By your activities, you and your aides are expected to ensure the equal status for, as people put it, both the Croatian lieutenants and the Croatian dead [as published]. Are you aware of that? [Zubak] All those who will perform duties in the federation's administration on behalf of the Croatian people, must ensure the equality of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course, in compliance with law. Particularly in the field, in practice. We shall struggle for that with every breath. We shall struggle for the prosperity of the federation, and our people in it. The struggle of our living and dead in this war is and will remain morally, and in any other way justly valued. [Marijanovic] The historic visit by President Tudjman to the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to take place quite soon. How do you feel about that visit, and how do you assess its eventual effect on and significance for the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Zubak] A general assessment is that the upcoming visit by President Tudjman to Sarajevo, and perhaps to some other regions of the federation, will be yet another step by which the determination of the Republic of Croatia and the Croatian people to implement what was signed in Washington, is shown. By that visit Tudjman confirms that in a symbolic way. The readiness of the Republic of Croatia, the greatest symbol of which is President Tudjman, to earnestly and thoroughly implement everything that was agreed upon in Washington, is very important for the future of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What will that mean for the suffering Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be seen in the way in which they will welcome President Tudjman. The Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina have never concealed their national feelings. That will be an extraordinary occasion for them to show their feelings again.
