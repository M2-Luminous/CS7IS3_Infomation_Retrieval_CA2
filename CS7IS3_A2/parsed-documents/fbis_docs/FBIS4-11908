Therefore, it is perfectly in character for them not to reflect on small deeds and spiteful acts by their enemies when those enemies fall into the trap of their own evil or receive a dire, divine punishment. Hence, we have not gloated over what has happened to the criminals who planned and carried out the 30-state aggression, thus demonstrating the most remarkable degree of moral nobility. However, the truly Iraqi, Ghazi al-'Ayyash, unlike the rest of the Iraqis, could no longer tolerate the kind and magnitude of the crimes of the enemies of humanity. So he wrote the following lines that express legitimate human feelings. [Signed: the Chief Editor] The collapse of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Santiago, Chile, was not the first such incident for one of the symbols of the 30-state aggression against Iraq. Former U.S. President George Bush had earlier fainted in Tokyo, Japan. Both collapsed in front of television cameras worldwide, just as bulls collapse when they are about to enter a slaughterhouse and approach their end. George Bush collapsed like a worn bull that fought in battles too great for him. Margaret Thatcher fell and her head drooped like a sick sheep falling under the feet of its herd. Here, we are not gloating, nor praying to God for the death of George Bush, Margaret Thatcher, or others whose hands were smeared with the blood of the innocent Iraqis, those who had a hand in imposing an unjust embargo against the Iraqi people, or those who denied Iraqi children and sick people food and medicine, thus causing their death en masse. We have faith and know that we are all going to die. However, we pray to God for their long suffering and agony. We pray to God to infect them with scabies that make their bodies itch constantly, denying them sleep at night and the joys of life in daytime. We pray to God to make those people lose their eyesight, having lost their insight. We pray that their minds and tongues be paralyzed, and that their hearts be rent over the death of their most beloved ones. We pray that their spite will eat into their bodies and those of their grandchildren. We pray they lose their way in the desert, naked and barefoot, and look for a drop of water but find only a mirage. We hope they are denied everything they like, that they will never feel happy and that they will lose their minds. We hope they will turn into a laughable joke to amuse children. We hope adults will kick them as well. The curse of the Iraqis shall haunt them, just like the curse of the Pharaohs has been haunting those who infringe upon their boundaries, sanctity, rights, and land. The curse of the Iraqis has begun to haunt them, for mysterious diseases are eating away their soldiers and earthquakes and volcanoes are destroying American cities and the cities of other countries that took part in the aggression against Iraq. Gorbachev has been overwhelmed by the disgrace of the disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the tribulations of its peoples. Shevardnadze, who was foreign minister of the Soviet Union during the 30-state aggression against Iraq and who contributed to this aggression, is today crying over the rubble of his country, Georgia, and its ordeal and is seeking shelter under the spears of the soldiers of another country. British Prime Minister John Major is now walking on thin ice. Any moment now, he could fall into a bottomless abyss from which he will never return. The symptoms of the Iraq curse have started to appear on U.S. President Bill Clinton. He still has not come up with a way to handle the Whitewater scandal. The world economy is being shaken and is about to collapse. The governments that contributed to the aggression against Iraq have all fallen, haunted by the curse of their scandals and their people's disavowal of them. They have fallen into the abyss. Some of them are still waiting. This is the inevitable fate of all tyrants and despots. It is a natural outcome of what they did to a faithful, peaceful people, the people of Iraq. The curse of the Iraqis promises them more dire consequences.
