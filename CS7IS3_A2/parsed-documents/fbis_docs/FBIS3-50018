"We are not bothered by the idea that other Central European states will do the same. On the contrary. Moreover, we hope that the simultaneous endeavors of all the countries in our area to increase, in every respect, their compatibility with NATO, will trigger a somehow lacking disposition to reproduce -- in their mutual relations -- the viable pattern set in Washington, 45 years ago, by the Alliance. If fulfilled by each of the new Central European democracies, the very objectives of the new practical programme will lead them in this direction. Likewise, to earlier NATO membership. "Both the spirit and the letter of the declaration adopted by the NATO summit do strongly reconfirm this valuable outlook. Its first paragraph underlines that the alliance 'is reaching out to establish new patterns of cooperation throughout Europe'. The West and the Russian Federation could decisively help the alliance in fulfilling this task. Inclusively by overcoming the parochial attitudes that have traditionally governed their mutual behavior. "This is exactly why, we in Romania find it important -- at this historical juncture -- to suggest to our peers in Central Europe not to ignore a precious security resource which is within our grasp: the establishment and consolidation, throughout our area, of good neighborly relations. "I hope the constructive thrust of this proposal will be correctly understood by all the countries in our area. The more so, because Romania does not embark herself barehanded on the historical Euro-Atlantic journey to strengthened European stability and security opened by the partnership for peace. Our country disposes of certain -- even unique -- geostrategic and geopolitical assets. Properly used, they could help the alliance in fulfilling its new role of projecting stability and democracy beyond its current area, thereby increasing Romania's direct contribution to 'lasting peace, stability and well-being in Europe'. The significance of those assets is substantially enhanced by Romania's belonging to the group of like-minded countries which enjoy closer relations with the main Western European structures. "In connection with this, I would like to remind to all those who still think that 'Visegrad membership' is a sine qua non for closer relations with the West, that Romania's status with the cardinal Western European structures -- the European Union, the Western European Union and the Council of Europe -- is identical with that enjoyed by the countries in that sub-regional grouping. "This is a most convincing recognition of the fact that, in spite of the heavier communist legacy Romania has had to get rid of, our political will to irreversibly enshrine the Western values and practices in our society, and to solidly anchor the country in the Western structures is as genuine as the one expressed by 'the Visegrad four'. At the same time, this situation clearly indicates that the Western European institutions' attitude towards our respective countries is not biased by parochial considerations."
