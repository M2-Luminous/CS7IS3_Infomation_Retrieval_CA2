One in five companies accepts amakudari. The triumvirate are the Ministries of Construction, Finance, and International Trade and Industry. The actual state of bureaucracy and industry adhesion is clear. Japanese society has been formed by the "iron triangle" of politicians, bureaucrats, and industrialists. The arena cultivated for a long time by both politicians and industrialists has become too fat and now, a series of general contractor bribes has shaken the islands of Japan. The bureaucratic system, which is another apex, was shaped in the early Meiji period [1868-1912], and its system of control has extended for over one century. Particularly after World War II, politicians and industrialists united to push economic reconstruction based on the leadership of the bureaucrats in order to rebuild the devastated country. The structure of bureaucrats and industrialists leaning on each other has been formed in the shape of industry accepting a large number of amakudari bureaucrats to obtain protection for their own company and industry and the newest information. A survey of amakudari officers from the bureaucracy in private firms was made recently by TOYO KEIZAI, and all of their names have been ascertained. The target firms were 2,175 companies with a total of 40,800 employees. Added to all 2,128 listed firms were 47 life and nonlife insurance companies and other nonlisted firms, as well as major economic agencies such as the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Ministry of Justice 4 Ministry of 1 Central 1 Labor Cooperative Bank for Agriculture and Forestry Ministry and Agency Total 808 Special Corporations, etc., 260 Total Amakudari for One in Five Companies The total number of amakudari officers identified for the first time by TOYO KEIZAI is 1,070 persons. The firms accepting them amount to 500 companies. Since there are a total of 1,012 officers and 474 companies pertaining just to listed firms, one in 4.5 companies has installed amakudari bureaucrats as officers. The number of amakudari officers in private firms at the point in time of last year was 1,020 persons, and this number on the 1,000 person level has hardly changed at all for the past 10 years. It is said that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has been decisively at the top of amakudari to private firms for the past 20 years and according to the recent survey also, they were tops with 189 people. Next was the Ministry of Construction (MOC), which is the government agency supervising general contractors that has been shaken by bribery, with 176 people, followed by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) with 99. However, if nonlisted firms are excluded and all listed firms are made the target, the results are that MOF and MOC change order--with the MOC in first, MOF in second, and MITI in third. The fact that MOF becomes the top if the nonlisted firms are added is because the financial institutions which are the domain of MOF account for the majority of the nonlisted firms that were the target of the survey. Viewing collectively that 75 percent of the amakudari sites for both MOF and MOC are related industries, the relationship of the bureaucracy and industry via amakudaris becomes clear. Moreover, 260 persons are also amakudari from special corporations such as public corporations, but when separated by supervising government agency, the prominence of MOC is conspicuous here too. Since 75 percent of public corporation officers come from the main ministry according to the "Amakudari White Paper" by the Federation of Government Special Corporation Employees (Seiroren), there should be several among these 260 people who came from a former government agency which this survey did not touch. The fact that bureaucrats with high positions in the main ministry move to important jobs such as director of a special corporation has been pointed out every year in the aforementioned "Amakudari White Paper" which considers only special corporations as the target of amakudari sites. Therefore, a survey of the migrating group coming from the three major ministries is in Table 2. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2. Migrating Group 30 To 40 Percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Former Ministry/Agency (-|Migrating Group |Percentage | |Total) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Finance (189 |56 persons |29.6 percent | |persons) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Construction |53 persons |30.1 percent | |(176 persons) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Internationa-|39 persons |39.4 percent | |l Trade & Industry (9| | | |9 persons) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- There is Takashi Tanaka, currently president of the Bank of Yokohama who went from MOF vice minister to president of the People's Finance Corp. and president of the Export-Import Bank of Japan. There is Takanari Sugiura who was appointed chairman of All Nippon Airways after serving as Ministry of Transport (MOT) vice minister, president of Japan National Railways, and chief director of Japan National Railways Liquidation Corp. There is Shigeo Sawada who became vice president of NTT after serving as Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications vice minister and chief director of the Postal Savings Association. It probably can be said that the pattern here of the high class bureaucrat is to have a long, elegant amakudari life by wandering through public corporations and finally settling down in a private firm. The treatment in private firms for one in four is generally high, starting with former MOF bureaucrats, with a position of president or higher. Moreover, the ranking of MOF and MITI has taken the form of endorsing what are generally called "the popular ministries." Calculating on the basis of survey results (Labor Administration Research Institute) that the average annual remuneration for full-time officers is 18,507,000 yen, the total annual remuneration for amakudari listed firm officers is roughly 18.7 billion yen. You might say that an enormous sum of about 20 billion yen has been appropriated as "amakudari officer support expenses" by listed firms. Moreover, making a trial calculation of amakudari officer support expenses by ministry including positions, it becomes 4.5 billion yen for MOF, 3.6 billion yen for MOC, and 2.3 billion yen for MITI. The various ministries must be eager to create "designated chairs" of posts that can be inherited from senior to junior. It probably can be taken that these expenses that are paid by the firms indicate the vested interests as it were of the three ministries. Construction Industry Is Still a Hotbed With the coming of the Hosokawa administration, interest is again increasing about relaxation of regulations, but what about the relationship between permit/license authority and amakudari? The total number of permits and licenses for 1992 reached 10,942 according to the Management and Coordination Agency, and the ranking by numbers are the MOT (1,966), MITI (1,915), Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (1,357), and thereafter to the MOF, Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the MOC. It would be thought that the ministries with the more permits and licenses would have stronger adhesion with firms, but the ranking by ministry from which amakudari officers come is somewhat different. The relationship with amakudari is not simply the number of permits and licenses, and it can be presumed that existence of power invisible to the eye that controls the life or death of a firm operates in acceptance. According to the National Public Services Law, approval of the National Personnel Authority (NPA) is necessary if a bureaucrat is reemployed in a private firm that has a deep relationship with the post that he held within two years after his retirement (approval for 208 people in 1992). However, looking at the actual situation in which the majority are amakudari into related industries, it is understood that the process of approval by the NPA perhaps has become somewhat of a shell. As became clear in the recent survey, the majority of the amakudari sites are related industries with the exception of the National Tax Administration where on the scene veterans join as auditors across various industrial sectors. As opposed to the amakudari side which is in fact been turned to pasture, what kind of features are in the side accepting them? Table 3.

Taken up in Table 3 is a list of former bureaucrats who are amakudari to large and medium size general contractor listed firms from MOC as well as special corporations related to construction. It is learned that firms that accept public works projects, which account for 30 percent of the total construction demand, accept amakudari bureaucrats across the board. The 475 listed companies that accept amakudari officers equates to 22 percent of the whole. With regard to the 84 companies in the construction industry, it is 75 companies and the acceptance rate climbs to 89 percent. In the construction industry, in addition to those from MOC and related public corporations accounting for half of the amakudari officers, distribution for the remaining "three public works ministries" is 20 percent for those from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and those from other ministries or agencies and public corporations sharing the remaining 30 percent. Moreover, while it is said that amakudari officers "make use of their experience and skill in private enterprise," almost all becomes officers in charge of marketing. This industry indeed has become a hot bed for amakudari coiling around various vested interests. It is said that the industry is mature and MOF influence in city banks has become less that before, but nevertheless, 36 percent of the banks accept amakudari from MOF bureaucrats. If those from the Bank of Japan are included in that, amakudari officers exist at 46 percent of the city banks. That is 53 percent at regional banks (72 percent including the Bank of Japan). It is 68 percent at secondary regional banks (79 percent including the Bank of Japan), including Hyogo Bank where the former director of the MOF Banking Bureau was sent in as president, and the smaller the scale of the financial institution, the more the amakudari percentage climbs. Is this because the larger the bank, the weaker the influence of MOF or the smaller the bank, the more the power of MOF old boys is needed? Expectations for Administrative Reform Council The pipeline between central government ministries and agencies and the industrial world, which has been built up over a long time, is too large and fat, and its overall image is difficult to grasp. It clearly was impossible in this survey, and there are many other amakudari bureaucrats. amakudari bureaucrats exist in public service corporations which amount to 20,000, special corporations and non-listed firms outside the target of this survey, and in posts other than officers in listed firms. In the political world, the one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic Party has crumbled and a crack is entering one corner of the "iron triangle" that has controlled Japan for over a century. At this juncture, the Third Administrative Reform Council is preparing an Administrative Reform Council report incorporating policy to correct amakudari. An amakudari officer states, "Among large firms, there are some areas that are more or less bureaucratic. There also are some areas where things go smoothly that way. I serve a private firm in those areas." The excellence of Japanese bureaucrats and the strong bureaucratic structure have been known for a long time in the world and here there is not the slightest doubt about what is bureaucratic. Indeed, among the officers recently revealed, there probably are some to whom so-called amakudari does not apply. Moreover, there probably also is a plus aspect in that amakudari has smoothed the relationship between the bureaucracy and industry and contributed to economic growth. There also is the aspect that ministries and agencies have been able to demonstrate efficiently the function of their organization by amakudari. It is necessary not to criticize amakudari unilaterally alone, but also to requestion a new way for personnel matters, including an extension of the retirement age and increase in pay for bureaucrats.
