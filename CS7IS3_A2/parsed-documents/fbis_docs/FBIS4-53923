Kim made the remark after meeting with Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of State for Political and Military Affairs, to discuss the North Korean nuclear problem and Pyongyang-Washington talks for about four and a half hours at the State Department. He indicated that conditions for U.S.-North Korea high-level talks have virtually been met, saying, "The direct conditions for the talks are additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the radiochemical laboratory and follow-up inspections on maintenance of the IAEA's monitoring equipment. "As far as I know, the IAEA's additional inspection has been carried out smoothly." He noted that solving the fuel rod problem at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon is not a precondition to the third round of dialogue but a basis on which Pyongyang and Washington can continue bilateral talks. "The basis can be prepared only when North Korea stops replacing the fuel rods or accepts the IAEA position, which demands selection, storage and measurement of the fuel, or agrees with the IAEA to secure measurement in any form after a certain period. "If North Korea pushes to withdraw fuel rods from the reactor unilaterally, the basis of the talks is feared to collapse at a certain point in time," he said. IAEA officials have already confirmed that Pyongyang replaced some fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor without outside supervision, while another IAEA team is to arrive in Pyongyang on Tuesday to negotiate supervision of further refueling. He also hinted that the IAEA-North Korean negotiations on fuel rods and the Pyongyang-Washington talks could be carried out side by side. Kim's comments suggest that the United States will push for a third round of high-level talks unless the IAEA officially announces that North Korea's fuel rod replacement has already passed over the "red line," even if the fuel rod negotiations take much time. He added that it is up to the IAEA to determine the "red line" up to which measurement of the fuel rods is secured.
