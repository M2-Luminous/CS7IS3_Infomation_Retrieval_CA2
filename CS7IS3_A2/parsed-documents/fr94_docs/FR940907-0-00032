In reviewing these regulations submitted by the State the EPA used guidance memoranda, the Blue Book, and the CTGS which have been issued up to this point. EPA's Analysis of the State's Submittal The following is a summary of the major changes to Michigan's VOC regulations contained in the State's submittal. I. June 1993 Submittal On June 12, 1993 MDNR submitted to EPA a SIP revision to address deficiencies in the State's ozone SIP. Listed below are descriptions of the changes contained in this submittal. A. Rules 101, 103, 105, 116, 122 (Definitions A; C; E; P; V) Definitions have been added or revised and include the following. These sections have additionally been renumbered to accommodate those definitions which have been added or deleted. (1) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Actual emissions'' to not apply in Parts 6 and 7 of these rules. Parts 6 and 7 regulate the emissions of VOCs. (2) MDNR has removed one of the two definitions of ``Air-dried coating'' from the State's rules. Now there is only one definition which applies to all of the rules. (3) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Air quality standard'' to mean the concentration and duration of an air contaminant specified by the commission or by the national ambient air quality standards as contained in the provisions of 40 CFR part 50 (1990), whichever is more restrictive, as the maximum acceptable concentration and duration of that contaminant in the ambient air. (4) MDNR has added the definition of ``Calendar day'' which means a 24-hour time period which normally is midnight to midnight, but which may, upon written notification to the commission, cover a different, consecutive 24-hour time period for a specific process. (5) MDNR has added the definition of ``Coating category'' which means a type of surface coating for which there is a separate emission limit specified in these rules. (6) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating line'' to mean an operation which is a single series in a coating process and which is comprised of 1 or more coating applicators and any associated flash-off areas, drying areas and ovens wherein 1 or more surface coatings are applied and subsequently dried or cured. (7) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating of fabric'' to include the application of coating by saturations and impregnation. (8) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating of paper'' to include saturation. (9) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Coating of vinyl'' to not include the application of plastisols. (10) MDNR has revised the definition of ``Completed organic resin'' to include dry organic resin. (11) MDNR has revised the definition of ``component'' and lists specific parts which are designated as ``components'' for Rules 336.1622, 336.1628, 336.1629, and specifically excludes a valve that has no external controls, therefore having no potential to leak VOCs.
