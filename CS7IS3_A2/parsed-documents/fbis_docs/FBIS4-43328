The winners are [German Chancellor] Kohl and [Italian Prime Minister] Berlusconi, as well as "outsiders" Tapie [French Radical Energy list leader] and Billiers [French "The Other Europe" list]. [Spanish Prime Minister] Gonzalez and Rocard [French European Solidarity list leader] have lost. Without exception, however, all have been defeated by European abstentionism, the worst on the market. This result is unequivocal, and it affects almost every country in the European Union [EU]: More or less half the voters did not turn up at the polling stations, thus evading their right-duty to take part in the renewal of the European Parliament, whose legitimacy lies precisely in universal suffrage. What are the reasons for this betrayal? Condemning -- with no right of appeal -- those who did not vote would denote a hypocritical and unreasonable attitude. If the European elections have been ignored, it means the citizens did not grasp the importance of what was at stake. The political forces failed to apply the necessary European pedagogy. None of them managed to explain the European Parliament's role and potential. The quest for support -- not only in Italy -- was mostly based on national-level messages. In other words, Europe has been betrayed more by its political class than by its voters. No doubt the fact that the European Parliament has limited powers only, and the fact that Europe's helplessness is highlighted daily by the tragic events in the former Yugoslavia, with the social consequences of a prolonged economic crisis, are all eminently valid arguments to explain electoral desertion. However, explanations do not end here. We must go deeper, delve into psychological introspection in the attempt to understand why Europeans are so distant from Europe, why disillusionment is today the most widespread feeling. During the cold war years, the need for a strong and united West Europe was never called into question. Different institutional models -- more or less federal in nature, more or less intergovernmental -- may have been advanced. General de Gaulle and Mrs. Thatcher may have had different views. But nobody ever thought of rejecting Europe, particularly in the knowledge that friendly relations between France and Germany -- an unquestionable peace factor -- were essentially the outcome of the European integration process. The first doubts were experienced in 1989. The fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany's reunification, the end of East-West ideological confrontation, the collapse of the Soviet empire, did not, in the view of Europeans, highlight the need for a united Europe or indeed the need to speed up the integration process. On the contrary, these events released 1,000 different poisons, not the least of which was nationalism. In today's Europe, as [outgoing EU Commission President] Jacques Delors correctly said, all the dangers of 1920 are present. We know very well how that story ended. Nationalism is a form of short-sightedness and closed egoism. If Europe proves unable to rid itself of this demon, it cannot fail to arouse disappointment among its citizens. If politics continue to be interpreted exclusively in a national key, without the necessary openness and generosity, the little there is today of Europe will eventually dissolve into nothing. It is the European Parliament -- the EU's weakest institution -- which is now footing the bill for this situation. But the new European deputies should not have their wings clipped simply because the polling booths were deserted. They must continue to fight against national governments' absolutism, against their tendency to drift off course by marginalizing and often criminalizing European power, whether in Brussels or Strasbourg. A victim of disillusionment, the European Parliament can nevertheless contribute to restoring the necessary climate of trust to further the integration process. In this respect, the massive abstention from the European elections must be interpreted as a sort of last warning issued to the political class. Politicians must understand that Europe cannot be built amid indifference from Europeans -- no kind of Europe, neither the continental supermarket the British want, nor the EU advocated by Altiero Spinelli from the benches of the European Parliament.
