Over one-half of those injuries involved logging trucks, on which logs are loaded for transport to mills, etc. Table 10._ Sources of Injury in Mobile Equipment Accidents 1Source of injury 1Number 1Percent Skidder 9 27 Log truck 17 52 Mobile equipment, n.e.c. 2 6 Ground surface 1 3 Other or non-classifiable 4 12 n,s Total 33 100 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Work Injury Report (WIR) Injuries in the Logging Industry, Bulletin 2203, June 1984. e. Protective equipment. Also included in the WIR survey was information about the type of protective equipment being worn or used at the time of the accident. Table 11 shows that the majority of employees were wearing logging boots, gloves and head protection when they were injured. However, less than one-third of those injured were wearing leg protection, even though almost 60 percent of the injuries investigated occurred when employees were performing activities that required the use of a chain saw (brushing, felling trees, limbing, and bucking). In addition, only six of the 33 employees injured while operating equipment or vehicles were using seat belts. Since more than one-half of all injured employees said they were working on sloping terrain at the time, OSHA believes it is reasonable to assume that some of the machine accidents were rollovers or tipovers and that seat belts could have prevented some of those injuries.
