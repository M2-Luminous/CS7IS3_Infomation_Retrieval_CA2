FBIS3-43947 "drafr014_c_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-014 Document Type:Daily Report 21 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 19 Jan MB1901135394 MB1901135394 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN PAC Gains Township Youth Support -- "Coinciding with the announcement of the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] decision to suspend the armed struggle has been the disclosure by a Sunday newspaper of an election poll in which the ANC [African National Congress] would get 64.4 percent of the vote to the PAC's 1.7 percent, with half of the ANC's Black supporters listing the PAC as their second choice," notes the page 6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 17 January. The PAC has gained the image, "particularly among radicalised township youth, as hard-nosed, more extreme and more aggressive than the ANC in recent times, particularly with its One settler, one bullet slogan. Abandoning attacks on White farmers and other civilian targets may make the PAC look like any other former liberation organisation." THE STAR IFP Backing 'Lagging By Miles' -- Referring to Zulu King Zwelithini's meeting with President de Klerk, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 19 January in a page 12 editorial says: "What is not clear is how far the king's concern with the Zulu monarchy and the 'kingdom of kwaZulu' reflects historical tradition as opposed to ambition and political affiliation (although he would deny the latter). By saying this we do not wish to pooh-pooh a lineage of kings which has stamped itself indelibly on our history, nor do we doubt that self-determination and the question of a double ballot are crucially important to many people." "Unfortunately the king resorted to a threat of resistance and indulged in rhetoric which is simply not supported by fact. Opinion polls suggest that backing for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] (and maintaining kwaZulu) is lagging by miles. They fail to substantiate the king's assertion that 'expunging the very name of my kingdom from the Constitution...has sent shock waves throughout the psyche of every one of our Zulu subjects'." THE STAR is glad discussions will continue, "but they need to be less emotively based." BUSINESS DAY Inkatha, White Right Avoid Feasible Settlement -- "There are good grounds for believing that neither Inkatha nor the white right wing is seriously seeking a feasible settlement," states a page 6 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 19 January. "A pattern is becoming apparent that, as soon as concessions are made, new demands arise. Nevertheless, the NP [National Party], the ANC and others involve in the next phase of talks with the Freedom Alliance, starting today, must not allow their scepticism to detract from good faith negotiations." SOWETAN De Klerk 'Forced To Show Sympathy' for Zulu Constituency -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 19 January in a page 6 editorial comments on the meeting between Zulu King Zwelithini and State President de Klerk in Pretoria, saying Zwelithini "is being manipulated by the politicians to do things that are unbecoming to a monarch." "For Chief Buthelezi this was a shrewd political move, made even more impressive by the concern expressed at acts of intimidation and the wanton killing of people. It was astute of him to play the role of loyal subject for the support he got was impressive even if it was mainly bused in. Buthelezi knows President de Klerk and the Government are forced to show sympathy to his and King Zwelithini's constituency. The bland political outcome, notwithstanding, the symbolism of having such a meeting at the very heart of Government had enormous impact." BEELD PAC Suspends Armed Struggle -- "The PAC's decision to suspend the armed struggle has been made dangerously late but is still very welcome," says a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 17 January. The organization has in the past renounced the struggle, and yet violence continued. "This has been evidence of scandalous opportunism," because while PAC leaders were in the mainstream of negotiations and were signing peace agreements, its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army, (APLA) continued its terror. The PAC on occasions tried to distance itself by claiming it was not really in control of its armed wing. "We accept that foreign governments have played a significant role in bringing the PAC to its senses." Big Western countries have for a long time been active behind the scenes. When African countries made the PAC realize that "its game was over," it had no choice but to suspend the armed struggle. "The PAC says the message on the ending of the struggle must be communicated to its people at ground level. This organization has to prove that it does have control over APLA. It will, therefore, have to play a credible role to help solve the problem it created." If not, the country will have to deal with violent elements which believe they can destabilize the country. The right wing, with its constant threats of a civil war, has to also realize this. "A continuing armed struggle will make everyone in the country a loser, while negotiations offer the country a second chance."
