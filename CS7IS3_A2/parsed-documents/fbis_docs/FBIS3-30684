The demonstrators argued that the operation of both parties involves the danger of a communist rollback. In a petition to be sent to Speaker of Parliament Gyorgy Szabad, the 56-ers demand that parliament should dissolve both parties, freeze their assets, and transfer them to the heroes of 1956 and their relatives. In the 56-ers' view, as many descendants of the 1956 victims as possible should be elected members of parliament and the government, so that the danger of a rollback will diminish. The petition presses for a coalition with Christian morals to be formed after the 1994 elections. Recent polls show that the socialists have strong voter support in the country, and the governing coalition sees them as its strongest rival. In a simultaneous development, those who suffered a loss in biohumus production demonstrated on the other side of the square. Biohumus producers took up loans some years ago. Afterwards, despite their valid contracts, they failed to sell biohumus and many of them went bankrupt. The 150 or so demonstrators gathered in front of parliament to support independent smallholder deputy Vilmos Bereczky's proposal of writing off their debts.
