NSC deputy chief Khachatphai Burutphat said the government has allowed the Burmese students to stay here on the condition that they do not use Thailand as a base for staging political moves against the Burmese government. "We will regard them as illegal immigrants and arrest them if they stage a protest against the presence of Burma at the Asean conference in July," he said. Khachatphai was responding to a report that Burmese students living along the border and at Maniloi holding centre in Ratchaburi province planned to organize a rally in front of the Bangkok hotel where the Asean meeting takes place on July 23-28. A high-ranking official in the Interior Ministry recently confirmed the ministry had been informed of the planned protest by Burmese at the holding centre who disagreed with the move. The official, who asked not to be named, said Burmese along the border had telephoned their friends at Maniloi and urged them to join the rally. "However there is a group of the students who disagree and they told the centre's chief about it," he said. The government opened the camp for the Burmese last year, but only about 200 of the 516 granted student-in-exile status have entered the camp. The official said the ministry had information that some Burmese students planned to sneak from the camp to join the protest in Bangkok. Students living in the camp can take leave for a few days with consent of the camp head. Rangoon's Foreign Minister, U Ohn Gyaw, will represent Burma at the meeting as guest of Thailand, the host country this year. The invitation has drawn strong criticism from several groups as Burma is still governed by the military. The junta, officially the State Law and Order Restoration Council, has detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi since 1989 and refused to hand over administrative power to the political party which won the 1990 elections. "Thailand has already been accused of supporting Burma's anti-government movement by allowing the Burmese students stay here. However, we will not stand by idly if they use the country as a base for launching political activities," said Khachatphai. The Maniloi camp chief would be instructed to restrict movement out of the camp before and during the Asean conference. Tight security would also be provided for the ministers attending the Asean forum, including the Burmese minister, he added. Deputy Permanent Secretary to Interior Chaloem Phromloet has also warned the Burmese they would be arrested and their student status revoked if they joined the protest. They would then be charged as illegal immigrants, interrogated and given the choice of being deported back to Burma or entering the Maniloi holding centre. "I don't really understand why the Burmese students would stage a protest as the Burmese minister, as guest of the host, will not participate in the full meeting. He will only attend certain functions," said Chaloem.
