[passage omitted] The bomb was found by Chantal Mansur, a teacher at the center, who alerted the army, the French embassy charge d'affaires Bernard Letourneau told AFP. [passage omitted] But Letourneau denied any plans to close down the center, which served as a consulate during the early days of Lebanon's 15-year civil war. He said the building was owned by the Maronite Catholic Sisters of the Holy Family, and they were renegotiating the lease which expires in 1995. "I don't know who the target was, the sisters or us. But it seems that this is the latest in a series of unfortunate attacks," he said referring to the February 27 church bombing. Letourneau added he had instructed the directors of all French cultural centers and schools in Lebanon "to be vigilant." An AFP photographer said army troops were stationed outside the center after the incident. Secretary General of the right-wing Phalange Party Karim Paqraduni -- which was devastated by a car-bomb in December which killed three and wounded 100 -- said he expected more attacks. "Thank God, today's attack was aborted. But I expect more bombings. They are part of a cycle which is aimed at the destabilisation of peace in Lebanon," Paqraduni told AFP. "Christians feel they are the victims of such terrorist acts and these attacks will continue as long as the assailants go unpunished." he added. [passage omitted]
