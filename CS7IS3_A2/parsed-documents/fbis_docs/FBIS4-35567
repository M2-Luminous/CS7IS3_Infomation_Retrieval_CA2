Our correspondent reports from the place where the settlers have convened: [Begin Matzliah recording] The heads of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza rented a particularly large hall for a particularly large convention in which their protest activities for the coming days are being presented. Jerusalem and Jericho are the two centers of these protest activities. In Jericho the settlers plan to take control of two Jewish points: the Na'aran synagogue which, contrary to its name, is not located near Kibbutz Na'aran but rather inside the autonomy area, and the Hasmonean Palace which is also located inside the autonomy area. The settlers intend to take control of these two points, to establish facts on the ground, and to remain there, as was the case with the ancient synagogue in Jericho. A large-scale protest is planned for Jerusalem too. The heads of the council are negotiating with businessmen in Jerusalem in an attempt to stage a general strike there on the day Yasir 'Arafat arrives in the area. Most importantly, do not dare let the PLO leader climb Temple Mount. [end recording]
