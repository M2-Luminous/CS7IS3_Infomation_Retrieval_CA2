Provincial party committee Secretary Li Zemin delivered an important speech at the meeting. He said: The party Central Committee recently issued a series of instructions concerning the overall situation in safeguarding reform and furthering stability. The provincial party committee standing committee and secretaries earnestly studied the instructions during their administrative meetings. Today's teleconference on early rice production is a major step in implementing the party Central Committee's instructions. All party committees and governments at or above the county level across the province should earnestly study General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng's important speeches at the central rural work conference and, in connection with local realities, put forward ideas for implementing their instructions in this year's rural work, which includes stabilizing grain production and promoting all-around development of the rural economy. At the teleconference, provincial party committee Deputy Secretary and Executive Vice Governor Chai Songyue analyzed the current situation in preparing for and carrying out spring farming across the province, and gave important instructions on properly planting sufficient early rice by every possible means and on strengthening leadership over early rice production. He said: There are three particular problems in the current spring-farming preparations and production: 1. There remains a certain disparity between grain production and fulfillment of the procurement task; 2. the price of goods, materials, and electricity for agricultural use have risen too sharply; 3. too much land has been requisitioned for development and industrial zones which actually make use of only a small portion. There are many instances where land is fenced up with no actual construction being carried out. [passage omitted] To mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm in grain farming, on behalf of the provincial party committee and government Chai Songyue reiterated three policies on grain production and marketing: 1. To guarantee procurement. Grain departments should procure in an open manner all early paddy handed in by the peasants regardless of whether or not it is covered by a procurement contract and whether or not it is new harvest; that is to say, they must not refuse the grain or impose a procurement limit. 2. To guarantee preset prices. They should, under all circumstances, firmly and fully honor early paddy procurement prices and extra-price policy already announced by the provincial government. 3. To guarantee the non-issue of IOU notes. In procuring grain, grain departments should manage to pay cash at the time they procure the grain. It is also necessary to ensure the honoring of all supportive policies formulated by individual localities. Various localities and departments must resolutely implement these policies and should never break their promise and hurt the peasants' enthusiasm. [passage omitted]
