[Begin recording] [Yi] In an interview with KBS, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin pointed out that North Korea is a dangerous state, not only for the ROK but also for the Middle East. He stressed that it is the responsibility of the international community to check North Korea's provocative intention. [Rabin] We look at North Korea as a great danger not only to your country but also to the Middle East. North Korea does not make any effort for the nonproliferation of weapons. It has even long-range missiles. The North Koreans do not participate in any international agreement in a practical way. To prevent preparations of non-conventional weapons and long-range missiles.... [Yi] Prime Minister Rabin said that the ROK's development experience will be helpful to the economic development in the Middle East, and hoped that the ROK will actively participate in the construction and industrialization fields. Prime Minister Rabin pointed out that the agreement on the implementation of the Palestinian autonomy is aimed at opening a new phase. Therefore, it is the most important issue for the two sides to reach a satisfactory agreement, thus suggesting a possibility of delaying the time of concluding the agreement. [Rabin] Even though the time is important, the basic question is to have an agreement with the Palestinians and with the PLO that will bring about implementation, a good one. [Yi] Prime Minister Rabin said that no fixed date has been designated for the withdrawal of the Israeli Army from the planned Palestinian autonomous area but only a goal is set for the withdrawal at an appropriate time. Therefore, the deadline for the withdrawal of 13 April is not likely to be the important issue of dispute. [end recording]
