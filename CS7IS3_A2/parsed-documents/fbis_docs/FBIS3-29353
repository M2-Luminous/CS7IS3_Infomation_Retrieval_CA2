A South Korean Embassy official in Moscow contacted Vladimir Kumachev, a senior researcher quoted in the press, and was told he was misquoted, Paek Nak-whan, director-general of European Affairs, said. Kumachev, with Russia's Institute of National Security and Strategic Research, was quoted as saying that North Korea has nuclear weapons "according to information we have received." He was also quoted as saying Pyongyang carried out nuclear tests in African countries. A Russian official, asked to verify the reports, said he wasn't even aware of the existence of the named institute. Kumachev told the South Korean Embassy official that he only said North Korea "could be" possessing nuclear arms as claimed by certain press reports and is trying to build up its weapons program, Paek said. The Russian official assured Seoul that North Korea does not have the precision technique involved for a nuclear weapons program and does not have the launching capability, he said.
