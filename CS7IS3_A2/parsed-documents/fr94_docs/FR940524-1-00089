FR940524-1-00089 FR940524-1-00011 In implementing the proposed regulation, NIOSH and MSHA will develop a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which will reflect the roles of both agencies in the respirator approval program. For example, the MOU will provide that NIOSH will notify MSHA immediately of field complaints and identified deficiencies concerning approved respirators. MSHA's rulemaking would remove part 11 from title 30. Removal of part 11 would, however, be contingent on publication of the NIOSH proposal as a final rule. All existing MSHA respirator use provisions in part 11 would be retained and recodified in 30 CFR parts 70 and 71. Commenters responding to the separate NIOSH proposal to revise the particulate filter provisions should direct those comments to NIOSH, to be included in the appropriate rulemaking record. The issue of MSHA's role in the approval of respirators will also be the subject of the NIOSH proposal and, therefore, commenters should direct responses on this issue to both MSHA and NIOSH. Both rulemaking activities will be coordinated to ensure that the level of protection afforded to miners and other affected workers is maintained at all times during the transition period. All technical data and commenter information will be shared by the respective agencies. III. Other Sections Affected After the title 42 rulemaking is completed and part 11 is removed, MSHA anticipates that conforming nomenclature revisions would be needed in standards in title 30 that reference the use of approved respirators. These conforming nomenclature revisions may require that references be made to NIOSH, or that references to MSHA or the Secretary of Labor be deleted. Nothing in the anticipated nomenclature revisions would change the compliance responsibility of mine operators, who would continue to be required to provide miners with ``approved'' respirators. IV. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866. In addition, this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not been prepared. V. Paperwork Reduction Act The recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 30 CFR part 11 would be transferred to 42 CFR part 84 under NIOSH. Comments on these requirements should be addressed directly to NIOSH.
