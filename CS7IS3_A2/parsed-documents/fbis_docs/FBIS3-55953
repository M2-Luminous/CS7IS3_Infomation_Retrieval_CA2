Today's plan of the joint flight envisages geophysical, medical, and biotechnological experiments, and the transfer of duties to the crew of the fifteenth main expedition. A cycle of video-filmings and spectrometeric observations of separate parts of the earth's continents and oceans are being carried out in keeping with the programme of studies of the earth's natural resources and the environment. The new crew, brought to the complex a short while ago, is carrying out a series of experiments to study in greater detail the mechanisms of the human organism's adaptation to the conditions of orbital flight, including by the method of blood composition. The biotechnological experiment, started on January 10, is being continued. Its purpose is to explore the possibility of obtaining hybrid cells of plants in conditions of imponderability. The old crew of the complex is to check during the day the condition of the board systems of the "Soyuz TM-17" vehicle and to prepare it for the return voyage to the earth. Reports received from the cosmonauts and telemetric data show that the flight is proceeding normally.
