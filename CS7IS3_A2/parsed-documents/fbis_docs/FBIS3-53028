The U.S. delegation arrived in western al-Biqa' in south Lebanon across the border from Syria and carried out a four-hour field tour of several villages before returning to Syria. Some Lebanese newspapers have criticized the visit. The Lebanese newspaper AL-DIYAR, mouthpiece of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, said the visit has created a diplomatic crisis-like atmosphere between Lebanon and the United States. AL-DIYAR said diplomatic sources in the Lebanese Foreign Ministry have not concealed their astonishment at the way the visit took place without official quarters being informed, especially the Foreign Ministry, and without any meeting being sought with any Lebanese official to explain the delegation's mission.
