At present, cooperation boils down to humanitarian aid in many cases. It is aid for survival, but not development aid. In many situations, the problems encountered are also not limited to national borders. While accompanying Foreign Minister Willy Claes to Kigali, the secretary of state for development aid had the opportunity to reaffirm that Belgium is the state which grants most aid to Rwanda. In these conditions, our country has the right to give a clear message: Things must change. For Derijcke, the institutional vacuum prevailing in Rwanda as in other countries prevents action worthy of the name. "Without an interlocutor, you can give immediate aid to the populations but you cannot do anything else," the secretary of state explained. With a few weeks to go before the negotiations on the second financial section of Lome, Erik Derijcke gave us his impression on the state of this convention and the lines which Belgium intends to follow in acting in the cooperation sphere. In short: Agriculture, education, and health will be the spearheads of an approach which is more regional, more integrated, and longer term. In addition, the populations, and particularly the women, will have to be involved in the plans. For Erik Derijcke, the most difficult thing is to make the populations understand the cooperation policy. "We must try to bridge the gap between problems and policy," he said as a preamble. [Grogna] Does Europe have the means of pursuing an effective cooperation policy? [Derijcke] I think that the means exist. The European Development Fund (FED) is by far the biggest fund in the world. Belgium alone contributes some 3 billion Belgian francs [BFr] to it. It is undoubtedly possible to do a great deal with such resources. There is also the Center for Industrial Development, which provides aid to entrepreneurs wishing to try a venture in the ACP [African, Caribbean, and Pacific] countries. But these are bodies which are perhaps not working at full stretch. [passage omitted] [Grogna] Africa is lagging behind. Is this not the result of the policy pursued for 30 years by the former colonists? [Derijcke] Africa's weakness probably stems from responses which we have had for 30 years. I admit we made mistakes during decolonization which was aimed, primarily, at maintaining the advantages of the former colonists. But I reject statements that the Africans are our brothers. After 30 years, I think it is old-fashioned and pointless. This is a tone of dependence which does not encourage the Africans to make efforts for their development. In Asia or Latin America, this policy of dependence did not exist and the opposition movements developed sooner. Today, these parts of the world are reaping the rewards of that. [Grogna] Africa's geographical situation has also had a negative impact... [Derijcke] The geopolitical situation was devastating for sub-Saharan Africa. The countries were divided into two camps, between the West and the East, thus creating greater dependence. Then, when the Berlin Wall fell, most of these countries were left out. The European countries have always tried to dominate the African countries which are now paying the price of our mistakes. To realize this, you just have to look at what is happening in the countries in the CFA franc area. That was another form of domination. Today, these 13 states are faced with reality and are suffering as a result. What Belgium has done in Central Africa was also the result of this policy. When cooperation was halted, Zaire was receiving BFr3 billion per year, of which 2 billion were for Belgian aid workers alone. That was not very sensible when hundreds of African students were coming out of our universities. It would have been better to help them to use their knowledge. In general, neocolonialism has had many negative consequences. [Grogna] At present, we should probably compensate and help the populations.... [Derijcke] We are trying. But it is very difficult to convince a certain African political class to think differently. The whole tragedy of Lome lies in the fact that we are talking with a political class which rejects change and not with the populations. I am convinced that development should call for joint responsibility. It must be put back into its cultural context. This is the success of Asia where cooperation is entirely different because the leaders know what they want. In Africa, we have always said what we wanted for them. [Grogna] Do you think that opinion is ready to change in Belgium? [Derijcke] I think so. In the Belgian Parliament too, because it is composed of a class of deputies who no longer have very close ties with the former colonies. But, to ensure that the debate on joint responsibility, complementarity, and consistency succeeds, the main development bodies must think the same thing. It is only when these big multilateral institutions bring about a responsible aid policy that we will be able to succeed. I think it would be a complete illusion to think that Belgium could single-handedly bring about economic recovery in Rwanda, or Burundi, or Zaire. We must work in a complementary way. This is the most fundamental debate which I tried to introduce at the European level during the Belgian presidency. [Grogna] Are the other countries prepared to follow your lead? [Derijcke] I have observed a change of thinking. There are different strategies within the European Council of Ministers. On the one hand there are countries which do not have much of a colonial past like Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium -- a group which will be strengthened by the countries which will join the Union. This group runs counter to the two big powers. Britain tries to sublimate its cooperation policy by a nonpolicy. Its recent adventure with the supply of arms to Malaysia is significant at this level. Finally, the French have great problems. Even for such a powerful country it is impossible to try to solve the economic problems in the CFA franc area countries single-handedly. The political change in the thinking of the French politicians is significant. They are obliged to call on their partners. [Grogna] This collaboration probably also would enable better use to be made of financial resources. [Derijcke] Indeed we do need international cooperation to avoid paying for the same problems several times over. Economic destabilization and industrial backwardness lead to political destabilization. As a result, we have to intervene with humanitarian aid, take part in the demobilization of the army, and think of cooperation. When that does not succeed, we have to intervene with emergency aid. It would be more useful to follow the same paths to achieve the same objectives. [passage omitted] [Grogna] There is sometimes an impression that Belgium is currently moving toward the regions which it knows least well, like Southeast Asia, at the expense of Africa. Even if you refuse to talk of historical ties, we have expertise in those countries. Would it not be more effective to concentrate on them? [Derijcke] Contrary to a widespread idea, Belgium has not abandoned Africa. More than 80 percent of our aid is still devoted to it. Belgium is the biggest per capita provider of aid to Africa. Our presence on the other continents is more limited. In Latin America, we devote our attentions to three countries (Ecuador, Bolivia, and Suriname) where we are achieving good results. In Asia, we have strongly reduced our aid to Indonesia and Thailand, but we have started cooperation with countries of the future like Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. We are also resuming cooperation with the Philippines -- a country which is making great efforts and which is important for our small- and medium-sized enterprises. [Grogna] Is it not a mistake to associate democracy and human rights with development? The Asian countries are not models of democracy and yet they are developing. [Derijcke] I have worked a great deal at the European level for the integration of human rights in cooperation policies. I attach importance to the problem of respecting human rights. However, the problem of democratization is less clear. In my view, if there is a desire to improve the existing situation, that is important in itself. In Indonesia, we received an outright rejection of our human rights policy. [Grogna] Do you think human rights are the key to development? [Derijcke] It is impossible to pursue an honorable policy if there is not stability and peace. [Grogna] Is Belgium accepted in the community of big nations in the cooperation sphere? [Derijcke] Absolutely. Unlike some big states, nobody is afraid of Belgium. In addition, we have considerable resources. We are in demand everywhere. Our African experience is recognized. In Asia, our policy in the sphere of energy, health, education...interests many countries. States in which we had no presence are calling on us. Mali, Burkina-Faso, Benin, and Togo are asking to cooperate with us. In this region, we are working on the basis of integrated cooperation. [Grogna] What does that mean? [Derijcke] These are countries which experience the same problems. We are trying to help them in the same way. It is important to realize that many cannot overcome their problems unless they try to solve their problems in cooperation with their neighbors. You just have to look at the example of Rwanda and Burundi. They are now dependent on international aid. But their future probably will depend on integrated development with Uganda, Tanzania, and southeastern Zaire. The economic integration of the southern African countries (Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi) is a success which should lead other regions to consider this solution. [Grogna] We are calmly approaching the negotiation of the second financial section of the Lome Convention. What is your attitude to these countries? [Derijcke] Three essential points must be highlighted. We will insist on including the reference to human rights in Article 5 of the Convention. This is a priority, especially because we are stricter in cooperation with non-ACP countries than with countries which are members of the Convention. In addition, we want to administer the payments more efficiently. We want to help the poorest countries but not without results. We will therefore be stricter and will only pay when there are real opportunities to use the resources. We must also plan in a more rational way and urge a degree of economic discipline. We must revitalize the economies, taking account also of the GATT results: To help the Africans to export in this new world order of trade. That is why we must organize basic production more effectively and revive exports. The nongovernmental organizations are afraid of this policy, fearing that the Africans will be swamped by our imported products. Belgium does not intend to end its food aid (to which 75 percent of our aid is devoted), but we must also prepare Africa to take part in world trade. I do not want it to continue to be treated as a powerless continent. [Grogna] Do you think that the ACP countries are prepared to agree to discuss a reorganization of the convention? [Derijcke] This is probably the biggest problem. However, I think we must have discussions to achieve progress. Unfortunately, the ACP countries are not asking questions, are not making their ideas heard. [Grogna] This probably shows that the political class has not changed much in recent years. [Derijcke] Indeed. The political class is often isolated, it does not even understand the population's needs. Whether you like it or not, development toward democratization is necessary. This will take time. We know that and we do not want to hurry anything. We are just waiting for positive signs, the establishment of bases for discussion. We do not want elections at any cost in all the countries. Elections are the culmination of a long process. We are just asking the countries to start the process. [Grogna] Do you believe in the future of the ACP? Is it not a term which is now meaningless? [Derijcke] The term comes from the former colonies, but no longer means anything. I would like to play down the notion of the ACP. The African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries are totally different. However, I do not want to call into question the Lome Convention in which I firmly believe: It is a superb tool which has enormous resources. It must change, while safeguarding the idea of it. [Grogna] Aside from human rights, what are the priorities for ensuring that bilateral cooperation functions well in general? [Derijcke] Our bilateral cooperation stands up well. However, I would still like to develop along several lines: Fewer countries and better specialization; changing our university cooperation (reducing the number of African students in our country and investing in quality education in their countries to prevent cultural disaffection); imparting new dynamism to our aid workers and reducing their presence in a single country, where they eventually forget their mission.... [Grogna] Will Belgium have a presence in Zaire? [Derijcke] If a government worthy of the name is installed, we will be present. This does not mean we are now no longer doing anything. We are virtually the only country giving them aid. In 15 months, Belgium has paid out some BFr750 million for Zaire. [Grogna] Does the institutional vacuum not present a problem? [Derijcke] It presented a problem but the law now enables me to work directly with the Higher Council of the Republic.
