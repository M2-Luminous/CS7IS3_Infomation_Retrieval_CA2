Stanic Should Remain Party Secretary"] [Text] Ljubljana/Zgornje Pirnice -- At a closed session on Saturday [18 June], the caucus of the Slovene Christian Democrats [SKD] discussed the situation in the party for several hours and, with a special conclusion, opted in favor of the party's consolidation and the majority principle in decision-making, SKD press spokesman Valentin Hajdinjak told the STA news agency after the meeting. The party will assert the majority rule at all levels of decision-making. In this way it will pursue a uniform political policy that shall be determined through the will of majority, the participants of the caucus -- which consists of party's executive committee, its ministers and its deputies -- decided. In cases where the party will not have a stance, the majority opinion within the club of deputies shall prevail. They also proposed to draw up the rules of procedure or regulations for the better work of the club of deputies and the party and, thus, fight the belief that the party is divided. The participants of the caucus expressed disagreement with the resignation of the party's secretary general, Edvard Stanic, and urged him to withdraw his resignation. Stanic has taken time for consideration and will announce his decision at the session of the party council today.
