It praised the Alliance of Palestinian Forces. It said that this alliance constitutes a political drive of the large-scale massive rejection of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and is solid ground for unifying our people in their confrontation of the dangers threatening them. The Islamic Jihad statement added: Toppling those who are negotiating with the Zionists in the name of our people requires an extensive popular action to prove to the whole world that this desperate team does not represent our people, and therefore, cannot determine their future. This team's agreements are not binding on our people. We must all move within cohesive national ranks to show the whole world that those negotiators only represent themselves and parochial interests. The Islamic Jihad in Palestine called on the valiant people of the revolution to direct their bullets to the chests of the occupiers. On the occasion of the blessed month of Ramadan, the month of jihad and sacrifices, it said: We call on all the sons of our people to strictly adhere to God's teachings, to safeguard the sanctity of the blessed month, to abide by the principles of the true religion, to carry out more acts of jihad, and to escalate the intifadah activities. It declared 6 February a day of comprehensive strike and popular indignation all over Palestine.
