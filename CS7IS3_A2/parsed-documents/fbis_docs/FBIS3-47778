The land, which was left almost waste for quite a long time, as it was subjected to droughts for six months and floods for the other six months of a year. A few people settled down in this area. Every year they just came in November to harvest floating rice which grew naturally during flood seasons. In order to turn that quadrangele into arable lands, the province implemented a five-year programme 1988-1992 with the total investment capital of 400 billion dong contributed by both the central and the local governments. Roads were upgraded, canals and ditches dredged and many rural areas supplied with electricity. As a result more and more poeple came and settled down in the quadrangle, bringing its population to 1.5 million. Farmers began farming double rice crops and got an average yield of 9.8 tonnes/ha/year, making An Giang the biggest rice producer in the country in 1993 with an output of nearly 2 million tonnes.
