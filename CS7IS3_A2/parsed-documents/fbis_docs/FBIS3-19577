The Foreign Ministry has said that, in a telephone conversation today, the two ministers resolved to discuss further joint steps regarding Kinkel's visit to Paris on 24 March. Reports on alleged anxious remarks by French Ambassador Francois Scheer on Franco-German relations were devoid of any foundation. Scheer met Dieter Kastrup, state secretary in the Foreign Ministry, this morning. According to media reports there was annoyance in Bonn about Scheer's remarks. Speaking to foreign correspondents in Bonn, Scheer had, among other things, called for closer cooperation between France and Germany in the expansion of the European Union.
