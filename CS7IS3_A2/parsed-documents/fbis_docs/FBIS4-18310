The ISTAT report went on to confirm how unemployment was highest in the south but showed a slight decline, 18.80 percent in January compared to 18.94 in October, and was significantly lower in Central Italy, where there was a minor decline from 9.84 percent to 9.5 percent, and while lowest in the north saw an increase from October to January, 7.16 percent against 6.87 percent in October of last year. An analysis by ISTAT claimed how rising unemployment appeared to have leveled out after its steep hike from January 1993 to October of that year, when it leaped 9.39 percent to 11.29 percent. In absolute terms, however, the quarter under examination saw a net decline in jobholders equal to 210,000 units, once seasonably adjusted. ISTAT also drew attention to the alarming fact that, between October of last year and January of 1994, there was a marked increase in the number of people looking for employment with work experience, while those looking for their first job declined, but probably only due to discouragement, ISTAT said. Looking over the 12-month period, the number of unemployed rose by 835,000, of which 452,000 were men and 383,000 women. ISTAT data also showed how Italy's work force in general has shrunk from 40.59 percent of the population to 39.8 percent. The greatest number of jobs lost was recorded by ISTAT in industry, down 404,000 posts, and the tertiary sector, off 334,000 and that employees were the hardest hit, down 628 percent [as received]. Examination of the ISTAT report on a regional basis saw unemployment two and a half times greater in the south than the north, while more than a quarter of the female work force was out of a job.
