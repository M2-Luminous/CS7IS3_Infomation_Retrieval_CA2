Liberal market advocates saw in it a step backward to the socialist authoritarian method of production management and communists, a change of the signboard not affecting the economic foundation of present Russia, while centrists viewed the document with guarded expectation. We will recall that the edict provides for the transfer of most state enterprises not subject to privatization to government expense. The new status significantly limits the rights of production workers in the management of plants and factories. Without the consent of the government they can no longer establish subsidiary firms, lease out premises, and take credits. No matter what monetarists may say, such restrictions are fully justified. As soon as a power declares that it intends to reserve for itself the right of an owner of a number of production structures, it would be totally unwise to stop controlling their activity, closing its eyes to the plundering of its property and to its passing to private individuals. The part of the presidential edict that discusses the prohibition to reduce work places at state enterprises seems much more interesting and important. If we take into consideration that the change in status will affect primarily chronically (within the last two years) unprofitable plants, among which the lion's share belongs to the military-industrial complex (its privatization will be affected to the smallest degree), it becomes obvious: The authorities have finally realized the danger of mass bankruptcies and mass unemployment in the country. Another thing is also obvious: The unprofitable military industry can be kept afloat only at the price of gigantic budget subsidies and the budget can be replenished only at the expense of profitable enterprises through an increase in the tax burden. Hence it follows that the president's and the government's intention to lower taxes by 10 to 20 percent, as promised in another presidential edict ("On Some Problems of Tax Policy"), is either an open bluff, or a sincere attempt to keep up with the second "rabbit," which will never be caught. Well, something always has to be sacrificed. The chief thing is to see to it that this tax sacrifice is not in vain and that unprofitable enterprises do not drag with them to the bottom the ship of the Russian economy, which is sinking as it is.
