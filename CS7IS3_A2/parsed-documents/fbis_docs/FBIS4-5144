Hata is expected to meet Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, on April 15 as the two visit there for the signing of a new global trade pact known as the Uruguay Round Trade Agreement. The Hata-Kantor meeting is expected to produce "good results" as there are signs that Washington is softening its stance on bilateral economic issues, said the top official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The official stressed the need to reach agreement by around June 10 when Emperor Akihito visits the United States and suggested that Japan should decide on "drastic" measures to do so. As for U.S. policy on Japan, the official said the issue of how to deal with the nuclear problem in North Korea seems to be given top priority in U.S. policy on Japan. "It seems that the Clinton administration to date has separated security issues from trade issues in trade negotiations with Japan but recently they appear to have linked security issues with trade issues," the official said.
