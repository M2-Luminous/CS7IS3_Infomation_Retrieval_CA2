According to preliminary assessments, as of the evening of 26 April, the group collected 130 signatures. The list, however, is not yet closed -- the collection of signatures continues. Having obtained the support of a third of the deputies, the initiators of this action continue to pursue their goal. The same sources have reported that the number of signatories increased after Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk had revealed his intention to ask the Supreme Council to change its resolution on the summer elections. There is another very interesting fact. Among deputies who have signed the motion, are those who are affiliated to entirely opposing teams of candidates for the presidency, including teams which consider the elections absolutely essential.
