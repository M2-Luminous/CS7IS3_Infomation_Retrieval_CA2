Dr. Sergio Mena Mendez, ARENA's legal representative, presented to the TSE General Secretariat a petition to investigate the vote count because, according to ARENA's count, there is a difference of more than 38,000 votes that cannot be found anywhere. Mena Mendez said his party knows perfectly well that the deadline to contest the election results has expired, and that it only wants the TSE to correct the mistakes that were made to prevent them from being repeated in the runoff. Mena Mendez said that after the final results of the vote count for deputies were disclosed, members of ARENA discovered an inexplicable difference of more than 38,000 votes between the figures for deputies and the figures for president. According to party representatives, this difference of 38,000 votes resulted from "a computation error at a specific number of voting tables in San Salvador Municipality; it is an error that affects all of the parties." Mena Mendez said the party does not know where the error could have occurred, and this is precisely what it is asking the TSE to investigate. As is well-known, all of the polling stations were manned by a representative from each party, and because of this, it is nearly inconceivable that more than 38,000 votes could have been lost, including the vote count certificates that are signed by each of the party representatives. Mena Mendez argues that there were more votes for deputies than for president which, according to ARENA, is unusual. Nevertheless, the trend is proportional in terms votes garnered by the respective parties. In other words, all of the parties received more votes for deputies than for president. Meanwhile, TSE President Dr. Luis Arturo Zaldivar said the deadline to contest the presidential election results has already expired, adding that ARENA's request is "completely out of place." Furthermore, he denied that such a mistake occurred at the TSE computation center.
