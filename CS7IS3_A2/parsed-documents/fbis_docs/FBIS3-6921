And, on March 22, he issued even a belligerent "order" to the puppet Army units to be "on the alert". Accordingly, the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff proclaimed "an order of special alert" covering the period from March 23 to 30, putting the puppet ground, Navy and Air Forces on "a war footing". Thus, the South Korean trigger-happy elements are madly pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. As is known to all, the Kim Yong-sam group, after unilaterally breaking up the working-level contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South, openly declared that it would resume the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises with the United States, its master, and is driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of strain by introducing even Patriot missiles into South Korea of the United States. The "order" of an "alert posture" which was issued on the extension line of such unpardonable dangerous military provocations against the North well shows to what extremes the traitor Kim Yong-sam has gone in his belligerent attempt to overpower the North by force of arms at any cost with the help of outside forces. The North is prepared for both dialogue and war. This is its unshakable stand and will. If the South Korean puppet clique venture a reckless war gamble, remaining deaf to the DPRK's repeated warnings, the North would take a decisive self-defensive measure against it.
