At a working lunch on Monday [31 January], he told Clinton that "not only the text but also the spirit of the agreement must be fulfilled," the chancellor told the press in Washington. The new agreement, which was negotiated in autumn, is in danger because the U.S. Administration so far has only partially approved it. Exports from both sides want to make a new state this week to abolish the differences of opinion. The outcome of the controversy is important for the German Lufthansa airline, which has concluded an agreement with the U.S. airline United Airlines on joint services (code sharing) on the basis of this agreement. This, too, has not yet been accepted by Washington as a whole. Lufthansa chief Juergen Weber said a partial approval, according to which Lufthansa can offer flights in the United States in cooperation with United Airlines is "almost worthless." The partner company has not yet been granted the same rights by the U.S. side for Germany and other countries. The Bonn Transportation Ministry said it would be a violation of good faith if the United States were to try to call the bases of cooperation between Lufthansa and United Airlines into question. The U.S. competitors American and Delta Airlines are raging at the U.S. Administration against the agreements between the two companies. In this connection, it was said in Bonn that these airlines should know that they are hurting themselves by torpedoing the agreement. Informed circles did not rule out that the Federal Government might cancel the old contract, on which the new agreement is based. This would mean that every single U.S. flight to the FRG would have to be approved individually.
