Resist is usually removed by dry/wet processes. The technology for dry removal of resist using oxygen plasma (hereinafter referred to as ashing) has been used widely for more than a decade. Problems in the ashing process include damage such as charge-up and metal contamination, and the ashing residue. This report describes ashing technologies usable with 256M DRAMs. Damage Damage produced in the ashing process can be divided into four categories: metal contamination, charge-up, ion impact damage, and UV irradiation damage. Each of these will be described below. 1. Metal Contamination When an alkali metal (usually Na) is implanted in SiO[.sup]2[/] during ashing, mobile ions are generated varying the threshold voltage of MOS transistors. Similarly, the implantation of heavy metal in an Si wafer or Si[.sup]2[/] causes stacking faults, or a deterioration of the withstand voltage of the gate-oxide film of MOS transistors. It is agreed that the target value of metal contamination with 256M DRAMs should be no more than 1 x 10[.sup]9[/]/cm[.sup]2[/]. With ashing using oxygen plasma, the metal oxides in the resist cannot be removed due to the low vapor pressure, and hence remain on the wafer surface. There are even cases in which the metal penetrates the oxide film, depending on the processing condition of the ashing. The major causes of this are ion impact (knock-on), charge-up, and temperature, but the detailed mechanism is not yet known. Success in the reduction of metal contamination lies in reducing the influence of charged particles, so the use of down-flow ashing or ozone ashing is optimum for this purpose. From the viewpoint of the process, studying the addition of H[.sup]2[/]O,[.sup]1[/] or low-temperature ashing may be necessary. 2. Charge-Up In the ashing process, charged particles in the plasma cause charge-up and degrade the withstand voltage of the gate insulation film. This charge-up can be evaluated by measuring the V[.sup]fb[/] shift of MNOS diodes. With this method, after previously identifying the relationship between the voltage applied to the gate of MNOS diodes, V[.sup]a[/], and the V[.sup]fb[/] shift (_D_V[.sub]fb[/]), the relative potential and polarity of the gate electrode with respect to the Si wafer is estimated from _D_V[.sup]fb[/] after plasma processing. Figure 1 shows the structure of an MNOS diode, and Figure 2 shows the relationship between the voltage applied to the gate of an MNOS diode, V[.sup]a[/], and the V[.sup]fb[/] shift (_D_V[.sub]fb[/]) when the voltage application period is 1 minute. The detection limit in _D_V[.sup]fb[/] evaluation is variable depending on the sample structure and measuring method, but in general it is +/- 0.1 V with _D_V[.sup]fb[/]. Among the currently available ashing equipment, the equipment with _D_V[.sup]fb[/] within +/- 0.1 V uses the down-flow system as with coaxial ashing equipment (with the electrode design optimized) and microwave down-flow ashing equipment (with the chamber structure optimized) or does not use plasma as with ozone ashing equipment. The equipment providing smaller _D_V[.sup]fb[/], while performing ashing processing in plasma, includes the helical asher (_D_V[.sup]fb[/] � +/- 0.25 V) and microwave asher (_D_V[.sup]fb[/] � 0.4 V). Figure 1. Structure of MNOS Diode Figure 2. Relationship Between Voltage Applied to MNOS With ashing equipment using capacity-coupling RF plasma or surface-wave microwave plasma,[.sup]2[/] it is necessary to reduce charge-up by applying the down-flow system in which the wafer is separated from the plasma discharge area, or by improving the uniformity of plasma density through the optimization of the equipment or process. 3. Ion Impact Damage Ion impacts cause the knock-on of metals, sputtering and crystal defects. Ion impact energy is determined by the difference between the plasma potential and wafer potential. Crystal defects can be evaluated by thermal wave measurement. Figure 3 shows the results of thermal wave measurements by irradiating four kinds of plasma. The down-flow (coaxial) ashing equipment presents an identical thermal wave signal level to the reference; the microwave ashing equipment, which exposes the wafer to plasma, increases the signal level slightly; and the O[.sup]2[/] RIE equipment (V[.sub]DC[/] = -100 V), which uses a large ion impact energy, increases the signal level drastically. Figure 3. Thermal Wave Signals of Various 4. UV Irradiation Damage When vacuum UV rays (_l_ = 140 nm or less) above the band gap energy of SiO[.sup]2[/] (8.8 eV) is irradiated, electron-hole pairs are produced in SiO[.sup]2[/] and the holes are trapped near the interfaces.[.sup]3[/] It has also been reported that, in a photo-etching experiment, neutral traps were produced by etching using UV rays with _l_ = 194 nm.[.sup]4[/] As seen from the above, it is desirable to avoid UV rays with _l_ = 200 nm or less as much as possible. Problems in Resist Removal As it is said that particles of more than one-fifth to one-tenth the minimum fabrication size degrade the device characteristics and decrease yield, the production of particles with diameters of more than 0.05 to 0.02 �m should be minimized with 256M DRAMs (0.25 to 0.20 �m process). There has been little research on the removal of these particles (residues) in ashing, but the basic orientation may be to use ashing for the removal of organic components (resist) and use a wet process for the removal of inorganic components (metals, etc.), contained in the resist. (It is desirable that ashing turns the inorganic components into a state easily removable by a wet process at the same time as removing the organic components.) Resist removal by the ashing process is specially difficult in cases where the resist is hard to release due to modification after high-dose ion implantation, for example, and in cases where the reaction products attached during etching remain as residues after aluminum etching or gate etching. These examples will be described in detail below. 1. Resist Removal After High-Dose Ion Implantation When high-dose ions are implanted using a positive resist as the mask, the rise in temperature due to ion impact degrades the resist surface, causing a drastic drop in the ashing rate in cases where the ashing is based on oxygen radicals. If ashing is processed at high temperature to increase the ashing rate, a phenomenon in which the resist splits into small pieces (pumping) occurs, and the resist turns into a state in which complete removal is impossible (a state in which oxidation is difficult). Figure 4 [photos not reproduced] shows a cross-sectional SEM micrograph after the pumping of a resist. The pumping is considered to be due to the emission of N[.sup]2[/] or other degases from the lower part of the resist that has not been degraded by high-temperature ashing. The pumping can be prevented by eliminating the gases in the resist by applying UV curing or hard baking to the resist before ion implantation. However, a fine residue is produced in the case of ashing based on oxygen radicals, even after UV curing or hard baking. For the present, such residue is removed by post-cleaning. The most effective method to remove the degenerated layer on the surface is ashing using the reaction with ion impact. It has been reported that H[.sup]2[/]O + H[.sub]2[/] RIE is capable of complete dry removal of ion-implanted resist.[.sup]5[/] However, as plasma processing, such as RIE, is accompanied by the potential of charge-up, ion impact damage, and contamination due to the chamber, such damage must be reduced. 2. Resist Release After Aluminum Etching Figure 5 [photo not reproduced] shows a cross-sectional SEM micrograph of the result of ashing with O[.sup]2[/] plasma after aluminum etching. The residue shown in the photo is a compound of the aluminum sputtered during etching. A similar residue is also produced after via hole etching. Figure 6 [photo not reproduced] shows a cross-sectional SEM micrograph after via hole etching. This residue has previously been removed by ashing and a chemical solution process, but it has recently been reported that it can be removed by F + H[.sup]2[/]O down-flow ashing and pure water processing.[.sup]6[/] The proposed mechanism is to substitute the aluminum compound with fluoride by F + H[.sup]2[/]O down-flow ashing and dissolve it in pure water. To deal with aluminum corrosion, a system has been implemented in which the etching equipment, ashing equipment, and wet tank are coupled to perform resist removal continuously in vacuum. 3. Resist Release After Gate Etching Highly selective etching of poly-Si uses HBr gas. When poly-Si etched with an HBr-type gas is ashed with O[.sup]2[/] plasma, a residue is produced on the resist sidewalls.[.sup]7[/] This residue is silicon oxide film produced when SiBr[.sup]x[/] deposited during etching reacts in the atmosphere. A similar residue is also observed in low-temperature etching of poly-Si using Cl[.sup]2[/] gas.[.sup]8[/] This residue can be removed by wet etching (SiO[.sup]2[/]) but removal through ashing is being studied to reduce the decrease of the film on the base SiO[.sup]2[/]. There has been a report that it can be removed by O[.sup]2[/] + CF[.sup]4[/] down-flow ashing. Conclusion Ashing methods which do not damage devices of the 256M DRAM class may be low-temperature ashing of the down-flow or ozone-type which cuts UV rays of _l_ = 200 nm or less. Reduction of fine residue (with diameters of 0.05 to 0.02 �m or more) is a concept left for the future. Resist remaining after high-dose ion implantation can be removed either by the complete-removal method using plasma or by the method using ashing (down-flow or ozone system) based on oxygen radicals by combining post-processing such as UV curing and hard baking and post-cleaning. One of these methods may be selected depending on the reduction of fine residue and damage in the equipment using plasma. There are cases in which reaction products deposited during etching tend to remain as residue after post-etching resist release. A method of adding fluorine-type gas has been proposed to remove the residue, but since the addition of such gas results in etching of Si and SiO[.sup]2[/], this requires an improved selection ratio (with respect to Si and SiO[.sup]2[/]), an improved ashing rate, uniformity, and stable end-point detection. As the production of residue after post-etching resist release is in large part affected by the etching technology, new problems are expected to occur as etching technology changes in the future.
