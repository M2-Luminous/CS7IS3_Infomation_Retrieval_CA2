He added: [Begin recording] [Afshar] Since the beginning of the atrocity against the Muslims of Bosnia, sorrow has entered the hearts of our popular and Hezbollah forces -- in particular our Basij forces -- who have been awaiting the right opportunity to be present on the scene of defending the Muslims. The present situation in Gorazde is rather strange considering that the United Nations declared the town as a safe haven, and we know that if global arrogance wishes, it is capable of stopping the Serbs, especially when one considers what happened after Iraq's attack on Kuwait. Under the present circumstances, that is after the attack by Serbian froces on Gorazde, there is increasing pressure on the minds of Muslims, in particular on our Basij forces. There have been numerous phone calls from our Basij personnel to our barracks and headquarters, urging the officials to facilitate their dispatch to the area. [Correspondent] In your opinion, how many personnel can the Basij force dispatch to Bosnia as part of the UN peacekeeping forces? [Afshar] We can meet the demand for any number of forces, such as say 10,000 or 20,000, or in fact any number which is necessary for Goradze in particular or Bosnia-Herzegovina in general. All these forces are of course volunteers. We are, moreover, prepared to send these volunteers without expecting to receive any payment from international organizations. [end recording]
