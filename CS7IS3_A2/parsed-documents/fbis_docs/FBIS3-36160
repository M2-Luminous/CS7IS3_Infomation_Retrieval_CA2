In his first public speech after his appointment Dubinin told the Duma Budgetary Commission Wednesday night that there had to be no replay of 1993 "when the budget indices were unduly high." That approach, he said, was justly criticized by numerous ministries who complained of shortage of funds, in particular for defense orders and agriculture. "We agree that the projects planned in 1993 for the first quarter (of 1994) have to be financed. We are looking for additional sources of revenue and believe that financial priorities must be set," Dubinin said. In his words, 4 Tn [trillion] rubles will be appropriated for that purpose in the first quarter of 1994 but "now priorities are being set for using this amount." The acting minister said: "We know that tax revenues in the first quarter of the year will amount to 8.5 Tn rubles and we will receive nothing over that amount. Therefore the expenses must be kept within these limits. We also know for sure that the tax revenues will not exceed 80 to 100 Tn rubles during the year." Dubinin thought that significant revenues were not to be expected from foreign trade because the export prices of Russian goods have become nearly equal to world market prices. He said that the 1994 budget draft would be submitted to the government before Monday, February 7.
