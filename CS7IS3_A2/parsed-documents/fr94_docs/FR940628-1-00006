FR940628-1-00006 FR940628-1-00001 The current regulations in §82.4 prohibit the interstate movement from a quarantined area of carcasses and parts of carcasses of birds and poultry, including birds and poultry that are not known to be infected with END. We believe that this provision is unnecessarily restrictive, and that carcasses and parts of carcasses of birds and poultry not known to be infected with END can be moved interstate under certain conditions without an undue risk of disease spread. We are therefore proposing to allow such movement, as described below. As noted in the preceding paragraph, the current regulations refer to ``carcasses and parts of carcasses.'' We believe that the term ``carcasses'' might give the impression that only dressed carcasses are being referred to, such as those handled at slaughtering establishments. In some cases in this proposed rule, that is what we are referring to. In other cases, however, we are referring to any dead birds or poultry, whether they have been dressed or not. To avoid confusion as to what we are referring to, in this proposed rule we use the wording ``dead birds and dead poultry, including any parts of the dead birds and dead poultry,'' when all dead birds and dead poultry, including dressed carcasses, are being referred to. We use the term ``dressed carcasses'' when the intent is to limit the provisions to birds and poultry that have been eviscerated, with heads and feet removed. To be moved interstate, dead birds and dead poultry that are not known to be infected with END and that are intended for disposal, including any parts of the dead birds and dead poultry, would have to be accompanied by a permit, the dead birds and dead poultry would have to be covered in such a way as to prevent feathers and other debris from blowing or falling off the means of conveyance, and the dead birds and dead poultry would have to be either moved under official seal or accompanied by a Federal representative. Official seal would be defined in §82.1 as a serially numbered metal or plastic strip, consisting of a self-locking device on one end and a slot on the other end, that forms a loop when the ends are engaged and that cannot be reused if opened, or a serially numbered, self-locking button that can be used for this purpose. The proposed regulations would not allow the unloading of the dead birds and dead poultry until their arrival at the destination listed on the permit, and the dead birds and dead poultry would have to be moved to the destination listed on the permit without any stops, except for normal traffic conditions. The dead birds and dead poultry would have to be disposed of by rendering, incineration, composting, burial, or other methods approved by the Administrator as being adequate to prevent the dissemination of END, within 24 hours of the loading for shipment of the birds and poultry. A copy of the permit that accompanied the dead birds and dead poultry interstate would have to be submitted so that it is received by both the State animal health official and the Veterinarian in Charge in the State of destination within 72 hours of the arrival of the dead birds and dead poultry at the destination listed on the permit. The requirements for the interstate movement of dressed carcasses would be largely the same as those for the interstate movement of other dead birds and dead poultry, with the following differences: (1) The dressed carcasses would have to be from birds and poultry slaughtered in a recognized slaughtering establishment; (2) the requirement that the means of conveyance be covered so as to prevent feathers and other debris from blowing or falling off would not apply to dressed carcasses; and (3) the disposal requirements described above for other dead birds and dead poultry would not apply to dressed carcasses, which are intended for consumption. Interstate Movement of Manure and Litter Current §82.4(e) provides for the interstate movement from a quarantined area of manure from poultry or birds that are not known to be infected with END. These provisions include requirements for heating the manure and sealing it in an airtight container. Current §82.4(e) also requires the submission to a Federal inspector of a declaration that provides information regarding the shipment of manure. We are proposing to retain the requirements of current §82.4(e), and to set them forth in proposed §82.7, with several changes. First, we would extend the provisions that currently apply to shipments of manure to include litter as well. In proposed §82.1, we would define litter as ``material that is used to collect and absorb bodily wastes from birds or poultry.'' This material, which commonly consists of wood shavings or a similar material, cannot be easily separated from the bodily wastes. Second, we would require that shipments of manure and litter be accompanied by a permit. Interstate Movement of Hatching Eggs The current regulations in §82.4 prohibit the interstate movement of hatching eggs from quarantined areas, except for specific movements allowed by APHIS upon request and under special conditions. We believe, however, that it is possible to establish general conditions under which hatching eggs from birds and poultry not known to be infected with or exposed to END can be moved interstate from a quarantined area without a significant risk of spreading END. Under these conditions, set forth in proposed §82.9, the hatching eggs would have to be accompanied interstate by a permit. The proposed regulations would require that a copy of the permit be submitted so that it is received by both the State animal health official and the Veterinarian in charge for the State of destination within 72 hours of the arrival of the hatching eggs at premises designated jointly by the Veterinarian in charge and the State animal health official. The hatching eggs would have to be held at this designated premises from the time of arrival until hatched, and the birds and poultry from the hatching eggs would have to remain at the designated premises for not less than 30 days following hatching. During this holding period, the eggs and any birds or poultry hatched from the eggs would be subject to any inspections, disinfections, and tests as may be required by the Administrator to determine their freedom from END.
