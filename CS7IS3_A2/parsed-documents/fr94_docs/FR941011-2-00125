FR941011-2-00125 FR941011-2-00082 In addition to addressing whether the differential in the per-submission fee is a fair and equitable allocation, the Commission also requested in the Continuation Order, 19 that the Exchange address why the Pilot Programs should not be incorporated into the Exchange's Minor Rule PlanÂ§ 20 because of the size of some of the fees imposed under the Pilot Program. 21 Although the Exchange has stated that it believes the ``fees'' assessed pursuant to the Pilot Program are fair and equitable and should not be incorporated into the Minor Rule Plan, 22 the Commission does not believe the issue has been adequately addressed by the CBOE. Nevertheless, the Commission has determined to grant a limited three month extension to the Pilot Program for two reasons. First, no formal complaints have been lodged by members regarding the fees assessed to date pursuant to the Pilot Program. 23 Second, the Exchange has represented that it will re-consider the issue of incorporating the As-Of Add fees, in some form, 24 into the Minor Rule Plan. 19 See supra note 4. 20 See CBOE Rule 17.50. 21 See Continuation Order, supra note 4, and supra note 7. 22 See Letter from Michael Meyer, Schiff Hardin & Waite, to Brad Ritter, Senior Counsel, OMS, Division, Commission, dated September 2, 1994. 23 See October 3 Conversation, supra note 11. 24 See Amendment No. 1, supra note 1. For example, As-of-Add fees could be deemed a violation of the Minor Rule Plan only after exceeding a certain dollar amount. In order to provide the Exchange with adequate time to assess any proposed changes to the Pilot Program, the Exchange has represented to the Commission that a proposed rule filing pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act will be submitted by the Exchange on or before November 1, 1994. In addition, the CBOE will be required to submit with that proposed rule change, an updated report containing the information requested by the Commission in the Continuation Order. 25 The Commission also notes that it would not be inclined, at this time, to grant a further extension of the Pilot Program until the concerns raised herein have been addressed by the Exchange. 25 See supra note 4. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 thereto prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register in order to permit the pilot program to remain in effect until December 31, 1994 without interruption. Additionally, the Exchange has represented that no problems has arisen and no formal complaints have been received by the Exchange concerning the pilot program since its implementation. 26 Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. 26 See October 3 Conversation, supra note 11. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written date, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.
