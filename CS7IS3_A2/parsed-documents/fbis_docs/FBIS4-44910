It is being published to provide a deeper understanding of the role of AIST laboratories. This is the 32nd annual laboratory research plan published by the AIST going back to 1962 and is reported to provide the most in-depth look at AIST laboratories. Looking back at the previous year, we noted that many countries around the world anticipated last year to be a major turning point. An international accord was reached at a UN-sponsored conference on the issue of environmental protection versus economic growth in June in Brussels in which countries agreed to work with one another under the banner of "sustainable development." Turning an eye toward the domestic front, meanwhile, we note that a Five-Year Plan was enacted in June to have the standard of living in Japan match that of the major powers in the world in terms of building an economy in which people experience a real sense of being rewarded for their work. This has been the result of both re-examining the mass-production, consumer-oriented society that Japan has created, and, together with that, recognizing the importance of establishing a foundation of growth built on a harmonious relationship between the environment and society. Working on that basis, the MITI AIST has produced a comprehensive industrial science policy for 1993 that should contribute to continued growth and popularity of science and technology in Japan. In 1993, in particular, we note the opening of the new National Institute for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research (NAIR), a new research laboratory that promotes joint research between government, industry, and academia, between different scientific disciplines, and between countries. This year also marks the start of the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research (NIMC) and the National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology (NIBH), which were both established to attract researchers in relevant fields of research to conduct research in the area of substances and materials and biotechnology-related fields. In addition, many earlier research projects were reincorporated into the Industrial Science and Technology Frontier Program (ISTF) and New Sunshine Project. Besides the radically new R&D project system, the agency has been formulating various policies to form a three-pillar support structure to promote cooperative international research. The agency has also been actively working to increase funding of the Japan Key Technology Center that was founded to promote development of private-sector technologies, and has initiated joint private-sector research projects in regional areas such as the local Large-Scale Project centered around public examination and technology centers that promotes technologies with a local character to them, and on standard basic research aimed at raising the standard of living in Japan to that of other advanced countries. The R&D being done in science and technology in Japan has to be further consolidated in the future, not merely to sustain economic growth in Japan but also to sustain the growth of the international economy as a whole, and in that context, AIST research laboratories are being counted on to play a major role to make this happen. The great expectations being placed in AIST research laboratories creates complex circumstances for them to operate in, but we believe that it is still possible to energize research activities and produce even more outstanding results.
