Arike maintained Estonia is in the clutches of a confidence crisis which involves also the Interior Ministry and the police. "The specific functions of some departments have not been defined clearly enough," the minister claimed. "This often gives rise to situations where a department, to establish its superiority to others, withholds vital information." Arike said the Estonian police currently employs about 1,000 detectives and only 600 officers; that is, more men are engaged in investigating crimes than in preventing them. The interior minister pointed out the need for setting up economic security structures. The Estonian economic police so far works on an elementary level, he claimed. Italy and Finland have offered Estonia assistance in training policemen investigating economic crimes. Italian experts are now in Estonia to prepare study plans for a seminar in March. Arike said the authorities are also considering the formation of a special police unit to trace illegal aliens in Estonia. The interior minister regarded policemen's knowledge of the Estonian language as a major problem. Under a government decree, all policemen who haven't by Feb. 1 passed the language exam are to be dismissed. Only those non-Estonian-speaking policemen's labor contracts may be extended who have a higher or a special police education. "The dismissal of a great number of policemen at once is very dangerous," Arike said. "Those people know well the structure, the equipment and capacity of the police; if they should go over to crime, it would have terrible consequences." The minister said the new head of the Police Department will be appointed within a month. At present Chancellor of the Interior Ministry Gero Kartau is the acting director general of the Police Department. Former director Igor Amann was dismissed on Jan. 14. Arike said his ministry pays much attention also to regulating the relations between the ministry leadership and departments, and defining the functions of the ministry's subdivisions.
