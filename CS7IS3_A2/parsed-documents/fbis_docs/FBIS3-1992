The circular says: Beginning 1 January this year, China is conducting a major reform in its tax system, which is an important measure for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. After the introduction of the new tax system, some taxpayers do not completely understand the system, believing that the practice of the value-added tax means to add 17 percent or 13 percent for tax to the original prices. There are some taxpayers who avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by tax reform to gain windfall profits by jacking up prices. As a result, prices are pushed up and the price system becomes chaotic, causing dissatisfaction among the people. To guarantee correct implementation of the new tax system, avoid price increases, maintain the stability of the market, and ensure a stable livelihood of the people, the circular is hereby issued as follows: 1. The major goal of current tax reform, for the most part, is to convert product taxes and turnover taxes into value-added taxes. Generally speaking, the newly designed value-added tax rates will not increase the tax burden for enterprises. The tax rates under the former tax system were uneven; now they are simplified and unified as two categories. Consequently, the tax burden for many enterprises is fair or somewhat lower. However, tax burden for a small number of products has increased somewhat. Enterprises should assimilate an increased tax burden through changing their management mechanism, tapping inner potential, and increasing economic performance. Meanwhile the state should correspondingly adopt such measures as lowering income tax rates for enterprises and exempting state-owned enterprises from turning over their profits to the state for "two kinds of funds" [funds collected for construction of key energy and transport projects and funds for state budget regulation] so as to alleviate enterprises' burdens. Therefore, enterprises which do not experience increased tax burdens after the tax reform should not increase their prices; enterprises which enjoy a low tax burden by a fair margin should appropriately reduce their prices; and enterprises which experience increased tax burdens should, in principle, not increase their prices. Individual enterprises which are overwhelmed by their tax burden and need to increase their prices should have such changes approved by departments in charge of commodity prices. 2. At present, taxes are included in all current prices; that is, they are tax-included prices. The formula enabling enterprises to change original tax-included prices to non-tax prices is as follows: non-tax price = original tax-included price / (1 + value-added tax rate) No taxpayers are allowed to add value-added tax or any other tax burden onto current prices. 3. Current factory prices, wholesale prices, and retail prices should not be increased because of the tax reform. Taxpayers should pay value-added taxes and other taxes or fees included in current prices. The current price (including tax) system should be conscientiously introduced to any commodities whose prices are set by the state (including maximum prices). In considering whether or not enterprises experience increased tax burdens, it is necessary to take many factors into consideration, such as reduction of taxes on purchased goods, reduction or exemption of "two kinds of fund" and income taxes, as well as cost-affected interests of loans for fixed assets. Without approval, no enterprises are allowed to readjust their prices. For commodities whose prices are regulated by market demand, enterprises should also try to maintain price stability in accordance with the abovementioned requirements. 4. For linking wholesale and retail prices of all consumer goods and capital goods, the rate of difference between prices for purchased goods and prices for sold goods (calculated on the basis of current tax-included prices) remain unchanged. Various tax burdens will be levied with or under such rates. No enterprises or units are allowed to increase such rates without authorization. 5. Departments in charge of commodity prices at all levels should strengthen their supervision over and check on prices. They should seriously deal with and immediately correct activities including unauthorized price increases for commodities whose prices are set by the state, price increase because of miscalculations due to a misunderstanding of the tax system, and availing oneself of the opportunities afforded by tax reform to gain windfall profits by jacking up prices. 6. Departments in charge of commodity prices and taxation in all localities should pay close attention to the market trend after the introduction of tax reform. They should also promptly report to the Administration of Commodity Prices under the State Planning Commission and the State General Administration of Taxation on newly emerging situations and problems as well as suggestions for their solutions. The State Planning Commission will hold a special meeting to study some issues concerning pricing policies after the tax reform.
