The incident occurred yesterday 763 km downstream on the Uruguay River, 12 km from the city of Santo Tome in Corrientes Province, when the PNA "BA-3608" patrol boat became the target of many shots fired from a suburban district in the city of Sao Borja in Brazil. In a communique the PNA reported today that the shots hit the water a few meters from the patrol boat's hull, and that in view of the attack the PNA personnel carried out "zigzagging" maneuvers to escape the shots, without repelling the attack because it came from foreign territory. The incident occurred a few minutes after the PNA personnel had seized fishing nets unlawfully set on the Argentine side of the river, and while they were investigating the suspicious movements of a boat that was crossing from the Argentine coast to the Brazilian coast. During the routine PNA river operations and patrols, 28 1,228-meter long fishing lines and 27 1,197-meter long fishing nets unlawfully set were seized, and four Brazilian citizens detained. Court proceedings, labeled "Attack Against River Patrol," were filed on the incident. The federal judge of the city of Paso de los Libres will handle the case.
