A feature of the measures is that an "import expansion action plan" (provisional name) needs to be prepared every year and that the 1994 plan will call for assisting foreign companies wanting to sell to Japan, improving import facilities, and promoting imports of particular products such as prefabricated housing and automobiles, the imports of which can grow large. The government wants to make its announcement of voluntary actions to expand imports not only a step toward reducing the trade surplus but also an opportunity to resume Japanese-U.S. economic consultations. The general foreign economic measures are composed of four categories of projects -- macroeconomic policies including tax cuts, and deregulation that would lead to market liberalization; the promotion of imports and foreign investment; the strengthening of competition; and the improved transparency of government procurement -- and the three priority areas of the economic framework talks, i.e., government procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications, automobiles and auto parts, and insurance. These measures will be announced next week. The promotion of imports and foreign investment, along with the macroeconomic measures and deregulation, will become the selling point of the measures. At a trade conference (chaired by Prime Minister Hosokawa) meeting held last October, the government decided on a basic policy of promoting imports. As such, the import expansion action plans to be prepared from 1994 will become detailed plans to implement this policy. The main points of the action plan to be prepared for 1994 are to be: 1) the deregulation of imports and foreign investment; 2) assistance for sales to Japan by foreign companies; 3) the expansion of consumer demand for imports; 4) the improvement of import facilities; and 5) the promotion of imports of specific products.
