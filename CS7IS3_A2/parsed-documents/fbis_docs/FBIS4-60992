Grachev, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, A. Kozyrev, and V. Kazimirov" published under the rubric "Artsakh": "The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Is Prepared To Provide for Complete Cease-Fire"] [Text] The leaders of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, having accepted the proposal of the Russian Federation and confirming their readiness for peaceful regulation of the armed conflict between the Armenian Republic and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, agree to provide for a complete cease-fire and to end combat activities as of 0001 hours on 29 April 1994 in keeping with the Protocol of 18 February 1994. Taking into account the absence of observers and the mutual mistrust of the opposing sides and striving to preclude possible attempts to take advantage of the temporary respite to prepare for another large-scale attack and thus, contribute to the irreversibility of the peace process, the leadership of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic considers it necessary to set in motion the entire mechanism of the aforementioned Protocol signed by the parties to the conflict with the participation of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. Only the realization of this complex of envisioned military-technical measures can guarantee stable termination of combat activities and create favorable conditions for solving the political programs. The leaders of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic are prepared to issue the corresponding orders after the intermediary confirms the receipt of the identical document from the opposing side. [Signed] Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic A. Gukasyan [Signed] Commander of the Army for Defense of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic S. Babayan Stepanakert, 28 April 1994
