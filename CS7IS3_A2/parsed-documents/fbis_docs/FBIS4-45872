Today we are going to talk about the very important, overall environmental cleanup plan. My guest today is Dr. (Adelaida Ibaz Monet), a specialist in hygiene and epidemiology from Havana Province, whom I welcome to this program. (Ibaz]: Thank you very much, Dr. Barroso. Barroso: Adelaida, what was the origin of this Overall Environmental Cleanup Plan [Plan Integral de Higienizacion Ambiental]? And let's call it PIHA, to give it an acronym. (Ibaz]: Since 1990, because of the restrictions of the special period, there has been a gradual deterioration of the hygiene and health conditions in Havana, and of course in the province as well. This situation has brought with it a whole series of difficulties in supplying water and in chlorinating the water supply. There are also difficulties in treating and disposing of liquid wastes, as well as in collecting, transporting, and disposing of solid wastes. Along with this has come an increase in the incidence of infestations of different kinds, such as mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, and rodents. All this brings with it a deterioration in hygiene and health habits, which in turn brings significant changes in the incidence and mortality rates of contagious diseases. Barroso: Doctor, what are the contagious diseases that most increase in such a situation? (Ibaz]: Among them are acute diarrheas, different types of hepatitis, leptospirosis, etc. Barroso: And tell me: Is not cholera among these contagious diseases? What measures are being taken against cholera here in Cuba? Because we know that there is a cholera epidemic, that cholera is practically pandemic, in Latin America right now. (Ibaz]: As you have rightly said, the moment this cholera pandemic hit America, our country took pertinent measures, and there is an overall plan, in this connection. Our country is not exempt from risk, of course, and such a thing would do us serious damage, not just to health but also from the economic point of view. [passage omitted] Barroso: There is a disease you mentioned that is on the rise right now: leptospirosis. We know that leptospirosis is a disease whose symptoms resemble many other illnesses, because it can cause fevers. Sometimes people even have renal problems; we know of patients who have displayed hematuria and turned out to have leptospirosis. The disease can be benign but it can also be fatal. What strategy are you using to prevent this increase in leptospirosis? [sentence as heard] Which we also know to be a disease caused by animals, right? I mean, it is a zoonosis. (Ibaz]: That is correct. Leptospirosis is a zoonosis that is transmitted not just by dogs, as is commonly believed. There are other animals that can transmit the leptospira. The population very frequently raises pigs and other domestic animals that can also transmit the leptospira. In Havana Province, in particular, as one of the first steps prior to discussing this plan for cleaning up the environment and after the surveying that has been done in the different municipalities, we have begun implementing a plan to eliminate rats. This plan basically entails diminishing the number of rodents in the province and targets certain priority centers such as cane camps, vacation time agricultural labor sites, food program camps, schools and health establishments, and centers where food is processed and sold.
