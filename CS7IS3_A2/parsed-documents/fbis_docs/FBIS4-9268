On March 19, the Slovak Government decided to remove 26 out of 38 directors of district offices for having signed a statement against the parliamentary speech by President Michal Kovac who criticised former Premier Vladimir Meciar. The statement accused Kovac of gross offences against parliamentary democracy, malicious and false accusation against Meciar, expedient destabilisation of the political situation and discredit to the previous government. The directors hold the view that Deputy Premier Roman Kovac proved by his arguments and positive attitude to their dismissal that he was incompetent to perform his post. As a result, he should contemplate his resignation from Moravcik's cabinet. The directors consider their dismissal to be a political step. Some of them claim that the Interior Ministry attempted "moral corruption" because the state secretary, Roman Vavrik, who participated in appointing them, offered in private conversation that they can remain in their positions provided they resign from the HZDS (Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia). The director hold the view that if Slovakia's interests are jeopardised, they can make a statement. A director stated that Slovakia was not yet a stable democracy and the directors did not break any law by their criticism of Kovac's speech. "What is not forbidden, is allowed," he said.
