FR940725-0-00172 FR940725-0-00019 In addition, extending the scope of Subpart B to land-side activities will benefit the industry and its workers by ensuring that land-side work activities are covered by a protective standard. Most of the industry has been following Subpart B for confined space work on land-side for some time. Because workers and the tasks and hazards are essentially the same whether on vessels or land-side, employing separate standards for each would have the potential to create confusion and actually increase the risk of an incident occurring. The full regulatory impact analysis is in docket S&hyph;050. B. Introduction Executive Order 12866 requires the Agency to perform an analysis of the costs, benefits, and regulatory alternatives of its ``significant regulatory actions.'' A significant regulatory action is one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. This final rule directly affects one well-defined industry, the shipbuilding and ship repair industry, but there are no new costs of compliance. Accordingly, the promulgation of the confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres standard for shipyard employment is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes' of E.O. 12866. As required by the OSH Act and its judicial interpretations, the Agency must demonstrate that this regulation is both technologically and economically feasible for the shipyard industry. The Agency has concluded that this standard meets both tests of feasibility. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) requires Federal agencies to determine whether a regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Assistant Secretary certifies that this rule will not have such an impact, as the rule imposes no new cost on firms. The Agency must also review this standard in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ), the Guidelines of the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ)(40 CFR part 1500), and OSHA's DOL NEPA Procedures (29 CFR part 11). This summary of the Agency's analysis includes an overview of affected industries and employees, estimated benefits, the technological feasibility of the standard, estimated compliance costs, regulatory flexibility analysis, economic and environmental impacts, a discussion of the regulatory and non-regulatory alternatives to this final standard, and the existence of significant risk. The full text of the regulatory analysis has been placed in the shipyard confined space's Docket S&hyph;050. OSHA created the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) in 1988 to advise the Agency in consolidating the shipyard standards. The committee was made up of representatives from industry, labor, government, and professional organizations. Besides making recommendations to the Agency about its regulations, the committee also provided information about current industry practices and the costs and benefits of various rules and alternatives. This information has been reviewed carefully by the Agency in developing the Regulatory Analysis of the final rule. C. Industry Profile The American shipyard industry has been in a long-term decline since 1981 when the Federal government ended subsidy programs for commercial ship construction. In the period 1976&hyph;1980, the industry built an average of 64 merchant vessels per year. Only five commercial ships have been built since 1988. The decline in merchant vessel construction in the 1980s was partially offset by a large increase in military ship construction. However, the end of the military competition with the former U.S.S.R. has resulted in a sharp drop in military ships on order. The recently completed ``bottom-up'' review of the armed forces has called for a major reduction in the number of active combat ships, and consequently a drop in the number of future orders. U.S. Navy orders, which averaged 19 per year in the 1980s, is estimated to fall to 8 per year during the period 1994&hyph;1999. Ship repair and construction of inland vessels and barges has remained constant during the past 5 years. Employment in the shipbuilding industry had fallen from 177,000 in 1984 to about 125,000 by 1987 and remained near that level until 1992. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that employment in the industry had fallen to 106,000 by late 1993. It is likely that employment will continue to fall to below 100,000 in the next few years. In 1992 the value of output from American shipyards was approximately $9.9 billion. Based on Dun & Bradstreet's estimated mean return for the shipyard industry of 2.9 percent, the industry earned approximately $287 million. The Agency estimates that there are approximately 500 firms in SIC 3731, and a majority of these have fewer than 50 employees. Employment in the shipyard industry is highly concentrated. The ten largest shipyards employ approximately 70 percent of all shipyard workers, and only the 100 largest firms have as many as 100 employees. The Agency estimates that approximately 200 firms engaged in ship repair employ fewer than 11 employees. D. Population at Risk
