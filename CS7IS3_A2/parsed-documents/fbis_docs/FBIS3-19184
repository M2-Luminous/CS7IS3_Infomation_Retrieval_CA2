The decline comes as the approval rating of President Francois Mitterrand, Balladur's socialist rival, is rising. A poll for the JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE newspaper, to be published Sunday [13 March], said 45 percent of voters expressed support for Balladur, down from 47 percent in February. Forty-seven percent said they were dissatisfied, up from 43 percent last month. For Mitterrand, 44 percent said they approved of his performance, up from 41 percent in February. However, 48 percent of voters expressed dissatisfaction with the president, down from 50 percent. The telephone poll was conducted between March 3-11 among a sample of 1,888 registered voters. It comes ahead of the 20 and 27 March local elections which will test the popularity of Balladur's conservative coalition government. Balladur, who enjoyed a long honeymoon in public opinion for his presidential style as prime minister, has recently suffered a sharp fall in popularity. It comes in the wake of demonstrations by fishermen angry over cheap imports and young people protesting a government proposal to let businesses hire them for less than the minimum wage as a way to fight France's nagging unemployment problem.
