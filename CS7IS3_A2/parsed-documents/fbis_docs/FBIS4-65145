Among other things, the CSCE should be prepared to undertake more peacekeeping operations, but in close cooperation with the United Nations. That is the essence of the proposal Kooijmans and Kinkel will be making to next week's special CSCE meeting in Vienna. The ministers will personally present the proposal at a joint meeting of the CSCE Permanent Committee and the security forum. Ambassadors from the 52 member states (Serbia/Montenegro have been suspended) sit on these committees, which respectively discuss the political and military aspects of cooperation. It is quite exceptional for ministers to present their plans in person. The Netherlands and Germany feel that the CSCE makes too little use of the opportunities available to it. At the 1992 Helsinki summit, the member states decided that in the event of future conflicts the CSCE should be able to undertake missions to investigate the situation on the spot. Subject to strict conditions, the organization may also undertake peacekeeping operations, for which it can request the military resources of NATO and the Western European Union. This makes the CSCE a "regional organization" according to the UN Charter. This means that it bears, in principle, initial responsibility for settling any conflict in the area covered by its treaty (Europe). The Hague and Bonn believe that it does not yet make enough use of this authority. Peacekeeping missions are now being planned for Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The CSCE may not, however, undertake any peacemaking activities. If a conflict gets out of hand to the extent that such a mission is required, the United Nations must then take over. The proposal by Kooijmans and Kinkel states that, in such cases, the CSCE must hand over the mission as fully as possible "so that it contributes to subsequent UN action and that the United Nations does not have to start again from zero," according to a Netherlands Foreign Ministry spokesman. The CSCE regularly brings together all the countries of Europe, including most of the former Soviet republics and the former Yugoslavia, plus Canada and the United States, to discuss such matters as political and military security, human rights, and the prevention of conflicts. The proposal by Kooijmans and Kinkel is to be discussed at a subsequent CSCE conference to be held in Budapest in October and November at which developments in the organization will be on the agenda.
