(The relations) are developing in accordance with the guidelines mapped out in the (bilateral) agreement of 25 July 1991 and the joint declaration signed by the Russian and Lithuanian presidents on 30 August 1993," said President Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania in an interview with the "MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN" ("INTERNATIONAL ARENA") journal that comes out in Russia. The whole text of the interview will be published in the next issue of the journal, but the official "ECHO OF LITHUANIA" daily published several excerpts from it on Thursday [12 May]. "The visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was of great importance. (The two parties) signed during his visit a package of agreements on 18 November 1993. ``One of the most important agreements -- the one on exchanging the most favoured nation status in trade and economic relations -- has not been put into effect as yet, unfortunately. Lithuania has fulfilled its treaty commitments - now it is Russia's turn,'' said Brazauskas. According to him, there is no mention of Lithuania in the long list of 130 countries, which trade with Moscow in "free trade" and "most favoured nation in trade" format, although the relevant agreement has been signed. This is "disadvantageous and detrimental to both parties," he said. "In our opinion, such economic statement has no future," the Lithuanian president emphasized in this connection. Commenting on a recent exchange of messages with Russian President Yeltsin and telephone conversation with Chernomyrdin, Brazauskas said that, in his opinion, it was possible "to eliminate existing difficulties in our relations, which surfaced recently."
