As you will recall, when the Belgian commissioner decided last December to study the asylum application which has now been refused, the Spanish government expressed its categorical repudiation. The commissioner for refugees bases his decision on the fact that right of asylum cannot be recognized in a community country for any citizen of another European country because human rights are respected throughout the European Union. In his decision he also indicates that in Spain ETA sympathizers are prosecuted only when they commit offenses and never for their ideological, religious, or ethnic convictions. Luis Moreno Ramajo and Raquel Garcia Arranz, who are accused of collaborating with ETA's Vizcaya Commando, were released last December after spending six months in a Belgian prison. The court which decided their release took into account in its decision the fact that the Belgian commissioner for refugees, Marc Bossuyt, had agreed to the processing of the application for political asylum made by the two alleged ETA members, who claimed in their application that charges against them had been obtained by means of torture. At that time the Belgian Government promised Spain that it would do everything possible in order that asylum might be refused to the two alleged ETA members and it gave guarantees that they would remain under surveillance to prevent them fleeing. Today's decision reopens the possibility of Spain obtaining the extradition of Moreno Ramajo and Raquel Garcia.
