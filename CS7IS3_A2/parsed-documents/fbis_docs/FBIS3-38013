Following the withdrawal of 260 Serb and 47 Muslim artillery pieces and their transfer to the control of the UN peacekeeping forces, the citizens -- Muslims, Serbs, and Croats -- can wake up without fearing for their lives. Our paratroopers are installed in the building of a former police school. Their commander, Colonel Viktor Vorobyev, has held a working meeting with General Stanislav Galic, commander of the Sarajevo-Romanija corps, which is keeping its sights on the capital of Bosnia. The discussion concerned the stationing of guys from Ryazan and Pskov on the demarcation line between the Muslim and Serb infantry within the precincts of the city. As Serb sources reported, the meeting between the Serb general and the Russian colonel ended with "a toast according to the old orthodox custom." The presence of Vorobyev's men -- the weighty argument of the Russian diplomatic initiative -- has stabilized the situation around Sarajevo. However, as one of the UN commanders expressed himself, it will not be easy for the peacekeeping forces to maintain an island of peace in a sea of war. In this connection, it appears that the United Nations will come up against specific difficulties in carrying out the operation to open the airfield in Tuzla, which is scheduled for 7 March. Official sources have reported that air support from NATO forces will be used during the operation if need be. The Serbs are keeping the airfield in the sights of their artillery, suspecting that it may be used not for the delivery of humanitarian aid, but as a new channel for supplying the Muslims with weapons. Over 1 million civilian inhabitants, mainly Muslims, in Central Bosnia, where Tuzla is located, are waiting desperately for the opening of the airfield. They are disastrously short of food and medicines, the UN Office of High Commissioner for Refugees, has reported from its Sarajevo base. Meanwhile, in downtown Belgrade, a street musician is endlessly playing Russian tunes on the accordion, hooligans have defaced the French memorial, drawing a swastika on it as revenge for the NATO ultimatum, and Western diplomats and members of their families are quietly getting ready to go back, while local experts analyze the critical situation which has been favorably resolved for all the sides. The names of Boris Yeltsin and Andrey Kozyrev, to which a number of local publications and activists had pinned labels of the type "betrayers of the Slav peoples and orthodoxy," are being praised to the skies. And those who yesterday were conducting dialogue only with Khasbulatov and Zhirinovskiy, counting on help from Cossacks and secret Russian weapons, are today holding rallies of gratitude outside the Russian Embassy.
