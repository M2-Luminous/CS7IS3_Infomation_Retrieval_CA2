Indeed, President Henry Konan Bedie received the Liberian and Malian foreign ministers this morning. Thomas Bahinchi has the details: [Bahinchi] Gabriel Baccus Matthews, minister of foreign affairs of the Interim Government of National Salvation [title as heard] of Liberia, was accompanied to the head of state's house by Johnson Tiakwe, charge d'affaires of the Liberian Embassy in Cote d'Ivoire, and by Dukure Abdulai, President Amos Sawyer's director of francophone affairs. President Sawyer sent his foreign minister here to present his condolences to President Konan Bedie and to brief him on the evolution of the peace process in Liberia. [Begin Matthews recording, in English fading into French translation] President Dr. Amos Sawyer, president of the Interim Government of National Unity, has sent me here to present his greetings to His Excellency President Konan Bedie. He also asked me to present to President Bedie his own condolences and those of the Liberian people to the people of Cote d'Ivoire for the immense and irreparable loss that the death of President Houphouet-Boigny has caused everyone, not only Cote d'Ivoire but the subregion and the international community. This is why I am here. President Sawyer also asked me to brief President Konan Bedie on the situation in Liberia -- the evolution of the situation in Liberia. There are signs that things are not going on well, but in general -- looking at the general situation -- everything is going on well and we believe that peace will return to Liberia and we hope that in 1994 we will be able to hold free and democratic elections. [passage omitted] In fact, it was President Houphouet-Boigny who laid the cornerstone of peace in Liberia. Thanks to him and thanks to the efforts he made in Yamoussoukro, we were able to make our present achievements. He always told us to go the school of patience. It was at his school of patience that we learned to be patient and to work assiduously. This is why we are saying that the groundwork and the foundation of peace in Liberia were achieved through the efforts of Houphouet-Boigny, and Liberians are very grateful to him for that. [end recording] It was also to express the pain felt by the government and people of Mali following the death of President Houphouet-Boigny that the Malian head of state sent Ibrahim Boubakar Keita, Malian minister of foreign affairs, Malians abroad and African integration, to President Konan Bedie. Before assuming this high government responsibility, Boubakar Keita was Mali's ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire. [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified reporter] You are responsible for African integration. After this devaluation we have just heard about, what solidarity effort should be made among African countries who have just been shown the need to count on themselves alone? [Keita] You are perfectly right. This is a very pertinent question. I think that this issue is an outright challenge to us. It has come to remind us of our fundamental duties of solidarity and concern for one another. I think it was time for such a decision to be made regardless of the fact that it was done in such a painful manner. In fact, we have now become more conscious of the intimate solidarity of our interests hence the necessity to make sure that today, beyond all petty squbbles and all sentiments of restricted nationalism, we should pool our meager resources together for the adoption of a well-meaning policy of integration and well-deserved complementarity to enable our people to pass this difficult stage and to envisage the future with serenity.
