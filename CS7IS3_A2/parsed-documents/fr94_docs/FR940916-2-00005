ACTION: Notice of termination of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: On January 18, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on ceiling fans from the People's Republic of China covering the period December 1, 1992 through November 30, 1993. We are now terminating that review. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrea Chu or Michael Rill, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4733. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 29, 1993, Lasko Metal Products, Inc. (Lasko), the petitioner, requested that the Department conduct an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on ceiling fans from the People's Republic of China covering the period December 1, 1992 through November 30, 1993. On January 18, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register (59 FR 2593) a notice of initiation of an administrative review of the order. This notice stated that we would review eleven manufacturers/exporters covering the period December 1, 1992 through November 30, 1993. On August 26, 1994, Lasko requested that it be allowed to withdraw its request for a review and that the review be terminated. Section 353.22(a)(5) of the Department's regulations states that ``the Secretary may permit a party that requests a review under paragraph (a) of this section to withdraw the request not later than 90 days after the date of publication of notice of initiation of the requested review. The Secretary may extend this time limit if the Secretary decides that it is reasonable to do so.'' Because no significant work has yet been done in this review, we have determined that it is reasonable to extend the 90-day time limit and to allow Lasko to withdraw its request for review. See Steel Wire Rope From Japan; Partial Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, 56 FR 41118 (August 19, 1991). Furthermore, we note that no interested party objected to termination of the review. Accordingly, the Department is terminating this review. This notice serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility concerning disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with section 353.34(d) of the Department's regulations. Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice is in accordance with section 353.22(a)(5) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.22(a)(5)). Dated: September 9, 1994. Roland L. MacDonald, Acting Dupty Assistant Secretary for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23021 Filed 9&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
