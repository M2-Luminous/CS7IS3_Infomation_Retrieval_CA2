Hosokawa made the pledge in a meeting with Soglo, who arrived in Japan earlier in the day for a four-day visit, Foreign Ministry officials said. The meeting lasted nearly 40 minutes and was followed by a 75- minute dinner, both at Hosokawa's official residence. The Japanese aid includes 565 million yen to help Cononou National University improve its medical equipment and another 500 million yen as a nonproject grant-in-aid, the officials said. It also includes 46 million yen as the first cultural grant-in- aid to purchase equipment for the state-run television station to produce educational and cultural programs, they said. The Japanese Government has already pledged Benin a total of 400 million yen worth of aid in fiscal 1993 that ends March 31, 1994. The aid included 100 million yen in food and 300 million yen to increase the production of food, the officials said. Benin, a small country in west Africa bordering Nigeria, is a former French colony that became a republic in 1958, changing its name from Dahomey in 1975. It has a population of about five million. It was under communist rule until 1990 but is currently boosting democratization efforts, the officials said. During the meeting, Soglo, 59, requested Japanese political and economic support for his nation, they said. The president is scheduled to meet Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko on Tuesday. He will visit Nagoya on Wednesday before heading home Thursday. Soglo visited Japan in 1990 as prime minister to attend the emperor's enthronement ceremony. He also came to Tokyo last October to attend an international conference on aid to Africa.
