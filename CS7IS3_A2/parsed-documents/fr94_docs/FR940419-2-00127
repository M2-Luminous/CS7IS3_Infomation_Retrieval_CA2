FR940419-2-00127 FR940419-2-00070 The Commission believes that the rule change providing that neither the Chairman nor the President are ex-officio members of any Judiciary Committee also is consistent with Sections 6(b)(1) and (5) of the Act. Article IV, Rule 5 of the Exchange's Rules states that ``the President shall appoint five disinterested members of the Exchange and/or general partners or officers of member organizations as a Judiciary Committee'' whenever a disciplinary matter is to be reviewed in accordance with the Rules. The rule change specifies that the Chairman and President are not ex-officio members of any Judiciary Committee. Finally, the Commission believes that the rule change replacing ``Public Governor'' with ``non-member Governor'' and defining the term as a ``Governor who is unaffiliated with the Exchange or any broker or dealer in securities, as defined in Article III, Section 2 of the Exchange's Constitution,'' serves to provide consistency within the CHX's Constitution and Rules, and has no substantive effect. The Commission notes, however, that ``non-member Governors'' are intended to be representatives of the public and that the term is synonymous with the Commission's use of the term ``public Governor'' in general, and in this order and the order approving the 1992 changes to the CHX's organization and governance. 26 This interpretation is consistent with Section 6(b)(3) of the Act, which requires that the Exchange provide that one or more directors be representatives of issuers and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange, broker, or dealer. 26 See supra note 15 and accompanying text. The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 made a non-substantive change to the proposal by including in the rules the Constitutional definition that a non-member Governor is unaffiliated with the Exchange or any broker or dealer in securities. 27 The CHX's proposed rule change was published in the Federal Register for the full statutory period and no comments were received. 28 27 See supra note 3. 28 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33318 (December 10, 1993), 58 FR 66042 (December 17, 1993). IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
