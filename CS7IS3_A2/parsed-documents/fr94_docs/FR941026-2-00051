FR941026-2-00051 FR941026-2-00032 [Docket No. 94&hyph;23] Rose International, Inc. v. Trans-Atlantic Agreement and Its Member Lines; Notice of Filing of Complaint and Assignment Notice is given that a complaint filed by Rose International, Inc. (``Complainant'') against Trans-Atlantic Agreement, and jointly and severally its member lines (``Respondents'') was served October 21, 1994. Complainants allege that Respondents violated sections 10(b) (1), (4), (10), (12), (14) and (15) of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. §§1709(b) (1), (4), (10), (12), (14) and (15) by knowingly and willfully accepting cargo for the account of various shippers of household goods who are NVOCCs without tariffs or bonds on file with the Commission; by entering into unlawful service contracts with these shippers resulting in rates for them that discriminate against complainant; and by allowing these shippers to obtain transportation at less than the rates contained in Respondents' tariffs through unjust and unfair devices or means. This proceeding has been assigned to the office of Administrative Law Judges. Hearing in this matter, if any is held, shall commence within the time limitations prescribed in 46 CFR 502.61, and only after consideration has been given by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. The hearing shall include oral testimony and cross-examination in the discretion of the presiding officer only upon proper showing that there are genuine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions, or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the presiding officer in this proceeding shall be issued by October 23, 1995, and the final decision of the Commission shall be issued by February 23, 1996.
