[Serreqi] Albania's foreign policy is based on three main directions. First, to facilitate the transitional period and create favorable conditions for building a rule-of-law state and establishing true democracy in Albania. Second, to accelerate Albania's integration into Europe. Third, to secure a stable, acceptable, and honest solution to what we call the all-Albania question, which is directly linked with what is happening in the former Yugoslav federation. [Gurzhiy] What is Albania's approach to problems of all-European partnership and cooperation, to the CSCE as an all-region political organization, and to the North Atlantic Cooperation Council as an organization of military-political cooperation? [Serreqi] As I already pointed out at the start of our conversation, one of our foreign policy priorities is Albania's speediest worthy integration into all European and international structures. Here we rely on the reforms being implemented in Albania and on the successes achieved on this path over the past two years, and we take into consideration the special features of the Albanian people's mentality via a pronounced European orientation. We believe that our main problems can be resolved more successfully via fruitful cooperation with international organizations than via bilateral alliances. We proceed from this logic in building our relations with European security structures -- above all, NATO -- at the first stage through participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program and at the next stage through full membership of this organization. [Gurzhiy] How do you rate the Russian position on these problems? [Serreqi] We believe that membership of these international organizations presupposes the fulfillment of all the provisions of the corresponding documents. In the context of events in Europe and in the world, particularly after the collapse of the "bloc system," we believe that to build a more stable and peaceful Europe all states must make a contribution. We rate positively and support all efforts by other organizations within the CSCE framework aimed at restoring peace and international order. Any other approaches pose a threat to stability. They cannot, of course, be welcomed. [Gurzhiy] The resolution of the Albanian national question obviously presupposes the Kosovo problem. What is Albania's present position in respect to Kosovo? [Serreqi] We believe that the problem of Kosovo is the key to settling the crisis in the former Yugoslavia -- a crisis which could spread to the whole of the Balkans. Under real conditions, Albania takes a clear stand: We are opposed to altering borders by force. We have repeatedly advocated the inviolability of state borders. But this certainly does not mean that we are abandoning our demands to observe the rights of Albanians in accordance with international documents and the norms of international law. I believe that the Yugoslav crisis is complex. So far the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been its most tragic part, and it is unfortunately continuing. We welcome the recent very promising initiatives aimed at extinguishing the flames of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, just as we supported the NATO ultimatum, the sanctions resolution, and the Russian presence aimed at persuading the Serbs to join in this process. We insist that the "Kosovo question" must be a constituent part of the overall plan for settling the crisis as its key problem. We believe that pressure must be put on Serbia to make it agree to the establishment of international control over Kosovo, starting with the return of the CSCE observers mission. Second, the question of lifting or easing the sanctions should be linked not only with the restoration of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina but also with the resolution of the problem of the Albanians in Kosovo. [Gurzhiy] So do you believe that the problem of Kosovo must be tackled right now, without waiting for a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Serreqi] The crisis in the former Yugoslavia is complex. We respect the strategy of a phased resolution, but we cannot agree with the sidelining of its key elements. The problems of the crisis are organically linked to one another and must all be resolved together -- step by step. The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has somewhat pushed other problems into the background. The international community must realize that a potential threat of the widening of the crisis is linked with them. Thus, in respect to Kosovo it is obvious that it is unacceptable to regard the Kosovo problem as an internal matter for Serbia. If this problem is not tackled in a timely way on the basis of an honest and fair approach, the threat of the destabilization of the situation inside and outside the Balkans will arise. [Gurzhiy] What place does Russia occupy in Albania's foreign policy? How do you rate Russia's Balkan policy and, on the whole, the state of Albanian-Russian relations and their development prospects? [Serreqi] Russia's presence in the Balkans is a historical fact, and its present participation in the context of the development of events in the former Yugoslavia is real. If we base ourselves on our previous conclusion that this presence must be realized within the framework of the efforts of the international community (CSCE, NATO), then any contribution, including Russia's, aimed at establishing peace should be welcomed. In terms of bilateral relations, I would like to emphasize that we have long been working with Russian Ambassador to Albania V. Nerubaylo on the realization of a visit to Moscow by an Albanian Government delegation headed by A. Meksi, chairman of the Council of Ministers. We are awaiting a decision on the date of the visit. [Gurzhiy] I believe that your interview will also serve to realize this visit. In this connection, what would you like to convey to Russian readers? [Serreqi] Unfortunately, I have not yet had an opportunity to visit your country, but I believe that I do nevertheless have some idea of Russia. I am not sure that my knowledge of the political situation is consonant with my acquaintance with Russian culture. The sociopolitical changes in your country have been so great and so rapid.... In particular, I feel optimism at the well-known assessments of the Russian people's spirit and culture, and I am sure that the present processes will lead Russia to democracy. I would be pleased to visit your country as soon as possible. I also hope that your country might be able to make a worthy contribution to European and world affairs under conditions of genuine democracy.
