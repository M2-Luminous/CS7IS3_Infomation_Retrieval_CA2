Our special correspondent Anatoliy Tabachenko reports. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] After the documents were signed a joint news conference began, at which both presidents made statements. Leonid Kravchuk said in particular: [Begin Kravchuk recording] Ladies and gentlemen. We have just put our signatures to a number of extremely important bilateral documents, which create a legal basis for our cooperation in the sphere of the economy, trade, and other spheres. What one may without exaggeration call a historic moment in relations between our states took place before your own eyes a few minutes ago. Today we have in fact turned the page in the still short history of our bilateral relations, which seemed to connect us forever with the complex problem, colossal in scale, of the nuclear weapons inherited by Ukraine from the former [Soviet] Union. Although this problem remains complex now, we have managed to bring it essentially and substantially nearer to a (?successful resolution) by joint efforts. The new dislocation of forces on the political map of the world has particularly demonstrated the necessity of creating a global system of security, which would work in accordance with new principles. We are aware that the complex processes of international security and peace are interconnected and failures or a vacuum in some or other part of the world cannot be permitted, especially on the European continent. For this very reason, I and President Bill Clinton agreed that the political and economic security of Ukraine, which plays an important and stabilizing role in its region, and this is not just our opinion, is of equally exceptional significance both for the people of Ukraine and for all of humanity, and (?for Americans) too. Proceeding from this key idea, we understand that relations between Ukraine and the United States of America should be constructed as relations between friendly states, which should have many more joint interests than differences. During the talks with President Clinton, we were convinced that the American side understands our problems and expresses concern at the serious economic condition of Ukraine. We saw that the U.S. Administration does not only hail the Ukrainian Government's measures to overcome the economic crisis, but also expresses readiness to render Ukraine the necessary assistance in many directions of an economic orientation, as the President has just said. Today we signed a package of economic agreements and accords, which I hope will help Ukraine to considerably ease and accelerate the movement to a market, remove the tension in the economy, and (?also) in the daily life of our people. We have been convinced that in America we have a friend, whom we need and at the right time too. Today Ukraine is a friend, as they say, in need, but a friend indeed, as your well-known American saying goes. But I believe that the day will come when we will truly recall these times as the era of the birth and establishment of true friendship between the two peoples and states of Ukraine and the United States of America. I thank you for your attention. [applause]. [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] We used to smelt half of the former Soviet Union's cast iron and steel. [We have] great chemistry, Donbass, and nuclear power engineering. All this creates preconditions which require large resources, primarily energy resources, while these energy resources are concentrated outside Ukraine, mainly in Russia. In the last year and a half the prices for these resources has risen a thousand-fold and more. [Words indistinct] it is surprising how our economy could withstand it when energy carrier prices have gone up by a thousand to fifteen hundred times within such a short period. This is an important objective cause of (?our difficulties). We also have Chernobyl, with over 12 percent of the budget spent on (?eliminating) the Chernobyl aftermath. (?Historically), we (?inherited from) the Soviet Union immense armed forces with over a million people. They have to be reformed and reduced so that these people are provided [word indistinct] socially and supplied with houses and so on and so forth. We now have another problem relating to the elimination of nuclear weapons. There also is a problem of providing social security for a great many people, to speak nothing of other problems of our economy -- the links that were formed with the former Soviet Union. Ukraine's economy was only a segment of that great economy and this segment served as an assembly plant in the Soviet Union or as a provider of part of the collective deliveries that were mainly consummated in (?production) in Russia. All this now needs to be redone and reformed. The structure of industry needs to be changed. This requires much expenditure and will take some time. Our human, natural, technological and scientific resources, however, are extraordinarily great. We have not yet done everything as far as our legislation is concerned, no. We have not managed to put everything into practice to create preconditions for, shall we say, the economy and the free movement of the workforce, capital and money to develop jointly. The banking, financial and credit system has not yet been worked out entirely. All this is now being elaborated, detailed and reformed. Clearly, this will be done quicker with the aid of experienced people who are in this hall today and in the United States of America in general, who will come to Ukraine and help implement it and assist us by sharing their experience. We are totally aware that nobody will pull Ukraine out of the economic crisis except for its own self and its people. We, however, also know that how quickly this can be done depends on whether Ukraine has real financial, economic and investment aid or is left face to face with its problems and grave consequences of the past. Politically, I am convinced Ukraine can and will play a stabilizing part in Europe. It can become a state where democracy, liberty, reforms, markets and transformations will lead the way. All this is a must in our future. I am also convinced Ukraine's future lies in its ties with European and world financial and economic structures. We also realize that the proportion of these ties today is not determined in the Ukrainian economy. It is there, however, where the future lies, because the development of society, technological changes, scientific and technological transformations are only possible on the basis of close ties with advanced technologies, market and financial structures of Europe, the world, the United States of America and other countries that have much experience and great possibilities in this respect. Today, however, we also orient our economy toward the CIS market because we know this market is a real one for the economies of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and others. In other words, all this has to happen gradually, by way of gathering experience, accumulating capital and restructuring, shall we say, industrial enterprises on a large scale through the conversion of our military industrial complex. So I appeal to you to understand the situation in Ukraine and realize its role, its possibilities, and its potential. Politically, our visit to the United States of America is exactly about expressly and clearly determining the political attitude, including by the United States of America, to Ukraine as a European state with a great future. This great future much depends on how and what emphasis is placed politically and economically by the great world state of the United States of America. I thank the people present here for their attention and can answer your questions. [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] I (?want) to say that when meeting at the Pentagon in particular, and other places too, we did not just discuss the volume of assistance, but the mechanisms for making use of it too. For example, we agreed with the U.S. minister of defense [as heard] that a considerable part of the assistance will go toward housing for and the social protection of officers who will be made redundant. Specific figures and time periods have even been determined -- that is, the talk is now about the value of the assistance and ways of making use of it, and so it was with every route for this assistance.
