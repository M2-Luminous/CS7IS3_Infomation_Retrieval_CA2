The committee held eight hearings from July 1993 to February this year, to prepare the long report which is entitled: "Sino-British Relations Around 1997." At the hearings, many people of insight criticized Patten and the British Government's policy on the Hong Kong issue, called for setting sights on overall Sino-British relations and for cooperation with China, and opposed confrontation. However, ignoring the facts, the report asserts that Patten's constitutional reform package does not violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the "Basic Law," and the agreements reached between Chinese and British foreign ministers; and holds that Patten was correct in unilaterally announcing his constitutional reform package in October 1992 without consulting China beforehand. The report states the committee supports the British Government in continuing to do things in its own way and in submitting the entire political reform package to the Hong Kong Legislative Council for examination. The report says: Given the current deadlock, it is impossible to win China's cooperation by revising the reform package. On the contrary, such an act will only draw opposition from a sizable number of people on the Hong Kong Legislative Council, impair the Hong Kong Government's prestige, and may jeopardize Hong Kong's stability and economic order. For this reason, the committee "supports the foreign secretary in refusing to strike a deal with China," and says the Hong Kong governor should submit "as soon as possible" the entire bill to the legislative council for examination. Without the least reason, the report blames China for the slow progress in Sino-British Joint Liaison Group talks, claiming that, if China continues to obstruct the group from holding further talks, the Hong Kong Government will have no choice but to submit the necessary legislation to the legislative council so Hong Kong's laws can be revised and made regionally-oriented before sovereignty is transferred to China. Moreover, in the "political and foreign relations" section, the report suggests relations between the British Parliament and Taiwan's Legislative Yuan be strengthened; and urges the British Government to re-examine the status of Taiwan's office in Britain and to relax restrictions on it. The report also encourages Britain to discuss the so-called Tibet human rights issue, blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs. Observers here have pointed out that, at a time when Sino-British relations are already in a very difficult state because of Britain's perverse acts over the Hong Kong issue, the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee report will inevitably create more adverse effects on relations between the two countries; therefore, the report should attract people's attention.
