Goulmamine: "Telecommunications: Opening Up to the World Through Fiber Optic"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] [Text] The submarine fiber-optic cable section inaugurated yesterday morning will connect our country to many other continents. Algeria is opening up to the world. The project in which Algeria is a shareholder consists in fact in curing the telecommunication sector of the mediocrity that characterized it. At the same time, Algeria's communications with the world will be improved. To this end, a link with South and East Asia, the Middle East, and West Europe was established. More precisely, this telecommunication network section will connect Algeria to the five other Maghreb countries, through 20,000 telephone lines and 16 television channels. This is the first section of the telecommunication electronic highway. Through a submarine section, Algeria will be connected to Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Italy and, finally, France. According to a Channel-1 radio news broadcast, the first section of the submarine cable will connect Algiers to Marseille. The Algerian part consists of 900 km of optical fiber, and the signal will be amplified by repeaters placed every 100 km. The estimated cost of the project is 90 million French francs [Fr] for 8,000 lines. The Algiers-Marseille link was acquired by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and will become operational soon. It was announced that, from now on, nearly all governorates will be connected to the national digital network. Over 100,000 subscribers are already connected. To relieve congestion at the Algiers telephone center, the sections created in Oran, Constantine, and Ghardaia were decentralized. The 1993 telecommunication plan also covered communication security. To achieve this, Mr. Hassene Daffer explained, "the creation of electronic highways will prove very useful to connect large regional poles and large national transit centers. Several sections are already in operation between Algiers, the South and the West of the country." Digital systems are increasingly used in Algeria. In the very heart of the capital, several computerized centers are already in operation in some districts. According to Mr. Daffer, setting up such centers nationwide will make it possible to meet 96 percent of pending applications very quickly and under favorable conditions. Nevertheless, a few towns in the East will have to wait until March 1994. Other projects are being considered, for instance an Algeria-Palma link by 1996, via a fiber-optic submarine cable. As you will recall, optical fiber is a means of transport that involves carrying laser beams through a 1.5-micron thick fiber. It was introduced in Algeria during the eighties. Since then, test sites have been set up and have enabled experts to master the project and the technology.
