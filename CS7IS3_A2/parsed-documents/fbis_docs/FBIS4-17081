Interfax learned that the Bosnian crisis had not been on the agenda. Yeltsin pointed out that the Russian position on the issue remained the same. He also stated that utilization of military force, or such a serious air strike, without its prior discussion in the UN Security Council was unacceptable. The Russian Security Council considered possible developments in Bosnia. Sources in the Russian Security Council told Interfax that the military approach to settlement in ex-Yugoslavia had been estimated as unproductive. Yeltsin emphasized that a summit with the participation of Russia, the U.S. and other parties concerned could play an important role in solution of the crisis. Interfax learned that almost all members of the Russian Security Council had spoken on the Russian policy in the Caucuses. Yeltsin stressed that the lack of a single state policy in this region was regrettable. He proposed that priorities of Russia's policy in the Caucuses be defined. This concerns not only the Trans-Caucasian region within the composition of Russia but also within the composition of the Caucasian independent states. The members of the RF Security Council pointed out that a balanced and weighed approach to developments in the Caucasian Region in general was needed. Yeltsin said not only the interests of the Russian and Caucasian independent states must be taken into consideration but also that of other states concerned. To define the policy of Russia it was necessary to know the real problems of the region, Yeltsin underlined. All moves there must be based on unification of the Caucasian peoples instead of their separation. No prosperity would be possible for these peoples under a policy of disintegration leading to violation of the territorial integrity and further confrontation between the peoples and the states, he stated. Yeltsin stressed that a single Caucuses would be in the interests of Russia and all peoples living in this region. He said primary attention must be paid to the proposals which could bring the conflicting parties together. For instance, when resolving the Ossetian-Ingush conflict it was necessary to take into account both old and new traditions. Influential leaders must be invited to participate in the talks. Everything possible must be done to bring about economic development of Caucuses and for providing jobs for the population, all of which could eliminate the existing problems, Yeltsin suggested. Commenting on the relations with Chechnya, Yeltsin emphasized the necessity for a single basis for further dialogue with representatives of the official Groznyy so that Chechnya remained within the composition of Russia. On support for Russian Cossacks, it was stressed that a special federal program must be worked out. The members of the Security Council stood for participation of Cossacks in the state structures, in particular in the army, in the border defense troops and in the law-enforcement bodies.
