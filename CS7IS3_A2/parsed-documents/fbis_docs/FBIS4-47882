Mr. Bruwer was reacting to the ANC's land policy announcement yesterday in which sweeping land reforms were envisaged. Mr. Bruwer said land claims and demands had always been a sensitive matter and should be approached with great circumspection because of their conflict potential. He said a government which did not take cultural differences into account could destabilize a country. Referring to land demands after forced settlement, Mr. Bruwer said the ANC should not forget that large numbers of white farmers had also been resettled. He said traditional land ownership applied to white farmers in the same way as it did to the other five ethnic groups in the Northern Transvaal.
