Bernardo Crespo, navigation chief of the Progreso port, pointed out that Cubans Amado Sanchez Garay, 35, and Roberto Perez Ruiz, 38, had said they left Cuba 14 days ago to go fishing and that a Mexican ship rescued them on 20 June. The official added the Cubans, who were on board a high-speed boat with registration number 302-322, arrived in the port, located 1,800 km east of Mexico City, early this morning and they requested help to go to Miami, Florida. The Lamba 302 fishing boat rescued the two fishermen, whose high-speed boat ran out of gas on the high seas. Crespo also said the Cuban fishermen were handed over to immigration authorities, who transferred them to Merida, Yucatan's capital, located 36 km south of Progreso. Some 193 Cubans have arrived in Yucatan Peninsula coasts so far in 1994. In March, seven Cuban boat people were rescued off the coast of Isla Contoy, and in April, three groups -- totaling 183 Cubans -- arrived in this port, Chetumal Bay, near Isla Mujeres. Last month, Cuban fisherman Pedro Gutierrez Fernandez arrived in San Felipe Port, also in Yucatan, after he was rescued by the Piscis Mexican fishing boat.
