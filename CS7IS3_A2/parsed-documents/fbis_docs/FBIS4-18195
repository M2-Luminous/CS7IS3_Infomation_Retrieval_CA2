Meyer; place and date not given: "The Community Should Be Able To Function"] [Text] [Meyer] On 12 June new elections will be held for the European Parliament. Important and experienced Europeans will not run again. These include Vice President Hans Peters and the chairman of the budget committee, Thomas von der Vring. Nor are you on the list of candidates--why not? [Klepsch] That is a difficult question. Let me say this: There were special considerations in my party's land organization in the Rhineland-Palatinate to which I did not turn a deaf ear. [Meyer] That means lines were drawn and you fell through the cracks. Could one say it that way? [Klepsch] I could have resisted, but after having been a member of Parliament for 29 years.... [Meyer] The president of the European Parliament is newly elected every two and a half years. He will, therefore, never be as well-known as the president of the Commission. Does Parliament thus forego the chance to create a personality that would reinforce the public's awareness of Parliament? [Klepsch] I think it is a good arrangement. It strengthens the integration of Parliament and allows all parliamentary positions to be reexamined every two and a half years. I also think that the question depends on the individual. I am quite well known in the European Community. A prophet always has the greatest difficulties in his own country. [Meyer] The 18 east German delegates will not become full members until the newly elected Parliament convenes. Paris wanted to prevent this, in case you do not want to sign the lease agreement for the planned new Parliament building in Strasbourg. Will you give in and sign? [Klepsch] The German media have sometimes given the impression that the issue revolved only around the 18 east German delegates. The real issue is the implementation of a system of graded proportionality for the entire Parliament. The package also included the determination of the number of European Community seats in a dozen cases and, especially, the final determination of seats for the Council and for Parliament. These decisions must now be ratified internally by the national parliaments. I think a favorable decision will be made shortly. [Meyer] Does that mean you will sign the lease? [Klepsch] Under the right conditions. [Meyer] Following the Nordic countries and Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics, and probably Slovenia are also seeking to join the European Union [EU]. These countries would benefit greatly from membership. What would be the advantage for West Europe? [Klepsch] I think the most important question remains the following: To what extent is the community's ability to function guaranteed? Such a guarantee exists for the Nordic states and for Austria if some minimum conditions are observed. The question will, of course, be carefully evaluated for each new membership. But there are, after all, many different intermediate stages. The European Economic Area, for instance, is suitable for those who do not want to sacrifice sovereignty to integration. There are association agreements, such as those we have with the Visegrad countries, in which the Baltic countries are interested. To come to a decision within a reasonable time should not be a problem as I see it--the same holds true for Slovenia. [Meyer] Can we expect a uniform right of asylum in the EU and a joint asylum policy? [Klepsch] There are strong indications. The Maastrich Treaty was a beginning. It is in the common interest to establish a joint policy. [Meyer] The institutions of the EU are constantly asked to become democratic. Yet, the preconditions for a European democracy are simply not present: There is no single European nation, no common European language, and there definitely are no European parties... [Klepsch] But these are problems for a nation state. Where do we live? We are not a nation state; we will never be a nation state. I still think the best way to define the European Union is to call it a "sui generis" [one of a kind] object. Even all this talk about a confederation or a federation in Europe is really an internal German debate about constitutional law triggered by our own constitutional structure, and so forth. It is irrelevant to others. [Meyer] Why, then, did the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] decide in favor of a federal model for Europe? [Klepsch] The CDU has correctly opted for a federal solution. If I look at the whole structure, I see that it moves steadily and continuously toward what we call a federal structure. There is an obvious reason: For our future survival and to solve our problems, we must act jointly. [Meyer] Why should our male and female citizens bother voting in the European election at all? [Klepsch] For the same reason they vote in any election: To pick their representatives, the delegates who, on their behalf, can control how and by whom power is exercised and the extent to which the exercise of power can be limited and influenced. [Box, p 7] Parliament Must Consent Article 228 (Agreements With Third States or Organizations) of the treaty concerning the European Union discusses the role of the European Parliament:.. the consent of the European Parliament is required for agreements as defined by Article 238 (Association) and agreements that...create a particular institutional framework, for agreements that have a considerable financial impact on the Community, and for agreements that require amendments to a...legal instrument. In urgent cases, the Council and the European Parliament may agree on a deadline for such consent. Article O (Admission of New Members) stipulates: Every European country may apply for membership in the Union. The country addresses its application to the Council; the Council then decides unanimously after hearing from the Commission and after Parliament, which decides with an absolute majority of its members, has agreed.
