TISHRIN notes the continuing Syrian-Lebanese coordination on all hot issues, primarily on the peace process and Israel's attempts to escape its obligations, especially withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon. The paper further highlights Israel's attempts to disturb the distinguished Syrian-Lebanese relationship and drive Lebanon to unilaterally conclude a suspect settlement. Israel is doing this through making threats and carrying out attacks. Israel's efforts are in vain because the Syrian-Lebanese relationship has reached a historic state of cohesion between the two fraternal countries. The two countries have faced Israel's prevarications and exposed maneuvers with a unified position, whether at the Washington talks or directly on the ground. Despite all the damage it has done to southern Lebanon, Israel could not make Lebanon drop its demand for the entire south or stop its coordination with Syria. The two countries share the same destiny and security and harm done to one of them harms the other. TISHRIN goes on: Experience has shown that the strength of Lebanon and Syria lies in their unified position. Israel is trying to disengage the two countries and drag them one after the other to conclude unilateral, unfair agreements according to which part of the territory would be lost. Despite the fact that Syria and Lebanon have shown willingness to establish a just, comprehensive, and firm peace in the region, Israel has to date not pledged, even for once, to withdraw from the Golan and southern Lebanon. In fact, it is asking Lebanon to conclude a treaty in advance and to make security arrangements. It is giving hints to Syria about a partial withdrawal on the Golan and that it will conduct a referendum on its fate. If anything, this position proves that Israel is taking lightly the peace process, the U.S. initiative, Security Council resolutions, and the Geneva charters. Syrian-Lebanese coordination is the best reply to such outright Israeli intransigence and schemes to undermine Lebanon's sovereignty over its territory and Syria's sovereignty over the Golan. Syria has proven over the years its willingness, in word and deed, to help Lebanon and share its bread and butter with it. Concluding, TISHRIN asserts that Syria will remain by Lebanon's side. If there are people in Israel who are wagering on a Syrian-Lebanese disengagement, they are certainly entertaining illusions. The Syrian-Lebanese relationship is expected to grow and develop further. Coordination will continue in the mutual interest of the two countries and for the good of the Arab nation. AL-BA'TH also comments on the importance of cooperation and coordination between Syria and Lebanon, as well as the peace process and Israel's hard-line approach toward any progress in this process. The Syrian-Lebanese summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Ilyas al-Hirawi reasserts the commitment of the two fraternal countries to a just and comprehensive peace, without any relinquishment or concession. The two countries also reject all Israeli maneuvers and plots aimed at taking on the Arabs one at a time and imposing its distorted, incomplete peace. AL-BA'TH says the above principles also consolidate Syrian-Lebanese ties, based on cooperation and coordination in all fields. These ties are an example of what brotherly relations should be like, to serve the one people in the two countries and the higher Arab interests. As for the hard-line Israeli positions on the peace process, the paper says these stands do not leave any room for optimism -- in the short and long run -- about prospects for progress in the peace process. Israel is still placing more and more hurdles to the bilateral talks in Washington by totally refusing to commit itself to the major principles on which the peace process was launched, primarily Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, and the land-for-peace principle. The paper asserts that Israel has greatly benefited from the serious achievement it has made on the Arab level by signing the Gaza-Jericho accord with the PLO -- an agreement which Israel wants as a model for other agreements it wants to conclude with the rest of the Arab states involved in the peace process. AL-BA'TH concludes: In light of the above, the Arabs had to embark on vital, concrete activity to straighten things out. In this context came the historic Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. The summit has succeeded, by all standards, in stressing the major foundations of peace and crystallizing a general international approach that is committed to a just and comprehensive peace that liberates all of the occupied Arab territories and restores all usurped rights.
