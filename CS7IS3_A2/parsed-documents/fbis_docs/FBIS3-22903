The center will offer peaceful research projects to scientists and technicians of the former Soviet Union who have expertise in weapons of mass destruction and missile guidance systems. Aside from its other role as a source of funds, the center will monitor the various assigned projects to ensure their peaceful objectives. Officials said the idea is to keep economically troubled former Soviet scientists and technicians from selling their expertise to the highest bidder, including such states as North Korea and Iraq. The center was established by agreement among Russia, the United States, the European Union and Japan.
