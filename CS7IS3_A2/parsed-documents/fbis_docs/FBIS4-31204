Soon after his arrival in Zagreb, the Romanian prime minister laid a wreath at the monument to the Croatian homeland in Medvedgrad. As I have just said, the official talks are now underway. The talks are focused on economic issues. After the high-ranking officials of the two delegations were introduced, Prime Minister Valentic informed his eminent guest about great changes in the Croatian economy. In his introductory speech, Valentic said that there are no political or economic problems between Croatia and Romania. The two prime ministers agreed that this is a precondition for doing more in the econmic sphere, because possibilities abound. In this respect, trade should be developed despite the fact that Croatia is not yet completely free. The Romanian delegation will stay in Croatia until Wednesday [8 June], when agreements on marine transport and the protection of investments will be signed. Talks between economic experts of the two delegations will soon open in the Croatian Economic Chamber. Later today the guests from Romania will visit the president of the Assembly, Nedjeljko Mihanovic, and the mayor of Zagreb, Branko Miksa.
