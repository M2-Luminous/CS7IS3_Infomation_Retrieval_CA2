FR940822-0-00030 FR940822-0-00009 (iii) Controlled groups. A member of a controlled group (as defined in §47.3&hyph;2) holds more than 4,000 gallons of gasoline if the aggregate amount of all gasoline held by all members of the controlled group exceeds 4,000 gallons. A member of a controlled group holds more than 2,000 gallons of diesel fuel or aviation fuel if the aggregate amount of all diesel fuel or aviation fuel, as the case may be, held by all members of the controlled group exceeds 2,000 gallons. (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this section: Example 1. On October 1, 1993, A holds 10,000 gallons of gasoline, 6,000 gallons of which are held exclusively for use on a farm for farming purposes. The remaining 4,000 gallons are held for use in A's highway vehicles. A is not a member of a controlled group. A is not liable for the floor stocks tax on any of the 10,000 gallons because the aggregate amount of fuel held by A for uses other than exempt uses does not exceed 4,000 gallons. Example 2. On October 1, 1993, B holds 1,900 gallons of diesel fuel and 3,900 gallons of gasoline. B is not a member of a controlled group. B is not liable for the floor stocks tax on diesel fuel because B's holdings of diesel fuel do not exceed 2,000 gallons. B is not liable for the floor stocks tax on gasoline because B's holdings of gasoline do not exceed 4,000 gallons. Example 3. On October 1, 1993, C holds 4,100 gallons of gasoline for resale at a service station. C is liable for a floor stocks tax of $176.30 (4,100 X $.043) on that gasoline. §47.3&hyph;5 Requirements with respect to payment and return for the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax. (a) Payment of tax. The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax is to be paid without assessment or notice on or before November 30, 1993. (b) Filing of returns _(1) Form 720. Every person liable for the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax must make a return of the tax on Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return. The return is to be prepared and filed in accordance with the instructions relating to the return. (2) Time for filing _(i) In general. The Form 720 required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be filed on or before November 30, 1993, and is a return for the third calendar quarter of 1993. A first return reporting only the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax is also a final return and therefore, in accordance with the instructions to Form 720, the box for ``final return'' must be marked. (ii) Return reporting other taxes. A person must file only one Form 720 for a quarter. If a person is required under part 40 of this chapter to file Form 720 for the third calendar quarter of 1993 for other excise taxes earlier than November 30, 1993, that person files a single Form 720 for the quarter on or before November 30, 1993. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii) does not extend the time for making deposits or paying any excise tax. §47.3&hyph;6 Imposition of the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax on diesel fuel held on January 1, 1994. (a) Fuel subject to tax. Section 13243 of the Act imposes a floor stocks tax on diesel fuel held at the first moment of January 1, 1994, by any person if_ (1) No tax was imposed on the diesel fuel under section 4041(a) or 4091 as in effect on December 31, 1993; and (2) Tax would have been imposed by section 4081, as amended by section 13242 of the Act, on any prior removal, entry, or sale of the diesel fuel had section 4081 applied to the diesel fuel for periods before January 1, 1994. (b) Rate of tax. The rate of the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax is 24.4 cents per gallon. (c) Person liable for tax. The person liable for tax on any diesel fuel subject to the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax is the wholesale distributor or other registered producer, recreational boat operator, or other person that holds the fuel at the first moment of January 1, 1994. Fuel is held by a person if the person has title to the fuel (whether or not delivery to that person has been made) at such time, as determined under applicable local law. §47.3&hyph;7 Exception to the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax. (a) In general. The January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax does not apply to diesel fuel held exclusively for an exempt use. In determining whether diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use, the following rules apply: (1) An exempt use, with respect to diesel fuel, is any use of diesel fuel (other than in producing a diesel fuel/alcohol mixture or as fuel in a diesel-powered train) that is described in section 6427 (as in effect on January 1, 1994) and that would entitle the ultimate purchaser to a credit or payment equal to any tax imposed by section 4081 (as in effect on such date). Thus, for example, exempt uses of diesel fuel include use other than as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle (as defined in §48.4041&hyph;8(b)(4) of this chapter), use on a farm for farming purposes, exclusive use by a State or local government or nonprofit educational organization, and use in an off-highway business use. (2) Diesel fuel held for use in a diesel-powered train is not exempt from the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax under paragraph (a)(1) of this section unless the fuel is held by a State or local government. Thus, the exemptions for use other than as fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle and off-highway business use do not apply to fuel used in a diesel-powered train. For circumstances in which diesel fuel held for use in a diesel-powered train may be exempt from the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax, see paragraph (b) of this section (relating to the exemption for dyed fuel) and §47.3&hyph;6(a)(1), which exempts fuel that was previously taxed under section 4041(a) or 4091 (as in effect on December 31, 1993).
