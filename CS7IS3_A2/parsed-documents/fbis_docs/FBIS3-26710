All levels of party committees and governments should take serious account of rural work, show concern for the peasants' lives, and protect and bring their initiative into play. From 5 to 9 February, Wen Jiabao visited some peasants in poor mountainous areas in Gutian, Pingnan, Zhouning, and Fuan counties and also held discussions with cadres and masses there to obtain information about the peasants' lives. Wen Jiabao said: This year is a crucial year for economic structural reform. The basic task in rural work is to seriously implement the instructions of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the central meeting on rural work, to stabilize the party's policy on rural areas, deepen rural reform, bring peasant initiative into better play, stimulate the rural economy, increase peasant income, maintain social stability in rural areas, and lay a solid foundation and create good conditions for the smooth implementation of all major reform measures and for the sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the national economy. Wen Jiabao stressed: Leaders in charge of rural work should always think of the peasants, show concern for them, rely on them, and do everything for them. At present, every possible effort should be made to develop the rural economy, increase peasants' income, reduce their burden, improve social order in the rural areas, and provide technological information for the peasants. There is a need to care for the old revolutionary base, ethnic, poor areas, and disaster-stricken areas and to help the people there make good arrangements in production and life. Wen Jiabao said: As spring farming is approaching, we should make good arrangements for spring production, help the peasants work out and implement production plans, organize the supply of chemical fertilizers, farm chemicals, agricultural machinery, diesel oil, and other agricultural production materials, ensure service before and in the middle of production, and strive to reap a good harvest this year.
