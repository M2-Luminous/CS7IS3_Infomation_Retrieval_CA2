And its forestry conservation practices have enabled the government to reap rare accolades from a Western world which was outspoken in its criticism of the military junta's takeover after public demonstrations five years ago. "Burma gets a bum rap" on logging practices, an otherwise- critical foreign observer commented. "The government is repressive, but its conservation policies are enlightened," a Western diplomat said. With about 75 percent of the world's teak reserves and a large quantity of other hardwoods, Rangoon has invited up to 100 percent foreign investment in everything from sawmills to furniture factories to gain sorely-needed funds for development. It intends, however, to maintain strict control of logging operations in order to preserve its forest resources for the future, officials stressed in recent interviews here. About half the country is covered in forests, and officials said that so far only three million cubic meters (105 million cubic yards) of wood had been cut, compared to 40 million cubic meters (1,400 cubic yards) in Malaysia, which is half the size of Burma. Before neighboring Thailand banned logging on its own territory in 1988, it had almost halved its forest cover. When Rangoon called a halt early last year to allegedly abusive Thai logging in concessions along the border, it adjusted its income targets accordingly, planning a 6.9 percent GDP drop in the forestry sector. In the 1994-95 fiscal year, starting April 1, it hopes to see a new rise in income as investors from places such as Sweden and Thailand come on stream with renovations to local hardwood furniture factories. But would-be foreign investors are mainly looking for big profits and a quick return, instead of taking a longer view, officials of the Forestry Department and the state-run Myanmar Timber Enterprise complained. They said they need equipment--including tractors, skidders and road-building machinery to help speed up extraction and delivery to the investors--as well as marketing and technology knowhow. From the felling of a tree to the factory can take up to two years. "The faster we can do it, the faster we can produce downstream products," one official said. But all officials, including Forestry Minister Lieutenant General Chit Swe, stressed that Burma's future resources would not be sacrificed. Interviewed surrounded by top aides and advisors, the minister, a member of the ruling junta, noted that no one else in the group was wearing military dress. "I'm the only one wearing the green," he said, tugging at the sleeve of his forest-green uniform. "I like green. I am a conservationist." His statement was backed up separately by other officials, one of whom said: "The minister is a fanatic. He doesn't want to fell any trees. He wants to lower the quota. What he wants are natural parks, wildlife, eco-tourism." Under a system of selective felling on a sustainable basis, the Forestry Department allocates a quota of Annual Allowable Cuts (AAC) for all commercial varieties in strictly-defined sites. Loggers could harvest up to 350,000 tonnes of teak and 1.3 million tonnes of other hardwoods annually without endangering future extraction, according to official calculations. Actual figures stand at approximately 250,000 tonnes and 500,000 tonnes -- due in part to equipment shortages, officials acknowledged. They also said the shortfall compensated for remote areas outside their control along the borders--estimated by one official at "maybe 5-7 percent" but which foreign analysts put at between 15 and 20 percent. The ministry meanwhile replants some 80,000 acres (200,000 hectares) a year, half in teak and other hardwoods. Much of the rest is devoted to faster-growing trees to be used for the fuel on which 70 percent of the population is dependent.
