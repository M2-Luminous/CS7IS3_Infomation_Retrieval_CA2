In the opinion of scientists from the All-Russian Research Institute of the Economic Management of Agriculture, Russia is quite ready for not only stopping grain imports by the state, but also for increasing the exports of its own grain. Grain imports began in the 60's after the agricultural experiments of Nikita Khrushchev, which ended in failure. Between 1961 and 1965 Russia accounted for about two million tonnes of grain a year out of the grain imported for all the USSR republics. Consequently, the average annual per capita level was 16 kg. However, in 1992 Russia imported 28 million tonnes, or 188 kg per capita. In 1992, the best of the past several years, grain imports accounted for 32 per cent of the domestic grain output. American farmers were the first to profit from massive Russian grain imports: They got a stable market for their grain, supported by the administration, for decades to come. In addition, grain deliveries from the U.S. were usually made on condition that Russia would pay for the freight of American ships, which transported the grain. U.S. credits for Russia's grain purchases, described as "aid", had to be returned with market interest rates. A considerable part of them were short-term credits. In short, Russia's grain imports were an expensive undertaking for it. The question arose: Are grain imports really so necessary for Russia? Statistical data show that the amount of grain per capita of the population was continually increasing over the past decade. Last year's per capita level of 538 kg was far greater than 342 kg in the years, when Russia was exporting and not importing grain. Analysing the problem, scientists from the research institute of the economic management of agriculture came to the conclusion that there were two reasons for the growth of grain imports. The most important of them is that the growth of the production and consumption of livestock-breeding products, registered during the past several years, was achieved through the growth of the use of grain as fodder for the stock and the poultry. Grain imports helped to make up for the wasteful use of part of the domestic grain output for fodder purposes. A shortage of high-quality wheat was the second reason for massive grain imports. In the opinion of Russian scientists, both factors can be eliminated in the near future with the help of corresponding corrections in the economic policy. A considerable, scientifically substantiated reduction of the consumption of fodder grain will become a real way of overcoming grain shortages. However, the termination of grain imports by the state does not mean that commercial structures will also stop buying grain abroad.
