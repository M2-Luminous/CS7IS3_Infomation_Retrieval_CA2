SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 1, 1989, the Maryland Department of the Environment submitted a revision to the Maryland State implementation plan (SIP) to achieve and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM&hyph;10). The revision consists of: (1) An amended Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 10.18.01&hyph;''General Administrative Provisions''; (2) An amended COMAR 10.18.02&hyph;''Permits, Approvals, and Registrations''; (3) An amended COMAR 10.18.03&hyph;''State-Adopted National Ambient Air Quality Standards and Guidelines''; (4) An amended COMAR 10.18.05&hyph;''Air Pollution Episode System''; and (5) An amended COMAR 10.18.06&hyph;''General Emission Standards, Prohibitions, and Restrictions''. The March 1, 1989 submittal is consistent with the SIP revision requirements for PM&hyph;10 Group III areas as detailed in the July 1, 1987 Federal Register notice (52 FR 24672). The amended Maryland regulations are consistent with the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10, and specify: PM&hyph;10 as an indicator of particulate matter. Exceedance levels. Reference methods for measurement of PM&hyph;10. Emergency episode plan revisions to include PM&hyph;10. Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulation standards for both PM&hyph;10 and Total Suspended Particulate (TSP), with standards for emission rates and significant monitoring concentrations. Summary of SIP Revision On July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10) (52 FR 24634). The PM&hyph;10 standards replace the total suspended particulate (TSP) standards promulgated by EPA in 1971. Also on July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated changes to the policies and regulations by which it will implement the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in 40 CFR parts 51 and 52 (52 FR 24672). Using the classification criteria established at 52 FR 24672, EPA has preliminarily designated areas within each State as Group I, II, or III based upon an area's probability of attaining the PM&hyph;10 standard. The July 1, 1987 Federal Register notice requires State implementation plan (SIP) revisions for all classified Group I, II, and III areas and indicates the SIP revision requirements for each classification. On August 7, 1987, the State of Maryland was classified at 52 FR 29383 as follows: Group II&hyph;Baltimore County&hyph;City of Baltimore. Group III&hyph;All other Areas not classified as Group I or Group II. The Clean Air Act as amended (1990 Amendments) affects these classifications, and the associated requirements, in a number of ways. The 1990 Amendments eliminated the need for States to seek approval of ``committal'' SIP revisions for Group II areas as prescribed in the July 1, 1987 Federal Register . The Group II areas are to be addressed using the authorities established in section 107 of the Clean Air Act concerning the classification of areas as attainment or nonattainment with regard to the NAAQS. EPA has determined that sufficient evidence does not exist to redesignate the City of Baltimore as nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 at this time. The 1990 Amendments did not affect the requirements established for Group III areas. The July 1, 1987 Federal Register requires States to seek approval of SIP revisions as required under the preconstruction review program and to codify other minor regulatory changes as needed. It is presumed that the existing Maryland SIP is adequate to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in all Group III areas in the State. On March 1, 1989, the State of Maryland responded to the July, 1, 1987 Federal Register by submitting five (5) regulations amended to reflect the revised particulate matter standards as a SIP revision. This SIP revision addresses Group III areas only. EPA Evaluation EPA has evaluated Maryland's SIP revision request and concluded the following: (1) The amended regulations conform with the revised primary and secondary NAAQS for PM&hyph;10; (2) the amended regulations are clearly enforceable; and (3) the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 51 have been met. A more detailed evaluation is provided in the Technical Support Document available upon request from the Regional EPA office listed in the Addresses section of this document. EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. These revisions to Maryland's regulations have been effective in the State since March 21, 1989. This action will be effective April 25, 1994 unless, by March 28, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on April 25, 1994. Final Action EPA is approving the five (5) regulations submitted by the Maryland Department of the Environment as a revision to the Maryland SIP. EPA's review of this material indicates that it conforms to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 51 and 52, and to the July 1, 1987 promulgation of NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in the Federal Register . The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment. Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. EPA , 427 U.S. 246, 255&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). This SIP revision establishing revised particulate matter standards in Maryland has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by April 25, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act.)
