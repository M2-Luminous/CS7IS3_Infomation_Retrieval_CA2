The observatory also predicted that after the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant is officially put into operation, the increase in the quantity of radiation in Hong Kong per year will be fairly low and will not affect human health. Since the end of last August, the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant has started supplying on a trial basis some electricity needed in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Observatory set up nuclear radiation monitoring posts in 10 areas of Hong Kong, but to date has found no signs of an increase in the quantity of radiation. Wang Mingsong, chief senior scientist at the observatory, said: It is predicted that after the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant is put into full operation, the increase in the quantity of radiation in Hong Kong will be merely under one-thousandth the amount of ordinary radiation exposure in urban areas; this will not affect human health. Dai Qianjun, public affairs manager for the Hong Kong Nuclear Power Investment Corporation, noted: Hong Kong's power plants did not increase power generating equipment last year, but Hong Kong's demand for electricity is increasing. After it is put into operation, the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant can provide 70 percent of its electricity to Hong Kong, accounting for 17 to 18 percent of the amount consumed in Hong Kong; this will meet Hong Kong's power demands from 1994 to 1995. Moreover, the low operating cost will maintain a stable electric rate in Hong Kong over the next 20 years.
