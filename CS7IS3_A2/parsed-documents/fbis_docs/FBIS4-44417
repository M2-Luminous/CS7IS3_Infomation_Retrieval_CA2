Bilateral economic and technological cooperation situation 1) Chinese joint venture enterprises in Indonesia. Some 84 Sino-Indonesian joint ventures have been set up in Indonesia since reestablishment of relations which have the approval of Indonesia's Investment Committee or of China's Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT--organization name as published], of which, 23 have been approved by the latter organization and officially have informed our office; seven have been approved by the former organization and officially have informed our office. Chinese investment agreements approved by MOFERT amount to $11.0025 million. The primary means of Chinese investment is by introducing equipment, manufacturing technology, set up and debugging, and conducting training, which account for approximately 90 percent of all Chinese investment agreements. Major projects include textiles, glass, watches, electricity, chemical industry machinery, universal machinery manufacture, activated charcoal, printing ink, pharmaceuticals, fishing, and technical consulting. 2) Engineering contracts, and technology and labor export cooperation. Between January and June 1993 China signed Indonesian engineering contracts and labor cooperation contracts at $41.52 million, up 640 percent over the same period in 1992, of which, the former accounted for $29.89 million, up 1014 percent over the same period in 1992, and the latter for $1.63 million, up 20 percent over the same period in 1992. Completed projects and projects being completed include: a 35,000-ton grade oceanic tanker and a 5 x 35,000 kilowatt thermal power plant unit. Work continues on complete alkalization equipment, cooperative gulch-gold mining, coal mine exploration and design, hot sheet steel plant construction and electrical transmission projects. In 1993 two contracts were signed for complete power generation equipment alone. One is a 2 x 25,000 kilowatt t hermal power plant unit. The other is China's largest thermal power plant unit, a 2 x 200,000 kilowatt project. The latter project alone is worth nearly $300 million, including plant selection and design, construction, equipment supply, unit set up , debugging and operation training. Only such a unified group of economic and technological cooperation projects with elect rico-mechanical equipment exports can better motivate and promote swifter developments in Sino-Indonesian bilateral economic cooperation to improve and spur on political and diplomatic relationships between the two countries. 3. Future outlook and growth According to the ranking of countries in China's import and export trade totals, Indonesia at present is in 14th place. In the three years since reestablishment of relations, it is also the country with the largest import expor t trade deficit with China. However, because the strong mutual dependence between the import and export commodities of both countries, we could say that Indonesia will be a large potential market for China's product exports, especially electrico-mechanical products and complete equipment exports. It should be a key point in our strategy to promote market diversification . Towards this end I recommend using China's strength in producing electric-mechanical products and complete sets of equipment combined with China's contract engineering in Indonesia to promote future growth in Sino-Indonesian economic and trade relations. It is important that the following work be done well: 1. Stress developing China's strengths in the industries of electric-mechanical products and complete sets of equipment, and participate in the transformation of Indonesia's production enterprises. At present Indonesia's major economic and trade partners are Japan, the United States, the EC, the ROK, Taiwan and Singapore and other ASEAN countries (regions). To develop its economic might swiftly, while actively developing its import and export trade, Indonesia tends towards more preferential conditions to attract overseas clients and foreign funds to open domestic joint ventures and thereby accelerate expansion and strenthening of economic and technological cooperation with various countries and regions of the world. According to statistics from the Indonesian Investment Coordination Council, as of the 31 August 1993, the accumulated global investment in Indonesia was $69.66 billion. The major investment industries are the chemical (19.6 percent), tourism (10.7 percent) and mining (9.3 percent) along with machinery manufacturing, papermaking and textiles. The aforementioned countries have been in the Indonesian market a relatively long time and their actual strength is far greater than China's. Regarding high class consumer goods in the Indones ian consumer market, their products are high grade, good quality, strongly functional, high priced and delivered on time. The Indonesian light and textile industries have grown to a certain international level with their own characteristics. However, its electro-mechanical industry is still in the infant stage; the country's largest machinery manufacturing plant only corresponds to a medium-sized Chinese one. The majority mainly do repairs. A few factories can produce some parts and small volumes of small and medium-sized mechanical equipment. The country has no complete electro-mechanical production system. There still is no production of power plant equipment. Thus we should stress importing complete medium and small capacity thermal and hydropower generators, electric transformer equipment, metallurgy equipment, mining equipment, a variety of construction machinery, petrochemical and chemical industry equipment, agricultural machinery, complete cement production equipment, plus technology for computer-controlled system software. China's greatest strength in opening and developing Indonesia's markets is in equipment and technology to satisfy the needs of Indonesia's production enterprises and extended reproduction therein. 2. The effective way to develop Indonesia's industrial product market should be active encouragement an d organization of projects uniting economic and technological cooperation to import and export trade. Catering to the needs of the Indonesian Government, support Chinese enterprises under contract work in Indonesia through Indonesian economic cooperative projects to spur on exports of Chinese electro-mechanical products and complete sets of equipment or use the sup eriority of both exports to promote bilateral economic and technological cooperation. This would both improve the economic results of China's export enterprises and earn us a lot of foreign exchange. Such forms of mutual bi-directional investment cooperation also will improve friendly relations with both countries. Given the shortage of Indonesian funds, China should appropriately assemble some limited fiscal power suited to Indonesia's peculiar situation and provide necessary export loans to expand exports of complete sets of electro-mechanical products. 3. To open the Indonesian market we must take note of the form of China's model projects in Indonesia. China severed relations with Indonesia for 23 years for various reasons, making present Indonesia still harbor misgivings regarding China. For example, Indonesia granted birth certificates to people from 45 countries and regions, excluding China. Although Indonesia's industrial and commercial world understands China, not all understand China's complete electro-mechanical equipment. Likewise they have many misgivings, thus it is extremely important that we set up several successful large-scale complete "model" projects in Indonesia. Provided we all give priority to this matter at home and abroad, it will have results very quickly. Recently we coordinated with t hose at home and abroad to bring closer bilateral relations through construction of an irrigation project in Indonesia, promoting future bilateral cooperation in broader areas. 4. Squarely face China's export product problems. The old issue of the quality of China's export products, which is difficult to resolve, is the fundamental issue for entering the Indonesian market. The competitiveness of electro-mechanical product quality lies in their superior performance, ease of operation and work safety. At least we must ensure that China's products are about the same as those of the advanced countries of Europe and the United States. Second is establishing product sales networks and after-sale service networks, including parts and components and repair networks. Finally, we must ensure that China's export products to Indonesia do not compete for sales at rolled back and lower prices. This would both confuse opening up the Indonesian market and shatter the development base for enterprises to be independent. Therefore, domestically, we must enhance the restraint and control mechanisms over export products through the chambers of commerce of various industries. At the same time, mesh with the coordinated management of overseas economic commerical attaches, and really consolidate and further develop the Indonesian markets already opened. 5. Establish a project contract model suited to Indonesia. This contract model mainly incl udes the following: 1) Foreign contract projects themselves are a complex system of projects. This is the same in every country. Basically they involve two major processes: the process from bidding, negotiations, study, economic and technolgical feasibility draft approval to signing a contract; and the process from project technical design, site selection and design approval, construction, equipment manufacture, check and acceptance, transport, assembly, debugging to going into commercial operation. 2) Indonesian contract projects must correctly squarely face special human relations and the phenomenon that "money opens doors" which determine relations between Indonesian proprietors and Chinese enterprises. We must firmly uphold the cooperative division of labor principle that proprietors are responsible for anything related to Indonesian work and conditions outside of construction while anything related to China's relevant domestic procedures and work is the responsibility of the Chinese contractor. 3) Indonesian contract projects must firmly uphold the overall responsibility of the Chinese side. We must divide labor with Indonesia. The Chinese side should undertake responsibility for technical guidance on projects in Indonesia. This is because Indonesia still is now an economically undeveloped large country with many people and rather high unemployment. We only arrived at this rather appropriate solution after 1992 when the Indonesian Government built a five unit 35,000 kilowatt coal-burning electrical power plant project which caused a "labor wave." China and Indonesia have a close geographical location. Economic and trade dependence is strong. In the more than three years since relations were re-established on the basis of voluntary equality and mutual benefit, the developing bilateral economic and trade cooperative relationship fully accords with the desires and basic interests of the people of both countries. Looking to the future full of confidence, we should work harder and strive to make greater developments in Sino-Indonesian trade and economic and technological cooperation in 1994.
