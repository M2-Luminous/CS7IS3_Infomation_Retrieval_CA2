Luc Lemonnier has this report from Sarajevo: [Lemonnier] The incident once again took place at the Jewish cemetery, close to the center of Sarajevo, in the hills where Serbs and Muslims are separated by only a few dozen meters. A detachment of French UN troops is also in this frontline sector. Earlier in the week they had already returned fire against the Serbs with their heavy machine-guns. Last night, just after 2000, they were the targets of deliberate fire, which a high-ranking UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] official said came from Bosnian Serb lines. The French soldiers returned fire for a few minutes with their machine guns, and one French soldier was injured by splinters of stone during the clash. Such incidents are a daily occurrence in Sarajevo, especially in the evening, and Generals Cot and Rose warned two days ago that without a significant increase in UN troop numbers, such incidents could end up threatening the cease-fire and the whole peace process.
