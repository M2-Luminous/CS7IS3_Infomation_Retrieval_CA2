Jean-Daniel Levi, general manager of the National Space Research Center (CNES), which is organizing a number of meetings between French and Chinese space experts in Beijing and Shanghai this week, told LE FIGARO that the Chinese "have a real desire to establish cooperation ties, and we have decided to continue discussions and to start a series of exchanges and expert visits." However, despite the interest of Chinese officials in this sector, two major manufacturers have been excluded from these meetings at the request of the Beijing authorities: MATRA and Thomson. The French gave in to Chinese demands on the advice of the French foreign minister. Black List MATRA and Thomson, with Dassault, have been "blacklisted" by the Chinese Government because of their participation in contracts to supply arms, frigates, and Mirage aircraft to Taiwan. The 12 January communique which restored Franco-Sino relations stated that China would open up its markets to French companies "on an equal footing" with companies from other countries. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur raised this issue during a meeting with Li Peng, his Chinese counterpart, in Beijing in early April. Mr. Levi thinks that this problem will disappear in time. A number of French industrial groups were nonetheless surprised at the Chinese Government's "indelicate" handling of the affair. The CNES head believes that possibilities for cooperation are more likely to be found in the design of satellites than in their launch, since the low-cost "Long March" rockets are already a serious competitor for the European Ariane space group. The French participants did, however, note the interest expressed by their interlocutors in French technology and, ironically, in MATRA equipment in particular. They were received by two leading officials, Song Jian, the minister of the State Science and Technology Comission, and, most importantly, by General Ding Henggao, head of the Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense. This commission controls the Chinese counterparts of the CNES, the Atomic Energy Commission [CEA], and the General Air Office. Gen. Ding, a member of the Central Committee who was very recently decorated with a third star, the supreme rank in the Chinese Army, was expected in Paris yesterday to attend the Satory Arms Fair at the invitation of French Defense Minister Francois Leotard. He worked with Nie Rongzhen, the "father" of the Chinese atom bomb, and married his daughter, Nie Li, who is herself a general and a leading official in the Chinese space industry.
