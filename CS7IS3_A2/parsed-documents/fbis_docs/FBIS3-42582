Odilov, deputy minister of grain products of the Republic of Tajikistan, by N. Vanichkin; place and date not given: "Bread Passion, or Someone's Misfortune"] [Text] A neighbor of mine, a woman in her declining years, called Auntie Vera in everyday life, was an inveterate optimist. Even the harsh consequences of last year's events which are known to all did not shake her faith in a bright future. Nothing could shake her: neither the empty shelves in the stores nor the long waiting lines in front of the bakeries. And I, who am younger, could only envy the unshakable faith of this elderly person. And once when I met Auntie Vera with a stool in her hand, of course, I could not help but ask her where she was setting out for at the break of day. "To look after the grain," was my neighbor's answer. Our oldtimers' conversations in the entryway have now moved closer to the window where bakery items are sold. We get up a little earlier, we get in line, and we share all the news at the same time. And you might even end up without any bread. Sometimes a "sit-in" in front of the store for a whole day does not even help. Not a single bun makes its way to us poor pensioners. Everything is snatched away by the "good fellows"--young people. And what is surprising is that they take it away in sacks and God only knows why they need so much. [Vanichkin] What is the real reason for the severe interruptions in the supply of bread for the population that have occurred recently? We asked this question of the deputy minister of grain products of the Republic of Tajikistan, Sh. Odilov. [Odilov] The situation with bread has indeed become critical. And there are many reasons for this. Because of the higher cost and shortage in the food stores of meat and dairy products, the population has begun to consume more bakery items. The situation is exacerbated by the lack of small-denomination coupons at the trading points. When they are unable to obtain change from R5,000 or R10,000 banknotes, many people are forced to buy bread in excess of the norm. Panic buying is also stirred up by the so-called "wheeler-dealers" in independent trade who speculate in bread along with workers in the store. Much of it is acquired by owners of private farms to feed their livestock. And while in past years internal affairs organs did a certain amount of preventive work with those who use bread for other than food purposes, today, as you have noted, they cannot impose order even in the waiting lines in front of the bread stores. The situation is extremely critical with fuel and lubricants as well. Because of all this only about 40 percent of the city's trade points are supplied with bread products. Enterprises of our branch, in spite of the shortage of yeast and other components, are over-fulfilling the daily norm for bread baking. And this--believe it or not--is more than 170 tonnes. We are producing even more than trade is ordering from us. We have adequate raw material and capacities. There are even possibilities of increasing production. The question hinges on the problem of prompt delivery of bakery products to the consumers. At the same time in the extremely difficult conditions with a shortage of the main food product one must be reasonably thrifty and use bread for food purposes. And trade workers and also buyers must be conscientious and prevent cases of violations in the sale of bakery items. One wishes to hope also that internal affairs organs will turn their attention to the operation of bread stores and also the illegal actions of certain wheeler-dealers in the speculation market. Otherwise it could happen that we would end up without enough supplies of raw material. And then panic buying could indeed lead us to a bread shortage. [Vanichkin] Sharifdzhon Olimovich, you mentioned that there are possibilities of increasing the production of bakery products. In this connection I do not think it would be out of place for you to tell us about how things are going with the construction of the new capital bakery, whose production capacities, as was anticipated previously, were to be introduced at the end of this year. How realistic are these expectations today? [Odilov] So far there is nothing to boast about. Although we did intend to start up a plant by the New Year and make a kind of gift to residents of the capital, this is not likely to happen. And here it is not the collective of the enterprise under construction or the general contracting organizations involved in the construction of this facility who are to blame. The builders are working, one might say, day and night. And I am not saying this just to sound good. You yourself saw how they brought mattresses and blankets to the construction site for workers on the second shift. Now everything is set up so that at least one line with a capacity of 20 tonnes of rectangular loaves of bread a day will go into operation by the end of the year. Its startup will make it possible for us to relieve the critical strain in supplying the population of the right-bank zone with bread products. Of course, this is with stable operation of the bread and confectionery combine. [Vanichkin] What is the reason for the adjustment of the earmarked plans? [Odilov] The main one is the failure to make payments to Russia. Since April of this year we have been unable to settle accounts with our suppliers under agreements concluded previously. All the equipment we need is ready to send, the containers and railroad cars have been ordered, and considerable penalty payments are being "accumulated" because of their idle time. Naturally, our associates are becoming more mistrustful, and this, as you yourself understand, threatens our established relations. For example, the warehouse for bulk storage of flour today is in urgent need of solid-drawn tubes with an internal diameter of 75 mm and wall thickness of 2.5 mm. There are none in the republic. We signed a contract with the Moscow Tube Plant but we cannot pay for the deliveries. The payments are not going through. Thus because the money did not go through for an air compressor, 24 units of standard equipment have not been delivered. And what can you say. With a normal finance-credit system the plant would have gone on-line three months ago. Workers of the main construction administration are letting us down too. We do not yet have the blueprints for the boiler, although they were to have been turned over on 15 October. I understand that the developers are now having difficulties with skilled specialists, but since they promised to prepare the documentation, they should be so kind as to do it by the earmarked deadline. [Vanichkin] Sharifdzhon Olimovich, if the boiler is not working, no heat or steam will go to the production facility. Consequently even the one production line you plan to start up at the end of the year will not go into operation. [Odilov] It is practically impossible to envision ahead of time the stage of construction readiness at which the failure would come. And there is no one to solve our problems for us. But I can assure you with complete confidence that one bread baking line will be in operation. The steam and heat will be produced according to a temporary plan from the currently existing boiler at the Dushanbe bakery-confectionery combine. We have also solved the problem of the air compressor. Instead of the air collectors that are in short supply we plan to use receivers--the Pamir production association promises to deliver them to us. True, the work front is still not large, but in the next few days we intend to complete all the startup and adjustment work on the fourth technological line for bread baking. To do this we have organized brigades which are now inspecting all the equipment and working on two shifts. The desire of the construction workers to solve the bread problem is commendable. But now they too need help. They are in extreme need of solid-drawn steel tubes, nonrusting electrodes or nonrusting welding wire, and bronze and brass faucets. Possibly certain enterprises or organizations have the aforementioned equipment. It would be good if any of them would help the construction workers. And we will agree to any payment conditions: transfer, cash, or barter. I hope that this request will not go unnoticed. The entire city needs the bakery, and this means that each one of us should be interested in its startup.
