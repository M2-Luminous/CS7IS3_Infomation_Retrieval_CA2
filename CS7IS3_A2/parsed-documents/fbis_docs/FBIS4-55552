Letters of certification have been distributed, but is this sufficient? Since 1981 no identification cards have been prepared by the Albanian Government, which, prior to 1990, had used the funds set up for this purpose in the Ministry of Public Order. For almost four years citizens have had only letters of certification of their citizenship because there has been no government decision or, more importantly, there have been no funds. This has created anomalies and possibilities for abuse and falsifications, presenting no small danger for the country. It is said that falsified letters of certification are being sold in Greece, thereby making it possible for Albanians to change their names. In addition to international passports, a number of foreign countries also require ordinary identification cards, a requirement which -- since it is transformed into a "necessity" -- becomes a source of illegal business and profit in the respective areas. "We have made several appeals to the government," Abdyl Xhaja, director of the Office of Vital Statistics, says, "but it is clear that there are no funds." The problem becomes more complex when you consider that one-third of Albanians work outside the country and that this reform, if it is carried out, requires uniformity in development. Another possibility is that the government might apply a system like the one in use in many European countries -- an ordinary identification card, which is also currently in effect in Macedonia. But in Tirana people have not been able to get identification cards since June 1990. We have to think as soon as possible, not only about recognizing the rights of Albanians in this situation but also about eliminating opportunities for chauvinistic moves on the human level for banal economic reasons.
