According to Cimoszewicz, it would be best if Solidarity joined the negotiations which are already taking place with the other trade union centers. The negotiations will continue regardless of whether Solidarity decides to participate in them since there are many partners for the talks, and they are sufficiently responsible partners, too. Yet, the presence of Solidarity "would be a very good thing to happen," Cimoszewicz stressed. Labor Minister Leszek Miller said the government is interested in meeting Solidarity postulates, but it is the parliament and not the government that decides on the rate of legislative proceedings; therefore the postulate to have a batch of laws on enterprises enacted by 15 March should not be addressed to the government (which is interested in speeding up the proceedings within the framework of ordinary legislative measures). According to chiefs of six working groups in which the negotiations with the trade unions are going on currently regarding citizens' social guarantees, it is possible to reach concrete agreements within the next few weeks, among others regarding family benefits and housing supplements. For instance, the idea of withholding family benefits from people with high incomes is being debated, as well as the idea of linking the amount of the benefit with the number of children and income levels. The presidia of KERM and of KSPRM said the negotiations are difficult, but they relate to issues which are strictly of merit, among them the fundamentals of social policies and also social protections. According to Deputy Prime Minister Cimoszewicz, the government had submitted specific proposals and it is waiting now for reasonable responses; the government is also determined to undertake measures that will facilitate a speedy coming to agreement. The participants of the negotiations are to receive a draft of the socioeconomic program for the years 1994-97, which was prepared by the Central Planning Administration.
