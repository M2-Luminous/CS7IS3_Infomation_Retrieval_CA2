It was the first meeting of the Defense Committee after the new government assumed office. At the meeting, the prime minister assured the chiefs of armed services that the government would fulfill all their requirements at any cost because the country's defense is among the government's top priorities. The meeting decided that Pakistan would not depend on any one country to meet its defense needs; instead the country's defense resources would be diversified. A glance at the issues discussed by the cabinet's Defense Committee indicates that a comprehensive review of Pakistan's defense matters was made at the meeting. Such a review is very important and inevitable for a country like Pakistan as its defense is always faced with serious danger. Although a ray of hope has emerged in the last two months about an improvement of relations with the United States, it is, however, premature to predict about the final decision of the U.S. Government on Pakistan's military and economic assistance. The U.S. Government is reportedly considering some proposals to make the Pressler Amendment ineffective. However, it is not possible to say anything definitely now about the U.S. Congress' final decision on these proposals. In the meantime, Pakistan cannot sit idly and do nothing to meet its defense needs, especially when it is dealing with an unfriendly neighbor. The neighbor appears to be unwilling to adopt a positive and fair attitude on the Kashmir issue. On the contrary, it is increasing all sorts of repression and violence as the struggle by the Kashmiri freedom fighters is intensifying. A few weeks ago India decided to resume talks with Pakistan, but it has not been witnessed making any effort for the success of these talks. It has intensified its atrocities. Having such a neighbor, how can Pakistan remain complacent, even slightly, about its defense? In view of the Indian attitude, the foreign minister has already expressed his pessimism about the outcome of the proposed talks. Armed Forces Chief General Abdul Waheed has expressed the view at the cabinet Defense Committee meeting that distressed by the situation in Kashmir, India might even embark on an adventure on the Kashmir frontier. The army chief's opinion is a realistic one. We should never adopt an attitude of complacency and indifference regarding India's designs. We should endeavor to meet our defense needs from every possible source and maintain full preparedness while simultaneously expecting an improvement in our relations with the United States. The holy Koran also advises Muslims to do everything possible for the defense and not to ignore it. Some uninformed quarters in Pakistan complain about an increased expenditure on defense. They forget that if a nation's defense system is not strong, it cannot expect any leniency or softness from its enemy. We understand that the Defense Committee has adopted a realistic approach by deciding to acquire arms and equipment from Europe, China and any other possible source to meet the defense requirements of the three services of Pakistan. This is a correct decision. Pakistan has repeatedly made the proposal to declare South Asia a nuclear-free zone. But the Indian response has always been negative. Keeping this negative attitude in view, one can easily realize what designs India is nurturing. We hope that all the decisions of the Defense Committee will be fully implemented and no effort will be spared in making Pakistan's defense impregnable. Also, we would like to make it clear that a country's defense cannot be made impregnable by merely amassing weapons and equipment. The country should also have a broad and strong industrial base and a self-reliant economy, and it should move toward the goal of self-reliance and have a stable and smooth political system. While striving to acquire weapons and equipment for our armed forces, we should also take effective steps for the country's economic and industrial progress. Similarly, we should also make every possible effort to ensure the country's political stability and continuity. By the grace of God, Pakistan has vast resources. If we utilize these resources with prudence and far-sightedness, then there is no reason we should not be able to effectively defend our motherland and raise the living standard of our people, too. We hope that the new elected government will initiate a process of reconstruction and reforms in all aspects of our national life.
