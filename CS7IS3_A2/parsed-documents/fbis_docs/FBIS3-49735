It is said that the Visegrad summit could become an impulse to expand U.S. economic interests in Central Europe. The question is whether Slovakia would not be left on the margin of the economic sphere in the same way it is being left out in some political relations. [Meciar] "First of all, during the talks, the interest of the United States in direct cooperation was stressed. On the contrary, Mr. Clinton made a statement to the effect that the United States would not exclude us from anything. [passage omitted] "On the contrary, President Clinton himself is in favor of doing away with barriers in bilateral trade exchange. He favors greater openness of markets and the weakening of the protectionist policy aimed at imports from our country, all of this to make better economic cooperation possible. His statement that the United States will economically support Slovakia is very important for us. It is especially important because many banking circles have been waiting just for this kind of a statement by the President so that some credit lines that are under preparation could open." [passage omitted] [Tosecka] An editor from the Hungarian section of Slovak Radio was interested in knowing what the content of bilateral talks with the Hungarian partners was, especially whether there was an agreement on resuming the talks that allegedly were suspended last year. [Meciar] "We had various talks. Foreign Minister Moravcik will speak about his part and I about mine. "Prime Minister Boross and I have met. We have discussed both--the issues concerning the Visegrad Four and bilateral relations. We have said that so far the attitudes to controversial issues--that is, ethnic minorities and Gabcikovo--were irrational and damaging to both countries. We agreed that we have to find new points of departure to resolve these issues. We cannot continue harming ourselves by impairing the trustworthiness of each other. We have fully agreed on this. "As for the concept of future development, the Hungarian Government is affected by the coming May elections. It is very complicated to enter this process through extensive measures now. "We expressed Slovakia's willingness to conclude the so-called big agreement. We expressed our readiness to hold consultations on all matters of interest. We expressed our readiness to work faster in setting up a customs union. We dealt with the readmission agreement and the related subsequent issues of opening customs checkpoints on the borders. However, we will leave the crucial decisions for the time after elections." [Moravcik] [passage omitted] "[Foreign] Minister Jeszenszky and I have confirmed our interest in continuing our intensive contacts to clarify some open issues." [passage omitted] [Kunsh] An Arab journalist was interested in knowing whether there are any obstacles to arms production and arms trade in Slovakia. [Meciar] "The Slovak arms industry in 1993 produced only 8-9 percent of its 1989 capacity. [passage omitted] "An analysis that we carried out has shown that our essential shortcoming is that we had lost market since the arms trading and arms-trading institutions did not exist. That is why we have set up a state-owned shareholding company in which several ministries participate. This company will be involved in arms exports and imports. "The development in Slovakia continued and goes on at present as well. Its quality is relatively high. The systems that have been developed and tested or are undergoing tests meet world parameters. Of course, we will offer them to the market, and the Slovak Army will be equiped with them as well. "Regions to which this technology will or will not be exported are the subject of a licensing procedure." [passage omitted]
