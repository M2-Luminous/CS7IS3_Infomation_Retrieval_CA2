"The recent developments are very disturbing," said Vondra, Czech deputy foreign minister. As a member of the UN Security Council, which has met to discuss the situation in the Bosnian enclave of Gorazde, the Czech Republic has to push for an agreement within this institution, Vondra said. The UN should try to do more, and everybody capable of positively influencing the Bosnian situation should take a more active part in the settlement of the crisis. "To a certain extent, it is probably also a failure of the international community," Vondra stated. He said he believed that the Czech Republic had made a considerable effort to help solve the problem. It had taken an active part in discussions within the UN Security Council, and assisted in keeping the peace. The number of Czech UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] soldiers stationed in the former Yugoslavia was now a thousand, many more in comparison with the country's population than the number of soldiers from most big powers and other influential European countries. Czech humanitarian aid was not negligible either, Vondra said.
