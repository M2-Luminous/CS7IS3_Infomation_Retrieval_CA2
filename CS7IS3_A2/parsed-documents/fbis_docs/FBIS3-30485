The step is just one of production-boosting measures envisaged under a programme of reconstructing the monetary system and healing the economy of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). The programme, launched on Janury 24, has already given results, curbing what was a world record inflation and improving supply on the market. The businessmen warn, however, that funds are low for swinging the production cycle anew. The 200 million dinars should be paid out of a fund that should be set up for financing the economy, one-half of the money to be put up by the banks' hard currency reserves, and the balance by the firms by selling stock-piles and buying futures. However, not all of Serbia's 199,500 firms can hope for a financial injection, but only the manufacturers of easily marketable goods, Serbian Industry Minister Momir Pavlicevic has told TANJUG. Yugoslavia is implementing its monetary and economic recovery programme alone, without any outside assistance and in conditions of draconic international sanctions, the worst ever imposed on any nation, with its firms banned from the world markets for both import and export of commodities and fuel.
