FR940727-2-00049 FR940727-2-00026 The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms. Donald S. Clark, Secretary. Concurring Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga in L&S Research Corporation, File No. 912&hyph;3004 The Commission has strong evidence supporting the central allegations in this complaint, and I have voted to accept the consent agreement for public comment. In my view, however, the complaint should not allege that the maintenance claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing women weight loss claim for QuickTrim were false. I am inclined to believe that the claims are false but I would prefer to have some corroborating evidence of falsity before finding reason to believe that Section 5 of the FTC Act has been violated. Because the available information shows only that there is no evidence that these claims are true, it seems to me more appropriate to allege that they are unsubstantiated. In addition, the QuickTrim weight loss allegations seem inconsistent in light of the evidence. The complaint alleges that the weight loss claim for maturing women users of QuickTrim is false but alleges that the same claim for all users of QuickTrim is unsubstantiated. Yet we have no evidence indicating that the weight loss claims are any more likely to be false for maturing women than for users generally. I therefore do not support the complaint to the extent that the maintenance claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing women weight loss claim for QuickTrim are alleged to be false, not unsubstantiated.
