We have interrupted Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at his papers three hours before his speech at NATO to ask him to comment on his tactics with regard to a rapprochement with NATO, exclusively for the viewers of the Details. [Grachev] What Russia could gain by this is the following: First, confirming to the international community our contemporary views on security and our adherence to the policy of strengthening our strategic union with the West; second, that this would make it potentially possible for us to obtain more information about NATO's military-political intentions, plans, and actions, as well as other states involved in the Partnership for Peace, and to influence them in our interests to a certain extent. [Dorenko] But will they not turn us into their southern flank? These kinds of worries have been voiced in the press: that they will make us fight against the Islamic Fundamentalism, and if relations with China become aggravated.... [Grachev, interrupting] I understand your question. You are trying to find out what negative implications our cooperation may have. No, though theoretically perhaps we will be attached to NATO in some way. Our state is a superpower with enormous economic and military potential, and of course we will not tow NATO's line, act as they tell us to, and take an extreme stance on anything. No, in fact, the program we will propose for signing will spell all of this out. If it becomes necessary for Russia and some NATO countries to take some collective actions, that decision should be made collectively, on the basis of suggestions and deliberations. Only should an unequivocal decision be made, which should be beneficial to Russia and the NATO countries. That would be a fair decision. [Dorenko] A question from daily life: In old times, the USSR defense minister was chief of staff of the Warsaw Treaty and not the United States the NATO leader. Now they will turn out to be your commanders. [Grachev] Well, that is a question of secondary importance. Actually, no, this will not be so. [Dorenko] What if Ukraine completes its transition to the partnership faster than Russia, and, if the conflict with Ukraine becomes more acute, NATO turns out to be on the Ukrainian side? [Grachev] If Ukraine joins this partnership before us and if the NATO countries attempt, together with Ukraine, to put pressure on us--well, this cannot be serious, and these states will not take such a step for political reasons. This is the first point; and second, why should they put pressure us? Are we threatening Ukraine, or do we have some extremely tense relations with Ukraine? [Dorenko] This happens occasionally. [Grachev] Well, you know, that is what strategy is for. We have to resolve all misunderstandings and conflicts by political means.
