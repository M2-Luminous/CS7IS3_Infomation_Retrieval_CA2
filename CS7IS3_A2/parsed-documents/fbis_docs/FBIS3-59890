Almaty is proposing the formation of a joint command. Moscow has rejected this idea, because it would be a violation of its international commitments. There is general satisfaction that the Ukrainian option of "privatization" of strategic missiles did not start a trend. The Kazakh parliament, at its recent session, ratified the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. At the same time Russia looked on jealously at the U.S.-Kazakh agreement, signed 13 December, on the safe dismantling of nuclear warheads belonging to the strategic arsenal of the former USSR. Washington promised to grant Almaty $84 million out of the total sum of $1.2 billion allocated by the U.S. Congress to the CIS countries for these purposes. Russia, which has great experience in such operations, had expected to find a common language with Kazakhstan and do the dismantling itself. In formal terms, all 108 SS-18 missiles stationed in Kazakhstan, and the 1,400 warheads, are Russia's property. The total value of their nuclear contents, after dismantling and reprocessing, will amount to about $1 billion. The world uranium market is strictly limited by IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] guidelines. But the Americans would like to buy all the uranium left after the warheads are dismantled, and have made it clear to Kazakhstan that money is no object. Almaty, having willingly renounced the status of a nuclear power, expects to receive compensation for the missiles. Nursultan Nazarbayev's edict banning the exportation from the republic of anything that is on its territory applies not only to missiles, but also to weapons [zaryady] that have been removed from alert status. Kazakhstan's storage facilities are packed with nuclear ammunition. Russia is willing to share, but insists that the dismantling and the uranium reprocessing takes place at its own plants. Ukraine's uncompromising position cannot but influence Kazakhstan's behavior. Kiev has decided, by the end of this year, to remove all the warheads from 20 SS-24 ICBM's, and to keep them. But Ukraine also does not have the plants and technology for reprocessing the uranium, which it could use as fuel for its five nuclear power stations. After the Russian elections, the former certainty that the safest course is to ship all the former USSR's nuclear weapons to Russia's territory is not shared by everyone. Russia may come up against more persistent claims from Ukraine and Kazakhstan to keep the nuclear weapons. It has yet to be decided how Kazakhstan's warheads will be dismantled and by what means their uranium content will be sold.
