The sources said the arrest of former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura earlier in the day will further hurt Kajima Corp., which allegedly bribed him, as well as other major contractors. The tarnished image of these dominant players in the sector, involved in this and other scandals, has already driven many customers away. Worse still, the revelation of the malpractices comes at a time when construction orders had already sunk to a nadir. Some industry officials, however, saw at least one benefit of the scandal. An executive at a second-tier contractor said, "because of this scandal, politicians will refrain from demanding bribes from us in the future." "So far, we could not but give them bribes because they would cause us troubles unless we did so," he said.
