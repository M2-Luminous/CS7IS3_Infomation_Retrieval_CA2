Partial operation will begin next March at the Northern District Supervisory Office (Sapporo). The system uses the latest computer and communication technology and allows the commander to rapidly transmit precise commands. Given the constraints on the primary facilities budget, defense sales at each company are falling. Since contracts for the Ground Self Defense Force Command System project long-term, stable income at the scale of several billion yen annually, this will probably become a valuable source of earnings in the industry. The Ground Self Defense Force Command System will be introduced as one link in information and communication system facilities known as C[.sup]3[/]I (Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence). Fujitsu is the main contractor. In addition, NEC, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Denki, Hitachi Seiyakusho, and Oki Electric Installation Ltd. are participating in the development. About 10 billion yen is budgeted for fiscal years 1991 through 1993. The start of operation at the Northern District Supervisory Office will be the first shot at its implementation. The initial plan forecasted an annual budget of 20 billion yen up to the 100 billion yen needed to complete the system. However, due to constraints on the defense budget, this is expected to drop dramatically in scale. Nevertheless, orders of several billion yen per year will support defense-related electronics firms. Although the Air Self Defense Force and Maritime Self Defense Force already operate command systems that use computers, the Ground Self Defense Force that has bases scattered throughout the country was late in establishing facilities. Since a reason stated for the victory in the Gulf War was the C[.sup]3[/]I system of the United States, this is one more field the Defense Agency regards as important. After 1994, the objective is to continue to expand the system to the Eastern District Supervisory Office. In the future, the plan is to set up computers in the Army and in occupied regions and to connect operations by light communications. General-purpose products are used for the hardware, but the performance features like transmission speed and maintaining security will become important in the software. The Fujitsu's Defense Division manages the charged electronic devices for P3C anti-submarine devices and P3C ground support system equipment. Total contracts for 1991 reached ¥38 billion. However, cutbacks are expected in the primary equipment budget to hold the 1993 budget to around ¥33 billion. While the Ground Self Defense Force System that belongs to the Rear Division is expected to be stabilized in future budgets and will become the core of defense-related business at Fujitsu.
