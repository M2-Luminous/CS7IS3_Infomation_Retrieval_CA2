At the same time, he stressed that every state that has a nuclear reactor is potentially able to make an A-bomb. The North Korean nuclear center was created with the use of technical documents and the assistance of Soviet nuclear specialists, Vladislav Kotlov, the ministry's leading expert and supervisor of the North Korean center's construction, told the news conference. In his words, the center is meant for exclusively economic and scientific purposes, it produces isotopes for medicine and industry, processes the results of physical experiments, develops technologies and trains specialists. Today the center does not have a single Russian specialist. "Any nuclear installation is capable to produce plutonium", said Kotlov. But it is necessary to build a number of facilities, train specialists and have kilos of plutonium to use the installation for the defence. The expert said that North Korea is building the facilities and has nuclear specialists. But it has produced several dozens or hundreds of grams of plutonium which is not enough to make a nuclear bomb, he added. In his turn, Kaurov thinks that one cannot say the nuclear arms are ready before they are tested. It is up to a sovereign state whether or not to admit IAEA inspectors to its secret facilities. Russia also has a number of centers which foreign specialists are not allowed to visit, he added.
