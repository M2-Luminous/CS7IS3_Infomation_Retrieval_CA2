This is absolutely true. One example is that the report attacks Article 18 and Article 158 of the Basic Law as "a serious hidden threat to the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the implementation of the Joint Declaration." The spokesman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) replied to this, pointing out that these provisions of the Basic Law were a concrete expression of the Chinese Government resumption of the exercise of sovereignty on 1 July 1997. It was totally unreasonable for the report to attack these provisions. Such an attack precisely reveals the real motive behind the British side's attempt to extend Britain's control and influence over Hong Kong. Article 18 of the Basic Law states: In the event that the Standing Committee of the NPC decides to declare a state of war or, due to turmoil within the HKSAR which endangers national unity or security and is beyond the control of the government of the Region, decides that the Region is in a state of emergency, the Central People's Government may issue an order applying the relevant national laws in the Region. Article 158 states: The power of interpretation of this Law shall be vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC. The importance of these provisions to realizing and safeguarding China's sovereignty is self-evident. China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 is not just a matter of changing flags. The HKSAR, which will be directly under the Central People's Government, must be established in accordance with the decision of the NPC; the Basic Law of the HKSAR approved by the NPC must be implemented; foreign affairs must be administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; national defense must be the responsibility of the Central People's Government; the chief executive and principal officials of the executive organs of the HKSAR must be appointed by the Central People's Government; the declaration of a state of emergency of the HKSAR must be decided by the NPC; and the power of interpretation of the Basic Law must be vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC. All these represent the expression of China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and are also an expression of the principle of integrating upholding the country's unity with ensuring a high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR. The NPC is the highest organ of state power, and it exercises state sovereignty in a unified manner. China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong will inevitably be reflected in the participation of the NPC and its Standing Committee in the handling of Hong Kong affairs. How can we talk about upholding the principle of sovereignty if the NPC and its Standing Committee cannot exercise even the power of declaring a state of emergency in Hong Kong or the power of interpreting the Basic Law? Britain is opposed to these two articles of the Basic Law. Is this not a brazen challenge to China's sovereignty? We really cannot understand why the NPC's possession of these two kinds of power can constitute a "serious threat" to the HKSAR. Suppose the NPC declares a state of emergency in the HKSAR because the Region is threatened by war, or by reason of turmoil within the Region which endangers national unity or security and is beyond the control of the government of the Region, and this enables Hong Kong to avoid aggression and ensures the unity and security of the state -- does this represent a "serious threat?" If some people attempt to tamper with or distort the meaning of the provisions of the Basic Law and attempt to create chaos in Hong Kong, and the NPC Standing Committee interprets the relevant provisions in order to ensure the correct implementation of the Basic Law, does this represent a "serious threat?" The right to enjoy a high degree of autonomy is invested in the HKSAR by the NPC, and this can be realized only if the Basic Law approved by the NPC is correctly implemented. According to the report, Britain, which is opposed to the Basic Law, seems to have become the defender of the HKSAR's autonomy, while the Chinese NPC, which resolutely wants to implement the Basic Law, seems to constitute a "threat" to this autonomy. Has anyone ever heard such logic? That the NPC exercises the two kinds of power mentioned above is entirely a guarantee of the realization of "one country, two systems" and is a guarantee for the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. To the several million Hong Kong residents who love their country and Hong Kong, this can only produce a "sense of stability" and a "sense of security," and will not produce any "sense of threat." Only the following types of people will have a sense of "threat" and even "serious threat": People who have all along been opposed to the Basic Law and who intentionally attempt to tamper with or distort the Basic Law; people who hope that Hong Kong will become an "independent" or "semi-independent" political entity; and people who are "opposed to anything put forward by China" and who are dead set on regarding China as their enemy. As a matter of fact, these kinds of people can be put under one category, a category of people who willingly grovel at the feet of the British and serve the colonial rule. The number of people in this category is not large. That the NPC exercises the two kinds of power mentioned above will certainly constitute an enormous obstacle to their perverse acts, and, therefore, this will naturally cause a sense of "serious threat" among them. When the British parliamentary report attacks the Basic Law, it is absolutely speaking for these people, and the motive is evident. When the Basic Law was approved by the NPC, the British Foreign Ministry made a statement saying that the Basic Law was an important milestone in Hong Kong's future, it reflected the spirit of the Joint Declaration, and was welcomed as a constitution. Only four years have passed, and the Basic Law has not yet been implemented, but Britain has changed from "praising" the Basic Law to opposing it. Chris Patten, who kept on saying that he "read the Basic Law more often than the Bible," also said a few days ago that Britain pointed out long ago that the Basic Law was harmful to the Joint Declaration. What does that mean? Did Britain say one thing and mean another in the past or is it playing tricks today? Either alternative shows Britain's hypocrisy and ulterior motives.
