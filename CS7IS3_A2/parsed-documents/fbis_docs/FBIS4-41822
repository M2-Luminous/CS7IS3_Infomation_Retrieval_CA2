"If such a meeting takes place, it should be attended by the Nagorno-Karabakh leader Robert Kocharyan," the aide said. The representative of the Armenian president positively assessed the results of today's talks in Yerevan conducted by the Russian president's special envoy, Vladimir Kazimirov. The Armenian president's aide pointed out the importance of such working meetings for the clarification of positions assumed by the sides on the Karabakh settlement.
