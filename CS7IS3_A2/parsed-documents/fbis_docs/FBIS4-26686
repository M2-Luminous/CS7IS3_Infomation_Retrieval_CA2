ACC members expressed disappointment with the draft agreement on funding for Chek Lap Kok being drawn up for signing within the next few days. They say it fails to clarify grey areas in the new airport Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) and fear overspending on the project may cause rows in the future. Some ACC members have already taken their grievances to Chinese members of the Airport Committee. The group is unhappy that Beijing appears to have accepted the arrangement proposed by the British without securing an agreement on setting up an independent body to monitor progress on the project. "Hong Kong people should welcome this agreement but the mechanism for monitoring the expense progress and quality of the project needs further discussion," ACC member Ho King-on said. Other members were harsher in their criticism of the deal, claiming it contained many loopholes. They said that, during their private meeting, Chinese official Hu Houcheng failed to give a satisfactory explanation for giving in to British demands, admitting only that there were many "problems" in the draft deal. "This is a disappointing result. They broke the deadlock which had lasted for two years but did not clarify the grey areas in the MOU. This is dangerous," one ACC member said. "We all understand that they (the Chinese) did so because they got advantages over defence land -- they mixed the two issues up." ACC members were disappointed China accepted a level of debt far above the $5 billion ceiling stated in the MOU without seeking more cash reserves to be left for the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government. "The British have only promised to leave at least $25 billion for the SAR government. Now the British increase the debt level, why don't they increase the reserve to make it more comfortable?" one member said. But ACC chairman Wong Po-yan did not share the anger, saying he hoped the agreement would be finalised soon. Britain is already planning to rush any agreement through the Legislative Council before the summer recess. The last Finance Committee of the session is scheduled for July 8, but a later one may be arranged if necessary. Legislators would be asked to approve a $60.3 billion equity injection, with $36.6 billion destined for the Provisional Airport Authority, and $23.7 billion for the Mass Transit Railway Corporation [MTRC]. Much of this has already been voted through, and a further $15 billion is up for approval at Friday's Finance Committee meeting. However, none of the money for MTRC has been put to the Legislative Council.
