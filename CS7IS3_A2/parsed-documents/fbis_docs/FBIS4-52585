[Ishida] When the former cabinet decided on a midterm administrative reform outline, cabinet ministers from the SDPJ were also among those who agreed on it. SDPJ Chairman Murayama also said the party will take responsibility for what it is responsible for. Thus, the SDPJ has to fulfill its responsibility for administrative reform. As for deregulation, the government plans to submit 40 relevant bills to the Diet as one package during the current session. As for the information disclosure system, the government will ask the administrative reform committee, which will soon be established, to fully discuss the establishment of the system and its legislation. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Hata cabinet is called "a cabinet led by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito." [Ishida] It was inevitable for Prime Minister Hata to give many cabinet posts to these two parties. But we do not need to feel so badly about it. The important thing is for the government to administer state affairs by placing emphasis on its policies. Tax reform is also a demand from society. The government has to promote reform while hearing opinions of the opposition parties. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Does Komeito plan to participate in the new parliamentary group Kaishin [Innovation]? [Ishida] I think our party should consider joining the group and fully discuss it. From now on, each party should work to reorganize the existing parties into two forces. Otherwise, small parties will be defeated in the general election to be held under a single-seat constituency system. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think there is a possibility that the next general election following the dissolution of the lower house will be held under the current multiple-seat constituency system. [Ishida] Some people have said it is inevitable to hold the general election under the multiple-seat system. This opinion is problematic because if the election is held under the current system, political reform will be delayed for two or three years. The people will never allow such a delay. We should deal with this issue after enacting at an early date the bills on new constituency boundaries for the single-seat electoral system. [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The chief cabinet secretary said it is possible that the general election will be held in July under the new electoral system and without a period needed to make the new system known to the public. [Ishida] Unlike the past, there are many news organizations covering political affairs. I think what he said is possible if the government informs the people of the new system through the news media.
