Politicians, observers, and media analysts consider this summit the most prominent event of the year given that it may activate the Middle East peace process and achieve positive, honorable, and satisfactory results on all tracks. The fact that 4,000 reporters from all over the world are flocking to Geneva gives an idea of the attention given by the world community to this summit and the great aspirations raised by it. The sincere hope that the results of this summit will be translated on the ground into a just and comprehensive peace in the region and into prosperity in the post-peace era. This large-scale concern over the Syrian-U.S. summit is evidence of the entire world's yearning to achieve a firm peace in the Middle East, the principal supporter of which is Syria. The world community is fully aware that separate deals do not achieve peace but increase tension. It is also aware that Syria's call for a just, comprehensive, and honorable peace based on Security Council resolutions opens the road toward real stability in the region. There is no doubt that the entire world is sick and tired of Israel's repressive and inhuman acts inside the occupied Arab territories. These acts worry the human conscience and cause it to question the purpose behind the international silence over Israel's serious violations of international principles and laws and the point behind the super powers' use of double standards. Israel is imposing a tight siege on the occupied territories. The Israeli Army and Zionist settlers are destroying Arab neighborhoods, scorching property owned by Palestinians, and killing Palestinians. Moreover, Israel rejects the Security Council resolutions and insists on occupation and expansion and on obstructing the peace efforts. All this constitutes a real threat not only to Middle East peace but to world peace as well, given the impact the Middle East has throughout the world. It is worth noting that this world concern focuses on the need for Israel to submit to the resolutions of international legitimacy and to frankly announce that the Golan is Syrian territory, from which Israel should fully withdraw. This is a sign that Syria's sincere efforts to achieve peace have born fruit. The world community never cast doubts on the Arab's intentions, but is casting doubts on Israel's intentions and is denouncing its intransigent stands. The world community went beyond this, noting that President al-Asad's stands are principled stands that cannot be bargained over. The world's great politicians always take international public opinion into consideration. International public opinion demands a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East that removes the Israeli occupation and restores to the Palestinians their national legitimate rights, the most important of which is their right to self-determination. Certainly, President al-Asad, who has been known as a man of principle and decisionmaking, will not only represent Syria but will represent all the Arabs as well. He will be the staunch defender of the principles of right, justice, and fairness, without which there can be no peace in the Middle East. Peace contradicts occupation and occupation contradicts dignity. A stable and firm peace must be based on justice and dignity. Justice stipulates the full withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories. Dignity stipulates the restoration of the Palestinian people right to regain their freedom and self-determination. The Arab-Israeli conflict has many important and serious aspects. These include Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, the Palestinian people's rights, the issues of refugees, evacuees, displaced people, and deportees. All of these aspects are collective and their solutions lie in implementing Security Council resolutions and entrenching the principles of international law. The success of the summit, which is important to the entire world, is contingent on its success in tackling these issues.
