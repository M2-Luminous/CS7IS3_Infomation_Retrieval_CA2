Across Poland? [Zhirinovskiy] In Europe, we are mostly interested in good relations with Germany, and it is in this context that one should address the Polish question. However, we do not want to interfere in Poland's internal affairs. Even if Poland wants to join NATO, that is an internal matter for Poland and NATO. The creation of a new world order is a long process. Europe is currently experiencing a stage of profound destruction. After all, the Soviet Union has collapsed, and it would be hard to expect its remnants not to hit the neighboring countries. Poland has never had a permanent border. It has possessed various shapes at various times of history, and there was a period when it was divided and formed part of Russia, among other countries. Until recently, the Russian forces guaranteed the Polish border. Today, in this matter, one should turn to NATO and Germany, which play the greatest part in this section of the continent. For the time being, the Poles can carry on singing "Poland has not perished yet." [Graczyk] What would change in Russia if you became prime minister? [Zhirinovskiy] There will be a better economy, a strong state, and better guaranteed rights for all Russians, wherever they live. Is that too little? [Graczyk] During the election campaign, you promised you would double the standard of living of your countrymen. How? [Zhirinovskiy] We will do this without any help from outside. Until now, the so-called help from the West has caused us more harm than good. Russia has been exploited materially and intellectually. Let them leave us alone, and we will reestablish Russian power. As prime minister I would make three basic decisions -- an end to all financial help for foreign countries, an end to the conversion of the weapons industry to civilian production, and a sharp struggle against crime. The adherence to the arms embargo on the Middle East, for example, is costing us many billions of dollars. Russia could earn about $50 billion a year from weapons exports. After six months, not only would people's standard of living increase, but also their security. I would also bring more militiamen and soldiers out onto the streets. [Graczyk] That smells of totalitarianism. [Zhirinovskiy] The state should not have been allowed to disintegrate! The Soviet Union might still exist today; one should have provided greater independence and divided the country into provinces. Such a variant should also have been suggested to the Asian and Caucasian regions, plus Belarus, Ukraine, and the Baltic countries. Then they would have realized the advantages to be gained from living within one large state in which all the principles of freedom -- cultural and economic freedom-- are respected. Look what is happening right now. Entire settlements are burning, towns are being bombed, people are perishing. [Graczyk] Is the return of the USSR still possible? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, in a territorial sense. But the law, ideology, and government will be different. The territory of the former USSR could become the territory of a reborn Russia. That will only be possible when a new democratically oriented authority appears in the Kremlin, one that will work out a model of a strong state. A reborn and strengthened army is required for this purpose, together with a nuclear potential that must be improved so that our possible adversaries know that we are prepared to use it. Therefore we will develop our nuclear weapons, create a base in space, and from there we will defend Russia if the need arises. The ideal scenario calls for the existence of a Russo-Swedish and Russo-German border, and a border with China and India in the south. [Graczyk] How can one describe the present situation in Russia? Is it democracy, yet another "disturbance" [smuta], or perhaps something else? [Zhirinovskiy] I would call it a political cocktail, because it contains obvious signs of chaos and anarchy from the time of the Great Disturbance, but also the beginnings of democracy, fascism, and nationalism. Also possible are potential sources of future religious wars and conflicts caused by the clash between two worlds -- the Christian one and the Muslim one. As a lawyer and expert on human rights, I am an advocate of democracy, but I do not think democracy is the right medicine for the state's diseased organism. The only panacea is strong authority. Only after the organism of the state has recovered from the crisis and the economy has healed will it be possible to switch over to a democratic system. [Graczyk] The communists also promised that democracy would occur after the period of proletarian dictatorship. [Zhirinovskiy] That was their mistake. I am opposed to an ideological state. [Graczyk] Then why do they call you a fascist? [Zhirinovskiy] The disease of destruction is very far advanced in Russia, and the economic crisis has assumed a particularly acute form. That is why it is essential to apply drastic measures. Only through fear can one enforce an end to the civil war, stop the disintegration of the army, and stem the tide of emigres. Economic structures must be made operational again. One must reestablish the old links between work places, factories, and kolkhozes. First we must heal Russia and lift it off its knees. [Graczyk] Do you think the Russians expressed their weariness of democracy by voting for you? [Zhirinovskiy] They have never lived under democracy! By voting for me, they have opted for democracy and entrusted me with it. Democracy is in the right hands now. [Graczyk] But how can one introduce democracy to a country that has never had it? First there was the Czarist empire, and then the Bolsheviks came. [Zhirinovskiy] The shift to democracy must be suitably prepared. Democracy needs an economic base, political parties need varied social strata, and the Army needs an objective and specific conditions. What is needed today, however, is a freeze, a political diet. One must not sow seed in a fallow field -- a tractor has to go over it first. We need a strong authority. [Graczyk] Boris Yeltsin's spokesman said recently that he does not rule out the possibility of cooperation with you. Under what conditions would it be possible? [Zhirinovskiy] I am ready to do anything for the good of Russia. We will cooperate with our president any way he wants. Together with my staff I am preparing a program that we will submit to the president soon. I hope that on parliament's first sitting on 11 January, President Yeltsin will entrust mew with the task of forming a government. But if he appoints someone else, I will accept that. We will not even be offended if we do not obtain any ministerial post. Time is working to our advantage. [Graczyk] Until recently you were critical of Boris Yeltsin. You even called him your worst enemy. And now you want to cooperate with him. [Zhirinovskiy] I respect the will of the voters who voted for him. But I have no doubt that I will win the next presidential election. Neither the so-called democratic camp nor the communists will stand a chance. That is a pity, because I am accustomed to a sharp struggle. I am sad that the victory will be so easy.
