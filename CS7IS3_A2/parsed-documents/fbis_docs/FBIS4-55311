"There has not been a single day without strike since this government took office. Most strikes do not meet the requirements of legality, but we recognize this method of protest. Strikes are always dangerous. This one, however, was particularly dangerous because it affected strategic sectors, crucial to the security of the state. We are aware that trade unions are not rich, but, all over the world, financial compensation for strikes is paid by the organizer," Minister Pol said. According to Pol, the strikes in the lignite-mining industry were caused by anxiety over the sector's restructuring. The protest in the hard coal mining industry was initially linked to support for lignite-mine workers and later became a manifestation of support for Solidarity's demands on the national scale. Pol believes that mine workers should elect their representation; there are from several to a dozen or so trade union organizations in each colliery. For example, in the hard coal mining industry, there are 39 trade union organizations. The minister briefed the deputies on the content of agreements concluded with lignite-mine workers on 30 April in Konin and with hard-coal mine workers on 11 May in Warsaw.
