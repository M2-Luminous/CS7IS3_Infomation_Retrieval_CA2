Al-Mahdi: We do not consider it unlikely that the forces of arrogance may embark on such folly. If they find the conditions favorable, they will certainly intervene, since they are already poised against Sudan. The propaganda by the Western mass media, the United Nations, the UN Human Rights Commission, as well as their economic embargo, are all indications of an intervention by the forces of world arrogance. I stress: If they find suitable conditions, they will certainly intervene. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Two weeks ago, a mosque was attacked in Omdurman, Khartoum by armed assailants and some worshipers were killed and wounded. What group was responsible and what were its objectives? Al-Mahdi: Those who were arrested were mostly foreigners; this shows the nature of this act. What motive can there be for attacking worshipers? The attack on the residence of Shaykh 'Usamah bin-Ladin and against the Islamic al-Da'wah party's headquarters is a clear indication of the identity of the attackers. Such incidents usually have some political motivation. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Why was the mosque attacked? Al-Mahdi: The objective of the attackers was to foment agitation, unrest, and instability. [passage omitted] JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Do you see any foreign hands behind this attack? Al-Mahdi: The remarks by Government officials indicate that foreign hands were involved, but the complete report on the investigation has not been released. The issue is being followed up. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Sudan is currently facing the hostile stance of the United States and the West. How do you assess the attitude of the West and the United States toward Sudan? Al-Mahdi: The West and the United States cannot bear to hear calls for liberation. They are seeking to plunder and pillage the wealth of the people of the world. They wish to strangle every cry for freedom; and this is the policy they follow. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: What is Sudan's stance toward the world's Islamic movements? Al-Mahdi: Our message to the Muslim nations is--and we hope that they get this message--we approve of all acts in the service of Islam. The powers of world arrogance have besieged the nations. Thus it is the duty of Islamic movements that they all should join hands; and our relations with these movements are strong. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: The Egyptian and Algerian regimes have accused Sudan of giving refuge to the Arab Muslims who fought in Afghanistan. They say that Sudan is giving them military training. What are the objectives of these regimes in making such accusations? Al-Mahdi: Sudan has no problems with Egypt and Algeria and our relations with their people are cordial. However we believe in differentiating between the people and the governments. The lackeys are the ones leveling such baseless charges against Sudan. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: Who are these lackeys? Al-Mahdi: The Western lackeys who rule over these governments and are at loggerheads with their own people. They wish to label Sudan in order to cover up their own weakness. They are pitted against their own people, not against terrorism. They cannot face reality and therefore are using Sudan as a pretext. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI: How are relations between Sudan and the Egyptian Government? Al-Mahdi: The Egyptian Government has occupied the area of Hala'ib and is seeking to avoid talks on this subject. It continues to plot against us. The Egyptian mass media have started a propaganda war against Sudan. However we believe that the Egyptian people are closer to us and that Egypt and Sudan have a common destiny and interests. We belong to the same ummah and we will strive to maintain cordial ties with the Egyptian people and to counteract the maneuvers of the enemy.
