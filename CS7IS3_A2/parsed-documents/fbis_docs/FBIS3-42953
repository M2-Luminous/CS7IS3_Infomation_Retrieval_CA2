Insofar as a number of delegations of the United Nations, Council on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Council of Europe, and other international organizations have confirmed that the situation in Estonia is entirely in conformance with international human rights standards, the press release states, the question arises: Who is concealing the truth--international organizations or the political figure who has repeatedly proclaimed Estonia to be part of the Russian sphere of interest, the so-called near abroad? The laws of the Estonian Republic allow everyone to obtain Estonian citizenship, regardless of ethnicity. But the minister's statements, as noted by the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, contain a positive aspect (concerning a reference to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). This instills the hope that the Russian minister of foreign affairs will be able to take the next step and admit that the Baltic countries were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. Estonia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Juri Luik, in turn, did not ignore the interview given by Andrey Kozyrev to the American weekly NEWSWEEK and published in the 14 February issue. In response to the NEWSWEEK correspondent's question as to whether the minister truly meant in an address to Russian diplomats that troops should not be withdrawn from the Baltic countries, Luik believes that Kozyrev did not provide a clear answer. I would be quite happy to see Mr. Kozyrev find the opportunity to answer this question once again, this time more precisely, the Estonian minister stated. With regard to the Estonian demarche, it is useful to publish Andrey Kozyrev's utterances verbatim. In conversation with journalists on 8 February, the minister stated the following: "Approximately a third of the populace is set apart by virtue of ethnicity. We are talking about Russian-speaking people--Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews, and even Finns--who are denied the right of citizenship. They want to acquire such citizenship but are denied it for one reason only--ethnicity. If this is not `ethnic cleansing,' then what is?" (Here and henceforth we quote INTERFAX). In Kozyrev's opinion, in certain instances, in Bosnia and Herzegovina for example, "ethnic cleansing" is manifest in the form of criminal violence, in other instances--in the form of denial of civil rights, the right of citizenship in particular, for large population groups. "If anywhere people are called `occupiers' and `noncitizens,' they begin to conduct themselves accordingly. The result is instability," the minister stated. He then cited another example of encroachment on the rights of Russian-speaking people: "In the former USSR, everyone had a military obligation. There was no exception for Estonians or Latvians--they too served in the Soviet Army. But now they want to remove from Estonia and Latvia not all former servicemen in the Soviet Army, only the Russian-speaking ones. It is evident that the basis of the demand to remove servicemen comprises not a political, but rather an ethnic principle." In the minister's words, attempts to take out crimes of the Stalinist regime on simple people constitute political stupidity." "I admit the crimes of the Stalinist regime, but one must not forget that these were committed by political authorities--Stalin on the one hand, and Hitler on the other--that concluded the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Attempts 45 years later to take it out on thousands of simple people for the commission of these crimes and use the principle of ethnicity in doing so--are intolerable." "The world must turn its attention to this inhumane and potentially dangerous situation," Kozyrev concluded. There can be no doubt but that the minister's words are harsh to say the least, and possibly "inaccurate," but to categorize them as slander means closing one's eyes to the true state of affairs. Which is in fact what the prestigious Western structures and organizations whose views are being cited by the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs are doing. These groups include, for example, the American human rights organization Freedom House, which published its regular report for 1993 encompassing 190 countries and 63 territories. The section pertaining to "countries that are not free" lists Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The author of the report categorizes the following countries as "partially free": Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Belarus, Armenia, Romania, Macedonia, Slovakia, and Latvia. The experts proclaimed Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Lithuania, and Estonia to be "free." When compared with last year's report with respect to the Baltic countries, it is Estonia that received an "upgrade," moving out of the category "partially free" to "free." We must point out that the situation of the Russian-speaking population was precisely the key criterion in last year's report, in particular, "the measures to restrict citizenship and the denial of citizenship to Russian-speaking inhabitants." We must presume that the Russians in Estonia will be happy to hear that they are living today in a country that is completely free. P.S. INTERFAX reported yesterday that Estonian President Lennart Meri demanded an explanation from Aleksandr Trofimov, Russian Federation ambassador to Tallinn, in connection with the statements of Russian officials. A report distributed to the press Wednesday evening by the Chancellery of the Estonian head of state cites the words of Mikhail Demurin, official representative of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the press release, Demurin stated that "in the establishment of international relations, the use of diplomatic means alone is insufficient." The document also mentions that in his recent interview with NEWSWEEK, Russian Federation Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev accused Latvia of intent to deport Russians, and he "threatened conflict with the Latvian Republic." The document emphasizes that "the actual situation in Estonia has nothing in common with the picture certain extremist-chauvinist politicians in Moscow are attempting to draw, and this fact is without a doubt well known to the officials who are formulating Russia's foreign policy."
