"They are nothing but conjectures," a spokesman for the ministry, Mikhail Demurin, said at Thursday's briefing in Moscow. According to him, "when formulating Moscow's attitude to the ways to resolve the crisis in Bosnia, the Russian president takes into account the entire range of views prevailing among the legislative and executive authorities, including recommendations given by Russia's Foreign Ministry." Moscow, Demurin noted, "will continue its work with the Bosnian Serbs." "The statement made by the special envoy of the Russian president, Vitaly Churkin, as to an end to all talks with the Serbs, was interpreted incorrectly. Churkin meant only the crisis in and around Gorazde. Additional contacts with Bosnian Serbs in regard to that problem were not required. They had been told everything," he said. As Demurin said, "some positive shifts have emerged in regard to the possibility of defusing the situation in Bosnia." "According to the information arriving from Bosnia, all U.N. representatives have been freed, and the 18 anti-aircraft guns seized by the Serbs previously have been returned. The U.N. representatives have not yet arrived in the area of Gorazde for purely technical reasons," he said. "The special envoy of the U.N. secretary General, Yasushi Akashi, is satisfied with his contacts with the leaders of Bosnian Serbs, who promised to halt military actions in the three-kilometer zone surrounding Gorazde," Demurin said. With reference to the possibility of gradually lifting the international sanctions imposed against Belgrade, the Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that "in the future this issue should be present in the unified stand to be taken by the world community." "Such stand is to be worked out yet. When lifting sanctions imposed on the Serbs the world community must see prospects for resolving the conflict," he said. According to Demurin, "there are people with obviously militarist thinking among the Bosnian Serbs and in Belgrade." "The sober-minded Serbs in Bosnia and in the Republic of Yugoslavia should distance themselves from them. We shall support any efforts aimed at resolving the crisis in Bosnia peacefully," he concluded.
