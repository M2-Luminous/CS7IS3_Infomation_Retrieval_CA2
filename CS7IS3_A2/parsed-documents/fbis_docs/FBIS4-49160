They conducted investigations and studies on how to deal with new circumstances and problems in those localities during the course of reforming the fiscal and taxation system. They pointed out during the visits: The reform of the fiscal and taxation system is one of the several major reforms this year, and it is of great significance to promoting smooth proceeding of other reforms and to keeping a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. Leading cadres at all levels should seriously enhance their understanding of the importance of the fiscal and taxation system reform. The no. 1 men of party and government organizations should conduct investigation and study at lower levels on problems relating to local revenue sources. They should clearly know local situations so as to provide correct guidance for economic work. Lu Rongjing and other leading comrades called on all localities and departments to actively adapt themselves to the new fiscal and taxation system. They called on all localities and departments to pay attention to the following several points: (1) It is necessary to adhere to the notion that development is the last word, make great efforts to further promote economic growth, cultivate new revenue sources, link the fiscal and taxation work with economic development, and increase revenues on the basis of reliable economic development. (2) It is necessary to enhance the awareness of economic efficiency, strive to invest the limited financial and material resources in industries and products of high added value and high economic returns, and truly make the improvement of economic efficiency the central task of economic development. (3) It is necessary to change the idea of helping enterprises by relying solely on reduction of tax payment and profit delivery quota. We should help enterprises enter the market to participate in fair competition. We should enhance the government's ability in macroeconomic regulation and control. (4) Importance should be attached to both increase of revenues and reduction of expenditures. It is necessary to improve the management of funds, particularly the extra-budgetary funds, reduce expenditure and promote the work style of diligence and thrift. We must resolutely overcome the bad phenomenon of being wasteful and extravagant while being financially tight. We must maintain a basic balance between revenue and expenditure. During a discussion with local cadres, Comrades Lu Rongjing and Wang Yang repeatedly urged all localities to make efforts to study the new circumstances and new problems during the current reform of the fiscal and taxation system. The study should be conducted in a comprehensive, systematic, and thorough way on the basis of the preliminary study done in the preceding period. To build a leading force and work force that meet the needs of the fiscal and taxation system reform, leading cadres and staff members of various departments at various levels should be trained, either on a rotational basis or in regular training classes, in party or cadre schools. The propaganda departments at all levels should step up propaganda. The fiscal and taxation departments at various levels should set up a hotline for answering people's questions about fiscal and taxation work, accurately explain new policies to enterprises and families, and enthusiastically provide good service to urban and rural production units and businesses.
