"We showed people for whom they have been fighting and revealed their tricks when running Transdniestria," Lebed said in an interview with the Dnestrovskaya Pravda newspaper today. He added that the present power had completely outlived its time and that the composition of all its bodies must be changed through early simultaneous elections monitored by international organizations. It would be good also to vote confidence in current President Igor Smirnov, Lebed said. He said that Transdniestria had no future with its present leadership. "The Transdniestrian people will only be facing more disasters and finally Transdniestria as a republic will decay from its roots with no external interference. Moldova has realized this, calmed down and is just waiting. Only Tiraspol is reluctant to understand this. The local leaders are rushing ahead without thinking about the disaster lying ahead," Lebed said. Lebed said he believed that the Transdniestrian leadership must not count on the Russian opposition's coming to power. "It is even worse than utopia to hope that Alksnis or Umalatova will come to power. It is something fantastic -- not smart enough. As far as Zhirinovskiy is concerned, nobody knows definitely whether he will need Transdniestria when in power," Lebed said. Lebed categorically refuted the accusations that he had concluded a hidden agreement with Moldova and certain Russian forces interested in the elimination of the non-recognized Transdniestrian Republic. "While Mr Snegur, who has blessed this fratricidal war, remains in power, I have nothing to say to them," Lebed said.
