Anatol Vyartsinski, deputy chairman of the Commission for Mass Media and Human Rights, delivered a speech on this issue. I asked him to comment on the new law. [Begin recording] [Vyartsinski] The Law on Political Parties addresses a lot of issues. First of all, in the general political aspect, in a legal aspect, it admits and legalizes individual rights for free speech and worship, and the right to band with other like-minded people in political organizations. The law legalizes the multiparty system as a reality of our actual sociopolitical life. [Rutkowski] Currently, we have many parties in Belarus, however, the Communist Party is still one of the most prominent ones. [Vyartsinski] The law foresees equal rights for all parties. [Rutkowski] So, when the election campaign begins, each party will be able to nominate an established number of candidates to the Supreme Soviet. Is this true? [Vyartsinski] To some extent. The Law on Political Parties foresees that parties can participate in elections and nominate their candidates, and it is highly likely that future elections will be conducted on the basis of party lists. However, this is the domain of the Law on Elections [words indistinct]. [end recording] The draft law on alternative service has been discussed by our deputies not for the first time. Leanid Privalow, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet Commission for National Security, Defense, and Crime, delivered a report on this topic. However, the people's deputies have various opinions on the issue of alternative service; many deputies oppose it. We know that this law exists in many civilized countries. Yes, a young person should be able to choose between military service and something else. However, the implementation of this law demands that the mentality of our people change. This draft law was not adopted. I asked Leanid Privalow to express his opinion on this issue. [Begin Privalow recording] I do not want to comment on the behavior of some of our deputies, and I do not want to blame them. However, being an expert on this issue, I claim that the time for this law has not yet come [words indistinct]. [end recording]
