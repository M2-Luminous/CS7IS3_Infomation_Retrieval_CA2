The communist country will have to remove fuel from its 5-megawatt reactor "within weeks," Perry said at a news conference here. "The fuel will provide sufficient plutonium to make four to five nuclear bombs." "We believe it's critical that this operation is supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," he said. Emphasizing that Patriot missiles are purely a defensive system against conventional weapons, Perry made clear the anti-missile missiles will not be withdrawn from South Korea even if the tension over North Korea's nuclear program subsides. The IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog, first estimated that North Korea would have to change the nuclear fuel rods at its reactor last summer. It is believed that North Korea has yet to change the rods, and the IAEA says it must be present when the procedure takes place to verify whether the Stalinist state extracted more plutonium from the fuel than it reported to the agency in the past. While Pyongyang's secretive nature rules out an exact assessment of its nuclear status, Washington can say "with confidence" that "North Korea has a major nuclear weapons program under way," Perry said when asked to comment on how advanced the program is. Pyongyang has the 25-megawatt reactor, a 200-megawatt reactor under construction, a radiochemical laboratory and a high-explosives testing facility, according to the secretary. "The only possible explanation for these facilities is a major nuclear weapons program," said Perry. The United States can only guess how much nuclear fuel was diverted in the past, he said. "We estimate that there was enough plutonium in that fuel to make one or two bombs. We estimate they probably have the capability to convert that plutonium into bombs. We estimate they have had enough time by now to succeed in doing that." Perry flew into Seoul Tuesday for a visit centering on analyzing, planning and preparing for future developments following North Korea's refusal to allow full IAEA inspections last month. Just a day earlier, Perry and his South Korean counterpart Yi Pyong-tae announced they would go ahead with the annual "Team Spirit" military exercise in November unless the inspections were concluded successfully. Calling the joint maneuvers a defensive exercise, Perry said the two countries still hope that diplomatic persuasion can bring North Korea to comply with the inspections. "We plan to pursue diplomacy firmly and patiently unless there is no hope for success in diplomacy anymore," he said. "If that happens, we go together to the UN to impose sanctions on North Korea." Perry also defended the Patriot deployment, describing the system as purely defensive which "has no offensive capability at all." "... It is part of a regular modernization program that has been planned actually for several years, and there is no reason to withdraw," he said. "It's not here because of the nuclear weapons program. It is designed to defend against conventional Scud attacks."
