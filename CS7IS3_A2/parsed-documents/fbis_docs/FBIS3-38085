At dawn today an Israeli settler opened machine-gun fire, killing and wounding dozens of people in al-Khalil [Hebron]. As a result, the situation has sharply deteriorated on the West Bank of the river Jordan and in the Gaza sector, and clashes have taken place between Israelis and Palestinians, causing more human casualties. We decisively condemn this act of terror, carried out during a time of prayer in the month of Ramadan, which is sacred for Muslims. Measures must urgently be taken to prevent similar occurrences in the future and to punish the culprits. We express our condolences to the families of those who were killed and injured, and to all Palestinians. It is notable that the incident in al-Khalil has been condemned by the leadership and the main political parties in Israel, which, however, does not absolve the Israeli leadership of full responsibility, nor does it remove the need to act in such a way that will prevent violence from increasing. Such acts are certainly having a negative influence on the process of the Arab-Israeli dialogue and are damaging to everything positive that has been achieved toward a Middle East settlement through intense efforts. This crime has been carried out precisely when a tangible possibility was taking shape for arriving at an agreement between Israel and the PLO on the introduction of self- government in Gaza and the Jericho area. We consider it necessary to do everything possible to ensure a productive continuation of the talks and to prevent giving the extremists a chance to torpedo the peace process. The Russian Foreign Ministry is closely following the development of the events and is in contact with the interested parties in the interest of a speedy normalization of the situation and the creation of conditions for the further development of the peace process in the Middle East.
