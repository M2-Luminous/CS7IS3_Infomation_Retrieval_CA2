Japan welcomes the results of a visit to North Korea by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said. He told a press conference Japan will continue to watch the developments following Carter's Pyongyang trip and to make the utmost efforts in calling for a "serious" response from North Korea while maintaining close contact with the U.S. and South Korea. Turning to Japan's proposal to assist North Korea to convert its present nuclear facilities to a light-water reactor, Saito echoed Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa's remarks over the weekend that such aid would take place if Tokyo and Pyongyang discuss the issue within the context of normalization talks. Since Japan's economic aid for North Korea after normaliztaion of bilateral relations is one of the topics in the normalization talks, it is natural that Japan's help to convert to a light-water reactor will also be discussed, Saito said. Japan and North Korea have not held normalization talks since November 1992 due to a stalemate over international inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities.
