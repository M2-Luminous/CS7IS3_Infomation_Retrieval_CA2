This announcement was made here today by the commander of the gulf and Caribbean Sea Naval Force, Mariano Francisco Saynez Mendoza. He reported that three of these four units (manufactured in New Orleans) are currently operating in the gulf and Caribbean area for a training phase. In March, they will initiate the permanent surveillance. Saynez Mendoza revealed that, in the surveillance operations conducted in the Caribbean zone, an abandoned ship carrying 1.5 tons of cocaine was detected. As a result, the vessel was turned over to the Cozumel Island sector, to be consigned to the pertinent authorities. He claimed that drug trafficking by sea has declined considerably, although the Caribbean area is, of course, still a troubled area. It is considered a traditional route for the drug traffic from Central and South American countries to the United States. Stressing that the majority of vessels come from Colombia, Venezuela, and the Grand Cayman Islands, where these boats are detected while attempting to transport the drugs to the border, he admitted that there are, of course, some of other nationalities. He concluded by noting that, at present, the No. 51 patrol boat, Isla Coronado, the No. 52, Isla Lobos, and the No. 53, Isla Guadalupe, are in this port for a training period. It will be the No. 54 patrol boat, Isla Cozumel, that will be commissioned in March.
