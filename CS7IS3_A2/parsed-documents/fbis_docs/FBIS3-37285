To what extent does this correspond to reality? A UKRINFORM correspondent was informed at Ukraine's Ministry of Power and Electrification, that a tense situation with supplying electric power stations with organic fuel really did arise in Ukraine in the autumn-winter period of 1993-94. The main reasons were the more than hundredfold price increase for imported gas and oil products, tariffs on electric power lagging behind the general increase in the price of fuel, and also consumers' not wishing to pay the power industry. Left alone with its fuel problems, Ukraine's unified power supply was forced to lower the frequency of the alternating current in the grid. Namely for this reason the power systems of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary separated from it, and the export of electric power by the Lvov interstate (?crossing) was suspended. The suspension of its deliveries naturally did not evoke especial enthusiasm from [Ukraine's] foreign partners. However, they had an understanding attitude to the problems of their eastern neighbors and expressed their readiness for further cooperation after the situation improves. At the same time, they emphasized at the ministry of power and electrification, Ukrainian power engineers are continuing to carry out the transit of electric power from Russia to Bulgaria and Austria, although to date the Russian side has not extended the relevant agreement. They assert at the ministry that other events in the said reports do not correspond to reality either, for example, those concerning Ukraine's losses of one and a half billion from the suspension of exports or [concerning] the urgent measures by parliamentarians of eastern European countries regarding uniting with western countries and excluding Ukraine from the number of partners. It was noted at the ministry of power and electrification that the process of integrating the economies of eastern European states into the west European economic system, initiated by the leaders of the Visegrad Four countries in 1992, also includes gradual preparation for the transition by the power systems of these countries into a west European union. In order to resolve this problem the power engineers of Hungary, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic set up the organization (?Centrel), to which Ukraine was accepted as an observer. In particular the organization called for a resolution to the issue of keeping the technical possibilities for Central and Western Europe to receive electric power from Ukraine and Russia. A regular Centrel consultation in Warsaw on 16-17 February will be about this with the participation of a Ukrainian delegation. Similarly the Russian plans to construct new lines of electricity transfer to Europe via Belarus are not caused by the current fuel situation in Ukraine, but are a part of a long-term program of integrating Russia's power system in the Europe-wide power house. And so, although the situation in Ukraine's power engineering continues to remain tense, they summarized at the country's minister of power and electrification, it is not a catastrophic one.
