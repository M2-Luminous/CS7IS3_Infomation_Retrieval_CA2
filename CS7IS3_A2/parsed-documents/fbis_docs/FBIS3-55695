[Begin recording] [Kubilius] This draft law was prepared by the efforts of the opposition, and I can even say that thanks to the efforts of the opposition it was adopted by the Seimas before the New Year. Today, the president announced that he would probably not endorse this law, saying that allegedly it runs counter to the Constitution of Lithuania. I would like to say that according to our point of view, and as far as I know, judging by the reports I read in the press, when this law was adopted this point of view is supported by some representatives and the leaders of the government, and this law is one of the main laws in the struggle against corruption because there is no other way to fight corrupt officials except by means of this law. This law binds every official to declare his property and income. At the same time the source of their income must also be revealed. The president said that this law runs counter to the Constitution because the Constitution indicates that all citizens of Lithuania are equal before the law. However, he said that this law allegedly singles out certain officials in Lithuania and places some additional obligations on them. I would like to say that the Constitution should be regarded as a certain general document, and when one specific clause is taken out then, of course, different points of view can be adopted. However, I must say that there is also a clause in the Constitution, Clause number five, which reads that government institutions should serve the people. Therefore, this clause defines clearly how the officials at the governmental structures should work, i.e., they have to serve the people, the public and the state, and in no way should they serve their own interests. Extensive documents have been worked out in the West, called the code of practice of state officials, say, of the United States. Personal interests of a state official and those of the state are clearly defined. [passage omitted] I think that in refusing to endorse this law the president is making a mistake, because the refusal to endorse this law, which is a rather complex law and which will became fully operational only in 1995, means that this law will not now become valid in 1995. On the other hand, I fully agree with the president when he says that we must have a general law on income declaration by all citizens of Lithuania. However, I must say that the government believes that such a complex law can only be implemented at the beginning of 1996. This means that until then, i.e. 1996, corruption in our governmental circles will continue to flourish. [Unidentified correspondent] Could this unwillingness to endorse the law on income and property declaration by state officials be regarded as an apprehension by some, or rather individual, officials? [Kubilius] Absolutely. I can say firmly that, I am 100 percent sure, that...[pauses] I do not want to say that the president is concealing something because the president is also obliged to reveal his income. I think that Lithuania is in no way different from any Western country where, at times, corruption scandals shake a state. Rimantas Smetona, chairman of the Nationalist Union of Lithuania, said earlier at a news conference that while running away from socialism, Lithuania is now approaching Sicilism -- he means the Sicilian mafia. In this sense, both corruption and the mafia in Lithuania are flourishing and we must make all efforts to fight it. The West could not invent anything else in the fight against corruption but this law on the declaration of income and property by state officials. [Correspondent] [Passage omitted] The law was somehow linked to the elections. Can you comment? [Kubilius] What the president said today reminded me of the words spoken by deputy chairman of the Lithuanian Seimas, Juozas Bernatonis, when he spoke during the debates on the law in the Seimas. The same articles of the Constitution were mentioned and the same problems were raised. Already during the parliamentary debates on this law Bernatonis somehow said, half in joke -- although nobody speaks at the Seimas half in joke, and quite often very serious matters are spoken half in joke -- well, he said that instead of adopting this law let us declare new elections to the Seimas. [Correspondent] Elections and the adoption of such a law: The Seimas is dismissed, and in this way the officials escape responsibility. [Kubilius] In principle this would be so. I think that here some officials do not want to reveal their income and the source of their income, therefore, they think that it would be better to leave the parliament in a nice way through new elections.
