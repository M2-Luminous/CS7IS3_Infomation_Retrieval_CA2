The only solution for resolving this problem is to make use of foreign savings -- not in the form of loans attracted by interest rates that are much higher than in other markets, but in the form of direct investment, which brings not only the funds for creating jobs but the technology with which it is possible to face international competition. Now the first result of the law on the so-called abuse of economic power will be to push foreign capital away from our country. So far the strongest obstacle to foreign capital has been a very high inflation rate and protectionism, which impeded production under the proper conditions. We liberalized our economy, and in some sectors it was possible to reduce domestic prices by importing modern components that made it possible for us to compete abroad, streamlining production costs. The Real Plan has brought hope for the return of a "civilized" inflation rate. We can hope to once again receive foreign investment, which in recent years has dropped remarkably. Yet Congress has just approved an antitrust law that actually seeks to reinstate a price control system that is even more harmful than direct control, because it produces uncertainty. Under such conditions the country will push foreign capital even farther away. In order to attract foreign capital, Brazil has for several years been said to have -- unlike other countries -- a large potential domestic market. It so happens that this advantage is disappearing with the creation of Mercosur [Common Market of the South], as foreign investors can settle in one of the other Mercosur signatory countries, which sooner or later will be joined by Chile, in order to conquer the Brazilian market. Foreign investors will undoubtedly choose the countries offering the best conditions, especially those without price control. Now having more than 30 percent of the market is a mortal sin in Brazil, a sin that condemns an enterprise to several suspicions that can result not only in heavy monetary fines but also in the stealing of its technology... We do not know whether our lawmakers thought about this when they approved a law that condemned us to remain behind technological progress in the modern world. It is good to know that this has favored our Mercosur partners, which will be able to create jobs, enlarge their domestic markets, and conquer the Brazilian market without any difficulty, unless we resign our participation in an organization that is only one step forward toward the globalization of the economy.
