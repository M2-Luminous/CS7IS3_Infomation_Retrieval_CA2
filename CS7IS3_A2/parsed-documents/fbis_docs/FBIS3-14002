In effect, the resolution achieves much more. The categorical affirmation that Jammu and Kashmir [J&K] "has been, is and shall be an integral part of India" and that "all attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met resolutely" establishes the bottom line of the country's position on the subject. After this resolution, it is beyond the scope of any government, present or future, to flirt with outrageous proposals aimed at eroding national sovereignty in J&K. It puts paid to both sinister and well-meaning "self-determination" projects and imposes a parliamentary veto on all attempts to redraw the map of India. Equally, it signals to separatists throughout the country that the territorial frontiers of India are non-negotiable and that demands for "autonomy" have to be articulated keeping this position in mind. Regardless of other internal arrangements, the national tricolour must fly from Kashmir to Kanyakumari . Although the timing of the resolution was dictated by extraneous considerations, notably Pakistan's spirited bid to complete the "unfinished agenda" of partition and Washington's helping hand to Islamic terrorism, the resolution is calculated to have a salutary effect on the country's own morale. For the defence personnel engaged in the difficult and, sometimes, thankless job of fighting the insurgents, the resolution is reassurance that some cynical politicians will not barter away their sacrifices. For the dispossessed citizens of the Kashmir valley -- both Hindu and Muslim languishing forgotten in refugee camps there is at least a glimmer of hope that the will return to their homes one day. And ordinary citizens can delight in the realisation that no responsible person -- at least not yet -- can hope to remain in public life without acknowledging the emotive strength of Indian nationalism. Tuesday's resolution has established the parameter of national debate and international opinion will, in time, pay due heed to it. The collective echo of some 880 million cannot, after all, be treated as a casual refrain There will, of course, be the dissenting voices and these are likely to be highlighted by the pathological India-haters, not least in international fora. But after this show of national solidarity, the private agendas of "Track-II" diplomacy will no longer be able to masquerade as representative Indian opinion. The capitulationists should be certainly listened to, but with the same degree of seriousness reserved for the lunatic fringe in democracies. Parliament has clearly set out the ground rules for coping with this ferocious assault on Indian nationhood; the onus is now on the Government to ensure it is translated into practice. The nation has shown the will and the Government must evolve a way. *
