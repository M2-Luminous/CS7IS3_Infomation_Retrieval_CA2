The prevailing opinion then was that the biggest of all parties is that of the nonvoters. The election in Lower Saxony has shaken this conviction. At 73.8 percent, the voting participation last Sunday [20 March] was not even 1 point under that of 1990. The theory of nonvoting had proceeded from a false assumption. If the Germans are annoyed with politics, they vote nevertheless, even if for other than the usual party, perhaps an extremist one. Thirty percent of the eligible voters in western Germany say that they have already voted out of protest for a party for which they would not have voted otherwise. Only 14 percent, on the other hand, have ever failed to vote out of discontent. But the protest vote is the opportunity of the small parties. For this reason, the "concentration point" of the German party system, expressed in the combined share of the second ballot vote of the two people's parties, could decrease further in the Bundestag election in the fall. In the 1970's it was over 90 percent. Since 1980 it has been decreasing. In the Allensbach surveys of 1993 only 73 percent on the average still intended to vote for the Union [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union--CDU/CSU] or the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. Those who turn away from the people's parties do so mostly to give their vote to a smaller party. Only a few stay away from an election out of protest. Nonvoters are, for example, young people who as yet have little interest in politics and for whom voting is not yet civic duty and habit. Or they are elderly women, who after the death of their husbands no longer go to vote because no one takes them along. Nonvoters mostly have no interest in politics. They frequently come from the lowest social strata. For the heroic, protesting "party of nonvoters" there is very little left. Why does the voter vote the way he votes? A public opinion researcher who inquires directly into the reason for a voting decision could just as well ask: "Why are you Catholic?" or "Why are you Protestant?" Such questions do not lead to anything, for hardly anyone would answer: "Because I was born into a Catholic (or Protestant) family." But in many cases this would be the right answer. How, then, are the reasons for a voting decision to be recognized? "What on the whole was your family's political attitude, how far positioned to the left, in the center, or the right?" it was asked in February and March 1994. And: "How would you describe your own political position?" It became evident that in most cases the political position of the parents continued with the children. If, for example, a family is positioned "strongly to the left," the children in 4 of 10 cases, too, are positioned strongly to the left. Only 11 percent of the children from such families acknowledge themselves as belonging to the center. But in the political center or on the right, too, the generation of the parents in most cases passes on its views. Whether people vote regularly, too, is influenced by whether father and mother regularly went to vote. The much used concept of "political culture" really does apply in voting. Because tradition is so important, it is frequently impossible to uncover rational reasons for voting decisions through direct questions. The liberal theory of "rational choice" cannot be applied to voting decision and political loyalty in Germany. Hardly half of the voters expect personal advantages if the preferred party does well. Tactical calculations, too, such as not wanting to waste one's vote, are only marginally effective. It was asked: "Would you vote for a party which may not get over the 5-percent hurdle and thus not get into the Bundestag or the Landtag, or would you not bother to vote for a party that is not certain to qualify?" More than half of all Germans and more than 80 percent of the followers of smaller parties say: "I would nevertheless vote for such a party." Germans vote out of habit or tradition, and they regard elections as purposeful. They are not tempted by the idea that among 60 million eligible voters their vote is only a drop in the ocean, not worth going to the polling station for in the first place. One question asked: "Sometimes it is said that going to vote, after all, makes no sense. Do you at times, too, have this feeling, or do you not have such a feeling?" To be sure, 47 percent in western Germany and 54 percent in eastern Germany know this feeling. But as soon as one probes less directly and, for example, searches for associations with the word "voting," another picture emerges. The association "senseless" then is in next to last place; almost 70 percent say: "No, one cannot think of this in connection with `voting!'" Instead 86 percent say: "In connection with `voting' one can think of `important.'" Eighty-four percent associate "codetermination"; 64 percent think of "duty." Here lies the core of the political culture, closely connected with the belief in the value and superiority of democracy. Feelings play a large role. "When you have gone to a Landtag election or a Bundestag election and have voted, do you then have a good conscience, or have you never had such a feeling?" it was asked. Forty-nine percent answered: "I then have a good conscience." Or another question: "Do you know the feeling of having helped a party with your vote, or do you not know such a feeling?" Fifty-five percent reply: "I know" such a feeling. And time and again, when dealing with the subject of voting, one encounters the role of the parents. In the case of great closeness to the parents, young people in 79 percent of the cases say that going to vote is a kind of duty. Among those who are less close to their parents, only 43 percent say this. In response to the question of whether they will go to vote in the Bundestag election in the fall, 69 percent of those who have a close relationship with their parents say: "Certainly I will go and vote"; among those who are distant only 44 percent say this. Probably it has to do with the large role of tradition that the program of the preferred party is regarded as more important than the top politicians of this party. The program, that is the values of the family tradition. The politicians change. Sixty-three percent say that there is a party for which they generally vote. The democratic political culture is evidently much stronger than the feeling of political homelessness, and election years are high points in the consolidation of this culture. This also illustrates the magnitude of the task of letting a democratic political culture grow up in the eastern laender. When one hears words, one can, after all, have different feelings, whether one likes them or not. How about the word "voting?" "A sympathetic word," say 51 percent of the west Germans, with 18 percent opposite votes. Quite differently the east Germans: The 38 percent who regard "voting" as a sympathetic word are opposed by 29 percent: "Voting is unsympathetic." The Public Opinion Climate in March: The Union at a Low Point The forecasts of the polling institutes about the election in Lower Saxony were not bad. But, of course, they would have been wrong had the public opinion researchers taken their findings about the voting intentions of people at face value. In Allensbach, for example, the raw figures for the election in Lower Saxony were as follows: SPD 52.5 percent, CDU 28.5 percent. This did not correspond to the subsequent election results. At the same time, however, the information about how people voted in the end was distorted. The SPD share of the votes was much too high, the CDU share--much too low. If this was corrected and the almost 40-percent undecided, on the basis of their answers to other political questions, were apportioned, the results were 45.2 percent for the SPD, 35.4 percent for the CDU--very nearly the precise subsequent election result. All German polling institutes today adjust their findings in this manner. What is the source of such distortion of information in interviews? People do not lie. They find themselves under the pressure of the opinion climate. At the moment the CDU/CSU finds itself in a serious opinion climate low. Sixty-four percent of all those polled believe that at present most Germans do not like the Union. Only 11 percent say that people really like the CDU/CSU. It is different with the SPD. Forty-four percent are of the opinion that the SPD is well received, 21 percent contradict this. In such a climate, a spiral of silence develops. Those who feel threatened by the opinion climate become silent, refuse an interview, or declare themselves undecided when asked about their preferred party. The party which is under opinion-climate pressure is underestimated in surveys. Only through "political weighting" can one come close to the real strengths of the parties, for example now, in February/March 1994, for Germany as a whole 38.3 percent say they will vote for the SPD, and 32.5 percent for the CDU/CSU. The FDP, with 9.1 percent is far above the 5-percent hurdle and likewise Alliance 90/Greens with 11.5 percent. Accordingly, the Germans give the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens far better chances in the coming Bundestag election than the CDU/CSU and FDP. Only 22 percent expect a victory of the present coalition, but 46 percent believe red and green will win. But people know how ephemeral such estimates are seven months before the Bundestag election. Only 6 percent believe that the Bundestag election "has already been decided." For 81 percent, however, everything is still open.
