Since January 1993, the New Year has assumed a new importance to us, being the anniversary of the establishment of our state. This gives us an opportunity to reflect upon the first year of our lives in an independent state and, above all, to consider what our country needs and how we, all of us, can help our country. Our historical experience teaches us that our statehood is one of the most important guarantees of our national freedom and of our fully fledged national life, for which it is worth fighting and making the greatest sacrifices. For a long time, we lived in the shadow of others more powerful. Many of us doubted whether we would be able to rule ourselves, whether our own statehood made any sense, whether it had a real value, and whether it was not an excessive luxury for Slovaks. Many of us were afraid that our new state would not be internationally recognized. We were afraid that we would not be able to quickly build the state institutions needed for the existence of our independent republic. Today, we can see that these catastrophic predictions have not come true. According to these predictions, Slovakia would have been unable to avoid certain catastrophes. However, we are not hiding the fact that the new situation demands certain sacrifices. The peaceful and civilized partition of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic has given us a good starting point for a promising future. In a short time, the Slovak Republic has been recognized by most sovereign states, including all of the great powers. This testifies to the fact that the international community has fully respected the right of the Czech and the Slovak nations to establish their own states. This community has expressed trust in them and met them halfway. We, in the interests of peace and security in Europe, have embraced cooperation with all democratic nations and countries. Our objective is to jointly establish political, cultural, and economic prosperity in Europe and the world. This is the way we want to proceed in the future. Our democratic Constitution is our fundamental guarantee of civil rights and freedoms, as declared and demanded by hundreds of thousands of people in November 1989. For the first time in our modern history, we have become the architects of our own destiny. We ourselves have decided to establish our own state, as the historical development required or even dictated. The existence of the Slovak Republic is an undisputable fact. Those who accepted its establishment with nostalgia should understand it and respect it. Certain situations are unique and do not repeat themselves. We have taken the opportunity offered to us by history. Our task is to build this state as a common state of all of its people, irrespective of their nationality or religious and political affiliations, and to secure democracy, freedom, and legal order, so that the law may prevail over willfulness and unscrupulousness, and responsibility over impunity and corruption. I call upon everyone to participate in that work. It is our right, our duty, and our common interest. Our democracy must become a modern civic democracy in which the plurality of political parties, coexistence of the government and the opposition, and freedom for all must be secured. However, freedom means responsibility. We cannot tolerate freedom in the sense of an anarchic destruction of authorities and constitutional institutions, or the freedom to set various groups in society against one another. We will defend, as far as we can, our statehood, sovereignty, freedom, independence, and territorial integrity. The quick completion of our central state organization and institutions, the establishment of our Army, and the introduction of a separate currency, which we did not have before our state was established, are very important for our present existence and our future. I believe it is exceptionally important and encouraging that, now that the unified economic space we shared with the Czech Republic has been divided, the Slovak economy and currency have not collapsed. According to an international comparison giving the most important economic indicators, the Slovak Republic ranks second or third among the postcommunist countries. This should not be overestimated, but it certainly should not be belittled or ignored, either. I have been delighted that, apart from the newly established state institutions, hundreds of civic initiatives, associations, and nongovernmental organizations, usual in developed societies, have been registered in the first year. It is precisely in these organizations that civic activity should be concentrated and creative abilities provided by the democratic system utilized. Here we have opportunities to provide charity and assistance and express understanding and sympathy, which are features that give a human face to our society. Despite all of the mistakes and serious problems, I can proudly say that independent Slovakia has withstood the test in the first year of its state sovereignty. I want to thank the government, parliament, all state and public officials, and mayors of the cities for all of this. I want to sincerely thank all of you, my fellow citizens, for the patience and understanding that you showed last year. You know quite well that we not only had to face our lack of political culture, but also to get rid of bad habits and ailments inherited from the totalitarian system. We have inherited an extremely inconvenient economic structure and devastating way of thinking and morale. I appreciate that most of you have contributed to alleviating the difficulties and creating a gradual renewal of a peaceful and sensible life. My sincere thanks also go to all who are working without profit on the spiritual and moral revival of our society. We are proud of our artists, scientists, sportsmen, producers of top-of-the-line products, and others who help to spread Slovakia's good reputation abroad. Dear fellow citizens, if I have evaluated the first year of our state existence positively, it does not mean that I am satisfied with the results we have achieved. I am convinced that they could have been better in both the material and the spiritual spheres, especially with respect to the general social atmosphere and our life-style. We could have avoided various political feuds, unnecessary stress, and various scandals. All of this disappointed many people and caused them to stop trusting in politics and politicians and to lose drive and optimism. I am saying with pain in my heart that I believe that many difficulties have been caused by our failure to mobilize and unify all of the political and nonpolitical forces in our society, with the objective of jointly solving our essential problems. We did not try to find out what our errors were but pointed to the errors of others. We did not try to find ourselves allies but preferred to discover adversaries and enemies to be blamed for everything. Fortunately, we do not have too many parties in parliament, which made it easier to join our political forces. However, we did not succeed in establishing a coalition that would be able to secure the necessary stability of the government, or, at least, productive cooperation between political entities. It would be our tragedy if we thought that all of our important problems would be solved by capable and strong individuals. Today we know that a successful solution to our problems requires cooperation between dozens or hundreds of brains, if not thousands or hundreds of thousands. We need a government with a wider coalition that would mobilize the best brains of our society so as to solve its main problems and carry out its main tasks. Personal animosities must not hamper the formation of such a government. People who have the necessary knowledge and ability to cooperate decently with their colleagues should be appointed to such a government. This is why I appeal to the leading representatives of the parliamentary parties, movements, their elected bodies, and ordinary members to seek the appropriate personalities from among their ranks. When carrying out this task, we must put Slovakia's interests before the interests of individuals, parties, and movements. A broad coalition government must be based on the results of the last elections, in which the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia won a majority. It would be a very unfortunate situation if the parliamentary parties were based on one person and fell along with that person. Slovakia now needs political stability, conditions for peaceful and productive work, an atmosphere of tolerance, understanding, and goodwill. The key to solving our problems lies in cooperation among our parliamentary political parties and not in confrontation, in stretching our partnership and not in putting some people above others, in intensifying our mutual trust and respect and not in suspecting and accusing others, not in radicalization but in moderation and temperance. Our responsibility for Slovakia's destiny dictates that we should put an end to government-drafted makeshift solutions and improvisations and try, using all democratic and peaceful means, to establish political stability and a stable government that would also be trusted abroad. This is a condition for being able to focus on the uncompromising fight against unemployment and the growing crime rate, disorder, lack of discipline, and injustice. This is the basic prerequisite for improving our trustworthiness abroad and renewing the trust of people in our politics and the correctness of the road upon which we have embarked. Dear fellow citizens, we are entering a year that the United Nations has declared to be the International Year of the Family. Even though our country is in a difficult situation, we must not allow the human, spiritual, and cultural level of families to decline. As head of state, I will demand that state bodies help to create a social climate that stimulates a peaceful and harmonious family life, the protection of children and elderly people, and the sound development of the younger generation. I will require that a state program be established to support young families, which would help satisfy at least their basic needs in housing and starting their new lives. We are obliged to provide young families with a way out of today's unpleasant situation. No one except parents can assume the role of the mother or the father, however. This is why I appeal to you, dear parents: Give more love to your children and be a good example to them. It is in the interests of your sons and daughters, and also in your own. It is very important to ask: What do we still lack for a humane, respectable, and happy life? Material welfare or humanity, mutual trust, love, respect, and other spiritual values? I know that a decent human life requires adequate material conditions. This is why we are vehemently implementing economic transformation and trying to improve the output of our economy. Our efforts must not fade away. I am convinced that we need more human values. A peaceful, balanced, and happy life is impossible without them. It will depend on ourselves how much effort we exert to secure material welfare and how much to secure spiritual and human education. The more we concentrate on doing our daily work well, the more we will help, indirectly, to create the material prerequisites for a decent human life. We all have the opportunity to do good and contribute to a rapid improvement in the conditions of our lives. There are indeed people among us who need, for various reasons, the help of others. But the rest should not rely on someone else's help to improve their material and spiritual lives. Without their own diligence, it would be immoral to demand better material and spiritual conditions of life. Doing good cannot be replaced by anything. We only have to want to do good. Please, my fellow citizens, try to reflect upon my words and let us try to change our daily lives. It is worth the pain! Apart from democracy, mutuality, love, tolerance, and goodwill are the great riches in every society. Let us protect them and improve them. Dear fellow citizens, at the very beginning of the New Year, it would be the most simple thing to wish you a happy New Year, better than the one preceding. However, I know that particularly in economic life there will be no essential reversal. Our situation is complicated but not desperate. We have many reasons to face the future with real optimism. Everyday we become more convinced that our people are highly educated, that we have capable scientists, comparable technological experience, and responsible and industrious people. We are quickly acquiring managerial and entrepreneurial skills and learning foreign languages. We have the opportunity to embrace international cooperation and experience. However, we lack sound self-confidence. I have to take this opportunity to address the churches, the cultural and educational institutions, the intelligentsia, the publishers, the mass media and the teachers, and to ask them to help as much as they can to create a sound basis for our future life, to strengthen political and civic stability, the mental health and harmonious life of the family. Only than will we be able to look calmly into the future. Building a state, the foundations of which we have already laid, is like building a home in which our family will live. If we have sound and prosperous families, our state, too, will be sound and prosperous. All that we do for the harmonious and sound development of our families will become our most precious contribution to a better and new future for all of us. So help us God. In this spirit I greet you, fellow countrymen, brothers and sisters, who live dispersed all over the world, and wish you Happy New Year for 1994, good health, optimism, unity, and trust in yourself and your country.
