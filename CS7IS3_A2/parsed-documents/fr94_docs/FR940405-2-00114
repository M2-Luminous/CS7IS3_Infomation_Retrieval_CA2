Project/Activity: Installation of Smoke Detectors in Public Housing Units. Nature of Requirement: Public housing agencies are required to have either a hard-wired or battery-powered smoke detector installed on each level of all public housing units by October 30, 1992. Granted By: Michael B. Janis, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. Date Granted: December 24, 1992. Reason Waived: In Atlanta, Georgia local law prohibits the use of battery-operated smoke detectors and the Atlanta Housing Authority (AHA) will have to contract for the installation of over 8,000 hard-wired smoke detectors. The regulations were waived to extend the October 30, 1992, deadline for installing smoke detectors on each level of every unit to October 31, 1993, to allow additional time for the AHA to install hard-wired smoke detectors required by local law.
