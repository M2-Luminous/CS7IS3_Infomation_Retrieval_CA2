FR941116-2-00087 FR941116-2-00068 [Docket No. 50&hyph;390] Tennessee Valley Authority; Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Unit 1 Order Tennessee Valley Authority (the permittee) is the current holder of Construction Permit No. CPPR&hyph;91, issued by the Atomic Energy Commission on January 23, 1973, for construction of the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Unit 1. The facility is currently under construction at the permittee's site on the west bank of the Tennessee River approximately 50 miles northeast of Chattanooga, Tennessee. On September 19, 1994, the permittee filed a request pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55(b) for an extension of the completion date from December 31, 1994 to December 31, 1995. The proposed action is needed because the construction, modification, and preoperational testing of the facility is not yet fully completed. Following completion of hot functional testing, the permittee conducted an extensive review of the remaining scope of work required to complete the unit. The review indicates fuel load for the unit will occur in the spring of 1995. The requested extension period includes contingency in case any adjustments to the schedule are needed. The NRC staff has concluded that good cause has been shown for the delays, and that the extension is for a reasonable period. The basis for these conclusions is set forth in the staff's evaluation. The staff has further concluded that the requested extension involves no significant hazards consideration and that, therefore, no prior public notice is needed. The NRC staff has prepared an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, which was published in the Federal Register on November 8, 1994. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that extending the construction completion dates will have no significant impact on the environment. The applicant's letter dated September 19, 1994, and the NRC staff's letter and Safety Evaluation of the request for extension of the construction permit, dated November 8, 1994, are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Chattanooga-County Library, 1001 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402. It is hereby ordered That the latest completion date for Construction Permit No. CPPR&hyph;91 is extended to December 31, 1995. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 8th day of November 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. William T. Russell, Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28259 Filed 11&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
