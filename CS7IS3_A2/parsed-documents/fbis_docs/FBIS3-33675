The paper adds: Israel knows how to sell the illusions of peace to obtain more arms deals and restore its ties with many countries. The U.S. pressure to end the Arab boycott of Israel before the latter takes any concrete step proves this. AL-JUMHURIYAH points out that Israel has a long experience in prevarication and maneuvers, the most recent of which was the farce over a referendum on withdrawal from the Golan Heights. This was a move intended to confront the results of the Geneva summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. AL-JUMHURIYAH concludes: Washington apparently approves of this game as demonstrated by a remark made by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that his country, although a full partner to the process, will not pressure Syria or Israel in the peace negotiations and will not mediate unless requested to by both parties.
