The minister said before today's meeting of the People's Assembly Committee for Energy and Industry, chaired by Dr. Amin Mubarak, that the ministry is following up on the latest developments in nuclear stations around the world so that they will be ready at the appropriate time whenever a decision is reached to implement the nuclear stations. Mahir Abazah added that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion restricted the expansion of many developed countries in the field of nuclear stations. Examples are the United States, Italy, and Germany. The members of the committee had demanded that modern technology specializing in the use of nuclear reactors for generating electricity be introduced to deal with the rise in the price of electricity in Egypt. They noted that there are those who maintain that there are pressures on Egypt not to set up such stations.
