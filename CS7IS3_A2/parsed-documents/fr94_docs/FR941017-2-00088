FR941017-2-00088 FR941017-2-00056 The fourth measure is Executions in Size Greater than BBO, which measures the number of market and marketable limit orders which exceed ether BBO size and are executed in size larger than the BBO size. Thus if a specialist receives a total of 10 market and marketable limit orders which exceed the BBO size and executes nine of the orders in size larger than the BBO size, his/her raw score would be 90% and would receive 8 points since it falls in the 86 to 90 percent range. This calculation will comprise 25% of the overall evaluation program.

The minimum acceptance raw score for each question remains at 4.5. Thus if a specialist receives a raw score of 4.5 for each question for a weighted raw score (based on the weights for each question within the questionnaire) of 50.0052, he/she would receive 4 points since it falls in the 50 to 54 weighted raw score range.

If performance does not improve in the subsequent period, the specialist will appear before the Market Performance Committee for appropriate action, as described below. 8 7 A specialist is deficient in any measure if he/she scores below the minimum adequate performance thresholds set forth below. See infra, text accompanying note 10. 8 The Commission notes that, in the event a specialist's performance does not improve, SPEP's Supplemental Material authorizes the Market Performance Committee to take the following actions: suspending the specialist's trading account privilege, suspending his/her alternate specialist account privilege or reallocating his/her specialty stocks. Any specialist who falls below the threshold level for the overall evaluation program for two out of three consecutive review periods will be required to appear before the Market Performance Committee and the Committee will take action to address the deficient performance as provided for in Paragraph 2156.10&hyph;.60. 9 A specialist who is ranked in the bottom ten percent of the overall evaluation program but who is above the threshold level for the overall program will be subject to staff review to determine if there is sufficient reason to warrant informing the Performance Improvement Action Committee of potential performance problems. 9 See supra, note 8. The following threshold scores have been set at which a specialist will be deemed to have adequately performed: 10 10 A specialist who receives a score that is below a minimum adequate performance threshold will be deemed to be deficient in that measure. See supra, note 7. Overall Evaluation Score_at or above weighted score of 5.80 Turnaround Time_below 21.0 seconds (8 points) Holding Orders Without Action_below 21.0% (7 points) Trading Between the Quote_at or above 26.0% (5 points) Executions in Size >BBO_at or above 76.0% (6 points) Questionnaire_at or above weighted score of 50 (4 points) Due to the subjectiveness of the questionnaire, a specialist who is deficient on the questionnaire alone will be subject to review by Exchange staff to determine if there is sufficient reason to warrant informing the Performance Improvement Action Committee of potential performance problems. However, a deficient score on the questionnaire may result in performance improvement action where it lowers the overall program score below 5.80. The Exchange requests an extension of the current pilot program for a twelve-month period to begin on January 1, 1995. This twelve-month period will enable the Exchange to further evaluate the appropriateness of the measures and their respective weights, as well as the effectiveness of the overall evaluation program. 2. Statutory Basis The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(5) in that the SPEP results weigh heavily in stock allocation decisions and, as a result, specialists are encouraged to improve their market quality and administrative duties, thereby promoting just and equitable principles of trade and aiding in the perfection of a free and open market and a natural market system. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition No burden on competition is perceived by the adoption of the proposed rule change.
