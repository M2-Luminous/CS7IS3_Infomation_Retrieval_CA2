The green light brings the total number of industrial items allowed to be manufactured in the mainland to 4,444, or 70 percent of the 6,771 industrial goods Taiwan companies currently manufacture, Yin noted. The government made the decision following 29 rounds of talks with representatives of 12 key industries, including the information, consumer electronics, machinery, steelmaking, petrochemical, [word indistinct] and telecommunication industries, he said. Of the new products allowed to be manufactured in Mainland China, 196 and 188 are textile and machinery products, respectively. Even the automobile and information industries, both of which are considered vital to Taiwan's economy, have been approved to manufacture 18 and 16 items, respectively, in Mainland China, he pointed out. Information products getting the go-ahead for mainland production include the 486 personal computer, he added. Yin said the further relaxation of restrictions on investment in Mainland China will help create win-win opportunities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
