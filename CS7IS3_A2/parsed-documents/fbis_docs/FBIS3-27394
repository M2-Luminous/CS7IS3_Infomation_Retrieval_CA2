An official from the provincial statistics bureau said that non-state-owned manufacturers -- collectively-owned firms, private companies and Sino-foreign joint ventures -- turned out 166 billion yuan worth of goods in 1993, up 50 percent over the previous year. As a result, these manufacturers now account for nearly 48 percent of the province's total industrial output value, an increase of four percentage points, the official said. In contrast, output value of state-owned manufacturers rose just 5.3 percent last year, he said. Production growth of collectively-owned businesses in both urban and suburban areas is the most impressive, with output value topping 100 billion yuan for the first time in 1993, he said. The figure represented an increase of 68 percent over 1992, he added. Meanwhile, output value of foreign-funded companies shot up by 40 percent and that of private firms by 50 percent, he said. Local economists agreed that non-state-owned companies are now playing an increasingly significant role in circulation. They cited the change in market shares as an example. Retail sales of state-run companies rose 10.4 percent in 1993, while those of collectively-owned firms climbed by 15 percent, those of private businesses by 43 percent and those of foreign-funded enterprises by 70 percent. As a result, non-state-owned companies accounted for 63 percent of Liaoning's retail sales in 1993, up by four percentage points. Moreover, non-state-run research institutes are mushrooming throughout Liaoning, the economists said. The province had 5,180 such institutes in 1993, 4,100 more than in 1992, according to the provincial statistics bureau. These institutes employed 70,000 people last year, 55,000 more than in 1992. Moreover, these institutes generated a total of 170 million yuan in profits and taxes in 1993, ten times the amount in the previous year. According to economists, the non-state-owned sector is also becoming a major source of revenue for Liaoning Province. For example, collectively-owned township-run enterprises paid five billion yuan in taxes to the government last year, a quarter of Liaoning's revenue.
