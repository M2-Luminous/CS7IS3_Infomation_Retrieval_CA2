There were 14 main railway lines affected by floods as of June 19, according to the Ministry of Railways. A breakdown of railway service happened on 42 occasions, which resulted in a loss of rail service time of up to 371 hours, a rise of 237 hours over the same period last year. Loading and unloading services were affected, involving some 2,000 cars in the railway system on average each day. Incomplete statistics showed that direct economic damage to the railway lines resulting from the floods was put at over RMB 70 million [renminbi], while indirect economic loss because of breakdown of rail service was much more serious. As the flood season came earlier than normal with a violent impact, railway lines in central Fujian Province were affected by landslides because of torrents or water rushing down the mountain between May 1 and 3. A 27-kilometre section of the Yingtan-Xiamen railway line was buried by a mud-rock flow, which led to a breakdown of rail service of up to 68 hours. Railway service between Zhejiang and Jiangxi and that between Guangxi and Guizhou came to a halt mainly due to the floods. Guangdong and Hunan were violently hit by rainstorms. Railway service was seriously affected, including the railway lines between Beijing and Guangzhou, between Hunan and Guizhou, as well as between Hunan and Guangxi, all of which are under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Railway Administration. Along these lines, landslides and sections submerged in water took place in 60 places, and the water level at seven bridges was well over the warning line. The southern part of China is still subject to heavy rain in recent days, according to weather forecasts. A flood control command was set up by the ministry and various railway administrations, and a 600,000-strong emergency team was also established to stand by in a bid to fight possible floods and ensure the safety of railway service.
