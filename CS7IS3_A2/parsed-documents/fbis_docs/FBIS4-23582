Against all expectations, the latter has just accepted that the illegal government of criminals sits within the OAU. Yesterday we talked about the presence of two Rwandan delegations in Tunis, that of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and that of the illegal government, for the 60th meeting of African foreign ministers, in preparation for the 30th summit of heads of state and governments of OAU member countries. [passage omitted] To the great disappointment of the international community, the foreign ministers' meeting accorded support to the self-proclaimed government of Sindikubwabo. The RPF delegation will only participate in the summit of heads of state and government of OAU member countries as simple invitees of the OAU secretary general. [passage omitted]
