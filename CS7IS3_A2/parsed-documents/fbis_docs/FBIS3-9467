The accident occurred when a risky experiment was in progress in the No. 6 Unit, namely reducing the loading of turbogenerator No. 10 down from 100 percent to zero. At the very start of the experiment, a short circuit occurred that shut down the standby electrical supply to Units Nos. 5 and 6. Only by switching on standby diesel generators was it possible to prevent the reactor from becoming a bomb. Important control and monitoring apparatus remained without any electric power supply, so that between 1415 and 1600, no information or recordings were available on the actions carried out. The Soviet specialists in charge of the experiment refuse to provide any explanation. The experts established that no program existed for the experiment or for dealing with any possible incidents that might occur. The Central Control Department has no documentation either because the tape recorder that serves as a "black box" in the event of accidents is started manually, and on the day in question, no one thought of switching it on. The failure in the No. 6 Unit put the radiation safety monitoring panel out of action. The workers connected all the instruments to the standby diesel generators. However, no one noted this either in the report compiled by the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, nor in the one made by the National Electricity Company commission, nor in the report of the Committee for Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy because it contravened the nuclear safety regulations and considerably increased the risk arising from the fault. The chiefs of the nuclear plant decided to disconnect the preventative systems of the No. 5 Unit and reconnect it to its normal power supply because the standby power supply system, fed from diesel generators, was unreliable. However, on the very next day, "someone" countermanded this order. A further short circuit occurred, which, according to the experts, lasted for more than a minute. A fire broke out that burned for over two hours. As a result of all this, until 12 December 1992, we had to import from Ukraine additional electric power costing about 600 million leva.
