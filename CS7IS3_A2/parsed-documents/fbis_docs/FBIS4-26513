It was learned that China's satellite television industry developed rapidly in the last decade. The country today has nearly 300 enterprises producing more than 100,000 sets of satellite television reception equipment a year. These enterprises, which are under the jurisdiction of more than 10 departments, spread thinly their production investment and are generally small in terms of their scale of production. Many of them lack the ability to develop products by themselves and demonstrate poor economic efficiency. To change this condition, the State Council has decided to strengthen the macromanagement of the production of satellite ground reception equipment. Based on this decision, the Ministry of Electronics Industry recently promulgated the "Provisions on the Management of Ground Receiving Equipment for Satellite Television Broadcasting." The provisions specify that local departments in charge of the electronics industry will be centrally responsible for managing the production of satellite ground reception equipment, for receiving applications, for making recommendations related to the designation of enterprises for the production of satellite ground reception equipment in the localities, and for investigating unlicensed production. The provisions stipulate that an enterprise must possess certain conditions to become a designated production enterprise: An enterprise must has the ability to develop new products, and its products must contain a higher proportion of locally made components. Its production scale must be fairly large, and its products must enjoy a fairly large market share. It must have the means to measure satellite ground reception equipment qualities and possess a sound and effective system for quality control. Its products must reach the current national or industrial standards. It must have a complete set of documents on the design and industrial process of the products as required by state regulations. The provisions also set specific requirements on the methods of application, examination, and approval for designated production enterprises and on the operation and management of licensed enterprises. The provisions also stipulate that unlicensed enterprises must immediately stop producing satellite ground reception equipment and that unlicensed producers will be investigated to fix their responsibility as legal entities in accordance with the law.
