Vladislav Kozyakov comments. [passage omitted] One of the most significant results of the latest summit, in terms of economic cooperation, was undoubtedly the agreement on the sale of Russian uranium to America. In the next 20 years, Russia will process some 500 tonnes of weapons uranium. The processed uranium will be shipped to America as fuel for nuclear power stations there, at a cost of 12 billion dollars. This deal is mutually advantageous -- Russia will receive the much-needed hard currency, while America perhaps will produce cheaper electric energy by its nuclear power stations -- but what seems to be the most significant in this agreement is the overcoming of one of the barriers in the way of Russian goods to America. The point is that Russia has many more such goods that could compete on an equal footing with others on the American market and on other Western markets, but such trade in those goods is being hampered by different kinds of barriers, or high tariffs, or prohibition law enacted in the past, or antidumping procedures. [passage omitted] Russia has goods to sell. This is not only space technology or energy supplies, and not only aluminum or uranium. There are other technologies -- ferro-alloy and mineral fertilizers, some types of electronics and products of machine-building industries. These are competitive goods, but to break into the markets has been very difficult. This may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely because of their high competitiveness. About 20 types of Russian goods fall within the antidumping procedure by American and Western countries, the aim of which, of course, is to take them out of the markets. Undoubtedly, to agree on the issue of trade can sometimes be very difficult, but the Russian-American contract on uranium and other accords at the Moscow summit give one the hope that the American market will at long last be open to Russian goods. This would be one more practical confirmation of the successful development of partnership between Russia and the United States of America.
