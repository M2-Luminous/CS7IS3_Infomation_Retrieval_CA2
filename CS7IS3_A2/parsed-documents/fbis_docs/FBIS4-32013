Asked by the daily, Cernak confirmed the existence of a private firm which acts as information and intelligence agency for ex-Premier Meciar. The firm, according to SLOVENSKY VYCHOD, obtained "unofficial" information about Slovak high-ranking politicians. The paper says that Jaroslav Svechota, former Slovak interior minister in 1990 when Meciar led the ministry, works in the firm. Cernak says that he has documents to prove that Meciar, in the interests of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), corrupted the Slovak National Party (SNS) when Cernak was its chairman, and had thus contributed to the victory of non-tolerant and radical wing.
