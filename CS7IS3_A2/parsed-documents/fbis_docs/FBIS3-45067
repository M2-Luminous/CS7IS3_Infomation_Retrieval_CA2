China's grain harvest this year is larger than that of last year, there are sufficient grain reserves, and there is no problem with the balance of supply and demand. Due to the unusually low grain prices in the past, appropriate rises in grain prices under market regulation are inevitable. However, the drastic rises we are now seeing are totally propelled by certain temporary and psychological factors. What needs to be pointed out is that some of our peasant brothers are reluctant to sell grain in the face of abnormally sharp price rises. Believing that "it is better to sell when prices are going down, not up," they intend to store more grain and wait for a better price. Is their belief correct? The answer is no. It is no cause for criticism that farmers intend to sell their products at higher prices for more profit. Past sales of grain at unduly low prices have already been noticed by both the central and local governments. After the decontrol of grain prices, a considerable rise has been registered in grain prices, thus enabling the price to keep up with the value. The decision of the central authorities to raise the price of grain next year is a measure to equalize grain prices and value. As a special commodity with great bearing on the state as a whole and on the everyday life of the people, grain is subject to market rules, and restricted by the risk-enduring capacity of urban grain consumers. When grain prices rise drastically, it is necessary for the state to adopt economic control and regulation measures, or other measures. That is why the State Council has decided to draw upon grain stocks to ease prices. Therefore, we have every reason to say that people who intend to store up grain and wait for a higher price will fail to attain their hope, and it is possible that they will not be able to sell their grain at today's prices. Peasants in China have always had a strong sense of the state and the whole situation. Starting next year, China will take major steps in reforming the systems of finance, taxation, monetary industry, and investment. This set of positive and stable programs follows the common rules of the market economy, uses the successful experience of advanced countries for reference, gives full consideration to China's national conditions and today's realities, and tries to take care of the interests of all sides in every possible way. Implementation of this set of well-coordinated reform programs will enable China to take a big step forward in its cause of reform and opening up, and in its economic development. However, to put into practice all these major reforms, we need to have a sound environment, and a stable market remains an important factor. The reluctance of peasant brothers to sell grain is exacerbating the abnormally sharp price rises, and as a result, the stability of the entire market will be weakened, and this situation is unfavorable for the state to start its major reforms next year. On the contrary, if peasant brothers continue selling their grain as they should, they help soothe grain prices and stabilize the market. This will help the state to implement its major reform measures next year. Peasant brothers, gain a farther and broader vision, do not be reluctant to sell grain, and try to carry out production and operation in a normal manner.
