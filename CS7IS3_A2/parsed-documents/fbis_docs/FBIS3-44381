While the people across the province were celebrating their festival, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee; Governor Ye Liansong; Li Zhanshu, member of the provincial party standing committee; and Guo Hongqi, vice governor of the province, inspected markets in the seat of Yuanshi County. Riding in the same bus for the inspection tours were leading personnel from Shijiazhuang city and responsible comrades from the provincial industry and commerce bureau, the provincial grains bureau, and the provincial commodity price bureau. At 0830 yesterday Cheng Weigao said to the accompanied personnel as soon as he got on the bus: Our inspection emphasis will be concentrated on the problem of injecting water into meat. Ye Liansong said: Regardless, injecting water into pork or chicken is illegal. Cheng Weigao said: He never knows the water injection of pork and it is a really fantastic story. Injecting water into pork means to replace meat with water and to use trickery. Such cases must be strictly handled as soon as they have been exposed. At about 0900 that day, the bus arrived at the seat of Yuanshi County. Cheng Weigao, Ye Liansong, and the accompanied personnel walked along the street after they were off of the bus and inspected, one by one, the stands and shops on both sides of the street. When inspecting the pork markets, Cheng Weigao and Ye Liansong held talks with the butcher, named (Cui Kou), who is more than 60 years old and has been in the meat business over the past twelve years. All meat he has sold is from his own hogs and bought by him from outside places. He was not aware of the inspection conducted by the provincial leadership. Cheng Weigao asked him whether his pork had been injected with water. While continuously chopping his meat, (Cui Kou) answered: No, no, I never do that and never do things mean. Ye Liansong asked him whether he has bought diseased hogs. (Cui Kou) said: I have bought two hogs of that kind. Ye Liansong asked how he handled them and whether he had sold them. He stopped chopping his meat this time, (Cui Kou) said: Such pork must not be sold and I have handled all of them. I would lose a family fortune if such a sale were exposed. After consecutively inspecting several meat stands and shops, the leading personnel discovered no meat with injected water and the meat prices were relatively rational. After leaving the meat markets, Cheng Weigao and other personnel went into a meat foodstuffs center run by a couple whose boss is called (Zhang Liguo). After inquiring about the channels of ordering goods, pork prices, and profit situation, Cheng Weigao said to him: Being the managers of an individually run business, you should first pay attention to stressing professional ethics, food sanitation, and credit. On the afternoon that day, leading personnel including Cheng Weigao entered the first grains and cooking oil center under the Yuanshi County Grains Storehouse just as soon as its doors were opened. They discovered a plate with rational prices of grains and cooking oil and were satisfied with the center's genuine goods at a fair price. After their inspection activities, Cheng Weigao and Ye Liansong were interviewed by the reporters. Cheng Weigao said: Today is New Year's Day. During the new year the central authorities will accelerate their pace in reform that is aimed at developing productive forces and upgrading the people's living standard. Therefore, in conducting reform, units at all levels should safeguard the vital interest of the people and do a good job in dealing with the problems that should not occur. For example, pork has been injected with water and steamed buns have been cooked with sulfur. All of this has been caused by the bureaucracy. There are almost 1,000 personnel in the Shijiazhuang city industry and commerce bureau and how could these personnel fail to successfully deal with these problems? He declared on the spot that we will find the industry and commerce bureau to blame for the recurrence of such problems and that will prove that leadership has not performed its duties totally and effectively.
