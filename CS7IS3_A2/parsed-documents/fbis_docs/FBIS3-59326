Due to different conditions in the development of the national economy, the economic and technical development in various regions is unbalanced. Under the conditions of market economy, we must understand that because of differences in various regions, there can be major differences under certain conditions. However, if the economic differences are excessively large in various regions, they would have an adverse impact on social stability and development. Therefore, we must follow the principle of giving consideration to both balanced development and efficiency in forming a reasonable pattern for the distribution of the productive forces. Widening Regional Economic Differences Since the beginning of the reform and opening up program, China has scored economic achievements which attract worldwide attention. Tremendous economic achievements have been attained in various regions throughout the country. However, such development is unbalanced. The rate of growth is the greatest in China's eastern region where economic and technological foundations are good, while this rate is comparatively low in the central and western regions where economic and technological standards are fairly low. As seen from the average annual growth rate of gross national product between 1980 and 1991, the ratio among China's eastern, central, and western regions is 16.72:15.2:14.78 with the eastern region nearly 2 percent higher than the western region. The accumulative difference in rate of growth has again widened the once diminishing regional economic differences. There are almost no changes in the ratio of population in China's eastern, central, and western regions during the past decade. Nevertheless there are notable changes in the ratio of gross national product in these regions. The ratio in 1980 was 52.2:31.2:16.5. The ratio in 1991 was 55.8:29.3:14.9 with the ratio in the eastern region raised by 3.6 percent and the central and western regions lowered by 1.9 percent and 1.6 percent respectively. Influenced by the differences in economic development, the gap in residents' incomes in various regions is also widening. Let us take the income of peasants as an example. The ratio in 1980 between the average per-capita income of peasants in five provinces and municipalities directly under the central government with the highest income and that of the five provinces and autonomous regions with the lowest income is 1.98:1 (assuming the average per-capita income of peasants in the provinces and autonomous regions with the lowest income is 1). These figures rose to 2.88:1 in 1991. As seen from the eastern, central, and western regions, the 1980 ratio of average per-capital income of peasants in these three regions was 1.39:1.11:1; while that in 1991 rose to 1.71:1.06:1. In China's existing economic structure, nearly half of the gross national product is contributed by secondary industry, and nearly 90 percent of the added value of secondary industry is contributed by industry (manufacturing industry). Therefore, the rate of industrial growth is extremely important in the development of the entire national economy. There are significant differences in the rate of industrial growth among the eastern, central, and western regions. The rate of average annual rate of growth between 1985 and 1990 was 1.39:1.05:1. This difference brought about changes in the regional structure in terms of total industrial output. The percentage in the eastern region rose from 60.3 percent in 1985 to 62.7 percent in 1990, while that in the western region dropped from 12.75 percent in 1985 to 11.91 percent in 1990. Due to various reasons, the growth rate of investment in fixed assets in central and western regions is relatively low. From the long-term investment point of view, this trend is not so favorable. The rates of growth of investment in fixed assets in China's eastern, central, and western regions from 1982 to 1991 were 19.69 percent, 16.15 percent, and 18.18 percent. In 1991, 61.46 percent of the additional investment in fixed assets was made in the eastern region. Since the beginning of this year, China has continued to maintain a high rate of growth in its economic development. The gross national product in the first quarter rose by 14.1 percent over the same period in 1992. According to accumulative figures compiled from January to April, China registered a rate of growth of 23 percent in industrial production. However, the pattern of unbalanced economic developments in various regions remains unchanged. In some districts, economic development is still quite sluggish. Those areas that were economically backward in the past are still lagging behind others, and their ratio in economic increments continues to drop. The gaps between the eastern region and the western region and between the south region and the northern region continue to widen. Let us take industrial production as an example. According to accumulative figures compiled between January and April, the rates of industrial growth in the eastern, central and, western regions were 28 percent, 14.5 percent, and 13.6 percent respectively; and the increments in industrial production in the eastern region accounted for 77.5 percent of the total increments in industrial production. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, and Guangdong provinces alone made up 61 percent of the total increments in industrial production. According to accumulative figures compiled between January and April, the rates of growth of investment in fixed assets in state-owned units in the eastern, central, and western regions were 77.5 percent, 48.3 percent, and 46.4 percent. About 70 percent of the increments of investment in fixed assets in state-owned units were in China's eastern region, and 44.7 percent of such increments were in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, and Guangdong provinces. Reasons for Widening Regional Economic Differences There are objective reasons for the unbalanced development in China's different regions such as historical and natural conditions and so on. However, we must not neglect the influence of the macroeconomic policy on backward areas. From the financial resources point of view, the state has placed emphasis on the development of China's coast areas in the eastern region since the implementation of the reform and opening up policy. Large investments are made with excellent economic results. Meanwhile, attracted by the high financial returns, funds have unceasingly flowed to the coastal areas in Southeast China from various localities. Let us take Heilongjiang Province as an example. Cash flowed out of the province totalled 1.3 billion yuan during the first quarter of this year alone. In 1992, funds flowed out of Shanxi Province to the coastal areas in the form of loans and fund-raising reached 1 billion yuan. This flow of funds has provided the developed coastal provinces with ample funds for construction, while money supply falls far short of demand in backward regions. From the industrial structure point of view, the central and western regions are important ones where there are abundant resources of energy and raw and semi-finished materials. These regions also supply major production facilities. In these regions, prices and production are more strictly controlled by the state plans, and there are more mandatory plans for production targets, while the processing industry is not well developed. Within the industrial structure in the eastern region, the processing industry and the industry of consumer goods are given priority. Production is almost completely regulated by the market. There are less state mandatory plans for production targets, and prices are set by enterprises themselves. Under the current situation whereby the pricing structure has not been rationalized, the central and western regions provide low-price energy and raw materials, while paying higher price to buy processed products and consumer goods. This has created a form of exchange at unequal value with the eastern region. Funds are being transferred to the eastern region from the central and western regions, thus hampering the economic development in the backward regions. From the point of view of flow of professionally trained personnel, professionals and technical personnel have always been leaving the backward regions to the developed areas for the past ten and more years. Between 1983 and 1992, more than 5,000 technical personnel of all kinds have been transferred out of Ningxia through the normal procedure. Between 1990 and 1992, 6,638 cadres including 31 high-ranking and 566 middle-ranking professionals were transferred out of Xinjiang to work in other provinces. Among the transferred cadres, 56.4 percent of them were transferred to work in coastal cities, while 43.6 percent of them were transferred to work in large cities in China's interior provinces. The shortage of qualified personnel greatly affects the economic development and the process of modernization in central and western regions. Under the conditions of the socialist market economy, it is impossible for China's different regions to develop with the same speed. Adequate regional differences are conducive to arousing the enthusiasm of various localities to develop their own economy and compete with one another. However, if the gaps are excessively wide and are continuously widening to create "polarization," such gaps may adversely affect economic, political, and social stability. Therefore, a major task of the state in exercising macroeconomic control is to make use of economic, administrative and legal means to keep the regional differences within the limits that are acceptable by the society. Several Proposals 1. Encourage Central and Western Regions To Look for New Fields for Economic Growth First of all, we must vigorously develop town and township enterprises. Right now, 40 percent of per-capita peasants' net income in the country comes from non-farming industry, while 80 percent of such income in coastal developed areas comes from town and township enterprises. Meanwhile, the total output value in town and township enterprises in central and western regions accounts for less than 5 percent of that of town and township enterprises in the whole country. Therefore, the central and western regions must regard the development of town and township enterprises as an important measure to stimulate the economic development in these two regions and make use of local resources to manufacture their unique commodities. To further develop the economy in central and western regions, town and township enterprises there must undergo a stage of unusual development by leaps and bounds. Second, they must take advantage of their geographic superiority. Those backward areas in the border region have fine conditions to develop border trade. They must develop their local processing industry through border trade and turn their geographic advantage into industrial superiority and form an industrial structure that benefits both China and the neighboring country. Third, it is necessary to pay attention to commodity circulation and promote production. The scale of market affects the production scale. Thus, it also affects the economic scale. The key in promoting economic development is to attach importance to commodity circulation and marketing. The current major task of the central and western regions in paying attention to commodity circulation is to further improve the market structure. 2. Permit Central and Western Regions To Adopt More Flexible Measures in Implementing Policy on Ownership System. The ratio of the public economic sector, particularly the state-owned economic sector, is far greater in the central and western regions than that in the developed areas. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage the economic sector which is not state-owned, particularly the non-public owned economic sector, to develop itself. While making the state-owned economic sector predominant and regarding the public-owned economic sector as the mainstay, we must adopt all kinds of measures to promote the development of all other economic sectors. We should treat all other economic sectors on an equal basis. 3. Adequately Increase Investments in Central and Western Regions. Right now, China's eastern region is more capable of developing itself. The state may consider gradually shifting its investments westward, and increase investments in central and western regions with emphasis on communications, transportation, and energy, and raw material industries. While taking into consideration the mutual economic benefits in all regions, we must set up and develop a system of division of labor in various regions, encourage and support the processing industry with local raw materials, and force the processing industry in the eastern region to turn out more products with higher added value and high technology and export-oriented products in order to upgrade the industrial structure in China. 4. The State Must Not "Demand Uniformity in Everything" in Exercising Macro-Control. In exercising macroeconomic control, the state should give more preferential treatment to economically backward regions while taking into full consideration the actual situation in the backward regions where economic growth has just started and there are differences in economic development in different regions. The percentage of economic increments contributed by the backward regions is fairly small. These regions have little overall influence. If the measures adopted by the state in exercising macroeconomic control are excessively severe, they may deal severe economic blows to the backward regions, although their effects in cooling off the overheated national economy may not be so obvious. Many backward regions are worried that the policy and measures to "demand uniformity in everything" may "chop off the tails of the developed regions, while cutting off the heads of the backward regions" and that it will thus make the backward regions lose another opportunity to develop themselves.
