"It was very satisfactory, everything went smoothly," the Prime Minister said when he got off his plane at the Vnukovo Airport, Moscow, today after ending his Chinese trip. Chernomyrdin told XINHUA at the airport that he was very satisfied with the visit during which he met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng and seven bilateral agreements were signed. He stressed that Russia and China, both great countries, are embarking on reform. Though the two countries are different in their situations, they can help each other make up their deficiencies, he said. The cooperation between them, he added, will solve not only some of the issues that have appeared in the Asian and Pacific region but also many of those in the world.
