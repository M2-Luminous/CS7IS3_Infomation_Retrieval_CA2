Oleg Poptsov, the chairman of the All-Russian Television and Radio Company: [Begin Poptsov recording] I believe that this action cannot be seen as antistate or without logic. It is an apolitical action. When [Finance Minister] Dubinin says that someone should take political action but that he has nothing to do with it, I have to say that such a strange stance by the Finance Ministry of a state called Russia begins to puzzle me somewhat. We have to insure one thing, namely that when those people sitting in high office give their word, they use their professionalism, their authority, and their responsibility to keep that word. If you cannot give the money, give the freedom instead, but once you have given the freedom do not complain and do not claim to be governing the state. In other words, having renounced your obligations to finance television and radio, you have to renounce your right to govern both of them. Then other forces will govern them -- not the government and not the president. [end recording] [Announcer] Igor Golembiovskiy, the editor in chief of the IZVESTIYA newspaper. [Begin Golembiovskiy recording] The danger has arisen of a situation in which Russia television and radio could fall silent. In our paper we have called this situation a national disgrace. It is a simply ludicrous situation. Both the television and radio, at any rate those channels in question, are state ones. Thus the state bears full responsibility for their work. I do not think there is a country anywhere in the world that would deliberately take the path of severing all links with society, and this fact is evidence of the collapse of our government and the state.
