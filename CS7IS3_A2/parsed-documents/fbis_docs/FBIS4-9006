Jovanovic arrived on a brief informal visit to Sofia from Athens yesterday. A Yugoslav foreign minister was last in Sofia in 1993. Jovanovic and his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov today discussed some alarming aspects of the situation in the Balkans. Peace was very close several times last and this year but was sabotaged by Muslims (in Bosnia) and their foreign patrons, Jovanovic said after the meeting. Bulgaria and Yugoslavia are equally interested in a peaceful, fair settlement of the conflict. I believe bilateral relations will go ahead at full speed after lifting the sanctions; it would be in the interest of the two countries and of peace and security in the region, Jovanovic also told the press. No one ever proved Yugoslavia is to blame for the war in Bosnia- Herzegovina, said the Yugoslav foreign minister. The sanctions create a favourable climate for the emergence of extremist ideologies not only in the Balkans, according to Jovanovic. Meeting with Daskalov, he emphasized the importance of joint action in support of lifting the sanctions. Bulgaria so far has not committed itself to participation in such action but the sanctions have inflicted heavy losses on it and it is interested in their ending, said the Yugoslav guest. The two ministers discussed a proposal by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias for three Balkan states, including Bulgaria, to urge the UN to lift the sanctions. Expressing the Bulgarian stand, Daskalov said that Bulgaria will abide by the UN Secuirty Council resolutions despite damage to its economy. During their informal talks, that lasted for nearly three hours, Daskalov and Jovanovic discussed the issue of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and stands of its neighbours. The Bulgarian proposal for Macedonia's neighbours to issue a joint declaration recognizing that republic's borders and announcing the lack of any territorial claims, cannot be carried out at this stage, said Daskalov after the meeting. The Yugoslav foreign minister said Macedonia faced no threat from its neighbour to the north (Yugoslavia) but quite a few things needed yet to be done to establish goodneighbourly bilateral relations. The two foreign ministers differed on the issue of the Bulgarian minority in the Western Outlands (in Yugoslavia, former Bulgarian territories taken away under the 1919 Treaty of Neuilly). According to Daskalov, the rights of this minority are not strictly observed whereas Jovanovic said no rights violations have been recorded. The hardships ensuing from the sanctions, however, are forcing the Yugoslav authorities to curtail the rights not only of minorities but of all the people, the Yugoslav foreign minister told the press. In such cases, efforts are being made to compensate the minorities with exraordinary measures, he said. The autonomous region of Kosovo is not a party to the Yugoconflict, the Yugoslav guest told the press conference. Separatism, fueled by Albania, was kindled there long before the Bosnian conflict, he said. According to the Yugoslav minister, a spillover of the war into Kosovo should not be feared. The Yugoslav foreign minister assessed the Bulgarian policy on the Yugoconflict as objective. According to him, Bulgaria placed the three warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina on an equal footing. The transit of equipment for UN peacekeepers in Macedonia via Bulgaria is consistent with Bulgaria's stand of non-intervention in the Yugowar, as there is no war in Macedonia, said Jovanovic. (The Bulgarian Parliament appproved such a transit on April 15). Yugoslavia, however, takes a negative view of the military presence in Macedonia because of Skopje's unsupported claims of "a danger from the north," he said. No conflict exists between Macedonia and Yugoslavia; Macedonia is not facing any danger from the north and never has, the Yugoslav diplomat emphasized.
