Such is the outcome of Russian-South Korean talks which ended here on Wednesday. At the same time, Mikhail Fradkov, Russian first deputy minister for foreign economic relations, who leads the Russian delegation at the talks, told ITAR-TASS that "the normal negotiating process is underway, and the negotiations will be continued". Upon signing an agreement with the "Paris Club" of creditor countries in April last year on a rescheduling of the repayment of debts to the club member-states, Russia found itself in a situation in which it cannot settle with individual creditor countries, even non-members of club, including the Republic of Korea, on terms that would differ from those set by the Paris Club. The Russian side tried to convince the Seoul government of the need to accept a debt repayment schedule comparable with the Paris Club terms but South Korean financial agencies have not agreed to that so far. South Korea provided the Soviet Union with credits amounting to 1,470 million U.S. dollars of the promised 3,000 million dollars. Russia upon having confirmed the assumption of the former Soviet Union's international obligations, paid interest in cash and partially through the deliveries of aluminium ingots. However, following the Paris Club's debt rescheduling decision, the repayment of Russia's debts to South Korea was suspended. The amount of overdue payments as of the end of February was about 449 million U.S. dollars.
