Earlier, the researchers here demonstrated the expression of thermal shock proteins in mycoplasma, which has an extremely small genome and has no cell wall. Most types of mycoplasma populate mucosa surfaces in animals and man. In the work reported here, the researchers used labelling and immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies to thermal shock proteins 60 and 70 to study expression of thermal shock proteins. The study involved Acholeplasma laidlawii PG8, Mycoplasma pneumoniae FH, M. genitalium of the strain G-37 ATCC 33530, M. fermentans ATCC 19989, and M. fermentans of the incognitus strain. Cultures were grown at 32�C in a liquid medium to the middle of the exponential growth phase. Thermal shock was effected by changing the temperature to 42�C for two hours and then changing it back to 32�C for two hours. [.sup]35[/]S-methionine was added after the change to 42�C. The cells were centrifuged, washed with a PBS solution, and stored at -70�C until they were taken out for use. The synthesis of thermal shock proteins in the A. laidlawii cells was accompanied by accumulation that was apparent 20 minutes after temperature elevation and was at its peak 1 hour after the elevation. Proteins p17, p65, and p72 were clearly identified on electrophoregram and in radioautography. Densitometry indicated that the quantity of base thermal shock proteins in the cells increased after thermal shock to 4.2 percent from 0.8 for p72 and to 4.8 percent from 0.05 for p65, which is comparable with thermal shock protein accumulation in E. coli. The A. laidlawii cells produced a large quantity of low-molecular p17, which reached 7.2 percent of the total cell protein. Immunoblotting of proteins of several types of mycoplasma with polyclonal antibodies to total bacterial antigen showed that appreciable changes in thermal shock protein expression occurred in A. laidlawii and M. pneumoniae only.
