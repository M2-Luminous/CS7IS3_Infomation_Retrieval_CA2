FBIS4-28843 "dreas114_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 South Korea Official Warns About Expulsion Official Warns About Expulsion SK1406085794 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 0800 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1406085794 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [Text] It is predicted that the situation will develop into a grave phase if North Korea, which has declared its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], should go out of the way to expel two IAEA inspectors who are now staying in North Korea. A government official concerned warned: As a sovereign state, North Korea has the full freedom to withdraw from an international organization. If North Korea should expel the IAEA inspectors who are now staying in Pyongyang, however, this will not only be noncompliance with Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], but also a direct challenge to the UN Security Council (?exhorting) that inspectors be permanently stationed in Pyongyang. This will bring about a serious consequence. He also said: North Korea's duty to undergo IAEA nuclear inspections is not a requirement as a member of the IAEA, but as a party concerned to the NPT. Therefore, North Korea's latest measure is evaluated to be nothing but a political message simply aimed at achieving symbolic effects.
