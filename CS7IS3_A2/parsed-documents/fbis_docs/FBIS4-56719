We will talk with Bermudez, Papa Egoro candidate for vice president. Mr. Bermudez is here with us. [Bermudez] The party is just as glad as it was at the beginning. I think we did a very productive job. I wish to mention that only close to 43 percent of the voting sites have been accounted for. There is still nothing final. No final conclusion can be made before we have the final election results. It would be venturesome for any political party to claim victory without first having the total vote count. I wish to stress the need to remain as civically aware as we were today. This has been an extremely pure and beautiful election. But we should not jump to any conclusions before all of the voting sites have been accounted for. [Rosas] We understand that you talked with candidate Ruben Blades, who is in the headquarters making assessments. What does Blades think? [Bermudez] Blades has been in touch with us during his tour of the city. He should be arriving here any minute now to make remarks on the party position. [Rosas] The figures indicate it is very difficult for the party to improve its situation. Do you think Papa Egoro will eventually improve its position before the million vote figure is reached? [Bermudez] Since the beginning, Papa Egoro was a bastion of the party. We still do not know what percentage of the figures released represent Panama City. May I insist, however, 50 percent of the votes are still to be counted. We should not jump to conclusions at this time. [Rosas] Polls were conducted in the past few months among the several political parties. How do you correlate past polls with the figures released by the Electoral Tribunal? [Bermudez] May I reiterate that the Electoral Tribunal has not yet released the final figures. Still 50 percent of the vote must still be totaled. Regarding the national polls, it is worth noting the movement's progressive geometrical growth in the past one and one-half months. I am sure that, once all the votes are tallied, the movement's position will be seen much more clearly.
