This is believed to be the central message of a detailed strategy document to be considered today by the council of the National Farmers' Union [NFU] of England and Wales. The NFU's long-term strategy group, which produced the report, believes the recent GATT deal will lead to another shake-up of the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP] before 2000. "Current CAP policies are not going to increase consumption or bring down the production of cereals and beef sufficiently to allow the EU [European Union] to meet its obligations under the GATT settlement," it says. "EU farmers are approaching a fundamental policy choice." This runs counter to assurances from the European Commission and the UK government that no further fundamental change will be needed in sectors subject to current CAP reforms to comply with EU commitments under the GATT deal. The report is understood to rule out the option of exit bonds, under which current agricultural support systems would end overnight and farmers would be compensated with a fixed, finite payment, which would be tradeable. The strategy group says this could push up the EU's annual spending on agriculture -- currently ECU29 billion -- by 60-70 percent in the short term and would be politically unacceptable because it would lead to high rural unemployment. It also dismisses the extension of output quotas -- such as those on milk -- to new sectors, saying this would be complicated to administer and would conflict with the general reduction in government intervention in industry. The choice therefore, would be between tighter controls on inputs -- for example, by increasing the amount of set aside land or reducing the amount of nitrogen used -- or abolishing the link between support payments to farmers and their production levels. Farm incomes would be better protected under a system of input controls, assuming these would continue to be accompanied by subsidised exports and import tariffs. "But they may not be sustainable (beyond the l990's) if future GATT rounds force lower levels of border protection and export subsidies," says the report. The decoupling option would expose EU farmers to competition with world prices, putting the full burden of support payments on the taxpayer. The report suggests EU cereal prices could fall by a further 30 percent before reaching world price levels and that this might entail an unacceptably high level of compensation. The NFU plans to consult its 100,000 members, as well as the government, the wider agricultural industry, and other European farming groups, in the difficult task of achieving a consensus on future strategy.
