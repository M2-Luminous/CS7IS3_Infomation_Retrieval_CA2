Many JNP members still maintain that a parliamentary grouping with Shinseito--which is associated with shady Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] factional politics--as a partner will only undermine the JNP's public image, while others are concerned that this may lead to the breaking off of fraternal relations dating to the start of the Hosokawa administration with Sakigake [Harbinger], with which the JNP has agreed to enter into a merger in the future. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa merely told Toshio Yamaguchi, former minister of labor, who visited him at his official residence on 17 March, that "I will watch future developments closely." This circumspection is believed to be in consideration of the agitation in his own home camp. There has been a rush of expressions of discontent or concern, particularly among young JNP Diet members, over the emerging plan for the JNP and Shinseito to form a joint parliamentary group. Some say: "Even if the Diet members agree, what will the party members say?" Others claim: "If there should be a heated debate in the party, the prime minister's leadership will again be called into question. In the first place, it is anomalous that the other party leaders have not been informed." As JNP's relationship with Sakigake falls into disarray, JNP Diet members say: "When we go home to our constituencies, our supporters cheer us up and tell us 'carry on with your cooperation with Sakigake'." Within the party itself, the prevailing opinion is that the new group should at least consist of Shinseito, JNP, and Sakigake. A heated debate took place at the meeting of JNP Diet members on 17 March. One Dietman said, "Since we are a political party, decisions should be made by the proper organs. The decision to create a new-new party [shin shinto] with Sakigake was a policy adopted by the proper authorities." Another stated: "If this policy is to be changed, there will be a struggle between two lines." About 10 young JNP lower house members led by Yuichi Takami also met in Tokyo on the evening of 17 March into the early hours of 18 March to discuss how to deal with the realignment of political parties. This shows how seriously the JNP is distressed by the issue of forming a bigger parliamentary group. Regarding the proposed joint parliamentary group, the new JNP leadership also claims that, "It is not the prime minister's strategy to ally only with Shinseito. Such a claim is groundless." "What we have decided so far is to create a policy study group across party boundaries." The JNP leadership headed by Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka made it a point to explain at the joint standing committee meeting with Sakigake on 17 March that "[The proposal] came from Shinseito; we are not involved in this." However, Shinseito's Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa had met with all JNP members of both houses of the Diet as of 16 March. [During these meetings] Ozawa criticized Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura implicitly, saying "It is ridiculous that someone who does not have a clear concept of the state should advocate a so-called theory of the state." He argued that "the ruling coalition parties should join hands and work in unity under the leadership of Mr. Hosokawa." Nevertheless, some JNP members have a favorable impression of Ozawa. They say, "Mr. Ozawa's conviction that Japan should be changed came across quite saliently." On the other hand, there are also objections to Ozawa's remark at a meeting with JNP Diet members on the evening of 16 March that "(Shinseito) will be capable of nominating candidates for all 300 single-seat constituencies (on its own)." JNP members commented that "this is like being threatened with a dagger pointed at your throat." JNP members are beginning to feel that "perhaps the top leaders of the two parties are planning to form an alliance immediately" (according to a senior JNP official). Since the prime minister is the only viable symbol of the party, party officials admit that "the party will move in the direction the prime minister wishes." However, other party members also predict that "if there is no persuasive explanation on our relationship with Sakigake, some Diet members may purposely opt for the difficult way out."
