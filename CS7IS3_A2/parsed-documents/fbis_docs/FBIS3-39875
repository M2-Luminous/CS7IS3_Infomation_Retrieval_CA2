[Italian Popular Party ,PPI, Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli, in an editorial appearing in today's IL POPOLO, takes issue chiefly with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, albeit without naming him. "We are in a political desert," he writes, "which encourages the emergence of improbable demagogues and the resistible rise (or, rather, the resistible decline, as we say) of dubious saviors." To those "who want some order and certainty and who are scandalized by political corruption" and want "to entrust politics to those who have shown that they can manage their own affairs properly," Martinazzoli points out that "political responsibility isn't limited to the individual, but includes others, and requires a mature awareness of the common good." "The people," he writes, "are not merely an audience and do not deserve misleading messages" and "magic words." Next Martinazzoli expands his criticism and attacks "the supposed new faces which are often no more than masks." He also addresses the voters of the progressive alignment to "appeal for a return to common sense on the part of those who are rightly aware of the disingeniousness and dangers of a left which, without being able to say what it now stands for, presumes to occupy a stronger position only because it swears that it is no longer the same as before." The PPI leader asks whether current Italian politics "is moving in the opposite direction from what the country's interests require" and whether it is possible that "the `chaotic innovation' that has emerged, nurtured by decadence, is not the solution, but its final decline." "It is not only possible," the PPI secretary says, "but highly likely, unless the Italian people are helped to find a capacity for critical judgment and reflection." Martinazzoli speaks in terms of a "decline of a political vision" and of the "invasiveness of a disastrous mystification, incapable even of realistically representing the difficulties affecting our national community." "The formulas that we hear," he explained, "are only magic words, rashly used." His final wish is this: "What we do not want the Italian people to be reduced to measuring their political time on a clock with no hands."
