Group"] [Text] DASSAULT ELECTRONIQUE has concluded an agreement with the major shareholders of SOREP S.A. under which it will be taking over 2/3 of equity in SOREP S.A. SOREP, located at Chateaubourg, in the vicinity of Rennes, specializes in the development and production of hybrid circuits and ASICs for military, civil and space applications as well as for telecommunications and oil prospecting. Since its founding in 1978, SOREP has been an important partner of DASSAULT ELECTRONIQUE in microelectronic activities. In 1993, SOREP S.A. had a revenue of 101 million FF (period ending 31 August 1993). It is a 100-percent shareholder in the EDGETEK Co., 43 percent in ERULEC and 56 percent in SOREP Inc. in the U.S.A., in partnership with SCHLUMBERGER. The SOREP Group as a whole generates an annual revenue of nearly 230 million FF and employs around 450 persons. For the DASSAULT ELECTRONIQUE Group, this outside growth operation is the culmination of a long production partnership and complementary microelectronic action. The SOREP Group will keep its identity and independence and under this alliance will acquire new facilities to develop its own microelectronic service activities for the benefit of customers in France and other countries. The DASSAULT ELECTRONIQUE acquisition, made in complete agreement with the management of SOREP, will become effective during the month of January 1994.
