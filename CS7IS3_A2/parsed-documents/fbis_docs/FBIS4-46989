They Would Have Behaved Better in `High Society'"] [Text] People behave differently as guests, but even when they feel themselves "at home," it is only to up a certain limit. There are lines that are not to be crossed. These unwritten laws exist not only among Armenians. And we are not the ones who invented the saying "my home is my castle." And a castle has its own rules. In short, one does not bring his own samovar to Tula; when in Rome, do as the Romans do; and so on. There are no rules without exceptions, however. It is assumed that if you feed someone, this gives you certain rights. For fairness' sake, we should point out that this exception has become a rule not only here, but in every corner of one-sixth of the dry land. Here, however, unlike in other places, guests feel free to do things they perhaps would not dare to do even among Australian aborigines. I am talking about the most honored guests. Ambassadors. What Mr. Stupishin, the Russian Federation ambassador, felt free to do is well known. It only seems at the first glance that his attacks were aimed at our newspaper: It is obvious to everyone whose pain and concerns GOLOS ARMENII voices. In any event, those whose interests are described on our pages do not throw a feast amidst a plague, do not take advantage of the people's misery, do not buy up for peanuts art works or, for instance, silver, and do not pretend that the obvious wealth of some is the expression of well-being of all others. These people have no relation to the ruling circles, which does not mean at all that they do not have a right to life and their own viewpoint. In attempting to morally destroy them in one strike (and using the basest verbal cliches at that), the ambassador of Russia (we hope, though, an ambassador of only certain circles of it) already now, long before the beginning of the election campaign, attempted to wipe out a whole class of people who resist the current authority--which means lawlessness, an authoritarian regime, attempts at completely turning the country into a police state, and many other troubles, which constitutes everything we habitually still call life. Let us not talk about diplomatic etiquette and its expression in every particular case. When there is a street fight, good manners are dispensed with. And Mr. Stupishin needed so much to do publicly a service for the current Armenian authorities, which almost entirely absorbed the main inciters of anti-Russian sentiments, that he did get into this street fight, not noticing in the heat of servitude that he is turning into a color he likes to paint others with. But is he alone? Not too much time has passed since the kerosene benefactor, U.S. Ambassador Mr. Gilmore, decided to complement humanitarian aid with public statements that Armenia has the right authorities. We had barely had time to digest Bush's praise of Levon Ter-Petrosyan when the ambassador began to opine that those who, figuratively speaking, see even one spot on the bright sun of the AOD [Armenian National Movement], are wrong. The pro-Petrosyan lobby made of ambassadors thus became as run-of-the-mill a thing as, for instance, "all-people's support" for Yeltsin's resolve that manifested itself in the tanks shelling the Russian Supreme Soviet. The new world order, whose establishment is propped on the shoulders of both Yeltsin and Ter-Petrosyan, apparently also assumes a new function for diplomacy. Ambassadors are permitted, for instance, to interfere unceremoniously in the internal affairs of the countries where they are accredited, express their opinion on the subject of some or other political force or simply a group of people, exert pressure on the public opinion--which means on the formation of a political system. A convenient and useful one for them in every respect, of course. Any state that is bold enough to call itself sovereign, even for appearances' sake, should theoretically be upset over the diplomatic "liberties" and attempt to make it clear to the frolicking ambassadors that this sort of attitude at the very least is demeaning; such a natural protest, however, apparently has been dropped from the rules of behavior both by superpowers and by those who, having lost their tracks, cannot decide which republic--in a numeric count--of his country he is the head of. And since such simple things are still a subject for debate, there is nothing shameful in feeling free to drop a delicate hint or resort to very obvious dictat. Just recently, for instance, the French ambassador, Mme. d'Arteng, reproached Armenia that our republic had not been brave enough to start searching for new allies. But if one can somehow swallow such remarks, seeing them as a statement of a fait accompli and the diplomatic defeat of the ambassador herself, it is not clear why did Mme. d'Arteng would need to send our young men, who have already been in the war, to foreign countries, thereby condemning them to the status of "wild geese." Is it perhaps that the ambassador wants to protect the current regime from those who already are used to fighting evil by other methods and, given the current omnipotence of the police, will not feel comfortable? One can ask himself a lot of such questions. No answers will be forthcoming anyway. Everybody will do what they see fit to do. Without restraint. Actually, when one is surrounded by lawlessness, it is hard to expect that even ambassadors will behave themselves as they would in high society. And because of that, in all truth, their plot exudes too much of the local aroma.
