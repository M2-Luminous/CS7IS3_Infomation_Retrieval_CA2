It hit a low of 3 rands 67.5 cents against the dollar this morning. Reserve Bank intervention helped lift the rand to a slightly better close of 3 rands 66.33 cents to the dollar. However, it is still the weakest closing level ever. The rand also suffered a deep depreciation against sterling to trade at 5 rands 50.5 cents against the British currency. The rand was last close to this level in September 1992 when a crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism led to sterling losing heavily against the rand.
