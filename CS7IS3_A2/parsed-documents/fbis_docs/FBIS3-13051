The build-up came despite growing opposition in the main cities to any spread of violence, the YEMEN TIMES reported in its latest edition seen here. The English-language weekly published two maps showing where units loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner, and his southern rival, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, were being swelled by reinforcements. These moves could lead "at any time" to a "large-scale conflict", since there had been no political settlement to the seven-month-old crisis, the paper warned. North and South Yemen united in May 1990, but a crisis erupted last August when al-Bid refused to take up his duties in the northern capital Sanaa, demanding political, economic and security reforms. The armies of the two former states, which each have about 50,000 men, were never merged after unification. According to the YEMEN TIMES maps, rival units are facing each others in 'Amran, Ma'rib, Dhamar and Harib, in the northern part of the country. Clashes in the past two weeks in Abyan province have already killed more than 20 people and left dozens of others wounded, sources have said. It was here a few dozen kilometers (miles) east of Aden that the largest build-up appeared to be taking place despite a reconciliation agreement signed by Salih and al-Bid on February 20 in Amman, Jordan, the paper said. In the south troops were preparing for action in Qataba, Mukayras and near the port city of Aden, the former South Yemeni capital. The regular army units on each side were also counting on tribal support if a large scale war erupted. President Salih has already received the backing of the powerful Hashed tribal confederation, led by the Muslim fundamentalist Speaker of the Parliament Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar. And Vice-President al-Bid has deployed militiamen around Aden, and is being backed by the Bakil tribe, Hashid's rival. Witnesses have also reported seeing military equipment being regularly flown into Sanaa and Aden from abroad. The exact nature and origin of those equipment is still unknown. The recent build-up in war preparations prompted Sanaa university lecturers to launch a "popular resistance" movement last week to make the "politicians listen to reason." Hundreds of people in Sanaa, Ta'iz and Hudaydah, in the north, and Aden, in the south, have signed a petition opposing violence and demanding that the Amman agreement be implemented. And organisers say that it has won the support of some military officers from both sides. Several Yemeni leaders, including al-Bid, have also called for a "civil disobedience" campaign to resolve the crisis peacefully.
