So I would like to make a few remarks on the topic of that visit; these remarks will deal with some very important issues. Remark Number One: Contrary to some other journalists, it is not my view that the customs duties declared by the Russians (immediately after the visit) on many goods exported by Poland were intended to be a deliberate affront to the prime minister. These customs duties had been announced before, so the concurrence of the two events is merely a coincidence. But, as people surrounding the prime minister argued, if an improvement of the situation of Polish trade with the East was the main purpose of the visit, one must say that the situation is worse than it was before; ergo, the visit's main goal was not achieved. Remark Number Two: That disadvantageous effect was caused by a few serious things. First is the false view, which is shared by a few of the prime minister's advisers, several members of the government, and some Sejm deputies, that Poland's problems in its trade with the East are due to mistakes in policies committed by previous governments. That view is proof of ignorance of the real situation by those who espouse it and of their certain political pigheadedness, which it never pays to go by. It is enough to familiarize oneself with the problems faced by Finland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, France, and many other countries in their trade with Russia to be able to assess how true that argument really is. Our trade with Russia suffers from problems primarily due to Russia's economic collapse and the inability of the Russian financial system to service commercial activities. So one must look for ways to improve trade settlements between our two countries, but the visit did not result in any progress in this field. Remark Number Three: The trip was poorly prepared. It is a trivial thing to say that the prime minister of a country should not go on a trip to a country as important as Russia, whose relations with us have recently become quite difficult, if the signing of some minor protocols is to be the visit's only result. The point is that, if a trip is not well prepared or thought through, then, as a net result, it creates the impression of deterioration (which may not be justified) instead of bringing about an improvement. Remark Number Four: Every country in the world tries to avoid conveying the impression that its authorities are conducting several foreign policies that are independent and uncoordinated with one another. But that is exactly the kind of impression one is bound to have when the president learns from a television report about an important foreign trip by the prime minister. The point is neither in stressing pragmatic rules of bureaucracy and official behavior nor rules of courtesy that, after all, are indispensable and worth observing. The real point is that, when you have an official guest visiting a grand capital and the hosts can see that the guest failed to come to an agreement over the visit with other forces in his country, his position is weak and his credibility shaky. If elements of domestic infighting among different political parties become visible on the international level, it is the country itself that is harmed the most, but participants in these games are not strengthening their positions, either. On the contrary, they lose prestige, both domestically and internationally. Such are the iron and permanent principles in the arena of international politics, which are observed by all experienced players. One must say with sorrow here that the rules have been violated by Poland a few times in the past. The results of that are always disastrous. One Final Remark: Russian customs duties show that customs duties are a double-edged sword. Those in Poland who persistently speak in favor of protective customs duties ought to keep in mind that we are not living in a vacuum. It is no accident that the most reasonable politicians and economists around the world are in favor of the gradual elimination of customs barriers, or that the GATT agreement was signed, or that wars over customs duties and trade issues are regarded as considerably harmful. Poland, in turn, is a country that should be very eager to develop its exports. So we received several useful lessons this past week. Now the point is for us to get them into our heads, and fast.
