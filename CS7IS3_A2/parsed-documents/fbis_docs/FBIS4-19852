Ideological and strategic differences, internal jostling for power, and personal grudges created a split that, as time went by, created mutual obstacles in extreme right-wing party politics. An example of this effect is illustrated by the 19 September 1993 Hamburg municipal elections, where although extreme right-wing parties together gained a total of 7.6 percent of the votes, they failed to reach the 5-percent threshold on account of their competing candidacies, and thus failed to gain seats on the municipal council. The following survey permits a view of the development of the extreme right-wing political landscape. Without doubt the most significant extreme right-wing party today are the Republikaner, founded in 1983 as a right-wing Christian Social Union [CSU] faction, or "right of center" party, by the two former Bundestag deputies Franz Handlos and Eckhard Voight and the former television reporter Franz Schoenhuber. In subsequent years, there were hefty internal disputes among the Republikaner, caused by differences of opinion about the party's orientation. Whereas Handlos wanted the Republikaner to be a conservative alternative to the CSU, Schoenhuber wanted to orient the party in a similar direction to the French Front National. In the end, Schoenhuber had his way, which resulted in former activists from traditional extreme right-wing organizations joining the Republikaner and taking over leading Republikaner posts, for example Harald Neubauer. This political orientation also found increasingly clearer expression in the party's programs and publicity. Adjustments to these were made later, but they were dictated not by a wish to revise contents, but by tactical needs. Thus, Schoenhuber described a softening of tone in the program as a "verbal revision." The Republikaner want to appear as a serious party that is faithful to the constitution, said Schoenhuber. That is the only way they can have an influence on broad public opinion, according to him. Against Foreigners Since then, the Republikaner have avoided making extremist right-wing statements, which does not mean that they never make them. For instance, Schoenhuber approves of the Mussolini regime's economic policies between 1926 and 1930, and for his deputy Rolf Schlierer "the political distinction between friend and foe" is a typical structural element of extremist doctrine. In view of such views, the statements of senior Republikaner functionaries who have left the party's ranks come as no surprise. For example, former Republikaner general manager Centa Hirsch said that Schoenhuber does not want to turn the party into a modern right-conservative party, and that "instead of pursuing a path of overcoming violence," he stirs up aggression against foreigners with his public appearances. But normally, leader Republikaner functionaries proceed more carefully and formulate their political positions in such a way that they do not appear extremely right wing at first glance, but are capable of being interpreted that way. This tactical concession has nothing to do with an acceptance of the democratic principles of a law-governed country. Even the exclusion from the Republikaner of the group of former members of traditional right-wing extremist parties whom Schoenhuber himself invited to join the Republikaner is no indication of such an acceptance, this exclusion being a mere strategic option dictated by internal power struggles. In the 10 years of the Republikaner's existence, a total of 10 groups have broken away from the party to form parties of their own. In elections, support for the Republikaner has been fluctuating all the time. The party received 3 percent of the votes in the 1986 Bavarian Landtag elections, viewed as a "relative election success," but was unable to maintain this support in subsequent elections and received about 1 percent of the votes thereafter. Not until the elections to the Berlin Chamber of Deputies and the 1989 European elections did the party receive a surprising 7.5 percent and 7.1 percent of the votes respectively, which, needless to say, was followed by another ebb in support, with the party receiving only 2.1 percent of the vote in the 1990 Bundestag elections. According to their own figures, the Republikaner have 24,000 members. Even so, the party lacks a sufficient personal and organizational basis for its political activity, something which appears rather obvious when one views its parliamentary activity. In terms of political significance in the right-wing camp, the German People's Union [DVU] is in second place. It was founded in 1971 as an association, and was converted to a party in 1987. Between those two years its chairman, the Munich publisher Gerhard Frey, tried to establish a readership within the DVU of his extremist right-wing newspapers such as the DEUTSCHE NATIONALZEITUNG. When it appeared that election mandates might be quite profitable, Frey made a daring move and entered the world of (election) politics. In 1987, the DVU ran for the Bremen municipal elections with a massive publicity campaign, and received 3.4 percent of the votes. This result was followed by further successes in the north, 6.2 percent of the votes in the 1991 Bremen Landtag elections and 6.3 percent in the Schlewsig-Holstein elections. In most of the other elections, the party tended to suffer defeat, for instance at the 1989 Europe vote, where it only received 1.2 percent. The DVU Incapable of Action The DVU claims to have 26,000 members, but it has even less of a functioning structure than the Republikaner because it consists mostly of passive members. Even inside the Bundestag the DVU has completely inexperienced and incompetent deputies who receive their instructions from party headquarters in Munich. Individual DVU fractions have disintegrated relatively quickly on account of internal disputes, so that continuous parliamentary activity is also impossible for this reason. The DVU's ability to act depends almost exclusively on one factor -- its chairman's finances. Programatically, the DVU has virtually nothing to say. The program consists of a single A4 sheet of paper with 12 vague points. The National Democratic Party of Germany [NPD], the oldest extremist right-wing party, forced in 1964, also possesses little more significance in its own political camp. It was incapable of following on from its elections successes in the second half of the 1960's, and achieved only sporadic low-level election successes, for example 2.1 percent of the votes at the 1988 Baden-Wuerttemberg Landtag elections. As a result of the decades of defeat, more and more activists quit the NPD as time went by, so that today the NPD is one of the few extremist right-wing groups that does not claim to have any popularity. The NPD claims to have only 5,000 members left. The exodus of members is encouraged by the policies of its chairman, Guenther Deckert, who wants to gear the party to traditional political concepts and harbors unofficial contacts with neo-Nazi activists. The German League Many ex-NPD officials organized themselves into yet another extremist right-wing party, the German League for People and Homeland [DL], in 1991. The DL's declared purpose was to cement together the disintegrated political landscape. Relatively well-known former officials from the above-mentioned parties joined the DL within a short period of time, but the DL's actual objective was never reached. On the contrary, the DL's existence has led to a further disintegration of the extreme right-wing political landscape. The DL is represented in the European Parliament by Republikaner deputies, but with its 800 members and completely nonexistent party structures, except in a few regional centers, it is of hardly any significance whatsoever. In addition, there are a few neo-Nazi formations that possess party statutes, such as the Free Workers Party of Germany [FAD], but have been classified as pressure groups on account of their own view of themselves. No Unity Despite their similarity, the extreme right-wing organizations do not form a united political bloc. The personal grudges of their chairmen, each party's insistence on its own independence, and ideological and strategic differences have supposedly prevented these organizations from gathering within a single bloc. In any case, the era of opposing election blocs of extremist right-wing parties seems to be over, as suggested by the results of the Hamburg elections. In Hamburg, the Republikaner succeeded for the first time in outstripping their election competitors on their own territory. The DVU was incapable of making any impression in these elections because it lacks a functioning party structure and because it is permanently geared to the role of an election party. The NPD, DL, and FAD are of no significance in any case. In the future, the extremist right-wing vote could go to the Republikaner.
