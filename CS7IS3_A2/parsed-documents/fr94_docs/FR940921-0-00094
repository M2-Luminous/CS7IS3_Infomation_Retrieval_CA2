FR940921-0-00094 FR940921-0-00016 42. Section 86.104 of subpart B is amended by redesignating paragraph (b) as paragraph (c) and revising it, and adding a new paragraph (b) to read as follows: §86.104 Section numbering; construction. * * * * * (b) A section reference without a model year suffix refers to the section applicable for the appropriate model year. (c) Unless indicated otherwise, all provisions in this subpart apply to petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles. 43. Section 86.105 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: §86.105 Introduction; structure of subpart. * * * * * (b) Three topics are addressed in this subpart. Sections 86.106 through 86.115 set forth specifications and equipment requirements; §§86.116 through 86.126 discuss calibration methods and frequency; test procedures and data requirements are listed in §§86.127 through 86.157. 44. Section 86.106&hyph;94 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §86.106&hyph;94 Equipment required; overview. (a) This subpart contains procedures for exhaust emissions tests on petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and for evaporative emission tests on gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Certain items of equipment are not necessary for a particular test, e.g., evaporative enclosure when testing petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. Alternate sampling systems may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator. Equipment required and specifications are as follows: (1) Evaporative emission tests. The evaporative emission test is closely related to and connected with the exhaust emission test. All vehicles tested for evaporative emissions must be tested for exhaust emissions. Further, unless the evaporative emission test is waived by the Administrator under §86.090&hyph;26, all vehicles must undergo both tests. (Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from the evaporative emission standard.) Section 86.107 specifies the necessary equipment. (2) Exhaust emission tests. All vehicles subject to this subpart are subject to testing for both gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions using the CVS concept (§86.109), except where exemptions or waivers are expressly provided in subpart A of these regulations. Vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' (i.e., phase-out) standards described under subpart A are exempted from testing for methane emissions (except natural gas-fueled vehicles). Otto-cycle vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' standards are waived from testing for particulates. For vehicles waived from the requirement for measuring particulate emissions, use of a dilution tunnel is not required (§86.109). The CVS must be connected to the dilution tunnel if particulate emission sampling is required (§86.110). Petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicle testing requires that a PDP-CVS or CFV with heat exchanger be used. (This equipment may be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles; however, particulates need not be measured for vehicles that are waived from the requirement). All gasoline-fueled, methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquified petroleum gas-fueled vehicles are either tested for evaporative emissions or undergo a diurnal heat build. Petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles are excluded from this requirement. Equipment necessary and specifications appear in §§86.108 through 86.114. (3) Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications. Fuel specifications for exhaust and evaporative emissions testing and for mileage accumulation are specified in §86.113. Analytical gases are specified in §86.114. The EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) for use in exhaust emissions tests is specified in §86.115 and Appendix I of this part. * * * * *
