Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Hiroyuki Yushita and Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam exchanged documents on the loan and the grant in Hanoi, the officials said. The loan is for seven projects to improve infrastructure related to power supply and transportation, and to pay for equipment to repair roads and waterworks, they said. The aid is to support Vietnam's efforts at economic reform and to shift to a market-oriented economy under its policy of "doi moi" or renovation, they said.

Another grant of 65 million yen will be used for a project to improve waterworks in northeastern Hanoi.
