FR940913-1-00028 FR940913-1-00012 Finally, at present, ยง582.5 states that to determine the actual premium that a consumer will be charged for insuring a particular vehicle or for complete information about insurance premiums, the consumer should contact insurance companies directly. In this proposed rule, NHTSA proposes that ยง582.5 be revised to advise the consumer to contact insurance company agents directly. Amending the text to advise the consumer to contact the insurance company agents directly, reflects the fact that the consumer's first point of contact with insurance companies is the insurance company agent. Regulatory Impacts 1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action and has determined the action not to be ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. The agency has determined that the economic effects of the proposed amendments are minimal, so that a full regulatory evaluation is not required. This NPRM proposes minor amendments to the insurance cost information regulation, so that the information to be provided to potential motor vehicle purchasers is more accurate. Assuming these proposals are adopted, any extra text that must be included in the information booklet would be minuscule. 2. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this notice of proposed rulemaking on small entities. NHTSA estimates there are about 24,000 dealers of new passenger motor vehicles. Many of the dealers would be considered small entities, that may be affected by this proposed rule. However, NHTSA believes that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of these small dealers. The rationale is that this rulemaking proposes minor editorial changes, resulting in a small amount of extra text in the insurance cost information booklet. The potential cost increments associated with this proposed rule should have negligible effects on the purchase price of new passenger motor vehicles. For these reasons, I certify that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 3. National Environmental Policy Act In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the agency has considered the environmental impacts of this proposed rule and determined that if made final, it will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. 4. Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12623, and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 5. Civil Justice Reform This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect, and it does not preempt any State law. Chapter 323_ Consumer Information of 49 U.S.C. does not provide for judicial review of rules issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 32302. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq. , provides generally for judicial review of final agency action, which in certain circumstances may include this proposed rule. The Administrative Procedure Act does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. Procedures for Filing Comments NHTSA solicits public comments on the issues presented in this notice. It is requested, but not required, that 10 copies be submitted. All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21.) Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15 page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion.
