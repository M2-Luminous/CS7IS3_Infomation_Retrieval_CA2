After underscoring that this Atlantic choice had created "a community of ideals and of interests which allowed our nations to progress in prosperity and in security", Fabbri added that the European nations, "lacerated by war, found in NATO a decisive element for overcoming ancient divisions and for establishing strong mutual confidence". For Fabbri, even in the new European geo-political context which, he stressed, to a great extent was itself "the fruit of Atlantic policies in the face of the totalitarianism's challenges", NATO has confirmed its "indispensable role of defense and as a factor of security and peace". He recalled the fundamental contribution made by the accords for nuclear and conventional disarmament, the stabilizing effects of the opening to the new democracies of central and eastern Europe, and the missions carried out in Bosnia and in the Adriatic for the United Nations. The Italian armed forces, which for four decades have been an active and dedicated part of the Atlantic military instrument, will continue to provide their decisive contribution to NATO, taking part in the common defense and in peace missions, Fabbri continued in his message. Furthermore, those Atlantic values which were at the base of Italy's choices for civilization and peace will find themselves ever more grounded and ever more suffused within Italian society, he concluded.
