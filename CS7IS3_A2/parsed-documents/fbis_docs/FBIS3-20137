Rasit stated that the Turkish Cypriot side expects all relevant parties to act in goodwill at the very least. The foreign minister announced that the accusations leveled by European Union Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek, who visited south Cyprus, against the Turkish Cypriots with regard to the confidence-building measures triggered amazement and regret in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. In a statement to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency], Rasit remarked that the departure statement issued by Van Den Broek, who did not feel the need to visit the Turkish Cypriot sector or listen to the views of Turkish Cypriot officials, is highly unfortunate on the part of those who claim they want to contribute to a lasting and just solution in Cyprus. Given the goodwill and positive attitude demonstrated by the Turkish Cypriot side throughout the negotiating process, Rasit said, such prejudiced statements issued after listening to the views of only one side, at a time when efforts are being exerted to eliminate the difficulties created by the new elements introduced with the aim of satisfying Greek Cypriot Administration leader Kliridhis and the Greek Cypriot side, greatly damage the ongoing negotiating process. In a statement yesterday, Van Den Broek charged that the Turkish Cypriot side is pursuing an intransigent policy on the implementation of the confidence-building measures.
