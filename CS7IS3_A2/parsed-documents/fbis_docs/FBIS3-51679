President Gaviria, at the head of the list, did not spare words in rejecting the guerrillas' actions, and he also announced that military mayors could be appointed in the region in the next days. [Begin recording] [Gaviria] It is cowardly and knavish to kill poor people who reentered civilian life after the Chinita invasion [not further identified] in Apartado. [Unidentified reporter] Is there a possibility that military mayors will be appointed in this region? [Gaviria] Those are decisions that will be made in the coming days. [Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party presidential candidate] Those of us who are in politics and want to do a good job are very concerned with the events. It is not only regrettable that they are occurring in the country, but it is also important that they be totally clarified. [Humberto de la Calle, Liberal Party presidential candidate] I believe the situation is very serious. I believe this has been the worst or one of the worse things that has happened to us on the road to achieving peace. The possibilities of ever achieving it dwindles if the people who abandon their weapons cannot obtain protection from the government or citizens. [Monsignor Pedro Rubiano] The Uraba massacre merits the rejection of the entire country. Heaven cries out for the blood of those innocent peasants and workers. [Senator Enrique Gomez] National sovereignty does not exist in that area; the public force is totally inefficient. Justice has disappeared, and the government's total lack of command is unjustifiable. [Barranquilla Mayor Bernardo Hoyos] Why can't the Colombian Government understand that the violence in the country cannot be solved from Bogota? [end recording]
