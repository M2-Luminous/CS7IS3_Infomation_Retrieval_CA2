It was established during the preliminary investigation that the crooks used as loan collateral property that was allegedly theirs--a private home. At first the documents on the house did not raise any suspicions among the bank employees. However, finally the loan repayment dates passed, and it came out that the collateral existed only on paper and the house itself had long been razed, which the swindlers, who had by then skipped town, of course did not tell the bankers. Another entrepreneur, the founder and director of four AOZT's [privately held joint-stock company], has managed to get large loans three times, using as collateral one and the same timber purchasing contract. The bank, which did not figure out the trick until it was too late, lost R420 million. The millionaire is wanted by the militia. Several more St. Petersburg banks have sustained losses from a similar scheme. They reported their claims against the AO [joint-stock company] Kronverk to the Regional Directorate for the Suppression of Organized Crime [RUOP]. The RUOP has not yet determined, however, whether there is criminal content in the actions of the company's founders V.Ye. Nevyakin, O.B. Nelyubin, and O.B. Philippov. In August 1993 the Kronverk company took out a short-term loan from the Sberbank [Savings Bank]--R400 million for three months at 180 percent annual interest rate, to buy industrial casein. As a guarantee of timely and complete repayment of loan, the borrower transferred its property to the Sberbank as collateral. The AO Kronverk's woodworking, ventilation, and electrical equipment at its production facility, several hangars, a casein line, vehicles, and office equipment were appraised at R712 million. When the loan term expired, the Sberbank attempted to find its client. In vain--there was no answer at either Kronverk's telephone or fax numbers: the company had moved from the facility it previously occupied at 56 Bolshaya Morskaya to an unknown address, while its general director V.Ye. Nevyakin had left Russia... The bank staff turned to the Vitabank, which had recommended Kronverk as a borrower and handled the company's operating account, asking whether the client ever showed up at the bank at all. Vitabank never replied to the inquiry. And, as the Sberbank staff infer, apparently not just out of considerations of confidentiality. According to Sberbank's security service, Vitabank is the first in line among creditors to recover the debt from Kronverk. And it is unlikely that everybody's claim will be satisfied, since Kronverk also received in the same manner hundreds of millions rubles from the St. Petersburg bank, the Murmansk Bank, and even the American corporation Met International. The Americans were the first to determine that they were a "victim of an international financial machination" and turned to the commercial arbitration court under the Russian Federation Trade and Industry Chamber. Our compatriots are in no hurry to run to court, and for quite understandable reasons. In order to get out of Kronverk the loan, interest, fines, and penalties totalling R1.5 billion, Sberbank alone will have to pay court costs of R150 million. Most likely it will win the case. As will the other creditors. But how to actually get the money? "We have information from the law enforcement organs that Mr. Nevyakin is currently in Poland," we were told by the Sberbank security service. "He is apparently close to government circles and Lech Walesa. He allegedly is putting together a fund for aiding Russian entrepreneurs. There is rumor that he has a personal security detail that consists of four former officers of Polish state security... The Kronverk incident is not unique. The bank suffers not only when someone literally walks away with a loan, but also when loans are not repaid 'peacefully.' Nobody will probably doubt the soundness of such enterprises, well-known in the city, as the Vityaz restaurant chain, the UniRem company, or the Goryachev concern. Meanwhile, we have been trying for many months to get them to repay in full our loans, and it is not easy. Quite understandably, a businessmen does not always become a hardened delinquent by criminal intent. Some are let down by business partners; some are victims of crooks; some simply lack entrepreneurial acumen. But this does not make it easier for the bankers--their interests are far from fully protected by the current legislation in the credit-financial sphere. Knowing this, the boldest ones do not refuse their good friends (of course, on terms mutually profitable for both parties in the deal) large loans, which also are not always repaid. The law enforcement organs often encounter such abuse on the part of bankers and financiers, who later themselves became victims if not of a crime then at least of unlawful actions. Such incidents have happened in our city, too. For fairness' sake it should be noted that the State Duma has already adopted amendments to the Criminal Code which will make entrepreneurs share the culpability of officials under such articles as, for instance, bribery, negligence, and abuse of official position. As to insolvent clients, so far the law does not envisage jail as a punishment measure for them. And they take advantage of this. Commentary by the Legal Department of the St. Petersburg Bank of the Sberbank of Russia Current legislation has a number of gaps which allow the borrower to "effectively" use credit resources received from a bank he does not "plan" to repay. For instance, according to the existing statute on joint-stock companies, the minimum charter capital is set at R10,000 and has not been revised. Thus, a Russian limited liability partnership puts at risk a negligible amount of charter capital. For comparison: The minimum charter capital of a limited liability partnership (GmbH) in Germany is DM50,000. Another pitfall. Any company may participate as a founder in setting up another company. A mandatory point included in the charter documents is that the founder cannot be held liable for the debts of the enterprise being set up, and vice versa. Liability also is limited by the size of the charter capital, or the amount of capital contributed by the founder company in the new enterprise. Thus, in this situation, too, the risk to the "borrower" and his guarantor is minimal. Next. St. Petersburg's rayon administrations still register enterprises at "convenience" legal addresses, most often using as such the rayon administration's own address. Or similar services are offered by companies set up either with direct participation or with the "blessing" of these administrations. This problem surfaced for the first time when the search was on for the notorious Amaris, Business-Navigators, and other enterprises registered precisely in this way. For instance, one can still find dozens, or even hundreds, of firms registered at the same address--such as 176 Nevskiy Ave., 4 Boytsov Lane, 26/28 Kamennoostrovskiy Ave., or 50 Mayakovskiy St. The city procuracy has already issued a separate opinion on this issue, which it has submitted to St. Petersburg mayoralty; however, as they say, the cart has not moved an inch. Another problem. The "Law on Collateral," which was adopted and in keeping with which various types of property--land, real estate, goods, and so on--may be used as collateral to secure the repayability of a loan, in real terms does not work. State organs whose job is to register collateral (for instance, GAI [State Motor Vehicle Inspection] regarding using a car as a collateral, the Property Fund for real estate collaterals, and so on) do not carry out this function. The "Rules for Registration of Tractors, Tractor Hitches, Self-Propelled Road Construction and Other Vehicles Subject to Registration by the State Technical Oversight [STO] Organs of the Russian Ministry of Agriculture," approved by the Russian Federation Ministry of Agriculture and coordinated with the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance, for all practical purposes are not in effect in St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg currently has an STO regional branch, which does not conduct any registration work. Apparently the time has come to also bring up to the legislative authority the question of entrepreneurs' personal responsibility for their loan obligations, and not just to the limit of the charter capital of his enterprise but personally, since it is the entrepreneur who is the owner and master of his enterprise.
