The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Japanese Government "strongly regrets" that civilians were victims in the attack and offered its sympathies to their families. "Japan strongly condemns this kind of terrorism by some extremists, which is aimed at obstructing the peace process," the statement said. Japan also regrets that Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) have not yet agreed on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho despite an historic declaration on principles on self-rule last September in Washington. The declaration stipulated the deadline for completion of the withdrawal as April 13. Japan will continue to support the peace process, the statement said.
