Now that armed and organized criminals are brazenly trying to establish their rules in the country and unleash terror, curbing organized crime is becoming a task of the greatest importance, he told the Collegium of the Prosecutor-General's Office on Thursday. "In fact, we are faced with the question of who will bring down whom to their knees: the state the mafia, or the mafia the state," he said. He demanded that the task of combating crime and coordinating the work of the law- enforcement bodies be given priority attention. He said the emergency measures, set forth in the decree, did not at all imply the neglect of the constitution or the law. On the basis of the available opportunities the state must curb the criminals and apply the new laws to them in all their strictness, he said. "We are well aware of the real possibilities of criminal reprisals and do not consider them a panacea in our struggle against crime. However, in the current setting, the punitive power of the law must be used fully and without hesitation," said Ilyushenko. He said he could understand society's concern about possible malpractices during the implementation of the decree and admitted that the law-enforcement bodies had violated the laws in many instances lately, acting in an arbitrary way. He said that the measures proposed in the decree were aimed at attaining a real breakthrough in the struggle against crime, not at violating human rights, and that the main gaol of the decree was to protect the citizens from organized terror. He proposed ensuring strict control over the observance of laws during the implementation of the presidential decree. According to his sources, compared to 1989 the crime rate has more than doubled in Russia. A total of 2.8 million crimes, including 500,000 serious ones, were committed in 1993. Among them were 30,000 premeditated murders, 67,000 serious injuries and more than 220,000 robberies. Over the first five months of 1994, 1.94 million crimes were committed, including 216,000 serious crimes, said Ilyushenko.
