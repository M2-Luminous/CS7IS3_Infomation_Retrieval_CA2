FBIS3-12518 "drnes041_m_94002" FBIS-NES-94-041 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Mar 1994 JORDAN Statements Urge Suspension of Arab-Israeli Talks JN2702135694 JN2702135694 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Jordanian newspapers have for the second day continued to extensively highlight various local, Arab, and world reactions to the 25 February massacre at the Hebron Ibrahimi Mosque. Statements made by various Jordanian and Palestinian parties and organizations are either reported or published in full. Condemnation of the massacre is overwhelming and most published statements call on the Palestinians and Arabs to pull out of the Arab-Israeli talks. Some call for jihad and revival of armed struggle while others call for retribution and revenge. A statement by the "popular and political key figures" in the al-Tafilah Governorate, published as an advertisement on page 38 of the 27 February issue of Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic and signed by four Jordanian parties and six al-Tafilah unions and societies reads in part: "At a time when the Arab regimes and the leadership dominating the PLO are bargaining over Palestine, presenting it to the Jews as an easy morsel through the conferences of capitulation, the ugliest of crimes of murder, imprisonment, banishment, and displacement are being perpetrated against our people and brothers in Palestine. "The crime perpetrated by the spiteful Zionist gangs against the sons of our people in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, in which approximately 400 Muslims were martyred or wounded, confirms the criminal nature of these gangs -- the sons of monkeys and pigs. In the name of the popular figures and political parties in the al-Tafilah Governorate, which rejected and continue to reject the policies of capitulation to the Zionist entity, demand an end to the current negotiations with the enemy on all levels and the adoption of jihad and struggle for the liberation of Arab Palestine." The advertisement is signed by the Islamic Action Front, the Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity Party, the Jordanian People's Democratic Party, the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, al-Tafilah Cultural and Sports Club, al-Tafilah branch of the Engineers Union, al-Tafilah Charity Society, al-Harith Bin-'Umayr al-Azdi Society, al-Tafilah branch of the Jordanian Red Crescent Society, and al-Tafilah branch of the National Union of Jordanian Youth. A statement by the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, published within a report on other reactions on page 12 of the 27 February issue of Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic says: "We in the Muslim Brotherhood emphasize that the Hebron massacre, along with the outcome of negotiations in Cairo and Taba where there is full capitulation to the Zionists, confirm the course in which our movement has always believed; namely, the escalation of armed struggle and all forms of resistance against occupation as the only option for the restoration of the usurped rights. Hence, we call on the PLO and all the Arab states, particularly Jordan, to immediately withdraw from the negotiations. We call on the PLO to return to the option of resistance and armed struggle and abandon the course of negotiations and concessions which left nothing else to cede and which will open the door for the Zionists to enter our Arab capitals to consecrate the state of usurpation that is dominating the entire region. While urging the masses of our Palestinian people and their struggling forces, headed by the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, and its mujahid battalions to burn the ground under the feet of the occupiers, we stress the need for the solidarity of all sectors of our people and nation outside with their brother mujahidin on the land of al-Isra' [Palestine]. We also call on all popular, Islamic, and national bodies in the Islamic states to express their indignation and denunciation of the appalling crime. We also call for a continuous drive to raise funds for the mujahidin in the territories to be undertaken by the Islamic movements and popular forces in these states." A statement by the Jordanian Democratic Arab Islamic Movement Party, published within the same report, but on page 13 of the same issue of AL-DUSTUR calls for suspending negotiations with "the Zionist enemy" and for holding an Arab summit conference in Mecca during the next hajj season to boost Arab ties and draw up a unified Arab strategy to extend unlimited support for the people in the occupied territories and "reactivate national struggle and jihad against the usurping enemy there." A boxed statement published on page 15 of the 27 February AL-DUSTUR reads as follows: "Urgent Appeal to Our Mujahid Battalions of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam and to All Armed Groups of All Palestinian Factions: Hamas calls on its jihad battalions--the heroic battalions of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam and all armed and military groups of the Palestinian factions to reply and in the strongest possible manner to the ugly massacre and avenge our righteous martyrs. "Let all operating units in the mujahid al-Qassam battalions and all struggling groups be placed on maximum alert and a state of emergency be declared. Let urgent military plans be drawn up to strike at the Zionist targets, the occupation troops, and the hordes of settlers. "Let today and all coming days be days of violent revenge and decisive reply to the ugly crime. "God is greater than the machinations of the aggressor. "Friday, 15 Ramadan 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 25 February 1994. "The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, Palestine, the Information Bureau."
