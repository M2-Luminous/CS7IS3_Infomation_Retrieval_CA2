The overall trend of development is good, but there is no denying that some people have gone to bizarre lengths to celebrate their New Year, holding extravagant functions to cultivate social relations with a view to furthering their interests, or even pursuing illegal activities. In line with social progress, we must establish a new concept for the New Year. We must establish a new "thrifty New Year" concept. Recently, reform and opening up have raised people's living standards considerably and have increased their consumption power. A certain number of regions and people seem to have forgotten how all this came about and have become extravagant, holding banquets to celebrate the New Year and festivals, trying to outspend each other. This "nouveau riche" demeanor is absolutely wrong. We must see the rapid development of our economy, as well as the fact that there still are people who have not solved the problem of getting enough to eat and clothe themselves with, and that millions of students are unable to pay their tuition fees. Horizontally speaking, we still lag behind many countries. Vertically speaking, our foundation is not yet solid. Granted, we will be very rich in the future, but we still should uphold the good traditional morals of hardwork and thriftiness and the good style of arduous struggle. Individually, most of us earn our income through toil. Throwing away the money earned through daily labor on a spending spree is unfortunate, unnecessary, and not worth it. We must establish a new "stay-clean" New Year concept. During the Spring Festival, it is only normal for units to visit each other to boost relations, and for individuals to visit relatives to renew and strengthen friendship. A few units and individuals, however, may give gifts under the cover of the festive season and at the expense of the state or may bribe people under the cover of social calls, to the extent of breaking the law. This is abnormal and must be halted firmly. Encouraging clean government is part of the agenda of socialist spiritual civilization and must be pursued through unyielding efforts. During the Spring Festival, the broad mass of the people must be highly self-disciplined; party and government cadres of all ranks should practise what they enforce, set a good personal example, refuse to give or accept bribes or to take advantage of anyone, and set an example of "clean government" for the people. We must establish a new "civilized" New Year concept. Over the years, socialist spiritual civilization has improved people's spiritual lives greatly, but we must see that certain unhealthy practices always surface at the Spring Festival. People play mahjong, gamble, worship ancestors, disseminate superstitious beliefs, and socialize to extend kinship networks -- all unhealthy, uncivilized activities in that are out of tune with the happy festive atmosphere. Another meaning of celebrating a "civilized" New Year is to voluntarily observe law and discipline, lead an orderly life, and be a civilized passenger, audience, and worker, and in short, a civilized citizen. We must establish a new "planned New Year" concept. In traditional Chinese customs, the Spring Festival is the beginning of a new year. It does not harm us to sit down and review the past and take a look at the future; to see what we achieved and did not achieve last year, and sum them up; and to outline the work and objectives for next year. Thus, we really can "make a step of progress with the passing of another year." Spring is the time to plan for the whole year. In the history of our civilization, the Spring Festival is the most important of all festivals. It takes place in spring -- at the start of a year. Therefore, it is highly significant for us -- a populous, not so wealthy developing country -- to celebrate the New Year properly. To do that, we must establish a New Year concept that corresponds with the times. That is only the first step. The most important is practice. The 1994 step is approaching. Here I wish everybody a happy, harmonious, comfortable, and healthy New Year!
