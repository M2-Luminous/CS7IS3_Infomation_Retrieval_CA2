The Foreign Ministry confirmed reports today by the Hamburg news magazine DER SPIEGEL and by Sueddeutscher Rundfunk that three complaints against Germany had been lodged with the Human Rights Commission. [passage omitted] The Foreign Ministry expressly denied that Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel would attend the meeting of the Commission in Geneva in connection with the complaints. SPIEGEL reports that the Commission's 53 member states will deal with "complaints about xenophobic activity in Germany" at their meeting in Geneva on 31 January. The Foreign Ministry remarked that it was "highly unusual" that a Western state was facing charges of this kind. Sueddeutscher Rundfunk also reported that a confidential examination was being carried out into allegations of xenophobia by a group of teachers from Thuringia who had not been admitted to the civil service. There was also a complaint by prisoners who said they were not receiving enough pay for their work in prison.
