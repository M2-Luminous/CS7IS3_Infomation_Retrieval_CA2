The key to gaining a clear understanding of the new situation, facing up to the new topic, and speeding up the pace of military legislation lies in leadership. First, we should deepen our understanding, upgrade our conceptions, and consider military legislation as an important item on the agenda of the party committee. In the course of reform, the tried and proven methods of doing things should be affirmed in the form of laws, the achievements of reform and opening up to the outside world should be consolidated, and decisionmaking on reform should be closely combined with decisionmaking on legislation. Before establishing or reforming things, we should try to enact and apply laws. We should ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization, as well as laws. To put it another way, we should "enact laws as far as possible before we act." This is a major change not only in China's legislative thinking but also in its leadership conception and method. Military laws and regulations, which are the embodiment of the will of the state and the Army, are highly authoritative, mandatory, and stable and have great significance in guiding, promoting, and ensuring the state and army building. Leaders of all departments should regard the enactment of military laws and regulations as an important task. Second, we should do a good job of three things: Tasking, organization, and ensuring completion of the task within the time prescribed by the legislative plans. The Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress stated: "The units assigned the task of drafting laws which failed to accomplish their tasks by the scheduled time should promptly submit a report to the Standing Committee with explanations." This requirement is also applicable to the Army. Once legislative projects are determined by the legislation plan, the drafting departments should ascertain the task, organization, and time limit, play close attention to the drafting of laws, and submit the draft laws to the higher authorities for examination and approval. Those which fail to do so should write a report to the Military Commission with explanations. Third, we should select cadres and assign them the task of drafting military laws and regulations and place great stress on improving the quality of drafting military laws and regulations. Drafting military laws and regulations is an important task dealing with theory, practice, policy, and professionalism. The drafted articles should be in line with the party's line, principles, and policies, complementary to the national condition and the reality of the Army, and should be made, as far as possible, practical, clear, detailed, and easy to implement. As such, the personnel drafting military laws and regulations should be strong, have a good mastery of professional work, and an intimate knowledge of laws. At the same time, they should have a desire to work and be good writers. Law drafters should adhere to an important principle: Proceeding from the overall situation of national defense and army building, submitting local interests to overall interests, and conscientiously safeguarding the unity of socialist legal system. Some military laws and regulations should remove departmental confinement, ensure that one law is enacted for the same or similar issues, and refrain from letting departments enact their own laws. Fourth, we should place great stress on bringing the role of experts into play in legislative work. Military departments which have the task of legislation should invite experts to aid in the drafting of military laws and regulations and earnestly heed their opinions and suggestions. This will help avoid detours and improve work efficiency and quality. Fifth, we should strengthen investigation and study, do a good job of consultation and coordination, fully understand the arduousness of legislation work, and make herculean efforts to conduct investigation and study in a down-to-earth manner. For some complicated issues, we should conduct repeated investigations and study and, for the issues which have to do with local authorities, we should conduct investigation and study in relevant localities. Meanwhile, the process of legislation is also a process of democratic policymaking. When it comes to issues which have to do with departments concerned, the departments should coordinate with one another. With regard to some important and complicated issues, leading comrades should take up and solve the issues satisfactorily through consultations. Only in this way can the contents of laws and regulations be practical and really applicable. Sixth, we should study and use as reference the useful experiences of foreign countries and armies in legislation. Laws are the common cultural wealth created by mankind. The legal systems of some developed countries are relatively sound. We can use some of their useful practices to serve our own purposes. In the course of drafting military laws and regulations, we should extensively collect and sort out the legal materials of foreign countries and armies so as to use them as a reference in drafting military legislation.
