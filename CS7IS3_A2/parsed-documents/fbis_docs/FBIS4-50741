King Sihanouk reiterated Wednesday his proposal for the different factions in Cambodia to come together for talks in the North Korean capital Pyongyang on May 27 to end the fighting between the government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas. "We sincerely hope that setting store by their national interests, the Cambodian leaders of various parties will, with the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, make joint efforts for national reconciliation," Wu said.

Winston Lord, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs, interviewed from Sydney on Wednesday, said that Washington was holding talks with Australia and Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries on providing military aid to Phnom Penh to help it fight the Khmer Rouge.
