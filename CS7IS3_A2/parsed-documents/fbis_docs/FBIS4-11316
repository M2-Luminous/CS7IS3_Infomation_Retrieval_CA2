In brief statements to reporters, Lage commented on the current state of the economy and its outlook and then added that the meetings with the emigrants were held in an atmosphere of mutual respect. The meeting began last Friday with the primary objective of normalizing ties between the country and Cuban nationals living abroad. Lage pointed out that the main obstacle to achieving that objective is the hostile policy that the United States has had toward the island for the past 35 years. He added that the blockade imposed by Washington is also an obstacle to the emigrants' aspirations to participate in the official plan to increase foreign investment on the island. He pointed out that the blockade, which has lasted for more than three decades, is a serious violation of the human rights of 11 million Cubans. That is why anything done to eliminate it is the fairest and most just course of action. Lage said the emigrants could help the country by increasing their awareness of the damage inflicted on their nation of origin by U.S. policy and of the need to fight against the blockade.
