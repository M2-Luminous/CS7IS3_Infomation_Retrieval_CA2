These processes are as follows: Process A: Acidification and Methane reactors, Process B: Acidification and Methane reactors followed Membrane, Process C: Acidification reactor, Membrane and Methane reactor. Three performance data were compared from the points of gas production under identical organic loading and operating conditions. Process C is excellent and recommendable when a waste water enriched organic SS is treated, because a membrane application between Acidification and Methane reactors allows a clear two-phase separation in substrate degradation. Introduction Methane fermentation process is considered one of the major biological waste water treatment processes characterizing energy recovery from substrates contained in a waste water. From a kinetic viewpoint, methane fermentation is described as three steps involving 1) hydrolysis of complex organic material, 2) acid production, 3) conversion of acetate or hydrogen to methane. The overall anaerobic conversion of organic matters to the end products: CH[.sub]4[/], CO[.sub]2[/] and NH[.sub]3[/], proceeds simultaneously within a reactor. Otherwise, according to reactor operating conditions, methane fermentation is classified under acidogenic phase and methanogenic phase. While a major drawback in methane fermentation was long hydraulic retention time (HRT), lots of work for upgrade of methane fermentation efficiency have been carried out. Such efforts are attempted to improve methane fermentation efficiency, for example, 1) two-phase fermentation process in which acidogenic and methanogenic phases can operate under optimal conditions,[.sup]1[/] 2) accumulation of high microbial concentration in a reactor using microbial carrier,[.sup]2[/] 3) UASB rector contributed by microbial pellet and granule formation,[.sup]3[/] and 4) membrane introduced reactor.[.sup]4[/] A membrane reactor of aerobic waste water treatment plant has widely been utilized in water reclamation systems. On the other hand, application of membrane to methane fermentation process is on a starting step. A great advantage of membrane application in methane fermentation process might upgrade efficiency due to methanogen accumulation. However, few studies have been reported regarding where a membrane should be introduced in a two-phase methane fermentation process. Further, few reports on quantitative analysis of improved performance between a conventional two-phase fermentation process and a membrane combined two-phase fermentation process. This study demonstrates a two-phase methane fermentation combined with a membrane separation unit for furthermore improvement of efficiency in gas production and treated water qualities. The purpose was to obtain comparison performances in terms of three different methane fermentation processes. These processes are as follows: Process A: Acidification and Methane reactors, Process B: Acidification and Methane reactors followed Membrane, Process C: Acidification reactor, Membrane and Methane reactor. Since a membrane was introduced between two reactors, it was of great interest whether perfect two-phase separation occurred in the process. A series of continuous field test was carried out in a soybean processing factory employing pilot scale plant consisting of fixed bed reactors. Experimental Apparatus A flow sheet of pilot plant and the specification of main apparatus are shown in Figure 1 [not reproduced] and Table 1 respectively. The reactor is divided into two chambers, acidification and methane reactors. Both reactors equip microbial carriers made of polyvinylidene chloride nonwoven fabrics. Circulation pumps provide up-flow in each reactor. Gas produced from each reactor passes through desulfurization tower. A membrane used is of an external pressure capillary type whose molecular weight cut off approximates 15,000. Five modules of ultra filtration (UF) membrane ensured a constant effluent water quality with merry-go-round usage. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

The HRT ranged 3.3-3.5 hour in acidification reactor and 6.7-7.0 hour in methane reactor. Figure 2 [not reproduced] gives a block diagram of three different processes used in this study. The continuous run for Process A was initially conducted for approximately six months. In the second step, Process B continued for approximately 100 days. In the final step, a membrane was replaced between Acidification and Methane reactors. The continuous run for Process C proceeded for approximately six months. Thus, a series of continuous run for three processes employed the identical experimental conditions. Analysis and Measurement Flow rates of water and gas, temperatures, pHs, ORPs and methane content were continuously recorded. The water quality analysis, in terms of TOC, BOD, COD, SS, VFA and ammonia, was executed routinely. An automatic TOC measurement monitored hourly variation of raw and treated waters. Results and Discussion Performance of Process A The continuous run for Process A was carried out to compare performances of two membrane introduced processes with a conventional two-phase process. Performance data from organic loading of approximately 3 kg COD/m[.sup]3[/]/day was chosen for the comparison. Average data are summarized in Table 3. Table 3.

When a membrane is combined with a reactor, Effluent implies permeate. G[.sub]a[/]: Acidification reactor Gas, G[.sub]m[/] : Methane reactor Gas, G[.sub]t[/]: Total Gas Methane conversion expresses on a COD basis, namely oxygen consumption (kg) required for produced methane combustion divided by raw waste water COD (kg). Process A showed a higher gas production and methane content in Methane reactor than those in Acidification reactor. One m[.sup]3[/] of waste water produces 308 Nl of methane. In treated water, SS and COD concentrations were relatively high and acetic acid (HAc) of 38 mg/l was still residual. The COD removal percentage (51.8 percent) that should theoretically be greater than the methane conversion resulted in the opposite phenomenon. This might be attributed by high SS concentration discharge in the treated water due to slough off of attached SS (microbes and soybean particles) on carriers during the period. Because acclimation run (COD loading 3.0 kg/m[.sup]3[/]/day) prior to this test provided a good material balance showing up COD removal 67.8 percent, methane conversion 54.9 percent and SS concentrations in raw water and treated water, 608 mg/l and 238 mg/l respectively, all the data in Process A except SS and COD might be considered possible to employ for process performance comparison. Performance of Process B The purpose of Process B was to obtain a clarified water and an enhanced biogas production due to recovery of methanogen with membrane. Average data for Process B are also demonstrated in Table 3. The resultant COD loading was 3.25 kg/m[.sup]3[/]/day. COD removal (77.7 percent) was appreciably improved by decreasing free SS in the treated water. In terms of soluble organic acids, higher acetic acid (HAc) and propionic acid (HPr) concentrations were found residual in the treated water. Pertaining to gas production, methane conversion (68.9 percent) showed, on the contrary of the expectation, a little lower value than that from Process A. Since the membrane separated perfectly solid and liquid, the decrease in methane conversion seemed to be derived from an accumulation of soybean suspended solids in Methane reactor. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observation proved the presence of mixture, microbes and soybean SS. Accumulation of SS in Methane reactor might cause simultaneous reaction of solubilization, acidification and methane production, the simultaneous reaction led deterioration of methanogenic activity. The two-phase separation was found difficult when a membrane introduced in the final step. Performance of Process C A membrane was replaced between acidification and methane reactors in Process C. The purpose of this process was to enclose soybean particles in the acidification reactor and to promote solubilization of particles therein. Accordingly, the methane reactor received a permeate contained organic acids. Average data for Process C from Table 3 shows the resultant COD loading 3.0 kg/m[.sup]3[/]/day. Process C revealed a remarkable improvement in terms of COD removal (92.4 percent) and methane conversion (83.4 percent). Some 100 mg/l of COD, 26 mg/l of HAc and 16 mg/l of HPr in the treated water gave the lowest concentrations among three processes. Further, 4 mg/l of SS was a low value, which could explain a firm attachment of methanogen on nonwoven fabrics carriers. Unlike the performance of Process A and B, Acidification reactor provided an increasing gas production. Methane production from Acidification reactor occupied 53 percent of the total value. Hence, Acidification reactor introduced membrane system permitted symbiosis of acid forming and methane forming bacteria. Since, the membrane permeate was free of SS, an ideal methane fermentation seemed to take place in the second reactor. A SEM observation disclosed a lot of methanothrix-like bacteria attached on carriers. Conclusions Introduction of a membrane in different locations caused a great difference in performance. Process B showed a clear blockage of SS in the treated water. However, there was no remarkable improvement in terms of gas production and soluble organic matters in the treated water. Process C gave noteworthy improvement results compared with Process A. Concerning two-phase separation, Process B did not attain it and inversely enhanced a heterogeneous microbial formation in Methane reactor. Process C, despite a membrane application between Acidification and Methane reactors, performed no obvious two-phase separation either. However, it allowed a clear two-phase separation in substrate degradation process. Conclusively, among three processes, Process C is excellent and recommendable when a waste water enriched organic SS is treated.
