Leonov; date and place not given] [Text] The director of the Baku Asbestos Cement and Ceramic Items Combine, U. Melikov, answers the questions of the BAKINSKIY RABOCHIY correspondent. [Leonov] Everyone needs the output which you produce, I dare say: state and cooperative organizations, joint enterprises, and individual citizens. Slate, Dutch tile, ceramic tile, and sanitary equipment are necessary for construction, repair, and everyday life. So why is it that we never have enough of them in our country, and how do things stand now? [Melikov] Even in the best times the republic supplied itself with only 30-40 percent of these materials and the rest of the output had to be obtained outside its borders. Even though our combine's capacity, according to accepted standards, is fairly large and it used to increase every year. But the disruption of inter-enterprise regional ties threatened the combine's very existence. The unified national economic complex which was formed in the past had its indisputable pluses and its enormous minuses. The administrative system could not handle the problems of long distance hauling, dependence on suppliers from other cities, and the marketing of finished items. In accordance with the program worked out at the top, our enterprise received almost all its raw and processed materials from outside. And those materials included up to 70 types of raw materials, industrial cloth strainers for manufacturing slate, and spare parts. This practice hampered initiative in local areas, created feelings of dependence, and hindered the search for and development of deposits of various types of raw materials right in our republic, which is rich in various kinds of natural resources. Now all this has also had a very negative effect on production. Judge for yourselves how nepheline is obtained in the city of Apatity, which is on the Barents Sea, and asbestos in the Urals and in the Kazakh city of Dzhezgazgan, firebrick in the Donbass, and ceramic paints in Voronezh! That is the reason for the disruptions in the combine's work, the forced downtime, and the drop in production of output. Now, for example, the slate shop is idle. We are trying to rectify the situation and reduce the enterprise's dependence on imported raw materials. Along with the sectorial concern and the Building Materials Institute, we are seeking particular types of raw materials in Azerbaijan and organizing their extraction and delivery. We have organized a cooperative engaged in working a local deposit of perlite; in Shamkirskiy Rayon and on the Sumgayytchay River we are creating production sections for exploiting deposits of clay. The quality of the clay, as it happens, is altogether suitable for producing superior Dutch and ceramic tiles. This will reduce the pressure for supplying clay from outside. There are also experiments underway on local quartz sand, deposits of which used to be ignored. Dzhebrailskiy Rayon will be completely liberated from the aggressor, and from there we will be able to obtain volcanic ash used to manufacture ceramic tiles. We have also adapted to the use of Karadagskiy cement, instead of cement from Volgograd. Work in this direction will be continued with increasing intensity. But even so, for now and in the foreseeable future the combine will be unable to operate successfully without close cooperation with partners from other republics of the former USSR. However, considerable difficulties of an objective and subjective nature put us on guard here. [Leonov] Most likely, first questions of mutual accounts with suppliers and customers, questions of payments. A lingering, serious illness common to many people! [Melikov] Within the republic, in the manat zone the situation with payments is relatively favorable. Overall banks are duly handling the transfer of money. True, sometimes, and not so very rarely, there are delays. For example, money takes half a month or even more to get from Salyany to Baku. At times one gets the impression that the banks hold back the capital for their own commercial transactions, since loaning it out and charging interest is profitable. We do not have Russian rubles, so we use barter in relations with suppliers from the CIS countries. We settle accounts with our own finished output as well, especially sanitary equipment and other items produced in Azerbaijan which enjoy stable demand. But today it is very difficult to cooperate with suppliers, Russian, Ukrainian, Kazakh, Central Asian, and Georgian. The world has a golden rule: everything that is not forbidden is permitted. In our country, with almost every step of economic activity, we encounter all kinds of obstacles, bureaucratic barriers and red tape, acutely painful formalism, innumerable derivative legal enactments, and arbitrary instructions and circulars. Any transaction has to be reconciled with higher levels, even the Cabinet of Ministers, and permission must be obtained from them. As a result, valuable time is lost, you must endure damages, and you may lose the supplier or the client. We reached agreement with our colleagues from Georgia that they would give us 26 railroad carloads of raw materials, perlite, and in exchange we would give them 9 carloads of our own output, slate. Our neighbors efficiently fulfilled their obligation. After a long ordeal, we managed to ship out only two carloads of slate. The documents for the other cars are wandering from office to office and the authorities are in no hurry to give the "go ahead." Lost days also mean lost money and additional troubles: we have to conclude the contract all over again, because of higher prices. Business ties with producers from the near abroad are complicated by the overly suspicious customs service. Customs by no means wanted to allow in the ceramic balls which are used in the technological process and came to us from Russia. We had to spend a long time proving that these balls were not suitable for other purposes. I have been in Turkey and Czechia more than once, and, I must confess, I have watched with envy how quickly and freely, without bureaucrats' intervention, major deals are concluded there, financial transactions are conducted, and the transport of freight within the state and hundreds or thousands of kilometers from it is carried out. [Leonov] Umud Umudovich, this is not the first year that as an administrator with a respectable record and an experienced specialist, you have headed an asbestos cement and ceramic items combine, for before this you managed the Karadagskiy Cement Plant, the Baku Glass Plant, and the Baku Building Materials Combine. Tell us what, in your opinion, must be done so that domestic sanitary equipment and our output earmarked for construction and domestic needs will meet world standards and be competitive on the international market. For it is no secret that local items suffer badly in comparison with those foreign models which are now sold in commercial stores at exorbitant prices. [Melikov] In terms of price, our items are on the average one-tenth as expensive, but outwardly they are at a disadvantage in most cases. A number of things are to blame for that. I dare to reassure you that the thousand-member collective of our combine is very skilled and people are able and try to produce contemporary, high quality output and raise production volumes. But the forced stoppages of technological lines have a by-no-means good effect on their work. As I already said, our slate shop has been down for a week because there is no asbestos, which comes from the Urals. We have the very same unfortunate problem with payments! Problems of supplying raw and processed materials take up too much time and energy. We managed to get several carloads of hardware for sanitary-porcelain items from outside, and we were lucky: we have enough of it for 2 years. Gypsum delivered from Samara allows us to manufacture better quality output. Under the present particular conditions, it is fairly difficult to procure good paints, which is what the quality of Dutch tiles largely depends upon. A substantial part of our equipment has become obsolete, and that includes equipment bought at one time in Italy and Germany; that also affects quality. You cannot get spare parts from the far abroad now. We are resourceful and make do with our own efforts and hire Baku machine building plants. Units for producing asbestos cement sewer pipes were installed at the combine back in the 1940s. There is a great need for these pipes, but we have had to shut down production. The equipment was so worn out that it did not meet the elementary norms of equipment safety. And, besides, it is intolerable to use primitive "sledge hammer" technology in our time! The maximum diameter of the asbestos cement pipes produced on this line equaled 1 meter 200 centimeters, while these days Italy is manufacturing equipment intended to produce pipes up to 3 meters in diameter. We spend 48 hours to fire each batch of porcelain items in the kilns. These kilns belong to the past, since in enterprises similar to ours abroad there are kilns where firing lasts not 48 hours but 24 or even 12 hours. We do not have the hard currency to acquire the latest foreign equipment, but we hope in the future to sign a mutually advantageous agreement with foreign firms which are managing construction of prestigious projects in Azerbaijan. Is it reasonable for them to bring Dutch and ceramic tiles and sanitary equipment from afar if they can get them at our combine equipped, with their help, with contemporary, high technology lines?! But even so, despite the difficulties already named, the collective is managing to raise the quality of our output. We are manufacturing pretty two-tone Dutch tiles and various kinds of attractive designs are being added to the surface of the tiles at the decal section. "Tyulpan" [tulip] basins for bathrooms done in light blue, pink, and other colors come off the conveyor. We have also changed over to producing more convenient models of other sanitary equipment. The enterprise's chief engineer, Meymat Guseynov, and the laboratory chief, Tagir Gadzhiyev, set the tone in the work to refine production and incorporate new models. Incidentally, last year by common efforts we managed to produce many more improved sanitary-porcelain items than was planned. [Leonov] It has become a common and unfortunate occurrence that skilled workers leave state enterprises, which are in turmoil, to go to all kinds of commercial structures where earnings are higher and more reliable. Tell us, please, how could you avoid the exodus of cadres and preserve the main backbone of specialists? [Melikov] I would like to have seen the results of the last year more impressive, but we kept profitability at the level of 15 percent and obtained pure profit of 411 million rubles. The average monthly earnings in January of this year reached 8,000 manats. As before we continue to handle housing construction for our employees. Last year a 10-story housing block with 100 apartments was occupied, and in the first quarter of this year another residential building with 50 apartments will be ready. It has been decided to build a third building in shares with Glavbakstroy [Main Construction Administration of Baku]. We supply our own people with agricultural products at reduced prices, subsidize the cost of lunches in the enterprise's cafeteria, and opened a shop to bake bread on the combine's territory. Special attention is lavished on the families of our industrial workers who with weapons in their hands protect our native land. And overall people treasure their own enterprise to which they are closely linked. I think that all these factors certainly serve as a response to the question posed.
