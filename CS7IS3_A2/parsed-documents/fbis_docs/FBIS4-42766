The small satellite, called "NBL-Sat," is to be primarily used for gathering information on environmental damage in the new laender from space. Speaking at the ILA 94 international aerospace fair at Berlin-Schoenefeld on Saturday [28 May], DARA General Director Jan-Baldem Mennicken said that he envisages concentrating the resources available to eastern Germany on this project. The plan is in line with Dara's goal of commercializing space flight and achieving the greatest possible benefits for the economy with the help of a state-subsidized space program, explained Mennicken. Last year, DARA and the European Space Agency, ESA, provided 52 million German marks [DM] to the new laender, the sum being distributed among 29 industrial companies, 14 research institutions, and eight universities. The space budget for the new laender amounts to just DM80 million and is thus less than 4.4 percent of the total budget, says Ralf Joachim, the head of the DARA coordination bureau. Speaking to NEUE ZEIT, Klaus Berndt, head of space technology sales at the Jena-Optronik GmbH, said that with the NBL-Sat project, DARA has finally stopped applying "the principle of giving everyone a slice of the cake." With this new plan, which will involve the participation of nine east German space technology companies and institutes, DARA will be able to show something concrete and will have an opportunity to demonstrate that it is acting in the interest of the laender. Berndt stressed that the participation of east German companies in the satellite project would serve as a reference for them. There were no doubts in his mind about their competence with respect to space distance measuring and analysis technology, as well as optical sensors. To develop the new satellite, one will, of course, need the support of companies in the old laender, but know-how and technical means are abundantly available in eastern Germany. Klaus Meyer, the executive director of the Freiberg Space Sensor GmbH, who initiated the project, assumes that the NBL-Sat project will use up about 50 percent of the space research funding available to the new laender. He expects the costs to reach a maximum of DM100 million over the next four years. The sum is tiny compared to the benefits to the environment. Thus, it might finally be possible to shed some light on radiation levels in Saxony's mining region. Meyer said that Saxony would have been able to launch such a small satellite project by itself if DARA had not become involved. However, with DARA participation, the use and benefits of such a satellite can be extended to all five new laender.
