The United States Justice Ministry claims that the Ames couple has spied against the United States since 1985. The U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has lodged an official protest with a Russian diplomat who was invited to the Department of State. In Moscow, the U.S. Ambassador Pickering voiced a similar protest at his meeting with Russian Foreign Ministry officials. Radio Moscow's reporter, Aleksandr Peripetchko has asked the chief of the Public Relations Bureau of Russia's external intelligence, Yuriy Kobaladze, to comment on the arrest of the American couple on charges of spying for Russia: [Kobaladze] Firstly, it is unclear for what reason the Russian external intelligence is believed to be involved in that affair. This question should be addressed to the Americans, those who made the arrest, those who formulated the charges, U.S. Administration officials. This is not our business. We never comment on such issues. This is a generally recognized practice for all secret services. The Russian intelligence is no exception. No comments are made on whether this or that person was, or is, involved in intelligence operations. All professionals are perfectly aware of that. So is the public at large. This is the reason why I refrain from any comments. [Announcer] A BBC report said that the United States does not want another round of mutual expulsions, so frequent in the Cold War years. Yet it hopes that Russia will recall from the United States those diplomats who have worked with the Ames couple. Washington would also like to hear promises from Moscow that nothing of the sort will happen in the future. What does the public relations official of the Russian external intelligence think of that? Yuriy Kobaladze: [Kobaladze] If we avoid focusing on this concrete episode and speak in broader terms, the Russian intelligence has never pledged to curtail intelligence activity. No other Western intelligence, including the American one, has ever done so either. Moreover, Washington keeps saying that in the wake of the break-up of the Soviet Union, its interest in Russia's problems and in the problems of other former Soviet republics has grown and not reduced. The Americans say they must increase the presence of the intelligence in that region. They have talked a great deal about what they call human intelligence. This euphemism means recruiting agents. The American intelligence and other foreign secret services have been very active in that respect. [Announcer] One of Russia's central dailies, IZVESTIYA, earlier this month published an interview with the chief of Russia's Federal Counterintelligence, Mr. Golushko. In that interview he said outright that several people have been arrested on spying charges. The damage one of them has caused to Russia is similar only to that of the Penkovskiy affair in the 60's. This is only one of the examples of how active Western secret services have been in Russia. Washington seems to be expecting Moscow to take certain steps to restore stability in its relations with the United States, the more so since the United States President Bill Clinton has described this as a very serious incident. Is that so? Yuriy Kobaladze: [Kobaladze] What we would like to say is that individual episodes should not be used to build up tensions in Russian-U.S. relations. That is a Cold War tactic. If we really live in a new world, a world of cooperation and good-neighborliness, it would be senseless to fan this hysteria. [Announcer] One cannot but agree that even in this changing world, an intelligence service will remain so. It will continue to have its own specific interest and use its own means. It remains to be seen whether this episode will have a negative effect on Russian- U.S. relations or not.
