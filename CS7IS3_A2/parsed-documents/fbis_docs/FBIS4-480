According to the newspaper a secret ANC report, in which it was found that Mrs Mandela had stolen money from and defrauded her own party to the tune of hundreds of thousands of rands, was leaked to a DISPATCH correspondent in Cape Town. A recent report in the DISPATCH said the ANC was still trying to work out how much money was missing. Mrs Mandela, who is widely tipped as a future cabinet minister in the new South Africa, had refused to appear before an ANC commission into the affair headed by late ANC chief Oliver Tambo, it said. The ANC commission's report, claimed the DISPATCH, had found that Mrs Mandela had been caught counting piles of United States dollars and cheques after a visit to the United States. The money was "donations" Mrs Mandela had collected during her visit and had failed to declare to the ANC. There was also evidence that Mrs Mandela had pocketed "substantial" amounts of interest yielded by funds deposited into her account. These funds were legally destined for the ANC's social welfare department. Mrs Mandela is also suspected in the ANC report, according to the dispatch, of taking an alleged R190,000 [rand] "kickback" on a farm bought by the ANC for returning exiles. The price paid for the Walkerville property was R350,000, yet it was only worth R160,000. Mrs Mandela was a main party in the deal. According to the ANC report, Mrs Mandela had admitted shaving R74,000 off a donation destined for the ANC's social welfare department. The money had, to date, not been paid back. A statement issued by Mrs Mandela on Saturday said she had instructed her lawyers to undertake litigation against the DISPATCH.
