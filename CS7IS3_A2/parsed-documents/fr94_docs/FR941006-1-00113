FR941006-1-00113 FR941006-1-00016 Likewise, CPSC reports that, based upon data from its National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) (NEISS is a probability sample of hospital emergency rooms in the United States that is used by the CPSC to measure the magnitude of the injury problem associated with consumer products and to provide a source for followup investigations of selected cases), there was a significant upward trend in the estimated number of hospital emergency room-treated iron ingestion cases involving children under 5 years of age in the 1980 to 1993 period. Every annual estimate in the 1980 to 1985 period was smaller than every annual estimate in the 1986 to 1993 period. The estimated average number of cases annually was 1,240 for the 1980 to 1985 period and 3,170 for the 1986 to 1993 period (Ref. 1). 2. CPSC Case Reports CPSC considers iron-containing products to be potentially hazardous to children and, thus, has taken a number of significant steps designed to reduce the risk from these products. As part of its efforts, CPSC has collected detailed information on pediatric iron poisoning fatalities and has also conducted followup (from NEISS data) investigations of incidents of nonfatal pediatric iron ingestion where the victim was taken to a hospital emergency room. In order to evaluate the available data on specific occurrences of iron poisoning as fully as possible, FDA obtained from CPSC the case reports on 37 fatal pediatric poisonings (Ref. 21) and on 70 NEISS followup investigations of nonfatal pediatric iron ingestions for the years 1986 to 1993 (Ref. 22). These data are described below and are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 summarizes the data obtained from CPSC on 37 iron poisoning fatalities of young children since 1986. Among these fatalities, the average age of the victim was 16.8 months. In 25 of these 37 deaths, the iron potency of the implicated product was reported. These 25 products contained, on average, 63 mg iron per dosage unit. The lowest reported potency of an iron-containing product involved in these pediatric deaths was 40 mg iron per dosage unit. The potency of the iron-containing product involved in the 12 other deaths was not reported. Table 4 shows that, in 21 of the 37 fatalities, information on the number of tablets or capsules consumed by the victim was reported. Among these 21 reports, the average number of iron tablets or capsules consumed by the victim was 39. Table 4 also shows that in 56 percent of these 37 pediatric deaths (21/37), the iron-containing product visually appeared to be packaged in child-resistant packaging (CRP), and more specifically, in containers with apparently child-resistant closures (CRC). In 16 percent of the deaths (6/37), the iron-containing supplement was not packaged in CRP. Among the remaining deaths (10/37), the type of packaging was not reported.
