FBIS4-27593 "dreas106_d_94030" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 30 May 1994 South Korea UN Report Shows Progress in Human Development UN Report Shows Progress in Human Development SK3005014394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0114 GMT 30 May 94 SK3005014394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea ranked third behind Malaysia and Botswana among 114 countries that showed the most progress in human development between 1986 and 1992, according to an annual report by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) obtained here by YONHAP Monday. East Asian countries, including Korea, also recorded the fastest economic growth, with the report observing that "this shows that the fast pace of economic growth in East Asia was built on a solid foundation of human development." The five-year human development report, published and distributed in eight languages throughout the world, aims to advance a new concept of human security and offers several concrete proposals for the world summit for social development in March 1995 in Copenhagen. Canada ranked first in human development overall, while Barbados was No. 1 among developing countries. South Korea placed 32nd in the overall rankings and North Korea was 101st. The other nations making up the top 10 in the global human development index [HDI], which ranks 173 countries according to life expectancy, educational attainment and basic purchasing power, are Switzerland, Japan, Sweden, Norway, France, Australia, the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Germany, in descending order. The new index shows that Korea, following Malaysia and Botswana, has made the most progress in human development since 1960. "They started from very low levels, but managed as a group to increase their HDI values by around 80 percent," says the report. The other countries among the top 10 performers in human development since 1960 include Tunisia, Thailand, Syria, Turkey, China, Portugal and Iran. The report notes that foreign aid to developing countries totaled 60 billion U.S. dollars in 1992, while 102 billion dollars in private capital flowed into the "South" that year compared to only 5 billion in 1970. But nearly three-quarters of the capital went to just 10 countries -- China, Mexico, Malaysia, Argentina, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Venezuela and Korea -- while just 6 percent went to Sub-Saharan Africa and 2 percent to the least developed nations. Developing countries paid 160 billion dollars in debt service charges in 1992, more than two and a half times the official aid and 10 billion dollars more than private financial flows. The report says that debt servicing is hampering developing countries' ability to meet urgent human development needs, and suggests cancelling the debts of the poorest nations in return for a pledge that they earmark those same funds for social development. The 1994 report points out that widespread human insecurity is a universal problem -- the poor nations are more concerned about hunger and disease, while the rich states focus on drugs and crime. Thus the concern for human insecurity is global. Nevertheless, spending to protect borders outstrips outlays to protect individuals within or across borders, the report notes. Observing that several poor nations are spending much more on arms than on education and health, it charges that those encouraging the weapons trade in developing countries are responsible for the world's security policy -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Saying the acquisition of more arms only aggravates existing human deprivations, the report lists China, India, Korea, Malaysia, Nigeria and Pakistan as recent buyers and explains how much it really costs them in terms of their unmet social agendas. For example, Korea ordered 28 missiles from America, spending an amount that could have been used to immunize all of its 120,000 unimmunized children and provide safe water to 3.5 million people.
