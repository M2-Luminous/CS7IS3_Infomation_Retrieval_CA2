The decision was made taking into account various factors facing the private sector, including business restructuring efforts, Kumano told a news conference. Implementation of the rate hikes at a time when the economy is still in a slump would affect industrial activity in Japan, Kumano said. The government announced Wednesday it will suspend until the end of this year a plan to raise public services charges, including public transportation fees, highway tolls, telephone rates and rent on government-owned houses. Meanwhile, Kumano voiced regret over gasoline sales by an unlicensed gas station near Nagoya in defiance of government instructions. The gas station should get a government permit at an early time by agreeing to undergo proper procedures, Kumano said. The gas station in question on Wednesday began selling gasoline at prices very low for Japan, and motorists flocked to fill up. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry did not issue a business license for the station because it did not clarify the wholesale routes of its products, one requirement for operating a gas station. A government advisory panel is now studying whether or not the requirement should be scrapped as part of deregulation, Kumano said.
