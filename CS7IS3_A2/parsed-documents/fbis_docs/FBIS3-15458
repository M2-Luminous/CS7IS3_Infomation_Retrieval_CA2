He was speaking at a meeting in Moscow on Saturday sponsored by the former opposition newspaper, DEN, closed by the government last October. The meeting was also attended by other released opposition leaders including Ilya Konstantinov and Stanislav Terekhov as well as leaders of the Communist and Liberal-Democratic Parties Gennadiy Zyuganov and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. One former Soviet deputy Mrs Saji Umalatova leading "the standing presidium of the Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR" claimed that "many innocent people are still behind bars" echoed previous calls on opponents to the Yeltsin regime to close their ranks regardless of difference in views. For his part, chairman of the executive committee of the National Salvation Front Ilya Konstantinov who was also involved in last October's parliamentary revolt said that "our people are everywhere and biding their time". In his words, the opposition would "stand tall" again within months.
