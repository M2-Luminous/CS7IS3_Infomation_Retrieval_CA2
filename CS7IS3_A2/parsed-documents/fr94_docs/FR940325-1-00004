FR940325-1-00004 FR940325-1-00002 Discussion During recent flight testing of a Lockheed Model 382 series airplane, the airplane could not meet the ground minimum control speed (V mcg ) schedule as specified in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). Investigation revealed that, during production, a change had been incorporated into the propeller governor, which altered the thrust decay characteristic of the propeller when operating in an engine failure scenario. This altered characteristic was such that the actual V mcg values were increased by as much as 15 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) over the values specified in the AFM. This condition poses a potential hazard in those situations where an airplane is operated in a high thrust-to-weight condition and the takeoff decision speed (V 1 ) is equal to or very near V mcg : If the airplane were to experience a critical engine failure at, or very near, the currently published V 1 speed, and the flight crew elected to continue the takeoff, the faster thrust decay (and, hence, an increasing V mcg ) could cause the airplane to swerve more than the 25-foot limit permitted by Civil Aeronautics Regulation 4b (under which the Model 382 was certificated). This condition, if not corrected, could lead to the airplane departing the side of the runway. Lockheed Model 382, 382E, and 382G series airplanes that are equipped with a servo-type valve housing assembly, having part number 714325&hyph;2, &hyph;3, &hyph;5, &hyph;6, or &hyph;7 installed on any outboard engine, have been determined to be subject to this unsafe condition. The FAA has reviewed and approved Lockheed Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) Supplement 382&hyph;16, dated August 11, 1993, that provides revised performance data to address the increase in V mcg . It also provides procedures to permit changing the power setting of the outboard engines, in order to partially mitigate the payload penalty associated with the increased V mcg . This AFM supplement is intended to be interim action until a design change in the propeller governor is developed to address the V mcg characteristics. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require a revision to the FAA-approved AFM to require takeoff operation of the airplane in accordance with the revised performance data contained in the AFM supplement described previously. This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may propose further rulemaking.. There are approximately 112 Model 382, 382E, and 382G series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 18 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the proposed AFM change, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $990, or $55 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Lockheed: Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;220&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 382, 382E, and 382G series airplanes; equipped with a servo-type valve housing assembly, having part number 714325&hyph;2, &hyph;3, &hyph;5, &hyph;6, or &hyph;7, installed on any outboard engine; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To ensure that the airplane is operated at sufficient speeds to mitigate the problems associated with a faster thrust decay and to prevent the airplane from departing the side of the runway, accomplish the following: (a) Within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the Limitations and Performance Data Sections of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include the information specified in Lockheed Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) Supplement 382&hyph;16, dated August 11, 1993, and operate the airplane accordingly thereafter. The requirements of this paragraph may be accomplished by inserting AFM Supplement 382&hyph;16 into the AFM. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Small Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Atlanta ACO. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on March 21, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
