Private sector investment, however, weakened during the period due to a decline in investment from abroad. Slow progress in mega-infrastructural projects also contributed to a slowdown in private investment. Production in the manufacturing construction, trade and service sectors continued to expand from the last quarter of last year while production in the agricultural sector weakened. The bank, however, pointed out that higher consumption and lower agricultural output contributed to higher commodity prices, leading to higher inflation in both the food and non-food sectors. The consumer price index rose 4.8 268460064uring the first quarter of this@ year, compared with a 3.3rise during the same period of 1993. Prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rose 6.2, while non-food prices went up 3.9 Concerning external trade position, exports rose 16.8as a result of the improving economy of Thailand's trading partners-- particularly, the US. The removal of Thailand from the US priority foreign country list (PFC) also contributed to higher exports. Imports rose only 12.4 268460064uring the first quarter of this year. Imports of oil products dropped, but imports of non-oil products-- particularly, consumer goods -- rose considerably causing the country to suffer a trade deficit of 68.8 billion baht during the period or about the same level as the deficit recorded during the same quarter last year. The current account deficit rose marginally from the same period of last year to 47 billion baht. Net capital inflow totalled 80 billion baht, a small increase from the same period of last year, while payments surplus remained nearly constant at 21.52 billion baht. Official reserves, as of the end of March, stood at US$26.67 billion or an equivalent of 6.6 months of imports. The Government's fiscal position weakened somewhat during this quarter as import and excise taxes on car imports dropped considerably. The cash account surplus was only 10.58 billion baht during the period, compared to 27.61 billion baht for the same period of 1993. But Phisit Lee-artham, a central bank spokesman, said that during the first half of this fiscal year (October 1993-March 1994), the Government's expenditures rose 22.82000060040ver the same period of the preceding year, while revenue rose only 13 As a result, the Government suffered a cash deficit of 17 billion baht compared to a surplus of 9.5 billion baht recorded during the same period of the preceding year. This is the first time in seven years that the Government has suffered a cash deficit during the first half of its fiscal year, but he said he expects the situation to return to normal during the second half. Mr Phisit said deposit at banks, as of the end of March, stood at 122 billion baht, which represented a decrease of 38 billion baht from the end of last year. He said the drop in bank deposits may stem from the fact that the public had invested over 30 billion baht in mutual funds in the period.
