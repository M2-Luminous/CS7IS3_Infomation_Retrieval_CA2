Reports from Nigeria suggest that his calls for mass protests have not been heeded and he is still being hunted by the authorities. On the line to Nigeria, David Sted asked the chief of the Nigerian police, (Suleman Lao), how the search was going. [Begin recording] [(Lao)] The search for Chief Abiola is still progressing well. We have asked all people or everyone who knows his whereabouts to report it to the police immediately. [Sted] Do you think that he is still Lagos? [(Lao)] That we cannot say, but we have every reason to believe that he is still here in Lagos. I may also ask whether you know where he is now? Can I ask that question? [Sted] You can, but I shan't be able to help unfortunately because I don't know either. [(Lao)] Thank you. [Sted] There is some suspicion that he might be in the U.S. Embassy in Lagos. Have you heard that at all? [(Lao)] I have heard that rumor but I don't think the United States of America would do that type of thing. [Sted] Have you checked the embassy? [(Lao)] We have not yet checked the embassy because we don't believe that. We have excellent relationship with the American Embassy. [Sted] Chief Abiola had been placed on house arrest before the weekend. How was it that he was able to slip past your officers? [(Lao)] That is what we don't know. That happens everywhere. You try to put people in the most safest area that you believe it to be as such and they do escape. It is not only here in Nigeria, you see. [Sted] There is still some debate over whether or not Chief Abiola did in fact attend a meeting to announce that he was going to be the president. Is there any evidence that such a meeting actually took place? [(Lao)] We have not had any evidence that a meeting did actually take place. I don't know quite honestly. [Sted] If and when you find Chief Abiola, what will you do with him? [(Lao)] Well until we have found him, we cannot predict what we will do with him yet. [Sted] But will he be charged with some offense? [(Lao)] We are still looking for him and we will....[pauses] You see, Nigeria has a very good legal system. We don't charge people like that until we ask them questions, until they say yes, this and this. So we have one of the excellent legal procedures here in this country. Abiola is declared a wanted person to answer some questions. [Sted] Could I just ask you what he is wanted for? [(Lao)] Yes. He is wanted for some alleged statements that he has made. As I said, we haven't yet established that until we have found that from him, whether he did in fact make those statements. [end recording]
