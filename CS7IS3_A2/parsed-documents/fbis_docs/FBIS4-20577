However, the crystal tips for the emitters must be cut out of the high quality parts because of subgrain boundaries. We reported that the boundary-free crystals were prepared by adding CeB[.sub]6[/], without any influence on the emission properties.[.sup]1,2[/] On the other hand, the boundaries were also removed from LaB[.sub]6[/] crystals by the traveling solvent floating zone method.[.sup]3[/] In this presentation, by using both of the above methods, the higher quality crystals were tried to be prepared. The crystals were prepared in 7 atm of ambient argon gas by the RF- heating FZ method. The feed rod was prepared by sintering a mixture of LaB[.sub]6[/] and CeB[.sub]6[/] powders. The initial molten zone was formed by melting La and/or Ce metal lump. The growth rate was 0.5 cm/h. The grown crystals were 0.9 cm in diameter and 6 cm long. Distribution of La, Ce and B was examined at the growing interface. The Ce content in the crystal increased by 10% due to evaporation, compared with the feed rod. The cases where the boundary-free crystals were obtained are shown as circles in Figure l. By using both methods, the amounts of added CeB[.sub]6[/] and La/Ce flux were decreased. Consequently, the strain of lattices and the void densities in the crystals decreased to be less than half. Figure 1. References 1. S. Otani, T. Tanaka, and Y. Ishizawa, J.
