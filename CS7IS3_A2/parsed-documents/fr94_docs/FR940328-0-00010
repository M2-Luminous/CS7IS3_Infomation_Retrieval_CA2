FR940328-0-00010 FR940328-0-00004 21 CFR Chapter I Redesignation of a U.S. Code Citation; Technical Amendment AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule; technical amendment. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations to reflect a redesignation of a U.S. Code citation. This action is editorial in nature, and is intended to provide accuracy and clarity to the agency's regulations. DATES: Effective March 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robin Thomas Johnson, Office of Policy (HF&hyph;27), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301&hyph;443&hyph;2994. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA is amending its regulations in Chapter I of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to reflect a redesignation of a U.S. Code citation. In section 106 of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;571), section 706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 376) was redesignated as section 721 of the act (21 U.S.C. 379e). Publication of this document constitutes final action on these changes under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). FDA has determined that notice and public comment are unnecessary because these amendments are editorial and nonsubstantive in nature. This regulation is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq. ) and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. FDA is amending Chapter I of Title 21 by removing ``706'' and ``21 U.S.C. 376'' and adding in its place ``721'' and ``21 U.S.C. 379e'', respectively, each time it appears. Dated: March 21, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7147 Filed 3&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
