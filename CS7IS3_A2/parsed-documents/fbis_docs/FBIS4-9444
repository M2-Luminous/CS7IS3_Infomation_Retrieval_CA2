It was opened by Bulgarian delegation head Transport Minister Kiril Ermenkov and his Iranian counterpart Transport Minister 'Ali Akbar Torkan. The sitting was also attended by Iran's Ambassador here Mohammed 'Ali Kormi Nuri. The sides were unanimous that the business and economic contacts between the two countries of the past 2 or 3 years are not at the desirable level. According to them, this situation was brought about by the reforms under way in Bulgaria and the plummeting international oil prices. The joint committee will sit in separate groups in charge of industry, agriculture, trade and banking, oil and gas, transport and communications, technical and scientific cooperation. The Bulgarian side is expected to raise the issue of overdue receivables of Bulgarian companies for a total of about $27 million. The Iranian delegation, including 20 business circles representatives will hold talks at the Council of Ministers and meet National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB) Governor Prof. Todor Vulchev and the ministers of trade and industry. The guests are planning tomorrow to visit Burgas to consider the possibilities for joint exploitation of transport technologies. They are also expected to visit the Port of Burgas. Meeting with Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev is also on the agenda, the Transport Ministry Press Office said. The joint committee is expected to end its work with the signing of four bilateral accords and a concluding document. Bulgaria has longstanding relations with Iran. The Bulgarian companies Agrocomplekt, Balkancar, Balkancarpodem, Machinoexport and Electroimpex have established stable positions in Iran. According to 1993 customs figures, Bulgarian exports to Iran amounted to slightly over $18 million, of which metal processing equipment, unprocessed zinc, minerals and chemical fertilizers have the greatest share. Bulgaria has imported some $149 million-worth goods from Iran, of which crude oil and lubricants accounted for 97.5 percent. In January 1994 the two countries' foreign ministers signed an agreement on economic and business cooperation which has yet to be endorsed by the two parliaments. Agreements on double taxation avoidance and reciprocal investments protection and promotion are currently being drafted. The previous sitting of the Joint Committee on Economic and Technical Cooperation was held in Iran in October 1993.
