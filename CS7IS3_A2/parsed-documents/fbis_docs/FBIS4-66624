An eyewitness who was present on the scene was willing to provide us with certain secrets that, in his mind, make up a large-scale act of treason. Tazoult--from our special envoys--"No one can be proud of what happened at Lambese; I never thought treason on that scale could ever take place," we were told by this witness who is still, even today, very shaken by everything he saw. Indeed, from the standpoint of its reputation, the Tazoult prison has always been termed an impregnable citadel. The prison was worthy of being an "Alcatraz"! Here is an account of one of the most mysterious breakouts. Everything seemed normal in this peaceful town with its Islamic majority. On Thursday, 10 March, at around 1700, close to 300 persons armed with Kalashnikovs spilled into this small town in the Aures Mountains. Working with a plan that had long been drawn up in minute detail, they divided up into groups, each one charged with carrying out a well defined task. The first task was first to isolate Lambese from neighboring areas by setting up two roadblocks, one on the road leading to Batna and the other on the Khenchela road. Furthermore two vehicles, one a yellow J5, the other a "Lada," went separately to the only gendarmerie post and police station. The terrorists' goal was to neutralize all security forces. Neither gendarmes nor police officers resisted. Other terrorists dispersed throughout Tazoult's narrow streets to prevent its residents from leaving. As for the prison, it was besieged by about 100 of the men who began by parking two "Sonacome"-make trucks in front of the main gate. This gate had been cordially opened by a guard by the name of Benoui who was an accomplice. To reach the second gate, which opened onto the detention areas, i.e., the cells, the attackers were aided by two other guards. In fact, then and there, Lagoune (a former commando) and another guard, both natives of Barika, killed their colleague guarding the second gate who was "not part of the deed." When he heard the shots, the director, Mohamed Latrache, called Hama, who is also nicknamed "I-don't-give-a-damn," ran out of his house that was next to the prison's first gate. "Why have you shot our colleague?" he asked Lagoune. In response, the latter shot the director twice, failing to hit him. From that moment on, the top prison official completely vanished into thin air. He reappeared only when the investigation committee arrived. However, he was the only one in possession of the keys to the place where the heavy weapons, especially three FMPKs, were stored. Once the two gates were opened, the attackers burst into the inner detention perimeter by overwhelming 13 guards in charge of overseeing the various cells from 1700 to 0100. They next proceeded to open all the cells in the three death sentence corridors supposed to be as impenetrable as the ways of the Lord. These corridors cannot accommodate more than 80 death sentence prisoners. The cells have names; some of them are called "high-risk cells," containing 12 prisoners sentenced to death kept chained day and night while there are other low-ceilinged cells where 10 prisoners serving the same sentence are kept as well as the mentally ill who need to be isolated. In the vicinity a place called the cave could be glimpsed made up of five cells with prisoners sentenced to death. All of these cells were opened as well as eight sections of 50 individual cells, each located in an area called "the junction." In all there were no fewer than 400 cells housing prisoners serving long terms. All of these cells were opened by the terrorists with alarming ease. In this regard, our eyewitness stated that the terrorists carried duplicates of the keys to all the cells. They were keys that had been molded in clay; this is one way of copying the master. However the rules are strict and require that at the end of each guard shift the keys absolutely be returned to the director, who is the only and the sole person responsible for the special box in which they are stored. So each guard turns over the keys to the cells he is in charge of to his station head together with a list of prisoners after having signed the register. The station head then turns the keys over to the head of detention before ending up with the director. This process is repeated several times each day, i.e., each time there is a shift of guards. Out of all the prison's cells, only "the star" and "the lower quarter" were not opened. "The star" is made up of four common rooms, each one containing 250 people, while the other 10 rooms in "the lower quarter" contain common criminals serving short sentences. All of these people seemed not to be of interest to the attackers since their main goal was to free "the hard core." Many of the released prisoners had the right to have a weapon. Those sentenced to death were carried in trucks and took the Khenchela road. The attackers also attacked the infirmary so as to free one of their paralyzed "emirs" who was receiving care. Besides, in so doing, they did not hesitate to forcefully "ship out" Kamel Soukhal, the main infirmary attendant, who was serving a 15-year jail term for drug trafficking in Annaba. The other escapees, who did not enjoy much help from the terrorists, were forced to get to the Ain Touta Mountains on foot. This helped the police, who were deployed three hours later, arrest a great number of them. However, certain prisoners, not knowing where to go and roaming through the village, were turned over by local residents to the gendarmerie. One thing is certain and that is that most of the ex-Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] militants who had been jailed for acts of terrorism were freed to the cries of women and the "Allahu Akbars" of men that emerged from some homes. Throughout the entire operation, the prison's electricity was not shut off and the lights in all the guard towers were lit. This was a fact that, as usual, slowed the breakfast hour back to the same time as the muezzin's call to prayer. Now no guard thought to sound the high emergency alarm siren to alert authorities to what was happening. In this regard, the surrounding neighborhood remembers the revolt that took place on 27 December 1978 that was brought under control thanks to the signal set off by the high emergency siren. The entire operation was carried out with the blessing of accomplices, the main ones being the three guards, [?Laagoune] and his associates, known as inveterate Islamic fundamentalists. The witness pointed out that the Lambese prison houses more than 3,000 prisoners and at least 500 guards. Most of the latter are young and inexperienced. "There are some of them who do not even know how to handle a weapon," he said. Furthermore, and according to the same source, the director, who was named to this position in 1989, does not have the qualifications required to run a prison of this scale. He was formerly the chief electrician in the same jail and has never done guard duty. Others have charged him with having a regionalist cast of mind with respect to certain guards who come from different tribes in the area. The operation, when all is said and done, lasted two long hours. The toll was 906 escapees, only about 100 of whom have been captured. At the end of their deed, the attackers fired five times from the interior of the prison to signal the end of the operation. They left, damaging a segment of the road leading towards Khenchela and to gain time and obstruct any pursuit. This is the version of the facts as told by the eyewitness. Furthermore, and as of press time, the commission of inquiry has revealed nothing "official." It headed towards the capital this Thursday. Despite nonstop efforts by reporters, its members have not even deigned to receive them. A protest letter written by reporters present on the scene was even given to the military authorities in Batna. As to Lambese's director, still shaken by events, he even received reporters at the entrance to the prison but declined to make any statement in the absence of any official authorization. For its part, Tazoult has returned to its usual quiet and police left the town three days following the operation. But the sweeps still continue in the mountains as well as the thorough checks. Helicopters fly over the area nonstop. Even if Tazoult's residents are not about to forget what has recently occurred, that is not preventing them from strolling in the streets, sipping a cup of coffee, or even playing a game of table soccer.
