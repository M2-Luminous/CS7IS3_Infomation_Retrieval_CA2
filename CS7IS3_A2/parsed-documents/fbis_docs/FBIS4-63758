A TATAR-INFORM correspondent asked Tatarstan Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov to say what the government is doing in this brief period to prepare for an extraordinary Supreme Soviet session to discuss the document that will determine the future course of the republic's economic development. [Khidiatullina] The Republic of Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers is working on an anticrisis program. Is the economic situation that dire? [Sabirov] We have probably not chosen the most felicitous terms. I would not say that our economy is in a stage of crisis. Of course, many enterprises are close to it, but a number of sectors are developing perfectly well. Although the situation has been getting increasingly serious month by month since the beginning of 1994. It must not be forgotten that the integration of the Tatarstan economy in the Russian economy is so great that we are bound to be affected by all its fluctuations. We only have the power to influence the acuteness of the problem of defaulting on payment and the speed at which it develops. I am referring above all to the situation that has developed over reciprocal default. Since last year Republic of Tatarstan President M. Shaymiyev and members of the Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers have been trying to persuade the Russian leadership to opt for reciprocal settlement. No way would you call it a market measure, of course. But Moscow could not come up with any other solution either. And in the meantime everyone has fallen into debt. Even those who were producng continuously and selling products. The "Tatneft" association was forced to dismiss people or send them on administrative leave, because it had no money to pay them. This enormous enterprise is unable to get the 400 billion rubles [R] it has earned. Reciprocal debt between enterprises in Tatarstan and Russia now totals approximately R2 trillion. Many people are asking banks for credit. You are well aware of the interest rates -- 21 percent and more. They double if payment dates are not met. Naturally, enterprises include these payments in the cost price -- a familiar chain of events! Some organizations and small plants are now being refused credit (the banks also fear for their money) and they, having spent their circulating capital, are beginning to "eat into" their fixed capital. We are able to support only the firms that are producing products essential to the republic. We will do this irrespective of the form of ownership of the enterprise. Some of them will be declared bankrupt. What can you do? Tatarstan cannot solve this problem alone, of course. Particularly where plants of the former military-industrial complex are concerned. It is great, of course, that we are now producing practically no weapons at all, but the vast machine tools that used to produce aircraft wings or warship hulls are not ready to produce irons or washing machines. But we can do something. The construction of a tanker fleet will provide long-term orders for the plant named for Gorkiy in Zelenodolsk, helicopters made by our specialist company are still in demand, and the Kazan Aircraft Plant has called to say that a Russian Federation government decree had placed orders for the new Tu-330 cargo aircraft, which can carry 20-30 tonnes. But enterprises such as the Lenin Science and Production Association, try as they may to keep their heads above water by producing linoleum or artificial leather, cannot resolve the problems of conversion. Russia needs to start meetings its commitments as set out in the treaty and the intergovernmental agreements. But, despite all our efforts, we have not yet been able to secure the necessary measures. [Khidiatullina] So Tatarstan needs a practical program to solve its problems? [Sabirov] Absolutely. But everything must be done to gear this program to the future. Only a madman would dream of a return to the past. We have not seriously attempted to consider what the economic system in our country is going to look like. Although for a year now the Cabinet of Ministers has been working on "Basic Guidelines for the Economic and Social Development of the Republic of Tatarstan in Accordance With the new Republic of Tatarstan Constitution." Academics and practical experts have been involved in this work. The draft is now ready. It is being examined by foreign experts. Together with the Republic of Tatarstan Constitution, the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, and the government program it will form the basis of the program currently being devised to stabilize the Republic of Tatarstan economy. The main aim is to ensure that any turn of events has as little effect as possible on our people. We are considering the economic situation in many countries and are copying the positive experience of Germany, Hungary, and Turkey. But none of these states has specific solutions to offer. For example, Turkish private enterprises are doing a fine job and their products are competitive. But we cannot help being worried by the rate of inflation and the appearance of large numbers of impoverished people there. That is not for us. We must plow our own furrow. [Khidiatullina] How is work on the document that is to be submitted for discussion by the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet deputies proceeding in practice? [Sabirov] All ministries and departments are now engaged in elaborating their own proposals. Every five days the members of the government meet to discuss progress in implementing this important task. We were prepared to examine several alternative versions. When we began to listen to the ministers' and vice premiers' proposals we realized that there was no sharp disagreement. Basically, everyone recognized an identical objective. Differences arose when the tactics for attaining it were discussed. The program will include a number of practical measures. Moreover, we are working on a mechanism for implementing it -- normative acts, draft laws, draft edicts. Adopting another declaration would be a waste of time. It is conceivable that the Supreme Soviet could grant the president special powers for the period of the document's implementation, whereby his edicts would have the force of law. Without this, rapid decisions and vigorous measures are impossible. [Khidiatullina] Will you be able to complete all the work by 30 May? [Sabirov] Had the Cabinet of Ministers not been working on the problem for, I repeat, nearly a year, it would have been impossible to do so in such a hurry, in a matter of days. But I am confident now that on 30 May the deputies will start discussing the program for the stabilization of the Tatarstan economy.
