(d) Requirements for provisional certification to participate on a limited basis for institutions that are not financially responsible. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary does not provisionally certify an institution that_ (1) Fails to meet the general standards of financial responsibility in §668.15(b) or the exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility in §668.15(d), unless the institution_ (i) Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has sufficient financial and administrative resources to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs under a funding arrangement other than the Department of Education's standard advance funding arrangement; (ii) Submits to the Secretary a letter of credit in an amount and form acceptable to the Secretary equal to not less than 10 percent of the Title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during the last complete award year for which figures are available; and (iii) Demonstrates that, during the preceding two award years, it has met all of its financial obligations and was current on its debt payments in accordance with the provisions in §668.15(b) (3) and (4); or (2) Is not financially responsible under §668.15(c)(2), or is required, and has been required at least one other time during the five-year period preceding the Secretary's decision, to certify the institution provisionally, to comply with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, unless_ (i) The institution, or one or more persons or entities that the Secretary determines under the provisions of §668.15 exercise substantial control over the institution, or both, submit to the Secretary financial guarantees in an amount determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to satisfy the institution's potential liabilities arising from the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs; and (ii) One or more persons or entities that the Secretary determines under the provisions of §668.15 exercise substantial control over the institution agree to be jointly or severally liable for any liabilities arising from the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and civil and criminal monetary penalties authorized under Title IV of the HEA. (e) Consequences for an institution whose State does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review program. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if an institution or branch campus of the institution is in a State that does not participate in the State Postsecondary Review Program (34 CFR part 667), the Secretary, with regard to any particular Title IV, HEA program_ (1) Does not certify that the institution or branch campus, as applicable meets the standards of this subpart; and (2) May provisionally certify the institution or branch campus, as applicable, unless_ (i) The institution or branch campus, as applicable, seeks initial participation in that program; or (ii) The institution has undergone a change of ownership that results in a change of control, as determined under 34 CFR 600.31. (f) Revocation of provisional certification.
