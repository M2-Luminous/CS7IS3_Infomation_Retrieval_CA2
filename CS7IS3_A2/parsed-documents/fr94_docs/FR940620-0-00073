FR940620-0-00073 FR940620-0-00026 4. We will revise our LPTV application acceptance standards and adopt a ``substantially complete'' test. We agree with the overwhelming majority of commenters that the strict acceptance standard is no longer necessary in light of the reduced number of LPTV applications being filed with the Commission and in light of the improved quality of those applications. We are persuaded by the comments and by our processing experience to favor the substantially complete standard over a mid-level standard. We do not believe that the substantially complete standard will lead to a lessening of the overall quality of LPTV application submissions, nor significantly delay the authorization of LPTV service. Conversely, this standard will enable the authorization of more stations for each filing window. We believe that this modification of our application acceptance standards will greatly benefit LPTV applicants, many of whom have limited resources. We note that while we will give applicants an opportunity to cure defects in otherwise substantially complete applications, the corrected application must adhere to the Commission's rules and policies. For instance, if an amendment to an application eliminates predicted interference to one station but at the same time introduces interference to another station, the amended application will not be accepted and will be returned. Similarly, an application that is not substantially complete, that is not submitted with the proper fee, or that is not timely filed cannot be cured via subsequent amendment. 5. The Commission has developed a body of case law over the years governing broadcast applications that were subject to the substantially complete standard. 2 From these decisions, certain criteria were established, even though each case turned on the particular facts involved. In the cases where applications failed the test, it was found that many sections of the applications were deficient to a significant degree or were omitted entirely, so as to lack sufficient information regarding the adequacy of the proposals vis-a-vis the public interest. 3 Amendments were allowed to correct errors, unless the application, judged as a whole, was ``so patently violative of the rules as to make its processing a futile gesture.'' 4 2 See generally, Miami STV, Inc., 42 RR 2d 1056 (Broadcast Bureau 1978); KALE, Inc., 56 FCC 2d 1033 (1975); Trustees of Dartmouth College , 29 RR 2d 59 (1973); Central Florida Enterprises, Inc., 22 FCC 2d 260 (1970). Prior to the adoption of the stricter LPTV and FM standards, all broadcast applications were processed under the substantially complete standard. 3 See National Business Network , 82 FCC 2d 220 (1978). For instance, in Henry M. Lesher , 67 FCC 2d 278 (1977), an FM application lacked substantial portions of the legal and financial sections and almost all of the community ascertainment information. Characterizing the omissions as ``glaring'' and ``numerous,'' the Commission stated that they impaired its ability to evaluate the applicant's qualifications under the public interest standard, and that conclusion was compelled by the cumulative impact of each uncompleted section. In Voice of Information , 27 FCC 2d 723 (1971), an FM application was judged on the basis of ``degree of completeness'' and rejected because it omitted the entire engineering and EEO sections and significant portions of the legal, financial and ascertainment sections. The Commission concluded that it lacked ``sufficient information to reach many of the necessary determinations regarding the adequacy of the proposal *␣*␣*'' Id . at 725. In George E. Oleson , 5 FCC 2d 58 (1966), recon. denied , 6 FCC 2d 5021 (1967), an AM application was ``incomplete in many respects'' because it lacked significant portions of the financial, ascertainment, program service and engineering sections. In Rancocas Valley Broadcasting Co., Inc., 95 FCC 2d 429 (1983), an AM application lacked a proper signature, six of ten answers concerning parties to the proposal, and a financial certification. The Commission characterized the missing data as essential to a threshold showing, given their quantity and significance. 4 K & L Communications, Inc., 70 FCC 2d 1987, 1989 (1979) (TV application found acceptable despite financial and minor EEO omissions); see also National Business Network , supra , note 3 (TV application acceptable despite defects in some financial information, ascertainment and description of STV proposal); Racine Telecasting Co., 51 RR 2d 1205 (1985) (TV application acceptable despite seven omissions in the engineering section); Communications Gaithersburg, Inc., 60 FCC 2d 537 (1976) (signature defect can be rectified); Anax Broadcasting, Inc., 87 FCC 2d 483 (1981) (TV application acceptable despite incomplete source of funds and contemplation of additional unknown limited partners); Galaxy Broadcasting, Inc., 46 RR 2d 1654 (Broadcast Bureau 1980) (TV application acceptable despite omissions in STV proposal and ascertainment surveys); Focus Broadcasting of the Monterey Peninsula, Inc., 49 RR 2d 1451 (Broadcast Bureau 1981) (TV application acceptable despite failure to document availability of funds); LDA Communications, Inc., 49 RR 2d 1290 (Broadcast Bureau 1981) (TV application acceptable despite omission of loan and equipment credit documentation).
