It is a difficult operation, people need a great deal of courage to endure this very important change and a few more months will be needed to make sure that things are moving in the right direction. In any case, France stands side by side with Africa, working with it and supporting it, doing what we have already been doing since January, namely, ensuring a very concrete follow-up with very significant measures taken as time goes by to help our partners live through this difficult period. [Balique] The key word is recovery, both internal and export-driven. According to your information, are encouraging signs or shudders already visible? The case of the Ivory Coast is an example, but is there any other? [Roussin] I believe that we could go beyond your excellent wording, you say shudders, I believe that we can go beyond that. There are very encouraging signs in a certain number of countries, I am thinking of Burkina Faso. You mentioned the Ivory Coast, one could also speak of the situation in Gabon and, since we are in Dakar, of positive developments in the Senegalese capital. I can observe very encouraging signs, but other conditions must be met for a genuine recovery. Legal guarantees, a single legal system, are needed to give a certain number of guarantees to investors. A noticeable growth must be observed too. I am very optimistic and I am convinced that we will see growth resume and, at last, development become a reality. [Balique] Some French businessmen complain of difficulties encountered in transferring funds. [Roussin] Rightly so. You are right to stress this problem. Some of our fellow nationals who are doing business in Africa encounter very serious difficulties. My mission is to listen to them and persuade my colleagues, the economics minister and the minister for social affairs, to make sure that problems encountered by our fellow countrymen facing difficult times are being taken in consideration. I met a certain number of French businessmen in Dakar today, they are facing very serious difficulties and I appealed to the president of the republic. I asked him to make sure that when measures are taken concerning the settlement of the foreign debt, measures will also be taken to guarantee that debts owed to French businesses by, let us say, the Senegalese Government, are settled as well, because businesses too are sometimes owed very large sums of money. In the current situation Senegal must absolutely do something for French businesses.
