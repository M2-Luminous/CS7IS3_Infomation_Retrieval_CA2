"We see no other cases to investigate except those in which we have indicted suspects so far," said Tatsuhiro Ishikawa, deputy chief prosecutor of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office which has probed the scandals. Following the investigations, the prosecutors indicted 32 people, including a Diet legislator, two governors, two mayors and officials of eight major construction companies, and a large paper manufacturer. There was speculation that several Diet members were likely to be charged, but former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura was the only Diet member to be indicted. Nakamura, 45, a House of Representatives member, was charged April 1 with accepting a 10 million yen bribe in January 1992 from leading contractor Kajima Corp. He left the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) shortly before he was arrested. Nakamura is still under detention at the Tokyo detention house. The prosecutors have decided not to charge a 63-year-old former executive of Mitsui Construction Co. who allegedly embezzled 10 million yen disbursed from the company's coffers to be donated to former LDP Secretary General Seiroku Kajiyama, 68, a lower house member, Ishikawa said. Ishikawa told a press conference that investigators dropped the case because the executive has paid back the money to Mitsui Construction and because the company does not demand any punishment. Some newspapers have reported that Mitsui Construction, in the spring of 1991, gave 10 million yen to the Kajiyama camp to win a public works contract. Prosecutors probed whether Kajiyama violated the law, but the executive told investigators about the alleged embezzlement, which means the LDP lawmaker did not receive the money. Former Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hideo Watanabe, 59, a former LDP lower house member, allegedly received a total of 40 million yen in secret donations from Kajima Corp. from 1988 through 1991 as a reward for helping the company get a 43 billion yen contract. Prosecutors suspected Watanabe violated the Political Funds Control Law in receiving 10 million yen out of the 40 million yen, but it was found legal because Kajima donated the money through a fund-raising organization. Prosecutors now only plan supplementary investigations into the Nakamura case, including questioning of his secretaries and former LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru, Ishikawa said. Kanemaru, 79, is currently on trial for income tax evasion. Evidence seized during investigations into the Kanemaru case in March last year led to probes into the series of bribery scandals. Aside from Nakamura, politicians charged during the probes are former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi, 76, former Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro Honma, 54, former Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii, 68, and Masahiro Oyama, 49, former mayor of the town of Sanwa, Ibaraki Prefecture. Prosecutors also indicted officials and executives of eight major construction companies -- Hazama Corp., Kajima Corp., Mitsui Construction Co., Nishimatsu Construction Co., Obayashi Corp., Shimizu Corp., Taisei Corp. and Tobishima Corp. -- and Daishowa Paper Mfg. Co., a major paper manufacturer. Of the 32 people indicted, the guilt of former town Mayor Oyama and three other people -- one of his aides and two construction firm officials -- has already been established. In a Feb. 15 decision, the Tokyo District Court gave Oyama a two and a half year suspended prison sentence. He was also ordered to pay 14 million yen to the state coffers -- the amount he received in bribe money.
