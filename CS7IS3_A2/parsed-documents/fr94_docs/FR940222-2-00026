The Agency uses these data to monitor the use of the collar, and to ensure the safety of livestock. Burden Statement: The burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 37.1 hours per response for reporting, and 2.9 hours per recordkeeper annually. This estimate includes the time needed to review instructions, gather the data needed, and review the collection of information. Respondents: Toxic collar applicators.
