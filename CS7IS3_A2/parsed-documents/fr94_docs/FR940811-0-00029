Order No. 1904&hyph;94 Revision of Delegations of Settlement Authority for Administrative Claims Against the Federal Bureau of Investigation AGENCY: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Attorney General is revising a delegation of authority she has made to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (``FBI''), to settle certain administrative claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act and 31 U.S.C. 3724, so as to allow redelegation to the primary legal advisors of FBI field offices. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Howard M. Shapiro, General Counsel, FBI, Washington, DC 20535, (202) 324&hyph;6829. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under 28 CFR 0.89a, the Attorney General has delegated to the Director of the FBI the authority to determine and settle administrative claims against the FBI pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act for amounts not exceeding $10,000 in any one case, and pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3724 for amounts not exceeding $50,000 in any one case. The Attorney General has also authorized the Director of the FBI to redelegate this authority to the Assistant Director, Legal Counsel Division, or his designee within that division, and has provided that this authority shall not be further redelegated. Restructuring of FBI Headquarters and efficient processing of the large volume of administrative claims against the FBI will be enhanced by further redelegation. This rule revises the current delegation to allow the General Counsel of the FBI to exercise the Director's delegated authority, and to allow for redelegation of the General Counsel's authority to the primary legal advisors of the FBI field offices. Public comment will not be necessary on this rule because its subject is limited to a matter of internal Departmental procedure. This rule is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to that order. As required by the Regulating Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), it is hereby certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on small business entities.
