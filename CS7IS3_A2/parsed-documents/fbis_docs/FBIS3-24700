Aidid will stay in Nairobi for "a few more days" to continue consultations with other factions about the possible formation of an interim government in Somalia before the end of March, Aidid's spokesman Mohamed Hassan Awale said. [passage omitted] He emphasized that the provisional administration would only be set up after a consensus had been reached with other factions. Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction will not impose a government in Somalia, he added. [passage omitted] Aidid is expected to meet representatives from the Somali Salvation Democratic Front, the Somalia National Democratic Union and the Somali National Front later this week before returning to Mogadishu. General Aidid has repeatedly called for UNOSOM's departure accusing the force of killing thousands of Somalis. [passage omitted] Aidid travelled to Uganda from Nairobi on Thursday. He arrived in Kenya late last month after the collapse of United Nations-sponsored peace negotiations in Addis Ababa.
