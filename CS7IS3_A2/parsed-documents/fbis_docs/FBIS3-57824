Jean-Pierre Jacquemin has just interviewed Yildirim Keskin, the Turkish ambassador in Belgium. He has confirmed Ankara's accusations against the Belgian authorities: [Keskin] My ministry believes that the Belgian authorities should not allow the PKK [Kurdistan Workers Party] to hold a meeting in the Turkish district. [Jacquemin] When [Interior] Minister Tobback says that the violent demonstrations by young Turks are not spontaneous, what do you say? [Keskin] I say that he is misinformed, because I have spoken with the people who witnessed these incidents: Everything happened very quickly and spontaneously. [Jacquemin] Does this mean that, according to you, there are no Grey Wolves, these members.... [Keskin, interrupting] I do not know about that. It may be the case. But according to me, nothing was planned in advance. [Jacquemin] This morning you met Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes. [Keskin] Yes. This is only a hitch, we agreed on the fact that violence could not settle anything and that the heat should come off all this. [Jacquemin] According to you, will things quiete down over the next few hours? [Keskin] But things have already calmed down, I think. [Jacquemin] Yes, that is also what we thought yesterday, but there were more riots.... [Keskin, interrupting] No. I believe that the PKK group which came from Bonn is to leave Belgium this evening or tomorrow morning, and that is it. [passage omitted]
