Yeltsin's spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told reporters at a briefing that summit was discussed in a phone conversation between the two leaders late Wednesday and would include in addition to themselves leaders from the United Nations, the European Union and the warring sides in the former Yugoslavia. The two leaders, who spoke for about 40 minutes, agreed that the conference required careful planning but stressed that the situation was "red-hot" in Bosnia, Kostikov said. "The assurance was given that all decisions to resolve the conflict would be jointly taken", Kostikov added. "Any attempt at an individual, unilateral solution is not constructive," he said. Yeltsin reiterated his firm stand in favor of peaceful solutions and his rejection of "any type of bombing" by NATO warplanes in Bosnia. [passage omitted] In Paris, French President Francois Mitterrand expressed satisfaction over the planned conference, which he said should be held as soon as possible considering the urgency of the situation, his spokesman Jean Musitelli said Thursday.
