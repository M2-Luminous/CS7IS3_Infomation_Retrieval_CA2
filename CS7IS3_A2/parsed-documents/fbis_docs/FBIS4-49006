Lu's snub was delivered on the day that an opinion poll showed an overwhelming majority of the Hong Kong public want him to put aside his differences with Patten. According to the poll, prepared by the public opinion survey centre of the Oriental Press Group, for Eastern Express and Oriental Daily News, 71 percent of those questioned think Lu should meet the Governor and 65 percent support Patten's written invitation to Lu to meet him. Another 74 percent said Lu should then invite the governor to visit Beijing to talk about Hong Kong issues. This will be Lu's first visit to Hong Kong since Patten took office in 1992. They have only met once, shortly after the Governor had published his reform plans that angered China. Patten said yesterday that he was disappointed by Lu's decision. "Today, director Lu Ping has written to say that his schedule is so busy in Hong Kong that he won't, on this occasion, be able to visit and to have a discussion though I think he suggested that there may be opportunities in the future which, indeed, I very much hope is the case," he said. "I am prepared to cross any street, open any door, shake any hand, talk to anyone if it is in the interest of Hong Kong. I think that is what people in Hong Kong would expect. I think people in Hong Kong want us to talk together." The Governor said that in his letter inviting Lu to a meeting, he suggested two topics for discussion. "The first is the whole question of property prices because I want to put him in the picture about how we saw the situation and what we thought was the right way forward in tackling it," he said. "The second issue which I said I would like to talk to him about was the transition of the civil service which is another issue which is important for us both." The Governor's views are reflected in the poll, which shows more than half the people--53 percent--think the two should discuss political issues. Another 40 percent believe Hong Kong people's livelihood should be on the agenda. However, 46 percent believe it would be unlikely that Hong Kong-Chinese relations could be improved even if there was such a meeting, while 38 percent were optimistic that a meeting between the governor and Lu would result in an improvement of relations. The poll was conducted on Tuesday and yesterday, interviewing a representative cross-section of 260 people. According to the 1991 Memorandum of Understanding signed by the British and Chinese foreign ministers, there should be regular meetings between the Governor and Lu to discuss Hong Kong affairs. The Governor said that if Lu's schedule was too busy to meet him, it must be too busy to meet any senior civil servants as well. Mike Hanson, the senior government spokesman, said yesterday the poll was "revealing." "It shows that the people of Hong Kong want Lu Ping to meet the governor to discuss important issues that people are worried about. If such a meeting does not happen, it is for the Chinese to explain why," he said. Li Weiting, an assistant to the director of the local New China News Agency (Xinhua), said since Hong Kong was a part of Chinese territory, the British administration here was nothing more than a "caretaker" and Xinhua was Hong Kong's "real master," it was natural that Lu would not meet the governor. The United Democrats are writing a letter to Lu to request a meeting with him while he is in Hong Kong, to address their concerns, such as the case of Xi Yang, the Ming Pao reporter sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. A pro-China legislator, Tam Yiu-chung, of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), also said Lu should meet the Governor although the atmosphere was "not quite right" for such a meeting. "It will do Lu no good if he refuses to meet Patten. But it shows that China is still cross about Patten and Britain. We hope in future there will be such a chance," said Tam. Hong Kong journalists also plan to lobby Lu to free Xi and petition him to relax the reporting restrictions in China. Lu arrives in Hong Kong on Sunday from Guangzhou and will stay for about eight days. He will meet the Preliminary Working Committee members, Hong Kong affairs advisers, and delegates to the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all appointed by China.
