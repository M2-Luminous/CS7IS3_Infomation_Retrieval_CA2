The motto of the congress is work, income, and social security. In addition to 200 delegates and some 50 domestic and foreign guests, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia President Zoran Lilic also participated in the morning session. Miroslav Pisarevic reports: [Begin recording] [Pisarevic] The congress began with the strains of The International and was opened by Grozdana Miljanovic, president of the 2-million-member organization. She stressed that the federal trade union had -- in the period between two congresses -- focused on the needs of the working masses and their families. The trade union has supported the program of the country's economic revival, said Miljanovic. [passage omitted] The congress was also addressed by Federal Republic of Yugoslavia President Zoran Lilic. He stressed that the congress is taking place at a time when our country is exposed to strong pressure, blackmail from abroad, and the economic blockade. [Lilic] We have been punished by a complete blockade and an attempt at absolute international isolation because we have chosen negotiations as a way out of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, because we have chosen a political solution and peace, rather than the way of terror and violence. A way which, unfortunately, has in many ways been paved by the international community itself, with its diffidence and inclination toward the extortionist demands of the Muslim fundamentalists. The unjustified and inhuman sanctions -- which, alas, we must always mention, and this gathering here today is no exception -- such as have never been implemented against a single country in the international community, have been imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia based on false accusations. Today, many former politicians that directly participated in the breaking up of Yugoslavia openly admit this and justify it by saying that it was carried out under pressure and without an objective assessment of the realistic situation in the former Yugoslavia. [Pisarevic] The economic situation in the country was particularly difficult toward the end of last year. However, we soon successfully started implementing the new economic program, President Lilic said, and added. [Lilic] I would venture to say that the program, which was already discussed here a short while ago, is proof of our strength, our perseverance, and our vitality. A growing number of countries throughout the world are showing interest in the Yugoslav program and the results that have been achieved so far. The people that imposed the sanctions expected a breakdown of the political, economic, cultural, scientific, and all other life in Yugoslavia. To put it succinctly, they expected complete capitulation. Instead, something unprecedented in economic theory has happened. In place of the desired chaos, we have attained a firm dinar, eliminated the hyperinflation, pared the money emission down to realistic [word indistinct], and stabilized the prices and the realistic exchange rate of the dinar. The Yugoslav dinar on the world exchanges -- and I especially want to stress this here today -- is a language that the Western world, particularly the Western business community on which the world rests, understands very well. [Pisarevic] We are glad that we can defend the sovereignty and integrity of Yugoslavia with a strong dinar, stressed Lilic, and added. [Lilic] The most important thing for our economic and every other form of prosperity is to turn our attention to work and knowledge and first search here for solutions to our problems. That is why the implementation of the program is our collective work and mutual responsibility. More order and more work in our economy, in these complex circumstances, and the mobilization of all forces for reviving the economy, as stipulated by the program [sentence as heard]. It is only through our work and knowledge, and the rational and effective use of our own potential, that we can attain the position that is rightfully ours among the countries of the world. The basic thing is to believe in ourselves, to know what we want, and to have the strength to actually achieve it. [end recording]
