The Iranian Government's disclosure about this illegal act was "coincident with the ballyhoo started by the British Government on the alleged Iranian financial assistance for the Irish Republican Army (IRA)," noted the paper. It argued that the Irish Americans were the greatest supporters of the IRA and their financial and logistic assistance to IRA, with the green light from the C.I.A., was considered normal and acceptable in international political circles. While the statesmen in London found it prudent to condone any differences they might have with the U.S. over the issue of IRA, they apparently felt it was necessary to transfer their internal crisis to other parts of the world, said the paper. Urging Iran's Government to continue to exert pressure until British authorities were ready to accept responsibilty, the paper concluded "we should not allow such glaring cases of violation of the country's national sovereignty be easily forgotten."
