But last year, Moldova joined the CIS anyway. How do you explain the change of attitude? [Botnaru] Our links with the CIS are of a specific nature. We are a de facto member of the CIS's economic union, but not de iure, since we have not ratified the appropriate documents. My view is that from an economic standpoint, Moldova should be in the CIS's economic union since that is the real situation from which we cannot get away. Our economic relations with the West still leave a lot to be desired, but one must live somehow until that situation changes. Generally speaking, the economic relations of a new country should be multifaceted. [Haszczynski] Is Moldova interested in the CIS only from an economic standpoint? [Botnaru] We do not participate in the CIS's military and political structures. So far, we have not signed any agreements which would relate, for instance, to security. What is important, is what shape the CIS will take in the future. Experience shows that those countries which have traditionally been together, can make their lots easier if they act together. But one should take part in such cooperation arrangements only insofar as it does not endanger a country's sovereignty. [Haszczynski] Do you not feel threatened by Russia? [Botnaru] I regard our relations with Russia to be correct, but there are still many problems which were inherited from the Soviet Union, first of all the problem of the 14th Russian Army which is stationed in Moldova. In my view, all problems can be solved if both sides conduct a dialogue. I paid a visit to Moscow recently, where I spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. We listed the unresolved problems in Russian-Moldovan relations and we signed a bilateral agreement. Moldova has ratified it but Russia has not done so yet, and because of that, solving other problems is being delayed, for instance the problem of gasoline supplies to former Soviet military personnel residing in Moldova. A withdrawal of the 14th Army would have an exceptionally positive impact on the development of Russian-Moldovan relations. The problem of the Cisdniester region is linked to that. We think that some elements of Russia's relations with the Cisdniester region could be described as interference in Moldova's internal affairs. I mean the issue of Russian aid for the Cisdniester region, both in material and political terms. [Haszczynski] Was there any specific date set during your Moscow talks, for the 14th Army's withdrawal from the usurpatory Cisdniester Republic? [Botnaru] Moldova's position is that the Russian Army should withdraw by 1 July of this year. I regard that date as realistic. Despite everything, there are fewer [Russian] troops on our territory than used to be the case with Poland or other East European countries. The withdrawal should be unconditional and in accordance with international law and CSCE provisions. Talks are under way. Moldova is absolutely against having foreign troops stationed on its territory. I want to remind you that all countries recognize Moldova within the boundaries in which it proclaimed its independence in 1991, and that includes the Cisdniester region. [Haszczynski] How do you imagine a calming down of the situation in the Cisdniester region? After all, fights have already erupted there a few times and hundreds of people have died. Is it possible, for instance, that Moldova should be transformed into a federation? [Botnaru] No. I think that the variety of nationalities and their distribution in the various regions, make a federal state impossible. Moldova is a small territory (33,700 square km) which would be split into many small units if a federation was to be established. Besides, the base criterion of a federation is not completely clear, either. We used to live in the Soviet Union and we were told then that it was a federation. As far as the Cisdniester region is concerned, we granted very far-reaching concessions and we guaranteed that if the issue of Moldova's joining Romania came up, then the people of the Cisdniester region could decide the territory's fate through a referendum. Almost all political forces in Moldova think that the Cisdniester region should have some kind of special status. The necessity of a decentralization is linked with that. Some amendments to our laws are indispensable, including the law on languages. We must talk about a possibility of using several languages in the country's offices: Let us say one of them would be called the state language (Romanian), and the other two would be called official languages (Ukrainian and Russian). The new parliament and the new cabinet should start working on these changes soon. [Haszczynski] Do you really believe in a compromise? After all, the authorities of the Trans-Dniester region have announced that the region will take part neither in the parliamentary elections (27 February) nor in the referendum on Moldova's sovereignty and integrity (6 March). [Botnaru] We do not seek the authorities' participation, especially given that these are not lawful authorities. We are after the people's participation; the usurpatory authorities' control does not extend to the entire Cisdniester region. There are areas and villages which cooperate with us. According to what we have found out, the people living in the parts not under the control of the usurpatory regime, will vote. [Haszczynski] In official documents, your country is known as the Republic of Moldova. Do the authorities of the republic (which gained independence more than two years ago) think that using the old name of "Moldavia" (which was used in the Soviet period, among others) is inappropriate? [Botnaru] "Moldavia" is a word of Russian origin. Right now, Romanian is our official language, and in Romanian, our country's name is "Moldova." But we have nothing against someone using the Russian-derived name in newspapers, for instance, as long as the name is used with respect. [Haszczynski] How strong are the desires of Moldova to join Romania, to which most of today's Moldova had belonged before World War II? [Botnaru] There are opposition political forces both in Moldova and in Romania, which are in favor of a merger of the two countries. I think the opposition is short-sighted. There will be a referendum on 6 March which will finally decide the issue of Moldova's sovereignty. But a referendum like this had taken place before -- I mean the presidential elections of 1991. The main slogan of the election campaign of Mircea Snegur -- who gained over 80 percent of the vote -- was Moldova's independence. A majority of Moldovans (Romanians) is in favor of independence. Almost all representatives of national minorities are against the merger, as well; these minorities comprise about 30 percent of the population. I think that those who are in favor of merging with Romania comprise no more than 5 percent. [Haszczynski] But still, Moldova's national flag is the same as Romania's (three vertical stripes -- blue, yellow, and red) and the national anthem -- which begins with the words: "Wake up, Romanian" -- is also the same. [Botnaru] The colors of the flag are indeed the same, but there is a state emblem on our flag. I think that since the parliament adopted the flag along with the state symbol, then that is the way it must stay, especially since, for instance, the Russian and the French flags have the same colors and their combination is the only thing that makes them different. So I can see no problem with the national flag. But it is a different story with the national anthem. A sovereign state should have its own national anthem. As a diplomat, I often encounter this protocol problem. My view is that the anthem must be changed. One must write a new anthem and the parliament should adopt it. And that will not be an unfriendly gesture toward anybody, since nowhere in the world do you have a situation of two sovereign states sharing the same national anthem. [Haszczynski] In your view, what should one call representatives of the nationality which constitutes the majority in Moldova? Are they Romanians or Moldovans? Is the language that they use Romanian or Moldavian (as it was called in the times of the Soviet Union)? President Mircea Snegur has recently expressed criticism about using "a Romanian," "Romanian," instead of "a Moldovan," "Moldovan." [Botnaru] It is a unique kind of problem -- it contains elements of history, as well as linguistic, psychological, and ethnic sciences. I would not like to go into such details. What is more important is that Moldova be transformed into a country of its citizens. Everyone should have a right to be called what he wants. [Haszczynski] On 14-16 February, you paid a visit to Warsaw. You spoke with President Lech Walesa, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, and Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. What are Moldova's political and economic expectations vis-a-vis Poland? [Botnaru] Poland's and Moldova's economies complement one another, so they can cooperate with each other as well. Some contracts have already been prepared pertaining to avoiding double taxation and protecting investments. Polish people will like our alcohol -- wines, high-quality champagnes, and cognacs. On a more serious note, Poland can import from Moldova agricultural products, broadly speaking. We are aware that Polish businessmen are afraid to invest because of the conflict in the Cisdniester region, but the conditions for investment will improve soon. Poland is an active country and its voice counts on the international scene. It is a big country with big possibilities. We regret that our two countries have, so far, failed to set up a legal framework for our mutual relations. We are happy to take note of the establishment of a Polish Embassy in Chisinau in the near future. I do not hide the fact that we hope to receive assistance from the Polish authorities on issues where we have problems. The 14th Russian Army is stationed in Moldova, whereas Polish people have experience when it comes to the withdrawal of Russian troops.
