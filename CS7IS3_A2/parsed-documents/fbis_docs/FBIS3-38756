In an interview granted to Onda Cero, Aznar asserted that following last week's trade union protest he hopes to convince the Spanish people that the best thing is "the complete government alternative" that he represents. Aznar emphasized that the government of Felipe Gonzalez is "a victim of its deceptions," which are causing it "a great lack of credibility among the Spanish people." "This country cannot be brought through like this," he said. In the opinion of the People's Party leader, many of Spain's problems depend "on that political change occurring" -- but, he specified, "when it can. In the meantime," he added, "we must seek to ensure that the country does not deteriorate." Aznar emphasized the need to analyze, discuss, and debate the situation "where the country's political solutions must be found, which is in the Congress of Deputies." For this reason, he explained, the People's Party has demanded that the state of the nation debate be held in February. The party is opposed to postponing it until after the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] congress in March. "If it is not held now, in this very grave crisis situation, when will it be held?" he asked. The People's Party chairman maintained his support for the labor reform measures promoted by the government, but at some distance and without forgoing specific criticisms. For instance, he supported the apprenticeship contracts because, he specified, "a cheap contract is preferable to (a young person's) having no job." He criticized, however, the regulation of the apprenticeship contracts. "It seems to me absolutely wrong," he said, "that a 28-year-old person can be defined as an apprentice." The alternatives would be work experience contracts for young people who have failed in their education or vocational training. Aznar accused Gonzalez' government of reducing the purchasing power of pensioners, maintained that the state welfare system could become financially unviable if the economic situation deteriorates, and called for a parliamentary committee to oversee the process of refloating Banesto [Credit Bank of Spain], which will cost every Spanish family 14,000 pesetas, he said. Finally, Aznar proposed a reflection on the nationalists' role. "If a policy, as a result of which the only thing that concerns a certain territory of a certain community is its own interest, becomes general," he explained, "we will then be making Spain impossible."
