After all, two whole months remain before the so-called zero hour -- two whole months before the period for using our privatization vouchers ends. Some people may have forgotten, or some people may not fully remember the mechanism for using our vouchers and the legal mechanism for the privatization process. It was these matters that our correspondent Nikolay Filippov put to Anatoliy Chubays, the Russian deputy prime minister. [Begin recording] [Filippov] Anatoliy Borisovich, what do we need to do in the remaining two months? [Chubays] It is a short period of time and many people have not yet managed to properly ponder their next moves. [passage omitted] At present we estimate that there are at least 10 million, people who have not yet taken their final decision. [passage omitted] On 1 July the period of validity of the privatization vouchers expires. They need to be used before then. [passage omitted] Our figures show that the involvement of foreigners in the voucher privatization process has been very insignificant. In fewer than 10 percent of cases has foreign capital been involved in the voucher privatization process itself. There is no sense therefore in saying that our homeland is being sold off for a song. [passage omitted] We now see, especially over the past few months, a sharp increase in the involvement of foreign capital at the post-voucher stage. [passage omitted] When I see that at the post-voucher stage many major firms such as Siemens, Proctor and Gamble, and Philip Morris are investing tens of billions of dollars in Russian enterprises, it signifies for me an upsurge in Russian enterprises and the start of a growth in dividends. [passage omitted] Dividends grow and at the same time the Russian economy gains, because it means increased production, new jobs, and the start of an emergence from the crisis that we are now in. Indeed, we are starting to emerge through the inflow of investments that have been forthcoming only because private enterprises and joint-stock companies are concerned. This is a guarantee of a real start to an upsurge of the Russian economy as a whole. [passage omitted] [end recording]
