The general secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was speaking at a seminar of people attending a four-day national party school working conference which ended here today. The seminar was presided over by Hu Jingtao, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the party Central Committee. Jiang said that with more efforts devoted to study, all the party's work would go more smoothly. The point of study, he said, was to have a good grasp of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In addition, he said, all members of the party should make great efforts to learn the basics of a socialist market economy and related policies, laws and regulations. They should also know something of modern science and technology, and learn from the experience of Chinese history, especially modern history, and the international history of socialism. Jiang noted that the Communist Party had always paid attention to study, especially when the whole party faced a new situation and fresh tasks. The great achievements that China had made during the past 15 years were to a large degree the fruits of study, he said. "A blueprint for a new economic structure was drawn up through the decisions made at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee last year," he said. "Our reform, covering economy, politics, culture and social life, is making a rapid progress. The rapidly changing situation presents to us many new problems and thorny questions and the difficulty in our work has increased. The way out is to admit our weaknesses and find solutions through profound studies," he said. The general secretary reiterated at the seminar that while studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, one should take into his heart its essence -- mind emancipation and seeking truth from facts -- and study hard to grasp a dialectical, historical, materialist and scientific world outlook and methodology. He called on all local party schools to further observe the policy of integrating theory with practice in their teaching. Party schools should, adjusting to the new situation, improve their education quality to a higher level.
