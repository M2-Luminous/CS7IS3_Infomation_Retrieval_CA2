The measure was adopted by Miguel Aparicio Ramirez, general commander of the Anzoategui State Military Garrison, at the governor's behest because the police could no longer control the violence which last week and over the past two days has evolved into vandalism, pillage, and plunder. Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz were totally calm today. The presence of Army and National Guard units patrolling the streets of the Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz conurbation was noted and welcomed by residents because, at least for today, calm has been restored in the area. Transportation service has fully resumed, allowing workers and students to fulfill their duties. Stores have reopened and are conducting business as usual. Governor Ovidio Gonzalez, who finally met with reporters this morning, said the situation in northern Anzoategui State has been totally normalized, but he refused to admit that Barcelona as well as Puerto La Cruz had awoke to [words indistinct] units of the Armed Forces and National Guard, saying it is a routine decision when there has been violence such as the recent incidents. Gonzalez disclosed that agreements had been reached by the leaders of the Anzoategui State Transportation Union and the mayors' offices of the state's two leading municipalities, which are Bolivar (Barcelona) and Sotillo (Puerto La Cruz), to release [sincerar] fares. While this happens, bus fares will be lowered until the respective agreements are signed by the transportation sector and the municipal councils, which are the authorities that set bus fares. On another issue, the governor denied that the search conducted by police at the Anzoategui branch of Oriente University was a search, claiming that the measure was adopted to prevent trucks transporting food and other merchandise from being hijacked and sacked inside the university. Gonzalez said the police entered the university to retrieve trucks that had been hijacked by hooded individuals and infiltrators determined to create chaos in the city. The police accomplished that task without violating any student rights. Aside from that, the governor added, we cannot allow a person, just because he is a student and can seek shelter at the university, to perpetrate abuses and create disorder that affects the general public. I was once a student, and such things did not take place in our day. We protested by staging demonstrations, and things went no further. Governor Gonzalez explained that it is the governor's duty to preserve the people's property and physical security, which is what the Armed Forces are helping to do, so peace and normalcy can return to the area. Gonzalez concluded by saying that for the time being, no demonstrations will be permitted.
