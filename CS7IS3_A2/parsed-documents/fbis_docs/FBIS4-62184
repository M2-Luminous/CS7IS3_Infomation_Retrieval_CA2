Yerevan and Stepanakert Are Content With the Results of the Bishkek Meeting"] [Excerpt] Armenian parliament speaker Babken Ararktsyan believes that realism has triumphed at the meeting in Bishkek. Its main achievement, according to him, has been the recognition by all the participants in the negotiations of some political realities, without which the advance to peace is impossible. These are: a stable cease-fire, recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict, and lifting all blockades -- and only after this, discussions about the status of the region. Ararktsyan stressed several times that the proposed plan is based on a "land in exchange for peace" formula, which carries a substantial share of risk for Armenia and Karabakh. But in exchange Armenia and Karabakh will get territories, from which their troops will be pulled out, as well as the lifting of the blockade, and peace. Both acquisitions, in Ararktsyan's opinion, are fairly fragile because the blockade can be easily resumed and peace breached. But Yerevan and Stepanakert are ready to take "the risk of peace" even with minimum guarantees, which provided a foundation for their signing the Bishkek protocol without any provisos. Baku's hesitations, on the other hand, were quite lengthy. Yerevan is inclined to believe that they were primarily related to the fact that Azerbaijan lacks a coherent policy with respect to the CIS and, secondly, its hope to secure support in NATO headquarters and in Ankara, which Geydar Aliyev has visited. And only when it became clear that NATO is not disposed toward serious military support of Azerbaijan, and Ankara confined itself to purely rhetorical statements, was it decided to sign the protocol, although with some qualifications. The addition of the word "international" to the term "observers" apparently suits Yerevan and Stepanakert no less than it does Baku. True, the replacement of the definition "acquired [zanyatyye] territories" by "captured [zakhvachennyye] territories" does not seem just so unequivocal because this immediately raises the question of who exactly captured them. On this count, incidentally, Vladimir Shumeyko, in his closing statement in Bishkek, said that during the discussion of this point the Karabakh side agreed even to the term "occupied" [okkupirovannyye], but demanded the specification that these territories were occupied precisely by the Defense Army of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. At the time this was assessed as an aspiration toward indirect affirmation of status, and the formulation was rejected. Even so, neither Yerevan nor Stepanakert so far has any official confirmation that the Azerbaijan side has really signed the protocol. According to Ashot Antinyan, adviser to the Armenian parliament speaker, "Apart from a telephone assurance by Rasul Guliyev, we have no other evidence about this." The speaker's aide furthermore expressed a certain amazement over the fact that of the two [authorized] copies [ekzemplyary] of the text of the protocol, one is in St. Petersburg, at the headquarters of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, and the other is in Bishkek, and therefore it is not clear which of them has been signed by the head of the Azerbaijan parliament. Duplicates [Kopii] in such cases have no legal validity. According to Arkadiy Gukasyan, foreign minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, neither has anyone in Stepanakert seen the text signed by Guliyev. [passage omitted]
