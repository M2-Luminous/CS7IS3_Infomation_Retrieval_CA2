At present Russian specialists are completing the technical research. It is expected the power station, which is to produce one seventh of Iran's demand in electricity, will be ready for operation in five years' time. The construction of the nuclear power station was started in the seventies by two German companies, however it was stopped before the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war. The Iranian leadership wavered for a long time as to whether it would be expedient to complete the construction, but when Tehran decided in an affirmative way Germany abdicated its commitments because of fears that the nuclear program might acquire a military direction. IAEA inspections to the Bushehr nuclear power station did not confirm the fears. In addition to participating in the construction of the nuclear power station, Russia will receive a contract to build a gas-fired thermal power station in the same region. According to political observers, new Iranian-Russian relations in the field of power engineering will boost bilateral cooperation in the political and economic spheres and will also bring to Russia hard currency it so badly needs.
