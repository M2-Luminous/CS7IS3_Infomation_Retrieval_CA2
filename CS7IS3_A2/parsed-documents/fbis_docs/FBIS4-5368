Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said China had talked with North Korea over the nuclear question. "But, North Korea listened to us some times, and at some other times they did not," Wu said. During his call on President Kim Yong-sam, the Chinese official said that denuclearization ought to be realized on the Korean peninsula. He was quick to add, however, that if pressures were applied to North Korea to this end, it is prone to aggravate the situation. "I am sure that if South Korea promotes its policies toward North Korea with patience, denuclearization would be realized some time," he said. During the meeting, President Kim said that if North Korea develops nuclear arms, it would be a misfortune not only for peace in Northeast Asia and the world but also for North Korea itself. If North Korea returns to dialogue with the South in a sincere manner, South Korea would furnish economic support to North Korea and help them improve relations with the United States and Japan, President Kim said. Wu flew into Seoul Sunday for an eight-day official visit at the invitation of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu.
