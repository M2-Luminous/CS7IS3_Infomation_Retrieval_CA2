FR940711-0-00017 FR940711-0-00003 The Department has analyzed the production and sale of almonds since the inception of the Almond Marketing Order. Over the past forty years, the production and sale of almonds, both in this country and abroad, have increased dramatically. In the 1950's, almond production grew from 19 million to 84 million pounds per year and the value increased from $15 to $38 million. By 1969, production had reached 132 million pounds per year at a value of $74 million. During the 1950's and 1960's, the domestic market was the primary outlet for California almonds. Supplies which exceeded the needs of the domestic market were exported or put to other ``non-competitive'' uses, such as sliced, diced and slivered almonds. In 1969, shipments of almonds to export markets exceeded domestic shipments for the first time. Most export shipments were of reserve almonds which were sold at prices below domestic levels. The Almond Marketing Order was amended in 1971 to provide for further market development through the establishment of a creditable advertising and generic promotion program. These programs have been in effect since 1972. In recommending that the Almond Marketing Order be amended to authorize advertising and promotion programs, proponents within the almond industry believed that advertising almonds would tend to increase almond consumption and enhance grower returns. The Department's analysis of sales figures for almonds during the last twenty-two years demonstrate that this belief was correct. The adoption of the creditable advertising and generic promotion programs has fostered a period of steady growth in the demand for almonds, both domestically and abroad. From 1972 to 1992, domestic shipments of almonds increased from 75 million pounds to 186 million pounds and their value increased from $63 million in 1972 to $318 million in 1992. During these years, the creditable advertising and generic promotion programs fostered an even greater rate of growth in the export market. Annual exports of almonds went from 69 million pounds in 1972 to 350 million pounds in 1992 and the value increased from $58 million to $598 million. The industry has benefitted from increased production and sales as consumption grew and almonds expanded into new markets. Currently, the majority of almonds produced in the United States are sold abroad, with the largest markets in Germany and Japan. The California almond industry has become an established supplier of high quality almonds to markets throughout the world and has maintained a dominant share (over 60%) of the overall world almond market for the past ten years. Substantial growth has also occurred in the demand for sliced, diced and slivered almonds, once considered a secondary almond market. Due to market expansion, shipments of almonds for such uses are now considered normal commercial sales. The relative proportion of annual crop sold to ingredient manufacturers in bulk quantities has also increased substantially during the last two decades. Currently, the majority of almonds sold in the United States are sold for use as ingredients in candy, cereal, ice cream, baked goods, cookies, granola bars, prepared meals, and other manufactured products. The Department's data on almond sales to export markets also indicates that the vast majority of almonds sold to European countries are intended for use as ingredients. Since the adoption of the creditable advertising and generic promotion programs there has been an increase in the number of almond handlers operating in the United States. In 1971, there were 15 almond handlers in California and the four largest handled about 95% of the annual crop. By 1991, there were 115 almond handlers in California and the four largest handled 62% of the annual crop. The growth of the almond market has enabled small handlers to enter the industry in greater numbers. The Former Creditable Advertising Program At the time of its adoption in 1971, the almond Marketing Order's advertising and promotion program was structured with a strong emphasis on individual handler advertising and promotion, with a complementary generic program conducted by the Board. Since its implementation, the Secretary has instituted numerous rulemaking actions to revise and update the creditable advertising and promotion program to address changing circumstances in the industry. In revising the program, the Secretary relied, in part, on industry production and sales data and the Board's consistent belief that the industry's advertising and promotion program provided an effective means of increasing almond sales. The Board, on behalf of the industry, responds to changing industry practices and trends by recommending to the Secretary modifications to the Order's implementing regulations and by redesigning its activities to better reflect these changes, thereby ensuring further development of the almond industry. In addition, the Secretary also relied on comments received from almond industry representatives and other interested persons prior to adopting certain amendments to the regulations.
