FR940607-1-00021 FR940607-1-00004 The Commission is proposing to exempt 21 exchange-traded debt securities from the borrowing restrictions of Section 8(a). 22 The proposed exemption to the restrictions on borrowing would eliminate one competitive barrier to the exchange trading of debt securities. Specifically, to the extent that the restrictions of Section 8(a) may encourage underwriters and investment bankers to recommend against debt securities being listed, the proposed exemption would eliminate that impediment to the listing of debt securities on a national securities exchange. 21 Section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act. 22 Proposed Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) would exempt debt securities that are traded on a national securities exchange from the restrictions on borrowing of Section 8(a) of the Exchange Act. A broker-dealer who extends credit on that collateral would continue to be required to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, including Regulation T [17 CFR 220.1 et seq ]. Moreover, the exemption from the restrictions on borrowing could provide certain benefits to the financial system. Under this proposal, a broker-dealer borrowing against a listed debt security could choose among prospective lenders based solely upon the terms of the financing that they offer. For instance, the exemption would make it possible for a broker-dealer to enter into a repurchase agreement with a non-bank institutional investor. This flexibility should help broker-dealers obtain financing at the lowest available cost. For purposes of the proposed rule, the term ``debt security'' would include any security that is not an ``equity security'' as defined by the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder. 23 Comment is solicited as to whether, in lieu of the proposed definition, the term ``debt security'' should be more specifically defined. For example, should the term ``debt security'' be defined as: ``(1) A note, bond, debenture or evidence of indebtedness; (2) a certificate of interest or participation in any such note, bond, debenture or evidence of indebtedness; or (3) a temporary certificate for, or guarantee of, any such note, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness or certificate; but shall not include an `equity security' as defined in Section 3(a)(11) of the Act and Rule 3a11&hyph;1 thereunder''? 24 Comment also is solicited as to whether hybrid debt securities should be treated as debt securities for purposes of Rule 3a12&hyph;11. 23 Proposed Rule 3a12&hyph;11(c). The term ``equity security'' is defined in Section 3(a)(11) [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(11)] and Rule 3a11&hyph;1 [17 CFR 240.3a11&hyph;1] thereunder. Equity securities would include, among other items, stock or similar security, certificates of interest or participation in any profit sharing agreement, voting trust certificate or certificate of deposit for any equity security, limited partnership interest, any security that is convertible, with or without consideration, into an equity security or any warrant or right to subscribe or purchase an equity security. 24 This definition is modeled after Section 304(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, (``Trust Indenture Act'') [15 U.S.C. 77ddd(a)(1)]. The Commission requests commenters to address the scope of the proposed exemption as well as its merits. Are there any categories of listed debt securities that should remain subject to the borrowing restrictions? Interested persons may also wish to comment on how exempting exchange-traded debt securities from Section 8(a) restrictions would affect investor protection in the debt market, including whether the purposes behind the Exchange Act's credit provisions would be frustrated as a result. Interested persons may also wish to comment on the proposed rule's impact on the transparency and liquidity of the market for debt securities. C. Exemption From Compliance With the Proxy Rules A second provision of the proposed rule would exempt debt securities listed on a national securities exchange from proxy regulation. 25 By proposing to exempt debt listed on a national securities exchange from the proxy rules, the Commission seeks to address the disparate application of the proxy rules between listed debt securities and debt securities traded in the OTC market. The proxy rules principally apply to equity securities, since most debt securities are not listed on a national securities exchange and thus not subject to the proxy rules. 26 25 Proposed Rule 3a12&hyph;11(b) would exempt listed debt securities from the proxy, shareholder communications, and information statement rules under Sections 14(a), 14(b), and 14(c) of the Exchange Act. The term ``debt securities'' would be defined in the same manner as in the exemption from the restrictions on borrowing. See proposed Rule 3a12&hyph;11(c). 26 The OTC market is the principal trading market for debt ( see n.20). Of the more than 13,000 publicly traded domestic corporate bond issues in 1989, fewer than 20% (2,135 on the NYSE and 280 on the American Stock Exchange (``AMEX'') were listed on the NYSE and AMEX. See Colloton, ``Bondholder Communications_The Missing Link in High Yield Debt,'' Hill and Knowlton, Inc. at 17 (August 1990). Similarly, less than 20% of the total face amount of corporate debt securities outstanding is listed on the NYSE. See New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Fact Book 54 (1993); Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Flow of Funds Account L.213 (March 9, 1994). In 1963, the Commission submitted a report to Congress that set forth its recommendations as to the scope of regulation needed for the OTC market. 27 These recommendations led to the adoption of Section 12(g) in 1964. The Commission concluded that proxy regulation should not be required with respect to debt securities since Section 14 was designed to protect shareholders and the solicitation of proxies was ``rarely [a] problem[ ] related to debt securities and, then, most probably in insolvency cases when other protections were available.'' 28 Today, solicitations of debtholders subject to the proxy rules continue to be infrequent, with only 18 such solicitations having occurred between 1990 and 1993 with respect to NYSE-listed issuers. 29 27 Report of Special Study of Securities Markets , (``1963 Special Study'') U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, H.R.
