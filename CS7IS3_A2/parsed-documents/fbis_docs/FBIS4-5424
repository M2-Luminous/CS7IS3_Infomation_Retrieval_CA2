Following the incident, Governor Kasem Chaisit ordered officials to warn Thais not to get close to or cross into Cambodia because of the safety problem in the wake of increased fighting inside Cambodia. In another incident, one Thai villager was robbed by Cambodian bandits in Tambon Tha Kham of Aranyaprathet early yesterday. The police said at least three bandits pulled a rope across the Aranyaprathet-Khlong Namsai border road to trap passing motorcyclists. Sawant Boonto rode a motorbike past the site without seeing the rope and was flung off-balance. The bandits hit him on the head with a rifle butt and stole his bike and gold necklace.
