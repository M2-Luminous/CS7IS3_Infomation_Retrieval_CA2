Applicability: Model 747 series airplanes, excluding Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. Note 1: Paragraph (a) of this AD restates the requirement for repetitive inspections contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;12. The first inspection required by this AD must be performed within the specified repetitive inspection interval after the last inspection performed in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;12. To prevent smoke and fire in the cockpit emanating from wire bundles and loss of essential cockpit instruments necessary for continued safe flight and landing of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 15 days after January 8, 1993 (the effective date of AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;12, amendment 39&hyph;8447): Perform a visual inspection to detect damage due to chafing of the wire bundles that extend between the P6 and P7 panels at station 400, water line 385, right buttock line 15, at Stringer 2 on the right-hand side, 6 inches aft of the P6 panel. Pay particular attention to wire bundles W418, W718, W998, and other bundles that cross over these bundles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 120 days until the inspection required by paragraph (b) of this AD is accomplished. If any damaged wire is found, prior to further flight, repair the wire in accordance with Boeing Standard Wiring Practices Document, D6&hyph;54446. (b) Within the next 4,000 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;24A2186, dated January 14, 1993; or Revision 1, dated May 20, 1993.

Accomplishment of this inspection terminates the repetitive inspection requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD. If any damaged wire is found, prior to further flight, repair or replace the wire in accordance with Boeing Standard Wiring Practices Document, D6&hyph;54446. (2) Measure the clearance between the wire bundles in accordance with the service bulletin. (i) If the measured clearance between the wire bundles is 0.25 inch or greater: No further action is required by this AD. (ii) If the measured clearance between the wire bundles is less than 0.25 inch: Repeat the inspection required by paragraph (b)(1) of this AD thereafter at intervals not to exceed 120 days. (c) Installation of the wire modification in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;24A2186, dated January 14, 1993, or Revision 1, dated May 20, 1993, terminates the repetitive inspections required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD.
