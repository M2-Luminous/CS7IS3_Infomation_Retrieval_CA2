This means all three working groups under the council have presented their reports. On deregulation of some individual regulations, however, this last report presented dual alternatives, leaving the government to make decisions on what alternatives to choose. The report was prepared by compiling the views of seven expert members representing academic and economic circles, and it recommends, among others: 1) Abolishing or easing Japan's unique economic regulations; 2) adopting as a target the reduction of gaps in commodity prices between Japan and other countries by half; 3) abolishing or easing rules which impede business operations; and 4) establishing without delay an administrative reform committee without any present or former bureaucrats represented on it.
