This association should then be integrated into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Bolivia's Trade and Industry Minister Carlos Morales said in Bonn. "We want to make use of our Andes Group presidency this year to get on with Latin American economic integration," Morales said. That is why at the next Andes Group summit (including Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela) in September, the presidents of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay will also be invited. The heads of state are planning a joint preparation of the all-American conference in Miami in December, which will be attended by government representatives from Canada, the United States, and Central and South America. Political and economic cooperation as well as the fight against drug dealing will be on the agenda. Prior to that, on the occasion of the soccer World Cup opening match between Germany and Bolivia in Chicago, Bolivian President Sanchez de Lozada wants to discuss Latin America's future relations with the United States and the European Union [EU] with Chancellor Kohl and President Clinton. For Morales, Latin America's integration within NAFTA is a long-term objective; "before that, we Latin Americans will have to do our homework." This means that each country has to stabilize and open up its economy. Therefore, since 1986, his country has gradually lowered its customs duties to 5 percent for capital goods and 10 percent for consumer goods. It is also important that the Mercosur countries quickly agree on common external duties. The line of conflict runs between Argentina and Brazil advocating comparatively high import duties on the one hand, and Paraguay, calling for a much lower import duty on the other. Once Mercosur and the Andes Pact have stabilized, they are to be merged step by step, Morales said. "The Latin American free trade zone has to come into existence within the next 10 years, otherwise we will be helplessly facing a world of integrated blocs." The minister is convinced that the U.S. Administration prefers talking to a unified region to talking to individual countries. An exception to that is economically successful Chile, the next candidate to be accepted into NAFTA, Morales said.
