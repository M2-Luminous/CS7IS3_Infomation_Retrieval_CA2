After a bitter nine-hour crisis meeting, in which numerous personal insults were directed at General Viljoen, hardline Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg announced triumphantly to rapturous applause: "We will not take part in the elections." The crisis was sparked by a last-minute decision by General Viljoen to have included on the ballot an organisation known as the Freedom Front, with himself as leader. He did so in response to the decision by the Inkatha Freedom Party -- the Volksfront's leading ally in the Freedom Alliance -- to register provisionally for the elections on Friday [4 March] night. General Viljoen said after yesterday's meeting he had registered for strategic purposes. It has been established that he did so without Dr Hartzenberg's blessing. After the meeting's decision, however, General Viljoen said the registration of the front would now lapse. The decision by the Volksraad -- the AVF's transitional parliament -- to allow the registration to lapse was taken by 73 votes to 20 in a secret ballot insisted upon by CP MPs Corne and Pieter Mulder, part of General Viljoen's moderate faction. Those who spoke in favour of the decision to register during the stormy meeting included Major-General Tienie Groenewald, Lieutenant-General Kobus Visser, Lieutenant-General Koos Bischoff, CP Cape leader Jan Hoon, the Mulder brothers and another CP MP, Petrus Groenewald. General Viljoen said he would remain in the AVF and would abide by the decision. "I won't abandon the idea of a volkstaat [homeland]. I have an obsession to arrive at a point where my people will survive." However, Dr Peter Mulder seemed resigned to the fact that he would not be returning to Parliament. "There is a short route and a long route to obtaining a volkstaat. It now seems they want to take the long route," he said. "The decision went against us. But I'm a fighter; I will win in the end." Dr Hartzenberg thanked General Viljoen for his "foresight in making the provisional registration". He had done so in the best interests of the organisation. But the election was not an acceptable test of support for the volkstaat idea, and the AVF was not prepared to give ligitimacy to the constitution by taking part. The AVF, added Dr Hartzenberg, would continue to put pressure on the election in pursuit of the ideal of self-determination. It would also continue to press for a referendum to test support for a volkstaat. Yesterday's decision, announced after the meeting held behind closed doors, followed a night of high drama on Friday. For the Volksfront, founded on May 19 last year, it was the night of the generals, starting with a flurry of one-on-one meetings and ending with a late-night dash from Pretoria to the World Trade Centre in Kempton Park. The generals -- Viljoen, Groenewald (former military intelligence [Counter Intelligence Division] chief), Visser (former CID chief) and Koos Bischoff (former SADF chief of staff, planning) -- learned of the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] decision to register provisionally for the elections on the SABC's [South African Broadcasting Corporation] 6PM news. At 8PM, a small group of Volkfront employees crossed the street from their headquarters in Hatfield, Pretoria to watch the main news bulletin at a restaurant. They were still not sure the IFP had "handed in the papers" at the World Trade Centre, and it was not until 9PM that they received confirmation that the IFP's Dr Frank Mdlalose had, in fact done so. General Viljoen left the Volksfront headquarters at 8PM to keep an appointment with a foreign diplomat. When he returned 30 minutes later, his face was strained. Shortly before 9PM, General Groenewald arrived, followed 15 minutes later by Afrikaner Volkswag [Afrikaner National Watch] leader Professor Carel Boshoff and CP MP for Pretoria West Joseph Chiole. Also at the meeting were the Mulder brothers. At 9.17PM, a visibly agitated General Visser entered the building. Just eight minutes later, General Viljoen, General Visser and Professor Boshoff left. Reliable sources said yesterday they had gone to Dr Hartzenberg's house. What was said at that meeting is not known, but events moved swiftly from then on. General Bischoff entered Volksfront headquarters at 9.40PM. At 9.58PM, Mr Chiole ran from the building and was heard to mutter "time is running out". He returned soon afterwards, but at 10.56PM, he and Volksfront spokesman Stephan Manning left in a hurry, speeding off in Mr Chiole's red Alfa. They were on their way to pick up a cheque for R[Rand]70,000, the amount needed to register the Vryheids-front -- Freedom Front -- for the polls. General Viljoen, accompanied by Professor Boshoff, General Visser and General Bischoff, left for the World Trade Centre at 11.01PM. At some stage in the evening, sources said, General Viljoen consulted Dr Hartzenberg, who refused to agree to registration before the Friday midnight deadline. He had pointed out that any decision to take part in the election would have to be taken by the Volksraad at its meeting yesterday afternoon. General Viljoen impressed on Dr Hartzenberg that the chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission, Mr Justice Johan Kriegler, had said the deadline for registration was final and that a decision had to be taken immediately. On arrival at the World Trade Centre, General Viljoen said he had come to talk to registration officials "to see if I can persuade them to let me hand in the papers and the cheque provisionally, subject to approval by the Volksraad". He later issued a statement saying that due to the IFP's decision to register provisionally, he had realised freedom to exercise "the strategic options" of the Afrikaner people would be "severely restricted) if the right wing did not follow suit. "Due to the limited time available, this decision could not be approved in advance by the Afrikaner Volksfront," he said.
