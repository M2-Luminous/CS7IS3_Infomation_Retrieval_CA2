To argue with him is as pointless as with the leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. This is how a high-ranking Russian diplomat dealing with Baltic problems commented on Landsbergis's recent statements concerning relations with Russia. Addressing a news conference in Vilnius recently, Landsbergis criticized the present Lithuanian leadership for its "policy of rapprochement with the East". According to him, the "aggressive nationalism of Russia, whose policy had been identical to that of Zhirinovskiy who only speaks more openly, revealed itself in full lately". "Such escapades on the part of Landsbergis no longer surprise anyone," said Interfax's interviewee. "They have become so biased and subjective, that they can hardly be taken seriously even in Lithuania itself," he noted. The interview with the Russian diplomat will be published in more detail in tomorrow's edition of Diplomatic Panorama.
