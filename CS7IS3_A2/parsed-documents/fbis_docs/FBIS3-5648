She said, "The current-accounts surplus is the most difficult economic factor for the government to control." She also said, "I understand that Japan has maintained the principles of free trade in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks." In this way, Kubota indicated that setting any kind of numerical target could lead to managed trade.
