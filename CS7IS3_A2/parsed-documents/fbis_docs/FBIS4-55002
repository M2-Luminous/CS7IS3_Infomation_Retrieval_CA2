Bosnian Moslems and Croats have been amassing strong forces towards Brcko these days. The town of Brcko is located in the narrowest section of the corridor which links eastern and western parts of the Srpska republic. In an interview to the Novi Sad daily DNEVNIK on Sunday, Major-General Simic reiterated that "Brcko is a Serb town and if anyone should secure and defend it, it is the Bosnian Serb Army," adding that the scenario prepared for Sarajevo and Gorazde was not applicable to Brcko. "We hold Brcko, as well as the corridor, and there is no price for which we shall allow the corridor to fall into Moslem hands," the major-general was adamant. It is evident that the Moslem leadership wants a repetition of the "Gorazde incident" so that the Moslem Army could break through to the River Sava unhindered and cut the corridor with the help of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Major-General Simic said. Brcko is not Gorazde, he warned, the Bosnian Serb Army is preparing to counter any possible attacks.
