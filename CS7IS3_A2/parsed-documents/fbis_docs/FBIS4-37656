A statement sent by the party to AL-HAYAH said that attempts have been made to attack the party's offices and buildings, including "the cowardly attempt which targeted the Society in Aid of the Poor, which is attached to the Turkoman Party, committed by people whose identity and party affiliation were known." It mentioned the killing of Rushdi Tahsin, member of the party's Irbil Committee and member of the Administrative Committee of the Turkoman Human Rights Organization, and party member Ahmad Junbaz and his son Mustafa. It requested that the implications of the crime be exposed. It maintained that "the collapse of authority and administration in the region" as a result of the fighting between the parties of Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani -- the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party -- had "resulted in anarchy and lawlessness endangering the lives of the population." It added that tension persisted in the areas under the control of the two parties and that "the Turkomans, led by the Turkoman National Party, intend to pursue a peaceful democratic course in the struggle for the achievement of freedom and democracy in Iraq. All the cheap ways of trying to divert them from these principles will fail.... The Turkomans will remain outside the conflicts and disputes despite all the attempts and plans to involve them."
