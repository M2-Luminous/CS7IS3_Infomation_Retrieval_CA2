After five years in the building, close to the German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) in Cologne-Porz, the wind tunnel has now been officially opened by Federal Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger and will be fully at the disposal of the aviation industry and aerospace research for aerodynamic tests on future aircraft configurations from mid-1994 onwards. The wind tunnel represents a decided breakthrough in aviation test engineering in Europe, as it explores new ground in operational and test technology. The operating concept is based on what is known as the cryogenic principle, whereby the high Reynolds numbers typical of the transonic range are achieved not by using large aircraft models, as was previously the case, but by injecting liquid nitrogen to obtain a drastic reduction in the temperature of the flow medium, to as low as minus 180 degrees Celsius. This entails a number of advantages: The wind tunnel itself can be significantly smaller, and this in turn makes for considerably lower plant costs. Operating costs are also substantially lower than those of comparable conventional plants. Present-generation passenger aircraft and those of the coming decades mostly fly at just under the speed of sound. This gives rise to locally occurring supersonic fields with vibrating compression shocks on the upper sides of airfoils. This can lead to flutter phenomena on the airfoils and result in flight characterized by irregular shuddering. In the near-supersonic range, design and fluidic measures that prevent or attenuate these compression shocks also achieve a marked reduction in aerodynamic drag and, consequently, make for considerable fuel savings. With the ETW, engineers are acquiring an ultramodern tool that will enable them to determine the final configuration of a new aircraft from model measurements much more accurately then before, thus obviating the need for expensive modifications in the light of subsequent flight testing. The four states involved are sharing the 660-million German mark building costs as follows: United Kingdom and France 28 percent each, the Netherlands 6 percent, the BMFT [Federal Ministry of Research and Technology] 27 percent, the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia 10 percent, and the German aviation industry one percent -- a further step in the direction of European integration in aeronautical research and development.
