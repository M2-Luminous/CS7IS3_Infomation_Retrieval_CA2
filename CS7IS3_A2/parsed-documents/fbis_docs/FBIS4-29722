As such, Thai and Malaysian undercover officers often rub shoulders during their forays to the restaurant as they seek to eavesdrop on conversations or pick up any other information that can come their way from the slip of the tongue of its patrons. The biggest restaurant in the so-called Sibsong Hong area, it is owned and operated by Abdullah Sulaiman, alias Sum, 50, a native of Pattani province who is, by bloodline, a nephew of the late Haji Sulong Tomina, who was charged with treason in 1948. He is also a cousin of alleged separatist leader Haji Amin Tomina. Because of his relationship with separatist leaders, it came as no surprise that Sum was accused by the Thai authorities of being a member of the separatist movement. Malaysian security officials suspect him to be a spy for Thailand. "I admit that members of several movements have approached me and sought my cooperation, some even asking me to join them. But I have always turned them down," said Mr. Sum. He said he has often been blackmailed and on several occasions questioned by Malaysian special branch police. "Neither the separatists, the Malaysian nor Thai authorities trust me," he complained bitterly. "Everybody identifies this restaurant with his movement. Be it the PULO (Pattani United Liberation Organisation), or BRN (Barisan Revolusi Nationale), or UMNO (the Malaysian ruling party) or the PASS," said Mr Sum cynically. He said his restaurant was under suspicion by all sides because it welcomed all parties regardless of their affiliation or background. "If you ask me if I ever met Haji Amin, I would say yes because he is my cousin. If I talked with Haji Amin, you would suspect that we might have discussed politics. "People like to sum up things the easy way. Sometimes, the information obtained by Thai authorities is not double or cross-checked. That's where the fault lies," said Mr Sum. Sibsong Hong was previously off-limits to outsiders because it was the meeting ground for runaway PULO separatists from southern Thailand. Mr. Sum admitted that when he first set up the restaurant 20 years ago life was difficult. But now the situation has substantially improved with most of the separatists and bandits gone. He said he believed most leading separatists had defected to Thai authorities, leaving behind only ordinary criminals. He ruled out the suggestion that some Middle Eastern countries had secretly funded separatist movements in southern Thailand. "The Arabs have their own problems. The Muslim world has problems. Even the conflict in Bosnia remains unresolved," he said, adding that he didn't think the Arabs had any interest in the people of Pattani. While insisting his non-involvement with any political groups or bandit gangs, Sulaiman admitted that he dare not return to his hometown in Pattani after the arson attacks on several schools in southern provinces last August. He cited the arrest of Toh Kuheng as the arson suspect, saying Kuheng was just a restaurant employee, a scapegoat. He claimed that several Thai Muslims who had took refuge in Malaysia still have loyalty towards Thailand, but dislike Thai officials who are unjust and abusive. He cited the arrest of four Islamic teachers on charges of perpetrating bomb attacks in Songkhla province as an example which would only worsen the situation in southern Thailand and sow mistrust between the state and the Muslim people.
