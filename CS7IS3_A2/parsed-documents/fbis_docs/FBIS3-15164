The defense minister has been forced to do this by the moral and psychological situation in and around our Armed Forces. Time has not yet managed to cure our units and subunits of the old defects of the Soviet Army, reads the appeal. Today, we can observe how new viruses are creeping through barrack windows and checkpoints in military towns to deprave the military organism. In the opinion of the defense minister, there is only one way to cure this disease: We will overcome this disease only if order is restored and the Army is cemented by strict military discipline. Appealing to parents whose sons are already serving in the Army or still studying in school, to soldiers and their commanders, to pedagogues, to wives of commanders and chiefs, and to famous patriots and honorable citizens of our country, Vitaliy Radetskyy says: Only together, as were our forefathers, can we achieve the desired goal. The time has come to turn our faces toward the barracks and the Army, reads the appeal issued by the defense minister, because it is no longer imperial, but our own Army with the Lvov dignity, Poltava diligence, Odessa humor, and Chernihiv joyfulness. Ukrainian Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy believes and expects that the appeal will be understood by every conscious Ukrainian citizen, and that an agreement on looking for common ways of overcoming the complex situation in the Army will be found.
