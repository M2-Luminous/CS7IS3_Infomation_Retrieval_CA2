Zhu, who arrived in Japan last Wednesday for a nine-day visit, was briefed by administrative officials on the construction of the 13.1-kilometer structure, which is actually a string of bridges across five islets in the inland sea. A number of Chinese dignitaries have visited the site since it was opened to automobile and rail traffic in April 1988. The bridges link Kojima in Okayama Prefecture on Honshu with Sakaide in Kagawa Prefecture on Shikoku. The same construction technology is being used for a 1.4- kilometer suspension bridge over the Ma Wan channel that will link mainland Hong Kong with Lantau Island. The bridge will be open to vehicles and rail traffic after its completion, expected in mid-1997.
