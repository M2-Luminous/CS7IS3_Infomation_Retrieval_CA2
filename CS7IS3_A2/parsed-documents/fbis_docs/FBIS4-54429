He mentioned, among other things, a 15 per cent growth in real budget revenues as well as a growth of hard currency reserves and stressed that if these positive trends prevailed it would mean that Poland was coming out of recession faster than the industrialized countries of Western Europe. Simultaneously, Pawlak pointed out that good economic results can be wasted due to excessive consumption and economic disorganization. He stressed in this context that strikes in the power generating sector increased the production costs. The prime minister declared that the government has always intended to abandon administrative methods of controlling wages but too much haste was connected with the risk of higher inflation.
