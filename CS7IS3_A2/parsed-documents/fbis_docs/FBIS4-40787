Petr Chernyatevich, the Crimean president's adviser for military affairs, said this in his telephone conversation with a RIA correspondent. As has become known just now, he said, the units of the Ukrainian national guards have been deployed in Yevpatoria and Kerch though this act contradicts the decrees by Leonid Kravchuk of April 14 and 26, this year. According to these decrees, the Ukrainian national guards should be deployed only in Simferopol and Sevastopol. According to the recent data, said the Crimean president's adviser, the national guards regiment is being transformed into a brigade. Petr Chernyatevich asserts that the Ukrainian authorities have not given up their attempts to split the Crimean interior forces. They are conducting psychological pressure on them with the aim of winning over at least part of the militia personnel to their side. The Crimean president's adviser said that this work is headed by Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Nedrigailo. However, the local militia are still devoted to the legally elected Crimean government.
