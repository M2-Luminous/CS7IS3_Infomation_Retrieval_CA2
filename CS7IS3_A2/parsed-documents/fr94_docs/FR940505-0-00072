FR940505-0-00072 FR940505-0-00020 The statute further states that the ``substantially related'' test for products and services must be consistent with the standards established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and courts reviewing IRS decisions. Accordingly, the rules adopted by the Postal Service follow these standards. To be ``substantially related'' in accordance with IRS standards, an advertised product or service must contribute importantly to the accomplishment of one or more of the purposes of the qualified organization. This means that the sale of the product or service must be directly related to accomplishing one or more of the purposes on which the organization's authorization to mail at the special bulk third-class rates is based. The sale of the product or offering of the service must have a causal relationship to the achievement of the exempt purposes (other than through the production of income) of the qualified organization. (Whether an activity generates income that will be used to accomplish one or more of the purposes of the qualified organization is not to be used as a factor in determining whether an advertisement passes the ``substantially related'' test.) A synopsis of IRS rulings regarding the definition of ``substantially related'' is in Internal Revenue Manual, sec. 7751, part (36) 40 (Exempt Organizations Handbook). Additionally, the Postal Service expects to publish a handbook that will provide further guidance to mailers. One of the major points of contention throughout this rulemaking has been the classification of third-class newsletters, bulletins, and other publications containing paid advertising from parties other than the publisher. The proposed rule published on December 10, 1993, sets forth the Postal Service's view that these publications are subject to the new statutory restrictions, and would be excluded from mailing at the special bulk third-class rates if they contained paid advertising that did not comply with the ``substantially related'' test. Numerous commenters have opposed this interpretation, arguing that the statute contains a general exception for these publications, or that it reflects the intent of Congress to permit paid advertising, as distinguished from an organization's own advertising, to be sent at the special rates. The Postal Service believes that these objections are not well taken, and that the terms of the statute contain no special exception from the ``substantially related'' test for the advertising content of third-class publications. The ``substantially related'' test is contained in new subparagraph (D) of 39 U.S.C. 3626(j)(1), which forbids the application of special bulk third-class rates to ``mail which advertises, promotes, offers, or, for a fee or consideration recommends, describes, or announces the availability of'' certain categories of products and services. The types of advertising already restricted under paragraph (j)(1) include advertisements for credit cards by subparagraph (A), for insurance policies by subparagraph (B), and for travel arrangements by subparagraph (C). Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) contain no exception for paid advertising in third-class publications, and the Postal Service has not applied any such exception in its enforcement of these provisions. Unlike the earlier provisions, however, new subparagraph (D) does contain a specific exception related to publications. Subclause (D)(ii)(II) provides that ``clause (i) [containing the substantially related test] shall not apply if the product involved is a periodical publication described in subsection (m)(2) [a periodical publication of a qualified nonprofit organization] (including a subscription to receive any such publication).'' By its terms, this provision recognizes that a periodical publication may also be a product that a nonprofit organization wishes to advertise, and it exempts the advertising for the publication (or for subscriptions to the publication) from the ``substantially related'' test. It in no way prevents the application of the test to third-party paid advertising for other products or services that may be contained in an issue of the publication itself. A second specific exception concerning publications is contained in new 39 U.S.C. 3626 (m), which restricts what ``mail consisting of products'' may be sent at the special bulk third-class rates. Under paragraph (m)(1), such products must either have been received by the mailing organization as gifts or contributions, or be ``low-cost articles'' as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Paragraph (m)(2) makes an exception from these requirements for a ``periodical publication of a qualified nonprofit organization.'' Thus, the statute recognizes that a periodical publication may also be a product that a nonprofit organization wishes to mail, whether as a benefit to members or a premium for potential donors in the course of a fundraising appeal, and allows such mailings to go at the special rates. By its terms, however, the ``product rule'' of subsection (m) does not override the separate and distinct ``advertising rules'' of subsection (j), and the Postal Service believes that it would be erroneous to construe subsection (m) as a blanket exception to those rules. Such interpretation would rob the new ``substantially related'' test of subparagraph (j)(1)(D) of much of its effectiveness, by allowing mailers to convert ineligible third-class catalogs into eligible third-class ``publications,'' and overturn the Postal Service's established enforcement policies regarding the credit card, insurance, and travel advertising restrictions in subparagraphs (j)(1)(A), (B), and (C). The new restrictions do not apply to publications mailed at the special nonprofit second-class rates. However, if a publisher wishes to mail copies of a special second-class rate publication at the special bulk third-class rates as provided for in DMM E215.2.6, those copies are subject to these new rules. Accordingly, those copies may not be mailed at the special bulk third-class rates if they contain any material ineligible for the special rates.
