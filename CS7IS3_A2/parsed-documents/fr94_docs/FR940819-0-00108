Rest period means the period free of all restraint or duty for a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator and free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion arise. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a duty period to a flight attendant only when the applicable duty period limitations and rest requirements of this paragraph are met. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, no domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours. (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a flight attendant scheduled to a duty period of 14 hours or less as provided under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be given a scheduled rest period of at least 9 consecutive hours. This rest period must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period. (3) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be scheduled or reduced to 8 consecutive hours if the flight attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours; this subsequent rest period must be scheduled to begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest period and must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period. (4) A domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours, but no more than 16 hours, if the air carrier or commercial operator has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least one flight attendant in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the air carrier's or the commercial operator's operations specifications. (5) A domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 16 hours, but no more than 18 hours, if the air carrier or commercial operator has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least two flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the air carrier's or the commercial operator's operations specifications. (6) A domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 18 hours, but no more than 20 hours, if the scheduled duty period includes one or more flights that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, and if the air carrier or commercial operator has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least three flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the domestic air carrier's or the commercial operator's operations specifications. (7) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a flight attendant scheduled to a duty period of more than 14 hours but no more than 20 hours, as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, must be given a scheduled rest period of at least 12 consecutive hours. This rest period must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period. (8) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(7) of this section may be scheduled or reduced to 10 consecutive hours if the flight attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 14 consecutive hours; this subsequent rest period must be scheduled to begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest period and must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period. (9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, if a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator elects to reduce the rest period to 10 hours as authorized by paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the air carrier or commercial operator may not schedule a flight attendant for a duty period of more than 14 hours during the 24-hour period commencing after the beginning of the reduced rest period. (10) No domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant any duty period with the air carrier or commercial operator unless the flight attendant has had at least the minimum rest required under this section. (11) No domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator may assign a flight attendant to perform any duty with the air carrier or operator during any required rest period. (12) Time spent in transportation, not local in character, that a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator requires of a flight attendant and provides to transport the flight attendant to an airport at which that flight attendant is to serve on a flight as a crewmember, or from an airport at which the flight attendant was relieved from duty to return to the flight attendant's home station, is not considered part of a rest period. (13) Each domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier must relieve each flight attendant engaged in air transportation and each commercial operator must relieve each flight attendant engaged in air commerce from all further duty for at least 24 consecutive hours during any 7 consecutive calendar days.
