The economic policy for 1994 continues with the successful economic policy of the previous years. Of course, however, it adds some new, growth-promoting accents (cf. highway construction, housing policy, etc.). In 1994, the maintenance of a balanced budget remains the objective, while the tax burden should be relieved. The government policy of a balanced budget helps the Czech National Bank, whose task it is to protect the stability of the koruna. Economic growth emerges from this background, as a new objective for the government that is fully compatible with the maintenance of the macroeconomic stability. 1994 is the first year in which we can say that all the corner stones have been laid, and we should witness the completion and finishing touchs to something that already exists rather than some new pivotal events. This is the fundamental information for the economic sphere, for the dependable calculability of investment decisions. I believe that inflation will not exceed 10 percent in 1994. That is implied by the long-term trend of the development of the month-to-month inflation, which, if we disregard the one-time price shocks in 1991 to 1993, hovers within the 0.5 to 1.0 percent limits. It remains a question, however, whether the Czech National Bank should not be more flexible and pump more money into the economy. I believe that this approach would be compatible with the protection of the stability of the price levels and the rate of the koruna. At the same time, it would support the growth tendencies on the already sufficiently transformed supply side of the economy. The gradual liberalization of prices should continue in 1994, rationed with consideration to the ability of economically weak households to bear the price moves. Another price liberalization (for instance, rents, transport tariffs, etc.) is considered in the context of the completion of the system of social subsidies. The price liberalization must not be cumulated so as to bring about useless financial expectations. The balanced budget is one of the reasons why the government has managed to maintain a stable nominal exchange rate of the koruna. With respect to the development in the volume of foreign currency reserves, I consider this policy a good one also for the coming year, and do not expect any substantial shift in the nominal exchange rate of the koruna. Because of the relatively high level of inflation in the Czech Republic (in comparison with our West European trade partners), the stability of the nominal exchange rate of our currency means a gradual strengthening of the competition for our domestic producers thanks to imports growing relatively cheaper. That is good for the consumer, and the producers have to adjust. The government has sometimes been reproached that it does not adequately deal with the structural policy. I believe that we want no such policy in the sense of the selection by the government bureaucracy of the victors and the vanquished. On the contrary, it is possible that the government would facilitate the process of the necessary structural changes by general measures such as supporting the retraining of employees or -- when necessary -- by selective interventions of the type of the restructuring of Skoda Plzen [company]. The condition is always that the interested entities, i.e., particularly the enterprises and banks, share the costs. It would be too soon to expect in 1994 a substantial recovery in the advanced market economies, and this will reflect negatively on the possibilities of Czech exports. Our manufacturers marked an exceptional success in export performance in 1993. The pace of growth of exports reached double-digit values at a time when competition on the world markets increased because of the economic recession. Nevertheless, I believe that, under the present economic conditions, even a deficit trade balance would be compatible with the external balance, given a surplus trade in services and a continuing flow of investments from abroad. One has to bear in mind that if the trade balance shows a deficit because of a high share of machines and equipment in the overall imports (40 percent in 1993), it will be favorably reflected in the growth of the gross domestic product in the next period and in long-term exports. Although the unemployment rate in the Czech Republic fluctuates substantially from region to region, on average and on a long-term basis, it belongs to the lowest in Europe. This fact has its positive side (from the point of social peace) but also a negative one (from the point of economic effectiveness). Anyway, a certain growth is to be expected in the unemployment rate in 1994. That is, above all, because of the rationalization brought about by the progress of privatization, but also as a result of the effect of the law on bankruptcy and settlement. Under no circumstances, however, would I expect any dramatic shifts in the unemployment rate. I am not even calling for bankruptcies. I believe that in the instance of bankruptcies, we bear witness to the process of learning while working. Wherever a bankruptcy is the best solution to the bad situation of the enterprise, sooner or later it will come to it. I would really like it though, if the courts worked better in the bankruptcy proceedings and that the court decisions were more easily executable. The small-scale privatization is practically completed, the large-scale one will continue in 1994, among other things, through the second wave of coupon privatization. A further dynamic development can be expected on the capital market, which has been operating smoothly for almost a year both at the Prague Exchange and within the framework of the RM-system. The share of the private sector in the economy will continue to grow. The volume of both direct and portfolio investments from abroad will also grow. The growth of foreign investments together with foreign loans (both state and private) will result, in 1994, in a further increase in foreign currency reserves. The ability of the economy to produce a sufficient volume of foreign currency is a prerequisite for introducing the regime of full convertibility of the koruna, which has become a topic of specific talks in banking circles. If, in closing, I were to briefly summarize my expectations regarding the economic development in the Czech Republic in 1994, I would say the following: The economic transformation is moving in the right direction. In this respect, the Czech Republic belongs to the best among the postcommunist countries. This fact should become even more apparent in the next year that it has been so far. I do not expect any dramatic jumps, internal or external, which could threaten our economic development. Of course, we must not underestimate the fact that 50 percent of our gross national product is produced for export. The merciless struggle for the place in the sun will continue on the world markets next year. The managers, whose performance is not up to par, should realize this fact. If they do not realize it in time, I hope that the enterprise owners will replace them soon. Overgrown bureaucracy, tying up enterprise with numerous superfluous regulations, could also become a threat to healthy economic development next year. Let us learn from the negative experience of others, including the European Union countries. A healthy economic development can only take place under the conditions of social peace. On the other hand, the healthy economic development itself creates conditions for maintaining the social peace. The diversification of income is a desirable driving force of the economic growth. The economic growth, however, opens the path to a higher living standard, also for those whose wages grow the slowest. The future prosperity is in our hands.
