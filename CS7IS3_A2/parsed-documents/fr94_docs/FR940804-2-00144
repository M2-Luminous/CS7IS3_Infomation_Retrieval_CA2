SR-Philadep-94&hyph;01, and SR&hyph;SCCP&hyph;94&hyph;03] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Changes to Amend the Philadelphia Depository Trust Company's and the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia's By-Laws Regarding the Composition of the Respective Boards of Directors and Nominating Committees July 27, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on July 14, 1994, the Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (``Philadep'') and the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia (``SCCP'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-Philadep-94&hyph;01 and SR&hyph;SCCP&hyph;94&hyph;03) as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by Philadep and SCCP. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested parties. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Changes The proposed rule changes respectively amend Philadep By-Laws Article IV, Section 2 and Article III, Section 4 and SCCP By-Laws Article IV, Section 2 and Article III, Section 4. These sections set forth the requirements for the composition of the Boards of Directors and Nominating Committees. II. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statements Regarding the Proposed Rule Changes In their filings with the Commission, Philadep and SCCP included statements concerning the purpose of and the basis for the proposed rule changes and discussed any comments received on the proposed rule changes. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Philadep and SCCP have prepared summaries, as set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of these statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of and the Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Changes In order to ease the administrative burden, Philadep and SCCP propose to amend their By-Laws to remove the requirement that the two Vice Chairmen of the Board of Governors of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'') serve as ex-officio members of the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors. The proposed amendments will install the Chief Operating Officer of the PHLX both as an ex-officio member of the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors and as the Vice Chairman of the Philadep and SCCP Boards. The proposed amendments will reduce the requisite number of PHLX Governors who must serve on the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors from a majority of the fifteen to seventeen Directors to six of the Directors. The proposed amendments will change the term of office for the Boards of Directors for the purpose of qualifying PHLX Governors as Philadep and SCCP Directors. 2 2 The intent of this provision is to synchronize the term of office for the Chairman of the Exchange's Board of Governors with his terms of office on the Philadep and SCCP Boards. Presently, under Article III Section 4(a) of the Philadep and SCCP By-Laws, the Nominating Committee must consist of five ex-officio members of the Board of Directors and two other persons appointed by the Chairman of the Board. Under the proposed rule change, the number of members on the Nominating Committee will consist of four ex-officio members of the Board of Directors and three other persons appointed by the Chairman of the Board. As composed under the proposed rule changes, the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors will continue to provide the PHLX, as the sole shareholder of both Philadep and SCCP, with adequate representation. The PHLX will be represented by both senior exchange staff personnel and members of the PHLX Board of Governors, who typically also represent Philadep and SCCP participant firms. In accordance with Philadep's and SCCP's amendment processes delineated in By-Law Article XI, the Chairman of the PHLX Board of Governors, as agent for the sole shareholder and parent corporation, has signed a unanimous consent in lieu of a special meeting to effectuate the foregoing changes. The proposed rule changes comply with Section 17A of the Act insofar as they will aid Philadep and SCCP in assuring the fair representation of shareholders and participants in the selection of directors and in the administration of affairs. 3 3 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(C) (1988). B. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Burden on Competition Philadep and SCCP do not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose any burden on competition.
