Prompted by the business community's high demand for ISDN applications, PTT Telecom is reducing the initially planned introduction period by nearly six months. At the opening of EURIE '93, the European ISDN telecommunications event, held from 14 to 16 December and involving 17 countries, PTT Telecom announced that it is particularly companies with subsidiaries throughout the country that are requesting the fastest possible introduction of nationwide ISDN. Since June 1993, European-standard-based ISDN has been available in 30 Netherlands urban areas with three-digit area codes. As of July 1994, it will also be available in 20 areas with five-digit area codes. These are the areas where demand for ISDN is highest. ISDN will be introduced in phases in the rest of the country. By the end of 1994, 95 percent of the country should be covered, while 100-percent coverage is expected by late 1995. Projects To promote the development of ISDN, the PTT is nurturing various projects by allowing access to its know-how and resources. One of these projects involves the development of a radio news database by regional broadcasting stations, which will allow the exchange of news items with high audio quality. The Netherlands Standardization Institute has started a pilot project aimed at giving its customers access to a database via the ISDN network. This will enable the exchange of standardization documents in a much faster and more efficient and inexpensive way. The third project involves the Foundation for ISDN Integration.
