He is accompanied by the Minister of National Wealth Management and Privatization Jiri Skalicky and First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra. Mr. Havel was welcomed by President Zhelyu Zhelev with full military honours. Immediately after the ceremony, the two presidents had a nearly one-hour-long session. They said after the meeting that their conversation had been very useful. The two briefed each other on the development of political processes, the processes and prospects of democratization, the progress of economic reform in the two countries and exchanged views on foreign policy problems, stressing the situation in the Balkans. The two countries' integration with the West European and Euroatlantic structures was also on the agenda. "On this point, our views are identical, and we arrived at the conclusion that we must not compete but help each other for an earlier integration of each of the countries," the Bulgarian head of state pointed out. "Probably the most important thing on which we agreed again was that our countries have the same political organization and foster the same values... We also agreed that the countries which managed to shed communism should also walk on the same road and cooperate, exchange experience and possibly coordinate their positions in the directions I listed (European and Euroatlantic integration), but this cooperation should by no means be institutionalized. For even the slightest sense that the post-communist countries are setting up some sort of community would create the impression that instead of aspiring to join the European community, they are aspiring to divide it," President Havel said. In his view, what matters most is to have continued working contacts between these countries. "We devoted a considerable part of our conversation to the Balkans, on which we turned out to have identical views," Mr. Havel said. "I set forth our firm assessment of the presence of 1,000 Czech Blue Helmets in the territory of former Yugoslavia, which we believe is extremely important and extremely useful for the maintenance of peace and the pacification of the area," President Zhelev indicated, adding that "the Czech Republic is far from that region, it has no immediate territorial, minority or any other problems with ex-Yugoslavia so as to be suspected of self-seeking motives." "We discussed the risks to which this area is prone, especially in Kosovo, the risks to Albania should events take an adverse turn," Dr. Zhelev also said. Russia and "our ambivalent attitude to it," as President Zhelev put it, was also discussed. The sides noted their support for the democratic forces in Russia and their "categorical distancing from all retrograde forces which are trying to take advantage of the difficulties: neofascists, neocommunists and ultra nationalists, who seek to isolate Russia," Dr. Zhelev said. Both sides are pleased with Russia's formal signing of Partnership for Peace without setting conditions for a privileged status within the North Atlantic Alliance, President Zhelev pointed out. Asked about the similarities and differences in the two countries' democratic processes, President Havel said that both countries have created all prerequisites for development of the democratic system. "Clearly, the Czech Republic is leading among the post-communist countries because 65 percent of the property there is already private. I think the main reason for this process is the unity of democratic forces in the Czech Republic, something of which we cannot boast, at least for the time being, and I think this is the main reason for Bulgaria's overall lag in the reforms," President Zhelev said for his part. In parallel talks, Czech Privatization Minister Jiri Skalicky conferred with the Executive Director of the Privatization Agency Reneta Indzhova, and Deputy Minister Vondra with Bulgarian First Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Gatsinski. Later in the day, President Havel is expected to meet with Bulgarian intellectuals for the presentation of his book "Power of the Powerless." This is Mr. Havel's second visit to Bulgaria after April 1992, when he arrived as president of Czechoslovakia to sign a Treaty of Friendly Relations and Cooperation between the two countries.
