In the opinion of Mr. Tarasyuk, Ukraine is regarded as a serious factor in the geopolitical situation. The journalists wanted to learn certain aspects of the tripartite agreement regarding the liquidation of Ukrainian nuclear weapons recently signed in Moscow by the three presidents. Asked whether the agreement will be implemented if the Supreme Council blocks joining the Lisbon Protocol, Borys Tarasyuk said: Of course, as a legislative body, the Supreme Council wields powers ensured by the Constitution, and its position on the Lisbon Protocol is known. However, one cannot deny the fact that the executive branch has a somewhat different viewpoint. As you know, the Ukrainian president has repeatedly stressed his disagreement with the Supreme Council decision made on 18 November, and again will try to persuade the deputies that Ukraine must join the nonproliferation treaty. Will the agreement be implemented? We know how the world reacted to the ratification of START I by our legislature. Some participants of the tripartite agreement soundly rejected the position and all conditions put forward in the Supreme Council resolution. As a result, the fact of signing the tripartite agreement proves that our partners recognized the correctness of the conditions declared by our parliament on 18 November, 1993. Let us examine the most important ones. National security guarantees are reflected in the agreement. So is compensation for nuclear weapons and financial aid. A question may arise here: Are these sufficient guarantees? But this is a different issue, and it will be worked on. I am confident, however, that implementation of this agreement serves the interests of Ukraine. Asked how the Crimean elections will influence Russian-Ukrainian relations, the foreign deputy minister cited a statement by a high-ranking Russian diplomat reported by INTERFAX, who thinks that the issue of the presidency in the Crimea is not completely settled with the Ukrainian parliament. Legally, the Ukrainian president can declare the elections void. The unidentified diplomat believes that no serious political crisis should be expected in case Yuriy Meshkov is elected Crimean president. Russian should only develop mutually advantageous relations with the Crimea, but on no account, as he put it, get it to eat out of Russia's hand. Politically, this would not be a good move regarding Ukraine. Besides, Russia does not need any spongers. This is the viewpoint of a ranking Russian diplomat, stressed Borys Tarasyuk. He also said that since this is our internal affair, the Crimean elections should cause concern to Ukraine rather than to Russia. If the presidential elections in the peninsula do not change the present norms of international law and the Helsinki principles, improving instead its social and economic life, they should only be welcomed. But if those elections result in attempts to change Crimea's status as part of Ukrainian territory, this will certainly produce very serious consequences in the domestic situation and, depending on Russia's reaction, on Ukrainian-Russian relations. At the same time, Borys Tarasyuk emphasized, signatures of the three presidents on the tripartite agreement that speak about territorial integrity -- especially as it applies to Ukraine -- and the nonviolability of the present border point to the explicit position of the Russian leadership on possible attempts to split the Crimea from Ukraine.
