All the same, the changed economic and competition situation also has not left the chemical group's R&D divisions unaffected. For instance, a number of organizational changes lie hidden beneath the since 1990 largely steady application of funds, BASF's head of research planning, Professor Horst Konig, states in a conversation with HANDELSBLATT: In the years since, BASF has turned heavily to the methods of project management with the aim of making innovation processes faster and more efficient. They include first of all clear agreements on goals, individual development steps and schedules. Planning itself takes place within the framework of a strategic performance target of the managing board based on individual suggestions from the fields of concentration ("bottom up"). At the same time the company has also for a short time been encouraging innovative behavior via an innovation prize for BASF personnel, which was awarded to two research teams for the first time a few weeks ago. Konig sees the main concern of project management to be the speeding up of research projects. "Because in the chemicals industry time is more often than not more important than money." For him the importance of the time factor can be seen, for example, in the fact that today almost 10 years are required for the development of a new plastic, 12 years for plant protectives and on average 15 years for pharmaceuticals. As a result, a half-year's delay could already lower a project's overall profitability by up to 40 percent. Konig blames a portion of these long development times on the especially time-consuming (and thereby innovation-inhibiting) approval terms and conditions in Germany. Just the thorough testing of a new substance in accordance with the law today requires around 1.5 years. However, because substances of this kind are often used as additions or intermediate products in a multistage process, this expenditure of time can easily build up. Hence, the aim of project management--which one could wish for the government approval process too--is precisely to lessen these delays also. Concentration on "Core Knowledge" More precise planning, project management and a more critical analysis of prospects for success have, says Konig, contributed to the fact that the number of individual research projects in the BASF group has been reduced since the end of the eighties from 800 to around 600 now. An additional reason for this was the more recent changes in the product portfolio. For instance, the retreat from the especially research-intensive field of concentration of structural materials. However, Konig by no means wants to have anything to do with applying to research the motto of "concentration on core fields." Rather the goal here has to be concentration on "core knowledge," he says. He points out that dealing with new fields of concentration in the final analysis constitutes a prerequisite for the further development of a company. BASF too would never have entered many of its major fields of concentration and would not have been able to find its present structure if it had concentrated its development activities instead on already strong fields of concentration. So, in principle research has to be strong precisely where one is not so strongly developed in business, Konig stresses. "All the branches cannot be cut off the tree, otherwise it will not grow." How strongly the emphases and orientation change he illustrates by the example of BASF's four large central research facilities: For instance, the main laboratory today is regarded as a "life science" center (with a distinct emphasis on the field of research of pharmaceuticals and plant protectives and biotechnology). In the plastics laboratory there is an ever stronger move toward research on materials, while the color laboratory has been generally dealing with the optical properties of materials and has developed an emphasis in the field of "effector materials." In the ammonia laboratory (which traces its origin to fertilizer research) they are turning ever more strongly toward research on catalysts, which play a central role in almost all chemical production. Konig rates the present basic structure of BASF's research as "solid and well adapted for the future," whereby, no doubt above all, efforts in the field of "life sciences" will be still intensified in the future. When the company is presently attending to developing a "vision" for all its research, so as by no means to create a sheer slogan, but to create a genuine leitmotif that presupposes a basic direction, without unduly restricting the researchers' creativity. Konig expects that an important change in overall chemical research will above all be the fact that in the future one will in general have to turn far more strongly to system development. Thus, there will be increasing research in an integrated system, whereby chemistry will also act ever more strongly as a development partner for other industries. Research in an Integrated System Gaining in Importance While in Konig's viewpoint one can blame German chemical research for all told only a few failures (rather, he ascribes the industry's current problems to too rapid market changes), he recognizes a still substantial need to catch up in the area of transindustry cooperation in research. He refers to the fact that this kind of integrated research is already far more strongly established in Japan, for example, where a short time ago a 16-partner-strong consortium integrated its work under the guiding theme "clean car."
