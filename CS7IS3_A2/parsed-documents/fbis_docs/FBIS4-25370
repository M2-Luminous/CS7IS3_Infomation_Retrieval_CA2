After making a fuss about "press freedom" with regard to Xi Yang's case and a BBC documentary, he then used the administrative dispute inside Asia Television and the subsequent resignation incident to exaggerate matters, saying that "the Hong Kong Government is working hard to ensure that after 1997, Hong Kong can enjoy the press freedom it enjoys now, and the Hong Kong Government is looking at whether some regulations have been abused to jeopardize press freedom. If the Hong Kong Journalists' Association asks that more regulations should be examined, the Hong Kong Government will consider it." That is to say, Patten's "press freedom card" is not just something to talk about, but will be implemented through amending many relevant regulations. However, the biggest flaw in Patten's "press freedom card" is precisely reflected by the fact that in the past, the British Hong Kong authorities have for a long time exercised very tight control over news and information, however, since the signing of the Joint Declaration, and particularly as 1997 draws closer, they have suddenly amended regulations and even want to amend and abolish regulations which have been drafted for the normal management of news and information. This flaw shows that the Hong Kong British authorities are hypocritical when they talk lavishly about "press freedom," and that Patten uses "press freedom" to sow discord between Hong Kong's press circles and the Chinese side on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to amend relevant news and information regulations. He wants to kill two birds with one stone by trying to change some mass media in Hong Kong into a tool with which the British side confronts the Chinese side and to create difficulties in news and information management for the future special administrative region government. In the past, the regulations used by the Hong Kong British authorities to restrict and control news and information were not only numerous but stringent also, and the British Hong Kong authorities once used these regulations to sue patriotic newspapers and ordered them to suspend publication; they also put certain journalists in jail. For a long time, the British Hong Kong authorities only allowed "press freedom" which protected and safeguarded colonial interests, while doing their best to attack and restrain real press freedom, which expressed other voices and ideas, and this method was an important component of colonial and despotic politics. Hong Kong's press circles have always expressed strong grievances with regards to this. After the Hong Kong question was settled by the decision that Hong Kong would return to mainland China, and particularly as 1997 draws closer, the colonial governor has suddenly changed into a savior who "defends Hong Kong's press freedom." He has ulterior motives. Patten once incited people by saying that "Hong Kong people must stand up to safeguard press freedom, not only after 1997 but also before 1997." People cannot but ask: What kind of "freedom" is this "press freedom" instigated by Patten? Only two examples are needed to illustrate the problem. First, when China's judiciary acted according to the law to handle Xi Yang's case of stealing state secrets, this was totally unrelated to press freedom, but Patten used the opportunity to accuse the Chinese Government of suppressing Hong Kong's press freedom. According to Patten's logic, any person who wears a reporter's identity card can feel free to steal political, economic, and military intelligence and jeopardize state security without being punished by law. Where does this "freedom" exist in the world? In the 1989 Official Secrets Act, which was imported from Britain by the British Hong Kong authorities in 1992, six kinds of information continue to be restricted, including "confidential data obtained from another country." Is it not true that data stolen by Xi Yang for a certain Hong Kong newspaper to publish falls into the scope restricted by the Official Secrets Act? [sentence as published] In order to stubbornly assert that the crime of stealing state secrets was "press freedom" and "legitimate," Patten claimed that "more regulations" must be examined and amended, and this fully reveals Patten's wanton trampling on the spirit of the law and the system. Second, when a Hong Kong television station decided not to broadcast a BBC documentary, Patten insinuated that Hong Kong's mass media were "exercising more self-discipline as 1997 draws closer," and he exerted pressure on the relevant television station by saying that he wanted to wait and see "if it would broadcast or not." This BBC documentary substituted one thing for another and fabricated and distorted facts in order to viciously slander Mao Zedong; when the relevant television station refrained from broadcasting it, this was a responsible attitude toward the audience, and precisely the kind of responsible attitude which is a guarantee of press freedom. What surprises people is that Patten went so far as to view the social responsibility of journalists as a mistake and a crime, against which he launched an attack. In Western countries, "news undertaking regulations" are very common, and journalists are restrained and guided by "responsibility," "justice," and "honesty." When media exercise self-discipline by conforming to the facts and according the external rules such as news regulations and policies, press freedom is not abused, press freedom can have a full role, and both things are guaranteed. Even the "slander regulations" of the British Hong Kong authorities stipulate that if a mass medium broadcasts or reports a program or information which is slanderous in nature, the relevant supervisory person can be arrested on criminal charges. Here we can see that when the television station refrained from broadcasting the BBC documentary which was slanderous nature, it embodied the application of press freedom both in terms of self-discipline and external rules, but Patten wantonly interfered in this and attacked it, and this precisely indicates that Patten tramples on and strangles press freedom and intervened in the television station's right to handle news at its own discretion. What is laughable is that Patten plays the "press freedom card" enthusiastically on the one hand, and, on the other, tries hard to intervene in the mass media to control it, and, as a result, his "press freedom card" collapses into itself. When a colonial and despotic governor of Hong Kong sells "press freedom" as 1997 draws closer, and when he amends information management regulations and dismantles the machinery of the rule of law, the whole thing resembles his efforts to promote a "quickened pace of democracy," and the purposes is nothing but an attempt to sow discord among the Hong Kong people, incite them, poison relations between Hong Kong's mass media and the Chinese Government, serve the aim of extending Britain's political control over Hong Kong after 1997, pave a road for pro-Britain and anti-China political forces to expand their room to maneuver, and to allow disturbances and confrontation to arise in Hong Kong after 1997. However, Patten's "press freedom card," like all the "cards" he has played, will never succeed.
