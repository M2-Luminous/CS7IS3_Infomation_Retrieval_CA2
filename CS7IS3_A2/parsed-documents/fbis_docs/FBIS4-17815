It is impossible to put an end to the conflict without it. This declaration was made by the personal representative of the Georgian head Sandro Kavsadze in an exclusive interview to SNARK. In his opinion, dislocation of peacekeeping forces all over the territory of Abkhazia meets the interests of both conflicting sides, for it will guarantee the coming back of Georgian refugees, as well as protect Abkhazia from the possible Georgian attacks.
