It is necessary to mobilize people's enthusiasm in harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu and exert joint efforts to do a good job which will help eliminate the calamities, maintain a long period of peace and stability, and benefit the generations to come. At the Third Work Meeting on Harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu which concluded today, State Councillor Chen Junsheng conveyed Premier Li Peng's abovementioned opinions. In his concluding speech at the meeting, Chen Junsheng said: The project of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu has a direct bearing on the future economic development in the two valleys and on the whole situation of nationwide reform, opening, and socialist modernization drive. Therefore, governments at all levels in these areas and relevant departments of the central government should shoulder the historic task of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu with a great sense of responsibility. They should see to it to attain the set goal of achieving the initial results in harnessing the Huai He in the "eighth five-year" period and basically accomplishing the work in the "ninth five-year" period as well as basically accomplishing the work of harnessing the Tai Hu in the "eighth five-year" period. Chen Junsheng said: The Huai He and Tai Hu valleys -- with a population of 143 million people, 200 million mu of farmland, and one sixth of total grain output in the country -- is China's main production base of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing seeds. This is one of the economically developed areas in China -- a golden area with a total industrial and agricultural output value accounting for one eighth of the country's total. But the Huai He valley suffers from severe droughts and floods, with fairly serious floods every three or four years. In 1991 alone, the economic losses caused by the floods of the Chang Jiang and the Huai He reached 48 billion yuan. If we do not speed up the harnessing work, inestimable life and property losses will occur again once great floods hit. While talking about the first three-year work of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu in the "eighth five-year" period, Chen Junsheng said: Among 18 backbone projects for harnessing the Huai He, 12 of them have been started, with an investment of 2.235 billion yuan. Among 10 backbone projects for harnessing the Tai Hu, seven of them have been started, with an investment of 1.292 billion yuan. The construction of all projects goes on fairly smoothly, with some projects already playing their role in preventing floods. Chen Junsheng said: The work of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu will enter an all-out critical stage this year. Departments concerned should have a sense of urgency and strengthen their leadership in the work. For this year, the state's investment in the projects is 1.84 billion yuan, an increase of 50 percent over last year. Department concerned of the central government must ensure that such funds are available in time. Local governments also must guarantee the input of supplementary funds. Chen Junsheng emphatically said: It is necessary for departments concerned to further strengthen leadership in the work of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu, clarify their responsibilities, and carry out their duties. All relevant provinces and cities in the Huai He and the Tai Hu valleys should closely cooperate with each other and be united in harnessing the floods. They must follow the basic principle of taking the whole situation into consideration, be cooperative, and sharing burdens in their future efforts of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu. Thanks to the efforts of the past several years in building water conservancy projects for harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu, these projects will be put into operation one after another. All localities must attach great importance to the management of these projects so as to generate maximum results. Equal attention should be paid to project construction, management, and flood prevention. During the construction period, it is possible for floods to occur each year. Therefore, we should not relax efforts in all flood-prevention tasks. Effective measures should be made to repair the projects damaged by floods. We should be resolute in doing a good job in dredging river courses. We should guarantee that projects already accomplished are put into service on time so as to ensure safe flood seasons. At the meeting, Minister Niu Maosheng of water resources talked about this year's goal of harnessing the Huai He and the Tai Hu. He said: It is imperative to launch a compressive drive to harness the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Huai He's main tributaries. We should open the passage of the middle reaches of the Huai He with all speed. All-out construction of the new river course for the Huaihong should begin so as to ensure its all-line completion in 1995. More efforts should be made in building projects for diverging river water to the east and the south, with a goal of accomplishing the first phase project in 1995. We should still focus the work of harnessing the Tai Hu on projects designed to diverge water of the Taipu He, the Wangyu He, and the Hangjia He to the south and ensure that these projects will be accomplished in 1995. Continued efforts should be made to build the dikes surrounding the Tai Hu and flood-prevention projects in east Shao Xi and west Shao Xi.
