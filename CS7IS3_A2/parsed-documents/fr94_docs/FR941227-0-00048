FR941227-0-00048 FR941227-0-00012 The final regulations, therefore, provide that any section 481(a) adjustment taken into account in the recognition period that prevents an omission or duplication of income or deduction is recognized built-in gain or loss to the extent the adjustment relates to items attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in the regulations. E. Installment Method The proposed regulations impose a section 1374 tax on income reported under the installment method either during or after the recognition period in accordance with Notice 90&hyph;27, 1990&hyph;1 C.B. 336. The tax is imposed only to the extent the income would have been included in net recognized built-in gain if it had been reported in the year of the sale and all provisions of section 1374 applied including the taxable income limitation. Several commentators argue that the proposed regulations wrongly impose a section 1374 tax on income reported under the installment method after the recognition period. In addition, they contend that the proposed regulations wrongly apply the taxable income limitation by reference to the S corporation's cumulative taxable income from the year of the installment sale to the year that income is reported under the installment method (assuming the income had been reported in the year of the sale) instead of the S corporation's taxable income in the year that income was reported under the installment method. Further, they believe that, where income is reported under the installment method after the recognition period, the proposed regulations are unclear regarding the proper use of section 1374 attributes and loss recognized after the recognition period that would have been recognized built-in loss if it had been recognized during the recognition period. The final regulations retain the installment method rules in the proposed regulations because the Treasury and the IRS believe those rules are necessary to prevent an abuse of section 1374. The final regulations clarify the use of an S corporation's section 1374 attributes and loss recognized after the recognition period where income is reported under the installment method for a year after the recognition period. Section 1374 attributes may be used to the extent their use is allowed under all applicable provisions of the Code. However, the S corporation's loss recognized in a year after the recognition period may not be used to reduce the section 1374 tax. F. Partnership Items The proposed regulations generally provide that an S corporation owning an interest in a partnership must treat its distributive share of the partnership's items as recognized built-in gain or loss to the extent the S corporation's distributive share would have been treated as recognized built-in gain or loss if the items originated in, and were taken into account directly by, the S corporation (the look-through rules). The look-through rules generally apply only to the extent the S corporation had built-in gain or built-in loss in its partnership interest at the beginning of the recognition period. The proposed regulations contain a small interest exception from the look-through rules for any taxable year where the S corporation's partnership interest has a value less than $100,000 and represents less than a 10 percent interest in the partnership's capital and profits at all times during the year. The small interest exception does not apply if the partnership was formed or availed of with a principal purpose to avoid the section 1374 tax. The proposed regulations provide that if an S corporation disposes of its partnership interest during the recognition period, the amount treated as recognized built-in gain or loss on the disposition is adjusted to take into account amounts treated as recognized built-in gain or loss under the look-through rules. The proposed regulations also provide special rules for section 704(c) gain and loss, and where an S corporation disposes of distributed partnership assets. Commentators argue that the look-through rules should apply only where an S corporation controls the partnership or the primary use of the partnership by the S corporation is to avoid section 1374 because, except where the S corporation is the controlling partner, the S corporation is not likely to have access to information and records necessary to identify and value partnership section 1374 items. In addition, the commentators suggest modifying the small interest exception to the look-through rules so that the small interest test is generally applied only on the first day of the recognition period. The commentators believe that subsequent increases or decreases in the fair market value of the partnership interest should be disregarded.
