Section 82.154 is amended by revising paragraphs (g) and (h) to read as follows: §82.154 Prohibitions. * * * * * (g) Effective October 18, 1994 until May 15, 1995, no person may sell or offer for sale for use as a refrigerant any class I or class II substance consisting wholly or in part of used refrigerant unless: (1) The class I or class II substance has been reclaimed as defined at §82.152(g); (2) The class I or class II substance was used only in an MVAC or MVAC-like appliance and is to be used only in an MVAC or MVAC-like appliance; or (3) The class I or class II substance is contained in an appliance that is sold or offered for sale together with the class I or class II substance. (h) Effective October 18, 1994 until May 15, 1995, no person may sell or offer for sale for use as a refrigerant any class I or class II substance consisting wholly or in part of used refrigerant unless: (1) The class I or class II substance has been reclaimed by a person who has been certified as a reclaimer pursuant to §82.164; (2) The class I or class II substance was used only in an MVAC or MVAC-like appliance and is to be used only in an MVAC or MVAC-like appliance; or (3) The class I or class II substance is contained in an appliance that is sold or offered for sale together with the class I or class II substance. * * * * * 4. Section 82.156 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1)(ii), (a)(2)(i)(B), (a)(3), (b), (c), and (i)(1), and by adding paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(2)(iii) to read as follows: §82.156 Required practices. * * * * * (a) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (ii) Due to leaks in the appliance, evacuation to the levels in Table 1 is not attainable, or would substantially contaminate the refrigerant being recovered; or (iii) The recycling or recovery equipment was certified pursuant to §82.158(b)(2). In any of these cases, the requirements of §82.156(a)(2) must be followed. (2) *␣*␣* (i) *␣*␣* (B) Be pressurized to 0 psig before it is opened if it is a low-pressure appliance. Persons pressurizing low-pressure appliances that use refrigerants with boiling points at or below 85 ○ F at 29.9 inches of mercury (standard atmospheric pressure), (e.g., CFC&hyph;11 and HCFC&hyph;123,) must not use methods, such as nitrogen, that require subsequent purging. Persons pressurizing low-pressure appliances that use refrigerants with boiling points above 85 ○ F at 29.9 inches of mercury, e.g., CFC&hyph;113, must use heat to raise the internal pressure of the appliance as much as possible, but may use nitrogen to raise the internal pressure of the appliance from the level attainable through use of heat to atmospheric pressure.
