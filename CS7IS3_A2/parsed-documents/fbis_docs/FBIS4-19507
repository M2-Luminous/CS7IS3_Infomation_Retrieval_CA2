Police carried out more than 300 searches and confiscated an unspecified number of weapons, drugs and ammunition in the raids, which were a follow-up to Operation North-South which a few months ago struck at the drug and arms pipeline between south and north. Most of the arrests, police said, were made in the northern region of Lombardy and in the poorer outskirts of Milan, where drug dealers are most active.
