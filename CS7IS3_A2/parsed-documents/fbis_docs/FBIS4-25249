According to the results of the "Assessment of Radiation Environmental Quality Over the Past 30 Years in China's Nuclear Industry," the average radiation level of the environment within 80 kilometers around the nuclear facilities was just 0.01 percent higher than the level of natural radiation [tian ran ben di zhao she 1131 3544 2609 1646 3564 1410], and the effect on the environment was extremely slight. In the last 10 years, China's nuclear industry has made substantial progress in the management of radiation waste and the handling of the old nuclear facilities that were no longer in operation. At the same time, marked results were achieved in the establishment of perfect standards and regulations for environmental protection and in the aspect of international cooperation. The official said: Along with the achievements, some problems also exist. For example, environmental monitoring was somewhat weakened, the quality of monitoring has declined somewhat, personnel and equipment are aging, the quality of the environment has to be further improved, and the professional quality of environmental protection personnel has to be further enhanced. Reportedly, environmental protection work in China's nuclear industry is now focused on the handling of waste, and the management of nuclear waste is being strengthened. Laws and regulations will be enforced strictly, monitoring will be strengthened, modern means will be used to improve the process of environmental assessments so that the quality of the work in this regard will be enhanced, procedures will be simplified, the environmental protection industry will develop on a considerable scale, and personnel training will also be strengthened.
