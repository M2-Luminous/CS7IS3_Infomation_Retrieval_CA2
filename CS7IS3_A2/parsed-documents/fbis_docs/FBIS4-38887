Demirel said: A reasonable solution is being sought. A reasonable solution cannot be found by making territorial concessions as well as concessions involving the flag. Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Kishinev: [Begin Yorulmaz recording] Demirel, who is in Moldova on an official visit, held a news conference yesterday evening and assessed his contacts. He also replied to reporters' question on foreign policy. In reply to a question on Cyprus, Demirel said that the Cyprus problem cannot be solved through the recent report prepared by the UN secretary general. He added: There have been many similar reports in the past. What is being sought? It is a bizonal and bicommunal federation. The Butrus-Ghali report states that this method has so far not yielded any results. A bizonal and a bicommunal Cyprus solution is not yielding any results. As was the case prior to 1963, if you try and bring together two peoples with separate languages, religions, and cultures in a world where federations are crumbling will the problem be solved? Demirel also described as unjust the fact that the Western countries have so far failed to recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. He added that the 150,000 Turkish Cypriots living on the island have been isolated and that no results have been achieved from the efforts exerted within the framework of the United Nations. Demirel said: This is the case because they want the flag as well as territorial concessions. When you give both away then you cannot explain such a solution to anyone. Demirel noted that the Cyprus solution should be acceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. He added: The methods pursued so far have not yielded any results. The time has come to try a new method. Assessing his visit, Demirel said that his contacts in Ukraine and Moldova was aimed at seeking cooperation between Turkey and these countries. Pointing out that during his contacts he also found the opportunity to discuss the situation of the Crimean Tatars and the Gagauz Turks, Demirel said that no one should be concerned that these issues have been included on Turkey's agenda. Demirel noted that Turkey has a historic responsibility toward the Crimean Tatars and the Gagauz Turks, adding that it will be appropriate to extend financial and moral support to these peoples. Demirel added: Turkey is obliged to act in line with the requirements of a great state. Pointing out that Turkey should not give the impression that it is exhausted in the face of its problems, Demirel said: Turkey will continue on its path and will solve its difficulties. New possibilities and means of cooperation will be created. Turkey will continue its growth and prosperity in stability. In reply to a question, Demirel said that his visit has generated a lot of interest in the foreign press, adding that it has raised the question of what Turkey is aiming at. Pointing out that Turkey is an independent country whose policies are not mortgaged and which maintains friendly relations with its neighbors, Demirel added: We do not pursue policies of enmity. In other words, our bilateral relations do not, in any way, pose a threat to a third country. Demirel said that Turkish entrepreneurs precede the state in investing in regional countries. He added that a risk insurance system should be developed with the aim of guaranteeing these investments. Pointing out that the loans extended by Turkey through Exim Bank are clumsy and inept, Demirel added that devising a new loan system will encourage investments. Demirel will conclude his contacts in Moldova today. He will inaugurate the temporary building of the Turkish Embassy in Kishinev and attend the signing ceremony of various bilateral agreements. Demirel will then hold a joint news conference with Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and assess his visit. He will also visit a winery near Kishinev and leave for Ankara this evening.
