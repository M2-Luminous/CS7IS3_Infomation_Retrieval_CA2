A recent Ministry of Agriculture [MOA] summary shows that a higher grain yield will be hard to achieve, with recovery of our cotton output being very difficult. MOA notes that to achieve our 1994 targets of stabilizing our grain output and increasing our cotton output, the task of prime importance will be to take steps to ensure their planting areas. The major immediate problems are: -- The planned area sown to grain is likely to be below the warning line. The planned-area figures reported by the farm sector from all areas show that the area sown to grain in 1994 will be 1.64 billion mu, down 11 million mu from the actually-sown area in 1993, and below the 1.65-billion-mu emergency-warning line. This includes a drop of about 10 million mu for the 15 northern provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions; by variety, the sown area will be down around 7 million mu for wheat, and 13 million mu for early rice in the south. While a recovery-type expansion of 2 million mu is expected, it will be hard to achieve a larger pickup. -- While the area planted to cotton is up, a large gap with plans remains. Since the cotton-purchasing price was raised, the initiative to cultivate cotton in cotton-growing areas has picked up somewhat. But while the cotton area is up 6 million mu from 1993 to 81 million mu, there is still a clear gap between this area and 1994 plans, making the conflict between production and marketing hard to ease. Faced with such a grim grain- and cotton-production situation, MOA holds that the current priority is to emphasize the planting of "two large areas." 1. While consolidating our northern grain area, the 1994 grain area and output stability throughout China will be largely dependent on a large part of the burden being borne by southern paddy rice. We need to guide and encourage qualified areas to expand their "two-hybrid" grain areas, actively disseminating a new combination of high-yield, quality, hybrid rice, in an attempt to sharply recover the planting area in 1994 for paddy rice, particularly early rice. 2. We need to fight a "tough battle" to recover our cotton area in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. The cotton output of these three provinces makes up about one-half of China's. As our national cotton area in 1993 was down 30 million mu from 1992, with 75 percent of the drop being in these three provinces, the implementation of the cotton-planting area in these three provinces in 1994 will be of key importance to our national output. We need to plant well and fully existing bare and leftover spring areas, with qualified areas appropriately increasing their summmer cotton, by actively cultivating cotton on wasteland. All areas need to better oversee and manage agricultural capital goods markets, strictly curbing arbitrary price rises, and firmly cracking down on the production and sale of fake and shoddy agricultural capital goods, to safeguard peasant interests and stimulate peasant initiative to plant cotton. In an attempt to reach state targets for 1994 cotton-area recovery to 90 million mu and gross output of 97 million dan, certain cotton-producing provinces have taken a series of stiff steps. In addition to emphasis by the leadership, their increased fund input and prompt provision of the goods and materials needed for spring planting have played a key role in expanding the area sown to cotton. A recent itemized report by the responsible state sector shows that the following provinces have won initial successes. Jiangxi Province has completed its 1994 planned task of planting 2.6 million mu, up nearly 700,000 mu from 1993 (and similarly hereinafter); Hubei Province has expanded by 200,000 mu, for an overall area of 7.5 million mu, mainly in two-membrane early cotton; the two provinces of Hebei and Shandong have initially increased their areas by more than 10 percent, with Hebei's plans for a cotton acreage of 8.45 million mu implemented down to prefectures and counties. Liaoning Province has increased its area by 390,000 mu, and Henan's planned acreage is up 600,000 mu. The pickup in cottonfield acreage in the above provinces was due to the following two practical measures. 1. These provinces increased their fund input in cotton production. For instance, Hebei provided financial allocations of 51 million yuan in support of cotton planting. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Bank and the credit-cooperative system raised 280 million yuan in special loans focused on cotton-planting preparations. The provincial government also decided to set aside 2 million yuan as a cotton-incentive fund; Shandong continued to spend 4 million yuan for high-yield cotton development; the Jiangxi provincial government decided to take 12 million yuan from cotton-incentive funds assigned outside of the province in 1993 to use for cottonfield water conservancy; Shandong's Dezhou region supported 30 priority cotton townships with 100,000 yuan each in revolving funds. 2. They actively organized goods supplies, promptly providing the materials needed for spring cotton planting and the whole year's production. In Jiangxi Province, where more than 5 million kg of cotton seeds were needed, they took steps, such as importing improved varieties, providing adequate seeds, as well as the fertilizer and loans to households needed for cotton planting; certain counties and cities in Hubei have supplied peasants with related items, such as fine seeds, dual film, herbicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizer; Hebei has supplied 45,000 tons of farm-use diesel oil at parity price in the first quarter, with priority going to cotton planting.
