FR940224-1-00049 FR940224-1-00010 3. With 104,000 mt reserved for shore-based operations in 1994, what are the net benefits to the nation from providing an exclusive opportunity to the shoreside sector to use twice its historical level? In 1993, the Secretary was concerned that the conservation burden of a reduced harvest guideline be equitably shared among the sectors. Similarly, the benefit of an increased harvest guideline also should be equitably shared between the sectors, particularly since it is not expected to result in increased capitalization, but rather in how effectively the existing infrastructure is used. Thus, it would not be reasonable to limit the shoreside sector to only what they processed in 1993 or any prior year. The shoreside industry needs a longer operating window to be viable than the at-sea sector needs. Production by early August will be a key component in determining if shore-based processors will need the entire reserve. Any unneeded portion of the harvest guideline will be made available to the entire fishery on or about August 15, assuring there is adequate time to conduct successful operations on the remainder of the harvest guideline. In 1992 and 1993, the at-sea fleet was able to harvest considerably more than its initial allocation due to the release of whiting not needed by shoreside processors. The historical level of catch or production is not the only consideration. In 1993, both the shore-based and at-sea processing fleets were constrained from catching as much whiting as they wanted. The 40 percent reserve recognizes anticipated lower participation by catcher/processors in 1994 and beyond, consistent with implementation of the limited entry program in January 1, 1994. NOAA has reviewed the Council's recommendation and supporting analysis and initially has determined that the proposed rule is consistent with the Magnuson Act and its national standards and other applicable Federal laws. NOAA also requests comments on the advisability of releasing additional amounts of whiting after August 15, but only if necessary to ensure full utilization of the harvest guideline. Clarification The regulatory text would revise an incorrect cross-reference at ยง663.7 which should read ยง663.23(b)(4)(v). Classification This proposed rule is published under authority of the Magnuson Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., and was prepared at the request of the Pacific Fishery Management Council. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (Assistant Administrator), has initially determined that this proposed rule is necessary for management of the Pacific coast groundfish fishery and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. The Council prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for this proposed rule (contained in the EA/RIR), and concluded that there would be no significant impact on the environment. A copy of the EA may be obtained from the Council (see ADDRESSES ). The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. Although the whiting fleet contains less than 20 percent of the total number of groundfish vessels, if this proposed rule diverts effort from other traditional groundfish stocks, more than 20 percent of the fleet could potentially be affected. However, none of the options is expected to have impacts that would qualify under any of the criteria for determining ``significant'' impacts, nor would they force any small business entity to cease operation. In fact, in comparison to the status quo, the proposed rule could result in greater fishing opportunities for non-whiting vessels and thus increased revenues. For these reasons, it is determined that the proposed rule potentially would affect a substantial number of small entities, but would not cause significant economic impacts on those entities. Therefore, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) is not required. Also, the Council has requested that this notice announce a correction to page 77 of the EA/RIR, the last sentence in the first paragraph, so that it reads: ``The Council concludes that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have significant effects on small entities in 1994&hyph;1996.''
