The influential general controls large areas in northern Afghanistan on the border with Tajikistan. His envoys are reported to have informed the other side of Kabul's readiness to put him in charge of Sherkhan. His emissaries assured their Tajik counterparts that Dustum would do all he can to restore a transit camp for Tajik refugees at Sherkhan. In their words, Dustum's units will guarantee the safe return of Tajik fugitives to their homeland. More than 50,000 Tajiks fled into Afghanistan at the peak of military hostilities there in 1992.
