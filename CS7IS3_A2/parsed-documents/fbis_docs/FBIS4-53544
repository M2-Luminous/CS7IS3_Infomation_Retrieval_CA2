The cases are being watched by the United States as criteria to judge whether or not Thailand should be removed from the U.S. Priority Watch List. Reporting on the matter, Deputy Commerce Minister Chulin Laksanawisit said the five cases of copyright violation are of great interests to foreigners. He said the court so far had ruled on three cases. The Macalpine Company is subjected to a fine of 80,000 baht and one-year probation pending a jail term of eight months. The three defendants in the Robot case were subjected to a fine of 35,000 baht each, but the sum was reduced to half because they all confessed. The Sky Company was subjected to a fine of 200,000 baht and one-year probation pending a prison term of one year. Two other cases, the Super Peacock and the MBK cases, are still under the hearing of plaintiff witnesses. The five cases, in addition to the copyright bill which is to be approved by the parliament, are being used by the United States as conditions to decide whether to remove Thailand from the Priority Watch List.
