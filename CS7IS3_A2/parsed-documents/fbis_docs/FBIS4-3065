The current difficulties faced by the province are temporary ones encountered in the course of advance. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council, it is entirely possible to invigorate Heilongjiang's economy with the efforts of the people of the entire province. From 12 to 17 April, Zhu Rongji, accompanied by Heilongjiang's party and government leaders, including Sun Weiben, Tian Fengshan, and Cong Fukui, and other comrades, arrived in Daqing, Zhaodong, Harbin, and other areas for inspection tours to conduct investigations. Comrade Yue Qifeng [deputy secretary of Liaoning party committee and Liaoning governor] participated in the inspection tour from beginning to end. Zhu Rongji visited drilling sites, factory workshops, state-owned granaries, grain stations, rural seed growers, and farm product markets to have a cordial conversation with workers, farmers, and shop assistants. He inquired in detail about their production, business, and living conditions. He also called on cadres and workers of state-owned forestry-industry farms and land reclamation farms to hold talks with them. In Harbin, he held several talks with the leaders of relevant departments directly under the provincial government and leaders of prefectures and cities, enterprises, and factories to discuss ways to invigorate Heilongjiang's economy. After affirming Heilongjiang's important contributions to the state and the achievements the province has scored since the introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, he said: The party Central Committee and the State Council pay special attention to Heilongjiang's economic development. Entrusted by Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, I, together with other comrades from the relevant departments under the State Council, have come here to conduct investigations and studies and to discuss with the provincial leaders new ideas for reform and development and measures for overcoming the current difficulties and for developing the economy. Zhu Rongji stressed: The difficulties which have cropped up in the course of Heilongjiang's economic development are temporary difficulties in the course of advance. There is no doubt that they can be overcome. In solving these problems, the most important thing we must do is to unify the thinking of the cadres and people of the whole province, enhance their understanding, and change their concepts. The characteristics of Heilongjiang's economy are that it has resources and that industry and state-owned enterprises occupy a large proportion of the economy. This is a factor restricting economic development, but is also an advantage for invigorating the province's economy. So long as the province does its work in a down-to-earth manner in accordance with requirements for developing a socialist market economy, it will be able to transform these factors of restriction to favorable conditions for developing the economy. Zhu Rongji said: Heilongjiang is the nation's important grain producing province and is also the nation's largest strategic base for grain reserves. It has great potential for grain production. Its 80 million mu of low-yielding farms can be improved; moreover, it has another 50 million mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed for farming. The central authorities attach great importance to agriculture. They are adopting measures to narrow the gap between the princes of agricultural and industrial products and are increasing investment in agriculture. So long as Heilongjiang upholds the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, makes full use of its advantages, readjusts its planting structure, popularizes fine seed strains, and develops a diversified economy, it will be able to turn agriculture into an important pillar for invigorating its economy. He pointed out: Town and village enterprises in Heilongjiang are not well developed, and farmers' incomes are increasing at a slow pace, but Heilongjiang's industry has enough technological strength to support the development of town and village enterprises. The prospects are promising in this area. Zhu Rongji said: Heilongjiang Province is an important industrial base in China. In particular, it has various categories of heavy industries; its technological strength is strong, and in terms of equipment Heilongjiang is not bad at all. The province should make the upgrading of state-owned large- and medium-size enterprises the focus of its economic work and enhance the leading role of these enterprises. The fundamental way to deal with the difficulties encountered by state-owned enterprises is to deepen reform and to effectively change their operating mechanisms in line with the requirements for building modern enterprises. In building a modern enterprise system, the most important thing to do is to separate government administration from enterprise management. The government should not interfere with an enterprise's decisions regarding normal operations. The government's main task is to supervise the leading bodies of enterprises and macroeconomic environment. While in Harbin, Zhu Rongji inspected the ordnance enterprises which were encountering relatively greater difficulties. He stressed: Ordnance enterprises should continue to carry forward the spirit of self-reliant work to build an enterprise with arduous efforts, and change their way of operation and management in line with the requirements of a market economy. At the same time, they should make accurate decisions regarding switching from the manufacture of military products to that of civilian products. First, they should undertake more labor-intensive projects, instead of projects that need a large sum of capital, so as to employ more surplus labor; second, they should undertake more technical transformation projects instead of capital construction projects, because this is an effective way to get quick returns with less investment; third, they should no longer rely on appropriations to undertake new projects. They should use their own capital or bank loans, but should consider their ability to repay loans; and fourth, they should undertake more service projects instead of concentrating entirely on industrial projects. Touching on debts among enterprises, Zhu Rongji said: In settling arrears among enterprises this time, new methods will be adopted to deal with the new characteristics. The state will not inject large sums of funds to settle arrears caused by the shortage of funds for investment in fixed assets. When funds raised by localities for projects are insufficient, the relevant prefectural authorities must quickly readjust their capital construction scale and channel their funds into other areas so as to ensure the minimum amount of funds; otherwise, banks will suspend loans for the projects. It is necessary to foster a concept of the legal system, strengthen settlement discipline, and prevent the accumulation of new arrears while settling the old ones. Zhu Rongji said: Heilongjiang has the advantage in opening to the outside world. It should work harder to absorb and utilize foreign capital. While developing all-directional trade, it should strive to improve border trade, rectify the border trade order, readjust border trade structures, and adopt strict measures to control quality so as to promote the healthy development of border trade. While inspecting Daqing, Zhu Rongji pointed out: Daqing has made immortal contributions in changing the concept that "China is poor in petroleum." Daqing should inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of building an enterprise with arduous efforts which took shape during the all-out effort to prospect for oil, and make greater contributions to the state. It should adopt advanced technology and strive hard to stabilize its oil output at the current production level before the year 2000. At the same time, it should strive to simultaneously develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, improve urban planning, and build itself into a prosperous area in the north. During the few days of investigations and studies, Zhu Rongji and other leaders of the relevant departments under the State Council he was leading discussed with the comrades from Heilongjiang new ideas for reform and development. They also solved some practical problems in economic development for Heilongjiang, especially for its ordnance and coal enterprises, as well as for state-owned forestry-industry and land reclamation farms. Accompanying Zhu Rongji on the inspection tour were comrades from the relevant ministries and commissions under the State Council, including Liu Zhongli, Guo Shuyan, Wang Senhao, Han Zhubin, Xu Youfang, Tu Yourui, Wang Tao, Sheng Huaren, Zhu Yuli, and Zhang Junjiu.
