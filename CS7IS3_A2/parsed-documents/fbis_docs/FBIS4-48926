The Bank of China's Hong Kong Macao Office assistant officer, Zheng Polin, said the government's attempts to curb the overheating economy had gradually been effective. The over-supply of currency was under control and the amount of bank deposits had gradually risen in the wake of the economic reforms adopted during the second half of 1993. Mr Zheng said yesterday that the series of reforms in China also enhanced the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and provided ample opportunities for the territory's economic development. The banking sector in Hong Kong had been further developed with the opening by 13 local banks of 60 branches or offices in China since 1985, he said. In turn, the China-based commercial banks had established offices in the territory. Both the financial and securities markets in Hong Kong would grow bigger, because they could act as centres for the large amount of fund raising required for the restructuring of China state-owned enterprises and many construction projects. Mr Zheng stressed that Shanghai could not usurp Hong Kong's position as the prime financial centre, in view of the time needed to develop it and the different characteristics of both cities. Neither did Singapore have the ability to surpass Hong Kong as, in comparison to Hong Kong, it was geographically far from China. China Merchants vice-general manager Lin Jiang said high inflation would cause pressure on the stability of the yuan exchange rate. The exchange rate was being stabilised after the currency's unification, which also implied that the timing and other mechanisms for the reforms were correct. He expected that the exchange rate of the yuan would be maintained in the near future as the policies of the Peoples' Bank of China would be effective in relieving the pressure on the demand for foreign currency in China. However, the stability of the yuan in the medium to long-term depended on fundamental economic factors such as inflation and interest rates. Mr Lin said it was unlikely that the business market for foreign banks would open within the next year or two because state banks were not competitive enough in terms of operations, management and staff skills. The government would tend to protect the state banks until they were mature enough to compete on an equal basis, he said.
