But the Belovezhskiye agreements closed the book on its history. Sovereign units of the former Soviet Army are not simply living separate lives; they are also confronting one another. Quite likely, those who just a couple of years ago would have been called up into the same army might now be looking at each other across a front line -- in Azerbaijan, Ingushetia and the Dnestr region. The question of invincibility will be answered differently in the history textbooks of each nation. Still, the army will always remain legendary. It is an army that was feared by the entire world -- an army with Halhin-Gol and the Great Patriotic War, Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, Tbilisi and Baku in 1989, and Vilnius in 1991 behind its back. To some, this is the stuff of a heroic legend, while to others it is horrifying. But no matter what the official name of this day brings to the minds of what used to be the Soviet people, 23 February will remain a holiday of the Soviet Army. It will remain so for all who served in it, and who waited for their soldiers to return from the front or from compulsory service. Russia Numerical Strength (as of 7 May 1992)--2.8 million.
