Among the guests of honor are leaders of terrorist countries and sworn enemies of South Africa and the West, such as Fidel Castro, Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, and Saddam Husayn. Western leaders mentioned include President Bill Clinton, Mr. John Major, and Dr. Helmut Kohl. Political observers believe this could be a protocol and diplomatic hot potato that might leave organizers of the event with red faces, as Western leaders distance themselves from the leaders of the terrorist countries.
