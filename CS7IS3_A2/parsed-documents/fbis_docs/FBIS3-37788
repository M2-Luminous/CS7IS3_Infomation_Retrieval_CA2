According to him, Russia and the West will "go through periods of complications, since currently they are involved in readjusting their interests." As the first deputy foreign minister said, Russia's present course is "to regulate the inevitable differences in interests by political means, through discussions, through partnership." "If we are pushed off this path of narrowing our differences, we'll have to search for other ways to uphold our interests, since our interests cannot be discarded. Therefore the West will have to reckon with us in one way or another," Adamishin noted. "Cooperation with Russia will yield considerably greater results in the efforts to settle conflicts and ensure security in Europe, than relapses into confrontation with Moscow reminiscent of the "cold war," he pointed out. President Boris Yeltsin's call for holding a special conference between the leaders of Russia, the USA, France, Britain and Germany to reach a political solution to the Bosnian issue remains in force, the diplomat stressed. According to Adamishin, there is a need to find "a formula for consolidating cooperation." "The formats can be different. One of them is the Security Council and the U.N. in general. Another is what is taking place in Bonn, where high-ranking officials from 12 European Union countries, Russia, the USA and Canada began their consultations on Tuesday." As Interfax's interviewee confirmed, at the conference Russia will be represented by the special envoy of its president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin. The meeting will not be attended by the warring Bosnian sides. Its goal is to coordinate the endeavors of Russia and its Western partners to resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, who is making a tour of the countries involved in the "Visegrad Group," is not planning to visit Bonn, Adamishin said. "The conference is taking place on the level of experts," he explained. According to the high-ranking diplomat, the turning of G-7 into G-8 can become another form of interaction between Russia and the West. "NATO's Partnership for Peace program can also serve as an area where useful exchanges of views and coordination of differring stands can take place," he said. With reference to problems connected with a settlement in Bosnia as such, Adamishin said that the withdrawal of heavy artillery and other military hardware from Sarajevo by the Serbs and Muslims is "a serious breakthrough achieved by political means." "Now it's essential to consolidate this first success," he said. According to the diplomat, Russia has a clear-cut program for further actions in this direction. "It provides for a final demilitarization of Sarajevo. This can be achieved by means of placing the city under temporary U.N. administration, as virtually all plans for settlement envisaged," he said. "The endeavors to resolve some other painful problems faced in Bosnia basing on the lessons taught by the Sarajevo crisis can pose another step," Adamishin noted. He does not view the course of "further ultimatums" as "very productive," he pointed out. "As developments in and around Sarajevo have proved, the course of reaching a political solution to the conflict Russia has always pursued yields the best results. To bank on the assumption that all sorts of ultimatums will be repeated, and Russia will continue to break the deadlocks, will not lead to gaining a settlement," Adamishin said. He said he disagrees with the allegations that "the Serbs would have had to yield to the NATO ultimatum anyway, and that Russia just helped to save their face by asking them to meet its request, not NATO's ultimatum." "Even though this concerns only intentions, nevertheless the possibility that the Serbs would have disregarded NATO's ultimatum cannot be ruled out. Events could have developed differently, which would have led to unpredictable consequences," Adamishin said. According to Interfax's interviewee, the use of intimidation to achieve one's goal is not the most effective method in diplomacy. "This does not mean that Russia rejects the use of force altogether. Moscow agreed that the U.N. forces in former Yugoslavia can give rebuffs, if attacked. These forces include Russian servicemen, and we cannot leave them unarmed from this point of view. The question is that such decisions should be taken with great considerateness, through the only possible channel -- the U.N. Security Council," he stressed. Russia's first deputy foreign minister called for a continuation of talks between the three warring Bosnian sides. "This is needed to reach a comprehensive solution in Bosnia, which had actually been gained. Subsequently the Muslims went back on it in the belief that they will gain more on the battlefield than at the negotiating table," Adamishin pointed out. "But since the ultimate goal is to achieve a final political settlement, Russia concedes that the plan suggested by the cochairmen of the international conference on settlement in the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, can be slightly and finally corrected." The vice president of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Aleksandr Vladislavlev, has described President Yeltsin's endeavors to settle the crisis in Bosnia as a remarkable success for Russian diplomacy. The reaction of all the parties concerned to the Russian president's initiative has proved that, "when Russia proceeds from its clearly understood interests and firmly upholds them, it regains the role of a great power," he told Interfax's correspondent. Vladislavlev urged all political forces, above all the Federal Assembly, to discard prejudices and support the Russian president who has proved to be "an outstanding statesman." He also called upon all political parties and unions to use this opportunity to achieve concord in the country. Russia's initiative concerning Sarajevo is a substantial success scored by Moscow; it proves that Russia has not abandoned its long- term policy in the Balkans, the well-known Yugoslav-born French businessman, Boris Vukobrat, who leads an international fund for peace and solution to critical situations, told Interfax. Nevertheless, Vukobrat pointed out that the withdrawal of military hardware from Sarajevo "does not mean that peace in Bosnia has been achieved. However it might become a step toward peace, if the forces involved in it realize that the holocaust in Bosnia has gone too far, and that it endangers not only Yugoslavia, but also Europe as a whole." He urged the European countries, above all Russia and the USA, to join their efforts to stop those who "wish to fan the flames in Bosnia." Vukobrat called for preventing Bosnia from being divided into ethnic states. According to him, this would be "a historic mistake," since the liquidation of Bosnia is in the interests of no ethnic group living there. "A divided Bosnia will become a source of constant clashes, fresh wars and casualties," Vukobrat pointed out.
