[passage omitted] Late this afternoon Minister Granic held talks with Haris Silajdzic. [Begin Granic recording] "The European Union has sent a (?memorandum) in which it warns all the sides to make all possible efforts to achieve an urgent end to hostilities and an agreement. This is probably one of the most important days of the Geneva negotiations. If no agreement is reached, there is a big chance that the war will intensify even further. Croatia is making extreme efforts to bring about an end to the conflict and, in the spirit of the agreement that President Tudjman proposed to President Izetbegovic, primarily an end to the conflict between the Croats and the Muslims, and to reach an agreement between them. Croatia is also making efforts to normalize relations between Croatia and Serbia on the basis of mutual recognition and of certain necessary preconditions. That was the main topic of all the talks today, the lengthy talks with Prime Minister Silajdzic and with the Bosnian Muslim delegation." [end recording] [passage omitted]
