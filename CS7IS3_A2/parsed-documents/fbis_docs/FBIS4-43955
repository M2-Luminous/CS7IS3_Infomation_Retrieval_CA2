She said: "We could reject the aid package." Ciller said she would contact President Clinton on the issue and stressed that Turkey will regard the condition on the aid package as a U.S. request to "abandon the struggle against terrorism." In a statement to HURRIYET yesterday, Ciller asserted: "The U.S. aid can be subject to no condition. It will be very wrong if the aid is reduced and linked with the condition that it must not be used for internal security purposes. As far as human rights are concerned, Turkey is waging a just struggle. We are waging a struggle against terrorism. If the United States says we `cannot use its military aid for internal security purposes,' then we will take that to mean that `we must not wage a struggle against terrorism.' If the aid is reduced and made conditional, then it will mean that the United States does not approve of our struggle against terrorism. But the whole world knows that President Clinton supports our struggle. The Senate Appropriations Committee's decision is confusing. The mistake must be rectified. I will call President Clinton when I return to Ankara to confer with him on the reduced and conditional aid package. We could reject the aid if necessary."
