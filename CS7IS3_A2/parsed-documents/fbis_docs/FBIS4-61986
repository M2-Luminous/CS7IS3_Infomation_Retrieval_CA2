The Azerbaijani economy is in a crisis condition; those citizens who live only on wages have dropped below the poverty line. There is no need to comment in detail on the tricky social and political problems such poverty has caused or may cause. If the impoverishment of the masses continues at the present rate, it will eliminate all opportunities for the democratic development of society and our Motherland's defense capabilities. The deepening economic crisis and further impoverishment of the population are processes that run in parallel and are interrelated. The exacerbation of the economic crisis in Azerbaijan is caused by both objective and subjective factors. At the same time, the currently adopted contradictory decisions are a sign of vagueness of the strategic line in the economy. Periodic wage increases for the purpose of neutralizing the tricky problems of impoverishment in the end do not solve the problem, since the pace of wage increases lags far behind the pace of increases in the cost of living. Thus, the main burden of economic decline falls on the shoulders of the low-income strata of the population, while the persons and state bodies whose responsibility it is to avert the crisis apparently are relieved of the need to conduct a firm economic policy. This situation cannot continue for long, however. While expressing our concern in connection with the current situation, we believe it necessary to implement the law on wage indexation for the purpose of averting a further worsening of the population's standard of living. This law by itself cannot help to improve the material situation of those living on earned wages. By setting up a mechanism for its implementation, it is possible to freeze the current difficult material situation of the workers and avert a further worsening of it. If we begin to implement this law, the persons and structures currently shirking their responsibility for governing at the expense of a decline in the popular standard of living will be forced to conduct decisive, well-thought-out, comprehensive political reforms.
