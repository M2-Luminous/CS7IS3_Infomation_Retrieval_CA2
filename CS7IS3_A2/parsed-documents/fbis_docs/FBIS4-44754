A new page has been turned with this decision (LE MONDE 24 February). The public authorities have made a clearly nonprofit-oriented choice regarding the fate of this installation costing 27.7 billion French francs [Fr] supporting the recommendations made in mid-January by DSIN (Nuclear Installations Safety Directorate), for whom power production at Superphenix was no longer a priority. The industrial logic has thus given way to research programs. As the Hotel Matignon communique explained it, EDF (France's Electric Power Co) "will have no authority over Superphenix' operating power levels," but states that CEA (Atomic Energy Commissariat), a purely research organization, will henceforth enter the game with EDF and NERSA (Nuclear Energy Association), which is responsible for the plant's operation. Thus, Superphenix will operate in stages to adapt to a research program that is to be proposed by a supervisory committee combining NERSA, EDF, and CEA, one or two months from now. This program, evaluated by Robert Dautray, high commissioner for atomic energy, and Claude Detraz, director of CNRS' (National Center for Science and Research) National Institute for Subatomic Physics, will be monitored by a scientific committee, which will issue a yearly report on the experiment conducted. For Gerard Longuet, minister of Industry, Posts, Telecommunications and Foreign Trade, and for Francois Fillon, minister of Higher Education and Research, this program should permit "the preservation of our (France's) lead in the fast breeder field," and determine the ability of this way "to generate power while managing the plutonium produced, and burning up nuclear waste over the long term." Are these also the choices of EDF's partners within NERSA, Germany's SBK (Fast Breeder Power Plant Co) and Italy's ENEL (Italy's Nuclear Electric Power Co). The government, while awaiting the answers, is saying that they "(should) accept their responsibility and pay the costs." In fact, there are some people who are not opposed to reviewing the levels of participation of SBK or ENEL, or, if worse comes to worse, seeing one of them drop out of the project altogether. Everyone knows that abandoning the reactor could cost Fr8-12 billion, and that litigation on this point with France's partners could raise this to 18 billion.
