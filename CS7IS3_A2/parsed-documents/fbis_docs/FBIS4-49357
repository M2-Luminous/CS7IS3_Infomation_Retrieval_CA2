Clinton made the above statement at a news conference in Atlanta, Georgia, which was televised by CNN worldwide. Clinton said: Judging from current actual conditions, China has made significant comprehensive progress in many areas. However, in order to work out the differences existing between the United States and China before the 3 June deadline, "we still have a way to go." He added: I believe that if we were to withdraw China's MFN status, U.S.-Chinese relations would be undermined. He said he did not wish to see this happen.
