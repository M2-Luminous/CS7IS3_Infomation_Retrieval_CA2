This will give a more realistic picture to U.S. official circles, the Communist Party's press service announced. Zyuganov pointed out that the Russian Communist Party and all Russian patriotic movements were "concerned over the inflexible approach of the U.S. to Russian political forces and believed that the growth in anti-American sentiment in Russia and the U.S. unconditional support for the present unpopular executive power have something in common." Commenting on the situation in Russia, the Communist leader suggested that the shock-therapy policy was dangerous for Russia and could provoke social unrest. However, he said the Russian Communist Party rejected both the right and the left radicalism and was ready to cooperate with any political forces which stood for "restoration of a strong Russia as a guarantee for peace and stability in the whole world." Nixon had a conversation with former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy who had been released on February 26 in accordance with the resolution on political amnesty. The ex-U.S. president also met with the leader of the Russian Unity and Concord's parliamentary faction, Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policies, Sergey Shakhray. A meeting between Nixon and the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) Leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is also expected. As it was earlier reported, the LDP received 63 seats in the State Duma after the December parliamentary elections.
