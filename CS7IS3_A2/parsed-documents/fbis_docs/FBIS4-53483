Two hundred public officials will be trained abroad next year, up 30 percent from 150, according to the 1995 state-funded training program for civil servants released by the Government Administration Ministry Tuesday. Noting overseas training so far was limited to academic studies and getting degrees, public officials will also be sent to foreign government agencies, international organizations, and think tanks for field studies with a view to raising their practical abilities to handle external negotiations. Training will no longer be restricted to advanced countries. Eighty officials will be trained at English-speaking countries; 35 in non-English speaking countries like Japan, Germany, and France; 35 in other areas, and 50 in international organizations and research institutes. Public officials in good standing and recommended by their agencies will be chosen by the end of October after testing their language ability, a Ministry official said. On returning from their overseas training, officials have to serve two to three years in related posts, he said.
