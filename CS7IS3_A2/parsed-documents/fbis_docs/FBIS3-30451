Zhirinovskiy, Russian ultra-nationalist and chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which emerged victorious at the Russian recent parliamentary elections, told REUTER that "the Czech Republic will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few breweries in which the beer will turn bitter will be left of the Czech Republic." Lebedev said that Zhirinovskiy's views did not reflect any official or semi-official line, but were his own opinions. Judging by his statements, it can be said that Zhirinovskiy knows the rules of the "propagandist game" that the more extravagant and wild are the ideas expressed the greater attention they attract. "And this is what he needs. So let us take this with humour," Lebedev said. He said he did not have information so far about Zhirinovskiy being prepared to visit the Czech Republic. Lebedev pointed out, however, that Zhirinovskiy is travelling to the states in Russia's vicinity. "We shall see what his plans are, but I know nothing about them thus far. However, if he were to decide to visit the Czech Republic, given his statement that in Czech breweries the beer will turn bitter, it would mean that he would try to drink some good beer in time," Lebedev said.
