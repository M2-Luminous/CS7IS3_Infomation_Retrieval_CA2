It is therefore of utmost importance that his successor has a vision of Europe in tune with the post-Maastricht mood of its inhabitants. The two leading contenders are Jean-Luc Dehaene, Prime Minister of Belgium, and Ruud Lubbers, former Prime Minister of The Netherlands. The contest has become more than just a question of competence, personality and political weight: it is now seen as the weathervane of the European Union's [EU] future direction. But the chances of agreement being reached by the 12 heads of government at their forthcoming meeting in Corfu are not good. To Britain's dismay, Mr Dehaene has been the favourite. Arguments claimed in his favour include his record of competence during last year's Belgian EU presidency, an ability to compromise, an outlook relatively free of socialist dogmatism. But he is also a federalist of the old order. Being Belgian, he will find it hard to distance himself from the Establishment of Brussels, and is ill-placed to respond to demands for regionalism, subsidiarity and a cutback in interference by unelected bureaucrats. Above all, he is the candidate that France and Germany have attempted to impose by diktat. France has an unreasonable desire for another French-speaker at the head of the Commission at a time when it sees four naturally anglophone members are about to join; Helmut Kohl has turned against Mr Lubbers for no better reason than personal dislike. Even if Mr Delors's successor must be chosen by secret manoeuvring rather than open ballot, this degree of manipulation should not be accepted. Even more insulting is the open talk of compensation jobs -- not in any European leaders gift -- for defeated aspirants. Mr Lubbers is better qualified for the job than Mr Dehaene. Support for him may prevent the immediate imposition of Mr Dehaene at Corfu. But it will probably lead only to stalemate. Of the other candidates, Peter Sutherland, a forceful former Irish Commissioner, has attracted considerable support. But Sir Leon Brittan, the EU Trade Commissioner, is without doubt the best qualified prospective successor to Mr Delors. A French speaker, a superb negotiator -- a GaTT treaty would have been impossible without him -- and a skilful diplomat who has re-established relations with southern countries upset by his firmness as former Competition Commissioner, he combines the liberal free trade ideas with commitment to a Europe that is open and decentralised. Given the Prime Minister's reputation in Europe and the fiasco of Britain's performance over voting rights, British support for Sir Leon will not be enough. It is therefore up to other countries to recognise that he would best take Europe in the direction most of their voters want. The French have a critical role here; their divided government must ask itself how much it really want a president as federalist as Mr Dehaene. Though the tide in the European Community remains unfavourable for antifederalists, no opportunity to shift it a little nearer to thinking which could be embraced by French Gaullistes no less than British Euro-sceptics should be squandered.
