Although 52 types of civilian goods have gone into production during the past 12 months, managers of former defense plants are unhappy with the results of their work. They are dissatisfied about mutual nonpayments, reduction of investment activity, and the failure of many existing development projects to match up to the requirements of domestic and, especially, foreign investors. According to Anatoliy Karpov, president of the Polieks joint-stock company, conversion in the kray has been conducted in an incompetent and uncivilized way. Traditional markets for output are being lost as a result. Over 5,000 employees have been made redundant from enterprises undergoing conversion. The council decided to set up collateral and insurance funds in the form of precious metals, minerals, raw materials and land allocations. The conversion program for the current year was endorsed. It is intended that another 44 new articles should go into production, including a prototype consignment of passenger carriages, multipurpose diesel engines, microwave stations, electric meters, electric motors for pumps and domestic appliances, hay cutters and motor assemblies, medical equipment and medicine. Specialists reckon that all this will require over 138 billion rubles of credit. Some of the kray defense enterprises, included in the republican conversion program, are hoping to get funds from the federal budget. Others are relying on their own resources and assistance from domestic and foreign investors.
