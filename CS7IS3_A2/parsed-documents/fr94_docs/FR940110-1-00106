Subpart K_Affordable Housing Reserve Fund ยง960.20 Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. (a) If a Bank fails to use or commit the full amount it is required to contribute to the AHP in any year pursuant to ยง960.18, 90 percent of the amount that has not been used or committed in that year shall be deposited by the Bank in an Affordable Housing Reserve Fund established and administered by the Board. The 10 percent of the unused and uncommitted amount retained by the Bank should be fully used or committed by the Bank during the following year, and any remaining portion must be deposited in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. A Bank is deemed to have used or committed its required contribution where amounts are remaining at the end of the year because funding the next highest ranking project would exceed the Bank's required AHP contribution for the year. Such amounts remaining shall be combined with returned AHP funds to fund the next highest scoring AHP project or projects, or carried over by the Bank to the next year's AHP funding cycles. (b) By January 15 of each year, each Bank shall provide to the Board a statement indicating the amount of unused and uncommitted funds from the prior year, if any, which will be deposited in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund. (c) By January 31 of each year, the Board will notify the Banks of the total amount of funds, if any, available in the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund.
