Experts are now determining the exact weight and composition of this ``bomb,'' but it is conjectured that enriched uranium-238 was in three cylindrical containers with a diameter of 15 cm and a length of 40 cm. Aleksey Shishkov, chief of the FCS Sochi service, has reported that preliminary measurements showed that the radioactive background created by the containers exceeded the maximum permissible norms by a factor of two and that the cylinders posed a great danger. Incidentally, the owner of the commodity (it would be premature to name him) had put the containers inside tubes, but it ``shone'' pretty well even through the additional protection. Intelligence officers are not yet saying how they happened upon the uranium dealer. It is only known that two capsules were first removed from two hiding places, while the third was discovered on the citizen when he was detained. He was arrested last weekend in the very center of Sochi. It is assumed that he intended to sell the containers to foreigners for a large sum in dollars. Criminal proceedings have been instituted, envisaging punishment not only for stealing radioactive substances but also for violating the regulations governing their storage. The most interesting question, to which the answer must be found, is this: How and from where did the dangerous capsules get to the Black Sea? According to militia staffers, the threads of the crime lead to the Urals region....
