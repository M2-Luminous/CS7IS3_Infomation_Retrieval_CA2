As a result, Sino-Korean border trade in the first five months of this year decreased sharply. Informed people have said that the decline is unprecedented and the margin of the decline was as big as 72.4 percent. This meant that the volume of border trade between China and North Korea dropped to almost one-quarter of the previous level. The CPC authorities are afraid that North Korea's failure to endure the economic pressure will eventually lead to instability in the Sino-Korean border area. Thus, they are trying to maintain the stability in the border area and have promised to give limited material assistance. According to information from the Jilin border area, the Chinese side was not happy with North Korea's behavior but China also feared that North Korea, which is adjacent to China, would behave unscrupulously when the situation becomes critical and this would in turn affect China's stability. So, China only gave political support to North Korea. Jin Zongzhu, former mayor of Tumen City, an open border town in Jilin and current director of the Economic and Trade Commission of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, said that being affected and constrained by various internal and external factors, North Korea sharply decreased its border trade with Yanbian Prefecture in the first five months of this year. The volume of two-way trade amounted to only $80.44 million, a mere 15.5 percent of the yearly target and down by 46.1 percent from that in the same period of last year. In particular, the exports from the Chinese side amounted to only $22.59 million, only 8.7 percent of the yearly target and down by 72.4 percent from that in the same period of last year. This marked the largest margin of decline in the history of Sino-Korean border trade. The possible sanctions imposed by the international community on North Korea constitute one of the major reasons for the decline in Sino-Korean border trade. At present, North Korea, being the main trade partner for Yanbian Prefecture, is seriously short of energy resources and is undergoing a serious economic landslide while facing the possibility of sanctions imposed by the Western countries and crop failures. As a result, its export commodities continued to decrease and it could take fewer and fewer materials in conducting border trade with China. At the same time, the rate of trade contract fulfillment also dropped to an ever lower level. On the other hand, Sino-Russian border trade is also undergoing a sharp decline. This is because the Russian economy has been bogged down in a predicament for the last few years, plus such problems as the unstable political situation, changeable policies, poor trade credit, and rising protectionism in the field of foreign trade. The dull situation in the Sino-Russian border trade in the recent period is reflected in the following figures: In the first quarter of this year, the volume of imports made by Heilongjiang Province amounted to only $210 million, down by 52.4 percent from that in the same period of last year, and the proportion of imports in the gross volume of imports and exports was down by 27 percentage points. At the same time, the volume of imports and exports in border trade in the first five months of this year decreased by 6 percent. Businessmen engaged in Sino-Russian border trade said that a major reason for the decline in Sino-Russian border trade was the fact that the Russian side tightened up the visa control over people entering its territory and this constrained the travel of the people engaged in border trade. In addition, the Russian side also restricted the exportation of raw materials, increased prices and tariff controls, and tightened up supervision over imported goods. After China merged the two foreign exchange rates systems and began to levy value-added taxes, some Chinese enterprises engaged in border trade recorded poorer profits in their business and this lowered the import demand on the Chinese side and also affected the export business. Moreover, some market factors also constrained the further development of Sino-Russian border trade. As Japan and the DPRK increased their competitive power on the Russian market, the share of the Chinese products in Russia's Far East market began to shrink and the market for Chinese goods became saturated.
