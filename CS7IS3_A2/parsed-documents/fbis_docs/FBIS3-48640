Washington will accept Seoul's request that it not issue Kim a residence permit, a senior official at the South Korean Embassy said Tuesday. The State Department notified the embassy that Kim has applied for a resident's permit and said that it will deal prudently with the application by Kim, who is suspected of taking bribes related to Korea's military build-up program, the official said. "It will take a little time for us to receive an official confirmation from the U.S. State Department, I guess," he said. "But it is clear that Kim did not ask for political asylum in the United States." The Korean Government has explained to the U.S. Government that Kim is wanted for prosecution in Seoul and has asked it to deal cautiously with any application to extend his visa or for a residence permit, according to the official. "The U.S. reaction was that it will make a decision on the problem through prudent internal discussion," he said. In the notification, the State Department did not reveal the date, place or content of Kim's application, but embassy officials think it was made this year. Kim went to Washington as a guest researcher at the Heritage Foundation in April last year and stayed when he was implicated in irregularities in the Yulgok (military modernization) project.
