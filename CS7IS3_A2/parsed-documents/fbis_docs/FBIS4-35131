Burelli Rivas said that these measures do not harm Venezuela's image abroad and that instead, they signify the new way of governing the country with authority within the framework of the Constitution. He rejected the possibility that the measures are in any way contrary to the interests of foreign investors. The foreign minister said that the measures have not alarmed foreigners because similar situations have occurred in other countries. He said the economic measures have produced expectations rather than concern about whether they will affect bilateral or multilateral agreements. The foreign minister said the suspension of some economic guarantees would have no effect unless they were accompanied by the suspension of some constitutional guarantees. [Begin Burelli Rivas recording] The damage caused in the finance and banking system and the struggle against drug trafficking requires that the state should be able to arrest people, search for people, or prevent certain people from leaving the country quickly, without having to wait for a judge to issue an arrest warrant. The economic measures alone would have served no purpose had they not been accompanied by the suspension of guarantees on free travel throughout the territory, departure from the country, transit in general, and the possibility of raiding the businesses of people supected of being involved in drugtrafficking activities. This is the reason for the suspension of guarantees. [end recording]
