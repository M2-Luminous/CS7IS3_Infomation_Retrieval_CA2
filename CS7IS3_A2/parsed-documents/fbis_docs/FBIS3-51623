As you know, workers around the country are meeting to discuss the measures that must be adopted to solve one of the biggest problems the country is confronting, excess currency. Luis Sexto will introduce the subject. [Sexto] I am going to talk about the meetings underway throughout the country to discuss the possible measures that could be adopted to reduce, among other things, excess currency. Some listeners have called to ask me: What kind of measures will be adopted? What is going to be done? I have told them that I am not a fortune-teller. You can ask a reporter for his opinion on specific social problems or political happenings, but you cannot ask the reporter, or anyone else for that matter, to predict which measures will be adopted. We do not know that. We are holding parliaments in the workplace. We have seen that the country is looking for a solution; it is asking around. [Roque] And people have doubts. Undoubtedly, many people must satisfy their need to be informed. There are times when information is not available because we not have enough newspapers, because a power outage does not allow them to listen to a specific program. These are reasons we are all familiar with. However, I do believe we must inform on this problem. We must continue to broach it. This problem has been discussed on "Straight Talk" in the past; however, today we are somewhat repeating it. We must do so because many people need the information, need to be told what is being done. [Sexto] I agree and this is what motivated me to come here and talk about this crucial and basic problem for our country. The other day we talked about the big material basis our country has to overcome in the special period. We talked about all those real material and economic possibilities our country has as a result of all that it has built throughout the past 35 years. However, it is also necessary to adopt economic measures. We must streamline and improve other aspects of our economy that will make it easier for the whole material infrastructure to operate properly. [Roque] Then why do people have doubts? Many of the people who have expressed doubts do not work. Many of these people stay at home; they have no way of attending a parliament at the workplace. [Sexto] I believe that the people want measures to be adopted. I believe the people want to see the problem solved. Some are uncertain about the whole process. I want to say that this is a very delicate process. This is a very delicate situation. Some people may think that the country is taking too long to solve a pressing problem. The seriousness of the problem has been addressed publicly; our leaders have discussed this problem in public. However, we must also realize that this is such a serious and delicate problem that we must find the appropriate way to solve it and not make mistakes while solving it. The country must not make mistakes when solving the problem; otherwise, it will have to correct those mistakes and the situation will be even worse. We must find the best measures for everyone. From the technical viewpoint, it is quite possible that the economists know what to do and can do it quickly; however, it has already been said, and I repeat: In Cuba, economy and politics go hand in hand. Economy and politics are one. This means that all economic measures adopted must first be analyzed from the political point of view. All interests must be reconciled before adopting any measures. We must avoid affecting the majority of the population. [Roque] Luis Sexto and I, Juan Carlos Roque Garcia, are here searching for coinciding points on this "Straight Talk" program. We are talking about doubts the people have about the measures to be adopted. Their doubts are quite normal. The people are worried and they want to know what is happening. They want to know what kind of measures will be adopted. I wish to make it clear that these measures are still on the drawing board. [Sexto] There is something I noticed among the listeners who called in. They are aware of what is being discussed at this or that work center, shop, or factory. Perhaps they are a bit confused about what is going on. Many people think that all the suggestions presented at these parliaments in the workplace are the actual measures that will be implemented. [Roque] I will give you an example. A few days ago Renato Recio was on this program and he talked about a work center in Matanzas where the workers suggested that the number of sick leave days a worker can take be specified. This is only a suggestion made by the Matanzas workers. This has many people thinking. Many people have called asking what this would entail. [Sexto] I know. Many people think that just because something has been suggested by a worker -- the worker made his suggestion publicly and the media covered it -- it will immediately become a measure to be implemented. They believe that any suggestion made will become a measure to be implemented. [Roque] It is quite possible. [Sexto] Yes. We have undertaken a process that many have called parliament in the workplace. The Cuban Workers Federation has approached the working class. It has sought the wisdom of the worker, the wisdom of the working man, to find the best way to solve this serious problem Cuba is facing. [Roque] Most of the voters are included in that group. We must also realize that we heavily depend on production to solve the problem. Right? [Sexto] Right. [Roque] This is the reason the worker is being approached. [Sexto] There is another purpose behind those parliaments in the workplace. The idea is not only to find a suitable proposal on solving the problem of the budget deficit and excess currency. The idea is also to get the workers to talk about how they can be more efficient. They are discussing what has to be done at the specific workplace to make it more efficient. When we improve efficiency we are also contributing to the reduction of excess currency. We are producing things that will be a tangible basis for the money we earn at a workplace. We will earn that money after we have produced a product. [Roque] Many listeners write or call us. We must not forget that many of these listeners are not directly members of a work center; however, they are going to be affected by the measures that will be implemented. [Sexto] If we use the word affected, some people may think they are going to be hurt by the implementation of the measures. I think many people may be a bit confused about this. We talk about measures that may affect the people or represent a sacrifice. People are wondering: What's cooking? Am I being prepared for something when I am told that these measures could affect me? Are they getting ready to hit me on the head? This has created uncertainty among some. [Roque] But we cannot overlook the fact that measures are measures and someone will always be affected by them. [Sexto] It is quite logical that the measures will affect some people. But let us stop and think about this a bit. I do not know what kind of measures are going to be implemented. I believe that no one in Cuba knows what measures are going to be implemented. Perhaps soon we will know. We will know once these meetings have ended and the National Assembly of the People's Government holds its extraordinary session. I believe that the people may be affected to a certain extent, and we should put the word affected in quotation marks. For example, I believe that one of the measures that could be implemented -- and any thinking person in the country would agree -- will be the elimination of some of the gratuities the government provides. The elimination of some gratuities would allow the state to balance its income and spending. One of the sources for excess currency is the imbalance between what the government receives and what it spends in social benefits, subsidies, and others. The deficit this creates is harmful to our economy. Perhaps some of these gratuities should be eliminated, but first we must study how this elimination will affect the people. Up to now we have been enjoying many services for practically nothing. Let us say that from now on we have to pay for the products included in the school ration book. What is the cost of a workbook and pencil compared to free medicine and free education? [Roque] Luis Sexto is asking what would happen if parents had to pay for pencils and workbooks. This is something we get for free. [Sexto] People would say that eliminating things like this affects them. And if we had to pay for uniforms, well, that would be for children with scholarships. Uniforms are usually bought at the store. Right now we do not have enough uniforms. I also believe we could increase the amount we pay for electricity. What we pay for electricity is practically nothing. What would a few centavos mean if we are getting free medicine? What would a few centavos mean if we do not have to pay when a child gets sick, when you get sick, or when you get a heart transplant. That is what I am talking about. What if the telephone rates are increased. I am not saying that the telephone rates are going up. I am not saying that the electricity rates are going up. What I am saying is that this is what I am going to suggest when I participate at my Parliament in the Workplace. It is necessary for our country to be in accordance with the demands of the situation. Our country cannot continue to subsidize electricity; it cannot continue to subsidize telephone costs; it cannot continue to subsidize some basic products. The state is paying so that the consumer does not have to pay high prices for those products. That is what I am talking about. [Roque] We are nearing the end of the program. [Sexto] Give me a minute to finish what I was saying. I do not want to confuse the people with what I am about to say. I am not a fortune-teller. What measures are going to be adopted? I do not know. I think no one does. Let us wait for the ANPP extraordinary session and let the deputies decide what strategy our country will follow. What I want to do is remind the listeners that these measures will be adopted to solve a problem, not to create more problems. That is what we must remember. That is what we must keep in mind, and we should not be frightened. [Roque] A process of awareness must be carried out. The people must be made aware of what is going to be done. [Sexto] I believe that these parliaments in the workplace also are contributing to making the people aware of the problem. We have never had a problem like this one. Back in the seventies, the country faced a similar situation and the problem was solved differently. Back then we had the socialist bloc, we imported more products, new products were put up for sale, and part of the excess currency was taken off the streets. However, today's situation is different and we must become aware of this. Juan Carlos, I do believe that all that will be done will be to solve the problem. That is what we must keep in mind. [Roque] You finished just in time. BOHEMIA reporter Luis Sexto was with us today on Straight Talk.
