Velasquez and President-elect Rafael Caldera have formally asked the U.S. Government to participate in consultations within the GATT in the hope of satisfactorily settling a controversy stemming from a new regulation imposed by the United States that will harm Venezuelan gasoline exports to that market. An interministerial commission was established to coordinate the Venezuelan strategy. It is made up of the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation, the Ministry of Energy and Mines, the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, and the Foreign Trade Institute [ICE], which led the commission in filing this request through the U.S. Embassy in Caracas. Miguel Rodriguez Mendoza, ICE minister of state-president [title as published], pointed out that "the regulation promulgated on 15 December by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency violates, according to Venezuela, GATT Article III (National Treaty) for establishing different quality standards for imported and domestic gasoline." This will have negative effects on Venezuelan exports beginning in 1985. Initial estimates indicate that gasoline exports to the United States could drop by 50 percent, that is, a $150 million revenue loss. This figure does not take into account the impact on trade of a possible exclusion of Venezuela from the U.S. market for a period of about two years. Rodriguez Mendoza pointed out that the Venezuelan Government position was channeled through a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. The letter calls for the start of consultations within GATT to determine the legality of regulations approved by the United States detrimental to Venezuelan gasoline exports. The ICE president said that, based on Article XXII (1) of the GATT General Agreement, the U.S. regulation violates Venezuela's rights and causes that country to break its commitments. GATT procedures state that consultations must start within 30 days. He pointed out that should the outcome be unfavorable to Venezuela, our country may request the establishment of a tribunal or arbitration panel (made up of three independent experts) that would be tasked with issuing a ruling within six months. Thus, this controversy -- that we hope will yield a favorable ruling for our country -- should be settled this year to avoid the economic impact that this regulation could cause beginning in 1995. The U.S. regulation could remove Venezuelan petroleum exports from that market. This is the first time that Venezuela, on an individual basis, will resort to GATT controversy-solving procedures. We have, however, some experience in this area because we participated -- not as a litigant but as an interested party -- in the controversies linked to the tuna embargo (United States) and banana problem (EEC).
