Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso today explained that the Real Value Unit [URV] will be adjusted for 100 percent of inflation. [Begin recording] [Reporter Ana Paula Padrao from Brasilia] The minister was very pleased that Congress had voted for the FSE; it put him in a very good mood. On his way to work this morning, he stopped to purchase newspapers, and briefly refuted the more sensationalist headlines. He promised: Nobody has to rush to the banks to take out their money, because the new economic plan does not change anything in the lives of the workers. He confirmed that the provisional measure establishing the URV will be issued on 28 February, adding that he is not worried by the coincidence that the Cruzado Plan had been launched on the same date. The Cruzado Plan was a good economic plan, Cardoso said, adding that a lot has been learned in the meantime, and the new plan will be successful. The minister stated that measures designed to punish companies which increase their prices outrageously are being studied. Cardoso confirmed, however, that the policy of the economic team is to adjust salaries according to the inflation average and keep prices free. From his point of view this is to the workers' advantage. He explained that those whose salaries are stated in URV will be protected. Once the URV is implemented, salaries will not stay behind inflation for a single day. [Cardoso] The wages of workers who get paid by the day will be adjusted practically every day. Those who get paid by the week will have their wages adjusted throughout the week, and those who get paid by the month will have their wages adjusted throughout the month. That is not the case now, because wages are adjusted for only 90 percent of inflation three months out of four, and only on the fourth month are the workers' wages adjusted for 100 percent of inflation. It will be different from now on: Wages will be adjusted for 100 percent of inflation throughout the month. [Padrao] Once salaries are adjusted for the average inflation through the URV mechanism, what will happen to prices? Everybody is worried because prices will not follow the same approach. [Cardoso] The less prices follow the same approach the better for the salaried workers, because the value of their income will be guranteed while prices will have no adjustment reference. Therefore, the longer businessmen take to adjust their prices through the URV mechanism, the better for the workers. [end recording]
