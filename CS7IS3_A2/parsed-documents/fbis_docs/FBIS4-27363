FBIS4-27363 "dreas105__a94044" FBIS-EAS-94-105-A Daily Report 20 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Toyota, Honda To Build Low-Cost Cars for Asia Toyota, Honda To Build Low-Cost Cars for Asia 942A0263A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 May 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0263A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Toyota Motor and Honda Motor respectively will develop and locally produce "Asia Car," a low-price strategic passenger car for the Southeast Asian market. Both companies will develop them with existing 1300-cc to 1500-cc displacement compact cars as the base, and they will achieve low prices through local procurement of almost all parts in Asia. Toyota will mass-produce it in Thailand beginning in 1998 and export it to the Near and Middle East and Central and South America. Honda will manufacture and sell it in Thailand and Indonesia by 1996. Japanese automakers' shift of production to Asia is accelerating, and an international division of labor system of complementary parts and car types among many nations is advancing further. Toyota is manufacturing and selling small trucks for Asia in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan, but it has not had an "Asia car" passenger car. Besides future anticipated growth of the passenger car market in Southeast Asia, the price of Japanese cars that use materials imported from Japan is becoming relatively high with the high yen, and Toyota is trying to develop a low-price car suitable for the Asian market by lowering manufacturing costs 5 to 10 percent from the existing level. It will be produced by "Toyota Motor Thailand," the manufacturing company in Thailand beginning in 1998, using the "Tercel" or "Starlet" compact car as the base. Toyota will procure parts from Toyota-affiliated engine and transmission plants in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) such as Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia, and at the same time as increasing the part domestic production rate in the region, it will also hold down production costs using local products for materials such as steel plate and resin. Honda, on the other hand, is developing an "Asia car" with the existing "Civic" as the base. It appears that the overall size will be somewhat smaller than the "Civic." Honda will procure all parts in the whole Asian region except for Japan. Indonesia or Thailand is favored for the assembly plant. The Asia car is a car developed especially for the Asian market. ASEAN has concluded a reciprocal complementary agreement regarding part imports within the region, and using this, they will locally procure parts in many nations, assemble and manufacture it, and sell it widely in the Asian region. Among Japanese carmakers, Nissan Motor considers the "AD Resort," which is an improved "AD Van," a special car for Asia, but it still does not have a full-scale passenger car "Asia car."
