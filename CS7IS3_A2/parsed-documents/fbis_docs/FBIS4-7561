The preservation of the Customs Union was important from the point of view of the expected integration into the European Union, the support of European thinking and general strategy for the future, Moravcik told journalists today. He said that open questions between the two countries should be solved but expressed doubt that they could be solved during his cabinet's six-month term of office. "However we are ready to make use of this space," he stressed, adding that he would consider it wonderful if the division of the former federal property could at last be settled. Moravcik said that his cabinet intended to settle previously tense Slovak-Hungarian relations. "We are interested in expanding cooperation," Moravcik said. He confirmed Slovakia's interest in Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's postponed visit to Bratislava taking place but admitted that it was being hindered by difficulties surrounding the conclusion of the Hungarian-Slovak readmission agreement. "I firmly believe that we will find a way to overcome this problem," Moravcik said, adding that Bratislava was ready to open new border crossings between Slovakia and Hungary. Moravcik rejected Meciar's warning against the penetration of Hungarian capital into southern Slovakia, arguing that capital was essentially international and to look for its ethnic origin was "counter-productive." The signing of a basic Slovak-Hungarian inter-state treaty was an open question in relations between Slovakia and Hungary, Moravcik said. He said that Bratislava expected the treaty to confirm the current border, which would eradicate fears of ethnic minority irredentism and possible territorial claims from the south. However Budapest is making the recognition of collective rights of the half- million Hungarian minority a condition, which Bratislava rejects, Moravcik said. Jeszenszky's visit, planned for last autumn, was again postponed after Bratislava made the conclusion of a readmission agreement on the return of illegal emigrants a condition for opening new border crossings between the two countries. Budapest refuses to conclude such an agreement for fear of an influx of Romanian refugees into its territory. As regards the current state of Slovak-Polish relations Moravcik said: "We are greatly interested in developing these relations but we cannot find a mechanism to realize them. We realize that our deeds are lagging behind our words." He mentioned the possibility of the Polish premier visiting Bratislava.
