The some 200 items among 699 products were listed late last year by Washington for an immediate 50 percent customs duty reduction. After discussions and evaluation with concerned authorities, about 200 items have no room for tariff cuts, Huang said. The government can reduce import tax on about 70 of the 699 items, while the remaining ones need to go through long resistance at the legislature before duty reductions are possible, he added. Huang stated tariff reduction rates and reasons behind the selective reduction policy will be forwarded to Washington for explanation within a week. The tariff reductions are expected to go into effect within two months [words indistinct]. Taipei had intended to hold discussion with the U.S. on the tariff reductions during bilateral assessment talks on Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] slated for next month, but Washington, a key supporter of Taipei's GATT membership, refused and demanded a consultation.
