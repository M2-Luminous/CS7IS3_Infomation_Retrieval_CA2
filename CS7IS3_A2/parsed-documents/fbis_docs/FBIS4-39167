In Ukrainian Agriculture and Food Minister Yuriy Karasyk's words, a large group of professionals, who include National Bank of Ukraine board chairman Viktor Yushchenko, has been engaged to draft this directive. The directive deals with a new source of credits, which is 10 percent of the credit resources that are available to commercial banks and that are to be sold by them to the National Bank of Ukraine to provide payments in advance and credits for the agrarian sector. The economic mechanisms contained in this provision should be of interest to commercial banks as the directive rules that the taxes payable by the banks on credits in the event of their sale to the National Bank of Ukraine are to be cut from 55 to 11 percent. The directive also makes provision for the return of stabilization funds rather than adopting a money-printing approach to the allocation of funds providing credits for agriculture. The directive also contains the following mechanism for payments to be made by the trading organizations to the agricultural producers: Upon the expiry of three days following a sale, a penalty to the amount of three percent of the sum outstanding is charged daily. There is a term of 15 days for credits to be issued to trading organizations for them to pay in advance for agricultural produce. The directive instructs the Cabinet of Ministers to devise a pricing mechanism by 1 July. In Yuriy Karasyk's view, "this provision in the directive is very important as agriculture is owed 12 trillion karbovantsi by the army, prison services, and trading organizations, with the debt of the latter to the countryside amounting to 4 trillion karbovantsi. This clause in the directive also enables city and town state administrations, goods manufacturers and trading organizations to work without waiting for the government." However, in Yuriy Karasyk's view, "this is a once only directive. In the transitional period, no legislative basis has been created yet so the president has said the word for the Supreme Council not to be `firemen'." In the minister's opinion, there will be no confrontation between the Supreme Council and the president because the directive takes account of proposals by Ukrainian people's deputies.
