Russia Has Seriously Thought of Constructing Its Own Spaceport"] [Text] It is probable that Kazakhstan, which a little more than a month ago signed a memorandum on the status of the Baykonur cosmodrome, has decided if not to reexamine its position, in any case to stall the adoption of the conditions for use of the cosmodrome. The recent negotiations of Russian and Kazakh experts did not yield virtually any results. The Kazakh side criticized the proposals formulated by the Russian representatives, but did not make their own counterproposals, other than the resurfacing idea of transformation of Baykonur into an international space company. A visit of Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, to the United States will begin on 14 February. It is proposed that an agreement be concluded on cooperation, including in the space research field. The Kazakh leader is attempting to clarify whether the United States intends to participate in Baykonur becoming a joint-stock company. The experts do not anticipate great enthusiasm on the part of the Americans because the appropriations for space research have recently been cut back greatly. According to the plan of the president of Kazakhstan, the cosmodrome will become a joint-stock company of the open type, with the stockholders being Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and other countries who so desire. However, at Baykonur there would be no place for Russian soldiers of the military space forces, although it is precisely they who ensure cosmodrome operation. This idea, it would seem, was cast aside because it was unrealistic, but due to the project for construction of the international orbital station Alpha and the possibility of bringing the United States in as a stockholder it has surfaced again. The time allocated for defining the specific leasing conditions will elapse after a month and the experts plan to meet once again in mid- February. Then only a few days will remain prior to the visit of Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, to Kazakhstan and there is very little hope that during such a time it will be possible to arrive at a compromise. The status of the problem of the demilitarization of Baykonur for the time being remains at the level "maybe yes - maybe no." It is evident that in such a case one of the sides must compromise. A more complex problem is that of the amount of lease payments. Here the requirements of Kazakhstan are extremely significant; the Kazakh negotiations are not about rubles, but about dollars. In addition, the Kazakh side raised the question of compensation for its losses sustained due to the activity of Russia at the Baykonur cosmodrome and at three other test sites located in the territory of Kazakhstan. According to the calculations made by an unknown method the total cost of restoration associated with the operation of the Baykonur cosmodrome and three other test sites during 1992-1993 is more than 7 billion dollars. Meanwhile it has been established that harm to the health of the population has been inflicted only by nuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk test site. But since the moment that Russia proclaimed its sovereignty there has not been a single nuclear test there. All this will probably soon force the directors of the Russian space branch to think seriously of the possibility of constructing a new spaceport in the Far East, the plan for which already exists.
