As for Little Rock Bill Clinton, who did make it to the finals last year, defeating Texan representative George Bush, his true test is still ahead of him -- at the next finals in three years. This week Clinton marked the beginning of his second year in White House. While he did pass first grade, his graduation to second grade is accompanied by the feeling that he has not yet fully adjusted to his new school. In his annual State of the Union address yesterday, Clinton presented America's current priorities: less foreign affairs, less defense, more employment, more health insurance, and above all, more action against crime, which is destroying the Americans from within. The punch line, which got Clinton the most applause, borrowed its terminology from another sports arena: baseball. Like a pitcher whose ball veers from its destination, a third-time violent offender will find himself out or, in this case, inside. Clinton's address touched on the Middle East in passing: The Rabin-'Arafat handshake on his lawn was mentioned and received in total silence at Congress, where his secretaries, officers, and justices were also sitting. Yet Clinton emphasized his commitment to the attainment of "comprehensive and durable" peace in the region. His intent -- territories for peace -- cannot be seriously doubted, although he did not bother to spell it out. This does not contradict the departure from tradition which Prime Minister Rabin detected this week in the stand of President al-Asad, who agrees to a bilateral peace that does not depend on the attainment of other agreements. It is a fact that King Husayn and Rafiq al-Hariri are waiting for al-Asad, and not vice versa, while 'Arafat is the last man in the world al-Asad would trust with a veto right over Syria's moves. In his speech, Clinton maintained that there is no isolationism in America. This assertion in itself must be proven. The Americans have stayed away from involvement in Bosnia -- a position which they feel is justified and which the President, who dodged the Vietnam draft, can understand. They temporarily blundered in Somalia, but were quick to announce a date of disengagement and to behead the secretary of defense who was -- unjustly -- perceived as responsible for some of the casualties in there. All these, as well as the tendency to reduce the U.S. naval and ground troops in Europe and Asia, can offer no encouragement to Washington's friends. For the time being, they can be comforted by the defense aid which refuses to die -- $3 billion a year, in Israel's case -- and to wait for the future report cards of student Clinton, who lacks the qualities that would make him Super Bill in the eyes of Americans and foreigners.
