Germany worries about the stability of its central European neighbours; Britain worries about the health of the Atlantic alliance; Mediterranean countries worry about their Arab neighbours, especially Algeria. All those worries are legitimate, and should be addressed by the EU's [European Union's] common foreign and security policy. The last, especially, should be taken more seriously in northern Europe than it has been so far. Two years ago the Algerian army intervened to forestall the election victory of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. It proposed to smash the violent hard core of the opposition while introducing economic reforms to restore hope to those who had joined it out of despair. That strategy has not worked. In fact, the economic side of it has not even been tried. The bold economic reforms launched between 1989 and 1991 have been reversed, making impossible any deal with the IMF and Algeria's other creditors on the country's $25 billion foreign debt, which will absorb 100 per cent of its export revenue this year. Politically, Islamic militants denied power through the ballot box have turned to violence. Repression, accompanied by human rights violations, has further radicalised the opposition, and even secular parties boycotted the "national consensus conference" held by the regime this week, since the exclusion of the FIS deprived it of credibility. The country is sliding into civil war. These developments threaten Europe on several levels. Civil war invariably produces large flows of refugees, many of whom in this case would be bound to cross the Mediterranean. Their arrival would exacerbate racial tensions. The war could spread to north African communities in Europe. Islamic militants, if they lose, might resort to terrorism not only against Europeans in Algeria but against targets in Europe itself. If they win after a long and bitter struggle, Europe would face a prickly and hostile neighbour within easy missile range. Either way, an Algeria racked by civil war and deprived of much of its Westernised middle class would not attract foreign investment and would be likely to stagnate economically. Europe could face more and more poor and angry people on its very doorstep. Only a genuine dialogue between the army and the FIS offers any hope of a peaceful solution. The EU should use its good offices to help bring this about. By promising economic aid and increased market access for a peaceful, democratic Algeria, it could offer an incentive to both sides to negotiate, and reassurance to those in the country who fear that an Islamic victory would mean isolation from Europe and wholesale suppression of human rights. Continued support for the status quo can only store up worse trouble for the future.
