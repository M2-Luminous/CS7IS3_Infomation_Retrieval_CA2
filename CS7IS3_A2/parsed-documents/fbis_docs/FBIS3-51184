Luiz Americo Medeiros, the chairman of the Textile Industry Trade Union (Sinditextil), has stated that "when the United States cuts the quota of one country it does not necessarily increases that of another. On the contrary, it increasingly seeks to apply more restrictions." Medeiros noted that the United States finds it easy to curtail the PRC's quota because the latter has not yet joined the GATT. The bilateral agreement between Brazil and the United States expires on 31 March and will be automatically renewed for another year.
