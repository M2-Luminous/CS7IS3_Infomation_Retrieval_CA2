They feared a negative impact on the economy of the province if the government fails to handle this problem effectively. Thailand is cooperating with Laos to open a permanent border point for trade in Ban Huai Kon, Thung Chang District, Nan Province. If the matter is not cleared up, Laos will be suspicious of Thailand, and this will delay the project. According to a report from the provincial office, a Thai delegation led by Nan Governor Prawit Sisophon held a meeting with Lao officials of Sianghon-Hongsa special zone on 21-22 February. An agreement was reached saying both sides will instruct officials to strictly check activities of the anti-Vientiane movements. They agreed to exchange information on a monthly basis so the authorities concerned could check the problem in time. The report indicates that authorities of both sides agreed to step up control at border trading points. Each Lao national seeking treatment at hospitals in Thung Chang District and Song Khwae Subdistrict in Nan will not be allowed to have more than two persons accompanying him into Thailand. Hospital authorities must report admissions to their superiors in order to prevent cases of illegal entry. [passage omitted]
