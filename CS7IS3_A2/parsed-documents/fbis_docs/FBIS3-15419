As DIENA has already reported, the NSA has adopted a statement protesting against the Latvian Government's agreement with Russia to keep the Skrunda radar station in operation for another four years, with an additional 18 months for its dismantling. Quite a number of representatives of the organizations included in the NSA expressed the view that Skrunda is similar to other bases which Russia has promised to vacate by 31 August of this year. Baiba Petersone, representative of the Movement for Latvia's National Independence [LNNK] said that although Latvia has a democratically elected parliament and the national situation is more favorable than it was in 1939, the interstate negotiations are being carried on in secret, with the people and even the Saeima [parliament] not being informed. Petersone said the national forces will maintain their rights for means of direct democratic action, by initiating the referendum and using other means of nonviolent resistance. Aigars Jirgens, a representative of the Fatherland and Freedom organization, has criticized the fact that the Cabinet of Ministers was not given the right to authorize the delegation to talks with Russia and give consent for the continued operation of the Skrunda radar station. The Latvian Government can not count on support from the people, he said. He said also that he has faith in Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, who has promised not to sign an agreement allowing for the continued operation of the Skrunda radar station. Uldis Augstkalns, leader of the Latvian People's Front, expressed the belief that for Russia, the Skrunda stations is not so much a matter of security than of policy, and that by the agreement, which is being prepared by the two state delegations, the Latvian Government is accepting Russia's strategic interests in Latvia. U. Augstkalns stated that to have a bad agreement is better than to have none at all. He also spoke in favor of a popular referendum on this question, because this is a matter of national survival. The representative of the Association of Latvian National Soldiers was indignant: We have not learned from the experience of our history, and this applies to the current policy of the Latvian Government. DIENA has already reported, the Club of Environment Protection has printed 10,000 postcards to send to the Saeima demanding the immediate dismantlement of the Skrunda station and withdrawal of Russian soldiers. All in all, 4,000 cards will be disseminated by LNNK. In reply to a question from DIENA if there is a possibility to succeed in concluding such an agreement with Russia, Ilgonis Klavins, representative of Christian Democrats, expressed a skeptical view regarding the very sense of a bilateral agreement. In his opinion, it should be signed on the international level, with the participation of countries which have signed the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam treaties, thus creating the present order in the post- war period. DIENA was interested in learning if any of the representatives of the national forces have visited the Skrunda base, but we received no direct answer to this question. Some time ago, while visiting Ludza, President Guntis Ulmanis also expressed a view supporting the idea of a referendum on the question of the Skrunda radar base. However, Presidential Press Assistant Anta Busa could not confirm to DIENA if the president is of the same opinion now. In accordance with Article 73 of the Constitution of the Latvian Republic, agreements with other states are not to be put to a popular vote. Minister of Justice Egils Levits confirmed to DIENA that the question of Skrunda cannot be resolved by a referendum.
