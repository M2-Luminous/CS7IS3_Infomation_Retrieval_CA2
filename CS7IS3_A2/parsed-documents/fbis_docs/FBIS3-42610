Essentially, only PRAVDA and NEZAVISIMAYA spoke out fully and sincerely about this congress. After all, the congress, held in Krasnoyarsk, was a meeting of virtually all the workers in Russia -- directors of the country's industrial enterprises, who were tired of the fact that some, pardon the term, condom dealer was living better than the Worker, the Plowman or the Laborer. PRAVDA has already written about the sort of congress this was. About 300 directors of enterprises from 43 regional organizations and 8 federal unions, headed by Yuriy Skokov, decided how things were to be and how to go on living. Today we are publishing the DECLARATION on the rights of Russian commodity producers, adopted at this congress. With respect to its style, perhaps, this document looks conventional. Essentially, though, it is a cry, an SOS shout, a powerful voice in defense of the workers of our land. Commodity producers, managers (directors) and entrepreneurs -- everyone who is employed in the sphere of commodity production, regardless of the form of ownership, type of economic activity and political orientation, stated: The chosen model of radical economic reforms in Russia has led to a progressing recession in commodity production and the growth of the crisis. No consideration is made of the fact that the entire infrastructure of the country's industrial, technological and scientific-technical potential has formed under conditions different in principle, and that a transitional period is needed to adapt to a truly market milieu. The main goal of the reforms -- raising the people's standard of living -- has been sacrificed. The Federation comes out in favor of carrying out reforms, and sets its goal as achieving the recognition and protection of the rights of commodity producers on the basis of self-organization and coordination of their interests in the process of reforming the economy. THE FEDERATION OF COMMODITY PRODUCERS, AWARE OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTRY AND SOCIETY, PROCLAIMS: --its right to conclude a general agreement with the Government of the Russian Federation that secures a qualitatively new system of mutual relations in the implementation of economic reforms, for the purpose of creating efficient commodity production; --its right to draw up and sign, in the shortest time possible, regional agreements with the organs of state authority of the subjects of the Russian Federation, on working out the optimal mutually acceptable mechanisms for carrying out economic reforms in the provinces; --its right to participate in the drawing up of all legislative and normative acts pertaining to commodity production, and to submit them for the consideration of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and other organs of state authority, in accordance with existing legislation; --its right to state guarantee of protection of the vitally important interests of commodity producers as a necessary condition for preserving and strengthening Russia. The state's attempt to evade solving the problems of supporting domestic commodity production is inadmissible; --its right to state guarantee of the priorities of domestic commodity producers in the process of privatization. We are against hasty redistribution of the national wealth, to the detriment of the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population; --its right to a long-term state protectionist policy in the interests of domestic commodity producers. We are for Russia's active entry into the world market in the interests of the national economy, but we are against turning our Motherland into a raw-materials appendage of the developed countries; --its right to participate in the creation of a complete system of social protection of commodity producers. The Federation will try to vindicate and protect the rights of domestic commodity producers within the framework of existing legislation in interaction and cooperation with the organs of federal and regional authority and administration and with all the domestic organizations and movements which express the interests of business circles and work collectives.
