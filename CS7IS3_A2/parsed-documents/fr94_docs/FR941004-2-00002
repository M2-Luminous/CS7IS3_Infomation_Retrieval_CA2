SUMMARY: Effective for the 1995 crop year only, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) herewith gives notice of its determination to extend the date for acceptance of applications for small grains (wheat, oats, rye, and barley), sugarcane, potatoes, and nursery crop insurance for all policies having a September 30 sales closing date.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mari Dunleavy, Regulatory Specialist, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250, telephone (202) 254&hyph;8314. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under its regulations for insuring crops, FCIC requires that applications for crop insurance protection must be filed on or before the policy sales closing date. The small grains, potatoes, surgarcane, and nursery crop insurance policies have a sales closing date in some areas of September 30. Due to the uncertain nature of improvements being made to agricultural risk management policies, producers have requested that FCIC extend the sales closing dates to allow producers opportunity to assess their risk management needs and make an informed decision as to the purchase of crop insurance. Therefore, to assist those producers who have requested an extension of sales closing date, the Manager of FCIC has determined that the September 30 sales closing date shall be extended to October 31. Under the provisions of the General Crop Insurance Regulations (ยง401.8 and ยง457.8), the sales closing date for accepting applications may be extended by notice in the Federal Register upon determination that no adverse selection will result from such extension. FCIC has determined that no adverse selection will result from this extension. FCIC will discontinue the acceptance of applications if it determines that the insurance risk because excessive and adverse conditions develop. Notice Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. ), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation herewith gives notice that, effective for the 1995 crop year only, applications for wheat, barley, oats, rye, nursery, potatoes, and surgarcane crop insurance with sales closing prior to October 31, 1994, will be accepted up to the close of business on October 31, 1994, for producers requesting multiple peril crop insurance coverage. This sales closing may be terminated by the Corporation prior to October 31, 1994 if the insurance risk becomes excessive and adverse conditions develop. Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1506, 1516.
