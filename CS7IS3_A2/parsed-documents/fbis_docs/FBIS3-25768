He was addressing 10,000 people who attended a peoples' forum to raise issues with the leadership at the Galeshewe Stadium in Kimberley. A questioner asked how matriculation could remain a qualification for membership of the ANC's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) [Spear of the Nation] if the future government was to provide only 10 years of free education. Mr Mandela said MK members must at least have a matriculation certificate. "The SADF, with which we are now uniting and which has had an opportunity for education, is very well qualified. Officers require certain academic qualifications and many of them are highly educated." This was evident at a recent meeting with the General Staff of the SADF at which he could see from the way they presented their arguments that they were well educated. "We do not want to bring down the standards of the army. We want to keep them as high as they are," he said. "Even in the reorganisation we will not get the qualifications we want; we must have at least matric," he said. The 10 years of free education was a first target and a future government would hope to increase it in stages.
