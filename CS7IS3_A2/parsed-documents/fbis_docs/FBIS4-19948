Why now? [Alvarez Cascos] It has not ceased to be present since the Socialist government with its parliamentary hegemony approved an anything-goes attitude and this was made clear with the Rumasa scandal. To try now to distinguish the Roldan affair or the Rubio affair from Filesa, Juan Guerra, or the reprivatization of Rumasa seems to me a mistake. They are manifestations of the same phenomenon, of the climate of impunity with which the Socialists have tainted the political atmosphere. [Ruiz de Azua] And it suits you people very well.... [Alvarez Cascos] It is very bad news for everybody. [There is] an atmosphere of unscrupulousness in the government's practice, and the feeling [exists] that it could generally harm the system's institutional prestige and affect us all. It grieves us, and it worries us increasingly, that Felipe Gonzalez's style of government has encouraged this. This is much more important than analyzing the consequences which could indirectly help the People's Party in its prospects. [Ruiz de Azua] Do you have the impression that the government is cornered and is responding with difficulty? [Alvarez Cascos] It does not wish to respond; there is a clear lack of political will. It is very unlikely that a spirit of regeneration capable of tackling the problem will emerge now from the same people who created the causes and were conducive to the breeding ground. The creator of a problem can never be the one who provides the solution, through lack of legitimacy and even of sincerity. In the first place, Gonzalez denied everything, and less than a year ago described Jose Maria Aznar's accusations as nonsense, and then concocted the line on ethics and the democratic impetus. Now he is aware that he is a prisoner of his actions and cannot lead the struggle against corruption. [Ruiz de Azua] However, the government attorney's office and the Taxation Agency are investigating. There has been a response. [Alvarez Cascos] The investigation has no credibility. Why only in the case of Mariano Rubio and not in all the others? It is simply advisable now, for image reasons, to pretend that steps are being taken in the wake of public indignation. [Ruiz de Azua] When the People's Party calls on the prime minister to accept his responsibility, to what exactly is it referring? [Alvarez Cascos] Gonzalez heads a collective government body which makes the decisions; he is not the apex of a presidential system whose responsibilities can be transferred to another, successive level. He is as responsible as the collective body's other members for the government actions and conduct. The great lie is to claim infallibility for oneself and dissociate oneself from collective responsibility in order to attribute it to the ministers. He has no right to call the ministers to account before the public; rather, he has a duty to account to the public for the actions of the ministers. [Ruiz de Azua] Are you going to call him to account in the State of the Nation debate? [Alvarez Cascos] We should not anticipate events or reverse the parliamentary order. In the first place, it is up to Gonzalez to explain the situation and its alternatives. Depending on that, the People's Party, as the leading opposition party, and Aznar, as its leader, will set out what they deem to be their duty. [Ruiz de Azua] A year ago, you said: "Corruption can be ended in 24 hours." Apart from demanding heads, what can be done in opposition? [Alvarez Cascos] That sentence can be repeated. Gonzalez has contributed to this situation because he has dissociated himself from all responsibility and allowed his government and party colleagues to act under the cloak of impunity, taking it for granted that to be a Socialist was a guarantee of ethics. These are demonstrable assertions. Here there has been a systematic and constant reduction of the objective checks and balances to prevent, correct, and prosecute irregular conduct. With the pretext of efficiency, ministers have been given greater discretionary powers to handle greater budgetary resources. In practice, the State Auditor General's Office neither oversees nor inspects anything. Gonzalez and the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] recently rejected People's Party proposals to restore objectivity and oversight to government decisions. They want no checks; they wish to continue to operate arbitrarily. They wished to presume that a Socialist's hands were those of a saint, and now it is clear that they are as human as anybody's. Some people have already used this for their own advantage. [Ruiz de Azua] The Socialists won the election thanks to the promise of the democratic impetus to bring openness to public life. What has become of it? [Alvarez Cascos] The Socialists won the last election thanks to the last great operation staged by Gonzalez to nationalize the truth staged by Gonzalez. The supreme expression of the attempt to control everything is the intention to nationalize the truth through control of the public radio and television systems. Gonzalez's success was the great national deception by virtue of which he was able at the last minute to turn round a situation which was becoming irreversible; the country's ills would come from the opposition, which was going to lower pensions, cut unemployment benefit, and increase unemployment, while from him would come a social pact, full employment, and the guarantee of social stability. But, in less than a year, Gonzalez's stock has fallen considerably, his word is now virtually worthless, and his lies today are patent. There remains only an unconditional redoubt of supporters capable of following him in his lies. [Ruiz de Azua] I was asking you about the democratic impetus. [Alvarez Cascos] It has a great deal to do with this. We are the first people not to believe in the sincerity of those announcements, but we have acted in good faith, sat down at the table, and now we have exhausted the possibilities of reaching an agreement because society needs a regeneration of its institutions. Eventually we ran up against the wall of the obvious fact that the line was for everything to change so that nothing would change. Everything was reduced to a mere exercise of staying in power. Gonzalez is now a caricature of a leader seeking legitimacy of tenure. He undoubtedly has legitimacy of origin in the votes and support of CiU [Convergence and Union] and the Basque Nationalist Party, but a democratic politician legitimates himself every day by tackling citizens' problems. He has lost that legitimacy. His only effort is that directed at clinging to power. [Ruiz de Azua] But the democratic impetus should have contributed something against corruption. Why has this not been possible? [Alvarez Cascos] This has already become apparent. When we try to take a step forward in the functioning of the committees of enquiry in the Congress of Deputies, the Socialists, who hitherto had the guillotine of the majority to constrict these committees, wish to add another -- their coinciding with the judicial investigations. If we approved the PSOE's proposal, the Roldan committee would have to cease operating right now. Is that what society expects of those who proclaim the democratic impetus? [Ruiz de Azua] It is striking how little you people have said about the PSOE congress. [Alvarez Cascos] That is normal; we have referred only to matters which are of general interest. For instance, the worsening of the internal discord affects the government's stability and its ability to act. We do not involve ourselves with the internal confrontation. [Ruiz de Azua] Do you have the impression that the Socialist congress opens up prospects for repairing the internal split? [Alvarez Cascos] On the contrary, we are confronted with a process of a breakup of cohesion which may be dressed up as an ideological or power struggle but is a result of the widespread realization of failure. Today the PSOE is creating increasing disappointment. The disputes are a result of the feeling of failure and, at the same time, boost the strategy of defeat. [Ruiz de Azua] While the government maintains that there is an economic recovery, you deny it. Can't you even agree on the objective economic facts? [Alvarez Cascos] It seems to me that there is very little argument among the public about the fact that we are in the worst economic crisis since the restoration of democracy. We should not fall into traps. Gonzalez used to tell Adolfo Suarez he was incompatible with democracy because he was leading the country to 2 million unemployed: He cannot tell the country now not to scourge itself because it is reaching 4 million unemployed. [Ruiz de Azua] But are we or are we not emerging from the crisis? [Alvarez Cascos] The question is whether we live off other countries' inertia or also make our own contribution. There are positive signs abroad which will reach here, but the domestic economic policy is a deadweight. The public deficit was recognized long ago as the cancer of the Spanish economy, which has placed it at the head of the crisis in Europe. Well then, 1993 is the year of the largest budget overshoots in the Socialist governments' memory. [Ruiz de Azua] Your analysis is rather gloomy. Are you not afraid that such a negative view will end up harming the opposition as well? [Alvarez Cascos] The worst thing that can be done to a country is to deceive it. As long as society is told that the government is doing everything possible and society resigns itself to living with the situation, nobody will take the necessary steps to emerge from the crisis. That is the People's Party's great responsibility -- to shake off any complex and tell the truth. That will be our legitimacy when we call for efforts or sacrifices. [Ruiz de Azua] If you win the European elections and deprive the PSOE of its absolute majority in Andalusia, could there not be instability in the government? [Alvarez Cascos] If we won, it would be the greatest support for the strategy which we have developed and our final confirmation as the winning party. On the government's stability, the question must be put to Jordi Pujol. Gonzalez governs every day on the time which Pujol gives him. How long will CiU endure the erosion? You must ask the CiU.
