A handful of days have been enough to bring about the collapse of the official truth proclaimed from Botteghe Oscure's [headquarters of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] second floor, i.e., [PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto's words emphatically uttered before the PDS's top brass: "My leadership is not being called into question." It was only 20 April then, but it feels as if centuries have gone by, following a succession of interviews and opinion polls, moves and countermoves, coded signals, and drops of poison, which are daily racking the party's nerves. Today it was the "leader of the turn" who unveiled his views by saying -- in the course of a long interview with L'UNITA -- that the issue is an open one, although it will not be easy to solve it because, as Occhetto has made it clear, he has no intention of stepping down -- except after a tough political battle. The secretary's decision to take a hard line -- explaining that a change of leadership would be suicidal, and sending out a message which, in the words of someone outside politics, could be translated as "I am up here, try to get me if you can" -- matured somewhat unexpectedly. It matured precisely on the day when [PDS Deputy Secretary] Massimo D'Alema's expected return to the PDS secretariat was announced officially -- the same day that a lengthy discussion took place at Botteghe Oscure about a long article in IL MESSAGGERO, which, in suggesting that [L'UNITA chief editor] Veltroni's possible election was part of a "secret plan" devised by Occhetto against D'Alema, gave many people the impression that it was an attempt to torpedo the candidacy of L'UNITA's chief editor (which the interested party himself denied yesterday in very harsh tones). This, then, was the reason for Occhetto's statement: the newspapers. L'UNITA "Occhettologue" Alberto Leiss described a secretary who "did not conceal his deep concern," the "difficult moment" experienced by a man who "has no intention of letting himself be pushed aside" only because people like Salvati or Cacciari were openly speaking of this possibility in the newspapers. However, although apparently replying to such people, Occhetto was in fact addressing the PDS itself, saying that "while, on the Right, bellicose leaders were emerging who are eager to concentrate enormous power in their hands, we are falling into the trap of destabilizing the leadership of the sole force which, albeit in defeat, has shown any vitality and consistency. I believe that this attitude," the secretary stressed, "is tantamount to hara-kiri." This was an open challenge, followed by the emphatic assertion that the leadership issue could only be settled on the political level. The "anticommunist condition" set by Salvati and Cacciari is "even somewhat foolhardy, and, in a pinch," Occhetto added ironically, "accepting it might enable me to remain secretary for who knows how long." Faced with Occhetto's clinging to his post as secretary, Leiss was looking for reasons, and found them. So Occhetto stays -- he asked -- and that is the end of the matter? Or is it true that you will resign after the European elections so as to keep D'Alema out by means of Veltroni? No, Occhetto replied, there is no plan, other than that of "bogging down the PDS over the issue of the leadership and the so-called internal struggles." The real issue is a different one, the PDS leader warned, namely, that there are only two ways of replacing the secretary. If the problem is posed in terms of a simple "turnover," he emphasized, "say so openly and, after the European elections, I will have no objection to stepping down," so as to prevent the congress from being reduced to a "petty power struggle," to the scene for "personal confrontations at the top." However -- Occhetto went on to say -- if someone at the congress wishes to move toward a political confrontation, "submitting an alternative motion and linking his own candidacy to the latter, let him do so: This is the only democratic way to solve the leadership issue." The outlined path is really unprecedented for a former communist party. At the same time, it is an open challenge, as it faces anyone contemplating the replacement of the PDS leadership with the choice between appearing to be motivated by personal ambition, or, alternatively, confronting the uncertainties -- and the disruption, and the paralysis -- of a vote count, down to the last vote. Essentially, without ever calling a spade a spade, Occhetto was flatly saying "no" to the role of "transition guarantor" which D'Alema had suggested to him, and was casting the suspicion of a negotiated co-opting procedure on the Veltroni option, thus depriving it of any "novelty." This scenario can be expected to give rise to serious tensions at PDS headquarters within the next few days, on the eve of the new distribution of responsibilities which, to a great extent, hinges on the "Gallipoli deputy" and L'UNITA's chief editor's return to the secretariat. Within the PDS, the scuttlebutt is now suggesting that next week Occhetto will name the secretariat's coordinator(s), and casting some doubt on the reappointment of Davide Visani, who is still recovering from health problems. What the political framework will be, however, it is as yet difficult to say, until we know the results of the European elections, among other reasons because, from the grassroots -- and with some considerable support from the guarantee commission -- the request is being put forward to vote for the party's leaders one by one, with an open list.
