However, relations between his country and Russia, in his opinion, "can be based only on the Tartu Peace Treaty" of 1920. IF Note: According to this treaty, Estonia included parts of the present Pskov and Leningrad regions of Russia of the total square of about 2,000 square kilometers. The Russian side has repeatedly stated that the Tartu Treaty had lost the [sentence incomplete as received]. As the president noted at a meeting with residents of the Parnu city and the district, the Tartu Treaty "allowed the Estonian people to realize the right for self-determination," and in this his sees its "eternal value." As Interfax was told in the presidential press service, Meri hopes that "problems which so far have shadowed the Estonian-Russian relations, should find a constructive and practical resolution." In the meantime, Tallin's aspiration to declare the Tartu Treaty a basis for Russian-Estonian relations was described by a high-ranking Russian diplomat as "judicially absurd." In an interview with Interfax he said that Meri's statements about the of this treaty cause "regret." "Obviously, if Russia recognizes this treaty, it will have to exchange prisoners of war and those interned with the Estonian side, to confirm the existence of `the neutrality zone' in the Finnish Gulf and to implement many other provisions of the treaty which have become hopelessly old," the Russian diplomat said. He expressed hope that during a scheduled meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the Estonian president in Tallinn, bilateral relations will be discussed "in a constructive spirit." "Russia's position remains the same: The Tartu Peace Treaty became invalid after Estonia joined the USSR in 1940," the diplomat concluded.
