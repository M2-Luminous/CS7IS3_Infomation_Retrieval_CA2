FR941007-0-00035 FR941007-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 1 [TD 8567] RIN 1545&hyph;AR50 Recapture of LIFO Benefits AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations that describe the events that trigger the recapture of LIFO benefits under section 1363(d) when a C corporation elects to become an S corporation or transfers LIFO inventory to an S corporation in a tax-free reorganization. The final regulations reflect changes made to the law by the Revenue Act of 1987 and affect corporations that use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting. DATES: These regulations are effective October 7, 1994. The provisions of ยง1.1363&hyph;2(a)(1) apply to S elections made after December 17, 1987, except as provided in section 10227(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1987. The provisions of ยง1.1363&hyph;2(a)(2) apply to transfers made after August 18, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeffrey A. Erickson, 202&hyph;622&hyph;3040 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 18, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;16&hyph;93) was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 43827) proposing amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 1363(d). Written comments responding to the notice were received. No public hearing was requested or held. After consideration of all the comments, the regulations proposed by PS&hyph;16&hyph;93 are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. Explanation of Provisions Under the proposed regulations, a C corporation that transfers LIFO inventory to an S Corporation in a tax-free reorganization is subject to the LIFO recapture rules of section 1363(d) and must include the LIFO recapture amount in its gross income in its last taxable year of existence. One commentator asserted that the IRS appeared to have exceeded its authority by extending the application of section 1363(d) to situations in which an S corporation succeeds to LIFO inventory in a tax-free reorganization. The IRS and the Treasury Department believe that the regulations are a valid exercise of authority to prevent the circumvention of section 1363(d). Therefore, the final regulations retain the rule of the proposed regulations.
