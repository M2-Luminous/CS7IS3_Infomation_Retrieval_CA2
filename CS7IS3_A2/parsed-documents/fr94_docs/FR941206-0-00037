FR941206-0-00037 FR941206-0-00007 This rule prescribes rules of agency organization and procedure, in accordance with congressional standards implemented by the IRS after notice and comment rulemaking. Because the Administrative Procedure Act does not require publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking before the issuance of rules of agency organization and procedure, and because, in view of prior IRS rulemaking, the PBGC has for good cause found further notice and public procedure unnecessary (5 U.S.C. 553(b) (A) and (B)), the PBGC is issuing this rule as an interim final rule. However, the PBGC is soliciting public comment on its provisions. If the comments received during this period warrant modifying provisions of the rule, the PBGC will do so. E.O. 12866 The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866 because the rule would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. The purpose of this rule is to enhance the PBGC's debt collection ability. The procedures will be triggered only by a failure to pay a past-due, legally enforceable debt.
