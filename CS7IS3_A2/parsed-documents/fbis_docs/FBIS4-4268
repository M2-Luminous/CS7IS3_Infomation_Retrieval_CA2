In the process of its economic development, China has failed to take these two essential elements into account for a long period, making many regional issues related to national economic development unable to proceed and issues related to transnational regional cooperation still difficult to be truly resolved. Transnational economic cooperation zones are the product which has emerged in the long development process of the world's economic special zones following the continuous strengthening of the tendencies of transnationalizing and diversifying the major participators of the activities. Building transnational economic special zones by two countries and even three countries together can be deemed as a new trend in the current development of the economic special zones of the world. During the post-war development of the world economy and international economy, regional conglomeration of the economy is the major form of international organizations that suits the internationalization of economic activities. It is usually reflected in four development layers, namely tariff union, common market, alliance in economy and currency, and economic integration, which is also called "economic community" or "economic ring." However, regional conglomeration of the economy faces great limitations. Contrary to this, transnational economic cooperation zones have many characteristics and advantages that the regional conglomeration cannot compare with. Judging from the current conditions, they may be regarded as the best choice of the organizations suitable to regional economy. First, the form of transnational economic cooperation zones is not limited by the difference in the economic development levels of the various sides concerned because, due to their different economic development levels, they can learn from each other's advantages to make up their deficiencies and supplement each other to achieve common development. Second, transnational economic cooperation zones are free zones opened to the whole world, which, instead of being exclusive, welcome and actively draw in the countries and regions other than those in the regional conglomeration to participate and invest in building plants and to conduct international trade and other forms of economic cooperation to promote economic development. Third, transnational economic cooperation zones reflect the relations between the local interests of a country and the interests of other countries. Through the transfer of some rights and interests, they enable some localities of a country to achieve economic development and also promote the economic development of the entire country. Transnational economic cooperation zones are easier to establish because they do not influence the nature and the overall situation of the countries which build the zones and are restricted less by political and other noneconomic factors. This has also been proven by history. Theoretically speaking, transnational economic cooperation zones are very feasible. Heilongjiang's transnational economic cooperation zones, which are being planned, have been provided with some necessary and also basic conditions. 1. The superior geographical condition. Heilongjiang and Russia share a border as long as 3,026 km and have groups of ports that have convenient transport facilities and corresponding counterpart ports in each other's side. Among them, the pair of Heihe and Blagoveshchensk cities and the pair of Suifenhe city and Pogranichnyy possess the best conditions and strength and can exert the widest influence. They are regarded as the ideal places to build transnational economic cooperation zones. 2. China and Russia strongly need each other economically. This is reflected in the complementation of their industrial compositions and structures of essential elements. Such a high degree of complementation and mutual need are bound to lead to the large-scale circulation of the manpower and material resources and even funds of both sides. The emergence of transnational economic cooperation zones, which epitomize such circulation, then becomes natural and necessary. 3. With border trade as the channel, the economic ties between some localities of China and Russia have become increasingly closer, and border trade has tremendously influenced and even promoted the economic development of both sides. Such increasingly closer economic ties have laid a foundation for the localities of China and Russia to establish certain types of economic associations and transnational economic cooperation zones. 4. Heilongjiang and the Far East Region of Russia constitute an important component of the northeast Asian economic region. Not only are they famous for their abundant resources and tremendous economic development potential, but also they possess the geographical advantages as areas in the development region and areas linking with international transportation lines. Building transnational economic cooperation zones in Heilongjiang and Russia will draw the great interest and active participation of northeast Asian countries and other relevant countries and regions. 5. A most direct effect of transnational economic cooperation zones is that they help bring in international advanced technology, managerial expertise, funds, and trained personnel. The very purpose of building Sino-Russian transnational economic cooperation zones is to bring the largest possible number of commodities, equipment, raw materials, technology, and trained personnel of China, Russia, and other countries into the zones by creating a more relaxed, stable, and advantageous regional and international market, so that the zones will become the centers and hot spots of northeast Asian international economic cooperation, more effectively realize the large-scale circulation and overall coordination of the essential elements of production, and then promote the development of Sino-Russian economic and trade relations to a still higher level and sphere. Based on the above-mentioned analysis, we maintain that it is not only necessary but also possible to set aside certain areas in Heilongjiang's Heihe and Suifenhe cities and Russia's Blagoveshchensk and Pogranichnyy for the establishment of transnational economic cooperation zones. The tentative pattern of the development of the zones may be as follows. Starting with the areas set aside, developed, and managed by China and Russia independently, China and Russia, aimed at their common prosperity, based on their natural economic ties, and backed by the active participation and support of the international community, gradually build relatively independent, complete, and integrated markets in these areas, establish joint organizations and managerial institutions in the process of developing infrastructural facilities, establish a coordinated system for division of work and cooperation based on commodity trade, and enable the areas to establish natural economic ties through division of work and cooperation, so that the economy of the areas set aside by both sides will be integrated, and the areas will ultimately become unified and complete transnational economic cooperation zones in the true sense.
