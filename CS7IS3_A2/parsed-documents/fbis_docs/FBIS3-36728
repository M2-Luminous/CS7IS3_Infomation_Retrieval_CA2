The Russian foreign minister expressed his satisfaction at a press conference in Tashkent on Tuesday [8 February] after the negotiations with Uzbek Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Said Asymov. "These are sharp issues for people but we work to ease them and not to aggravate the situation through deterioration of state political relations," Kozyrev emphasized. He suggested that there would be "good draft proposals," including the ones on humanitarian issues worked out for the Russian-Uzbek summit in Moscow planned for February 25. Earlier, when speaking at the Russian Embassy in Tashkent, Kozyrev pointed out that the situation with human rights of the Russian-speaking population had changed in comparison with that during his previous visit in November, 1993. "It is hard to give a definite evaluation. However, the element of mutual misunderstanding seems to have decreased," Kozyrev said. He met with about 50 representatives of the Russian-speaking population gathered near the embassy. According to them, there were incidents connected with violation of human rights and even physical injuries. Kozyrev announced that the parties had discussed not only juridical and humanitarian issues but also economic ones aimed at strengthening the economic union. In his words, the issue on a single system of settlement and correlation of the currencies' exchange rates was high on the agenda. The military-political issues were also discussed. "I think we can recommend that the president sign a treaty on military-political cooperation with Uzbekistan," Kozyrev said.
