Central Information Office (OCI) Director Guillermo Alvarez Bajares made the announcement at the conclusion of the Council meeting, saying that reforms to the law on bids for public projects and services, the budget law, and the law on taxes on bank debits had been approved. Regarding the law on taxes on bank debits, Alvarez Bajares said the tax will be charged only to those who issue checks or other documents against their assets held at any of the country's financial institutions; in other words, the person who receives the check will not have to pay a tax. The OCI director added that the tax collection system will be quite simple since all financial institutions already have their own control procedures in place to allow rapid supervision of the taxes collected. The tax on bank debits will be implemented on 2 May through 31 December. The government estimates that it will collect approximately 100 million bolivares during that time. Likewise, the 0.75 percent tax will be levied on all Caracas Stock Exchange operations with the understanding that only the first check of each operation will be taxed. The other two laws approved by the Council of Ministers include reforms to the budget law and the law regulating bids for public projects and services, which will go into effect once published in the official gazette. Following is the full text of the decree-law establishing the bank debit tax on accounts at the country's financial institutions. Rafael Caldera, president of the Republic In full use of the powers conferred by Paragraph 8, Article 190 of the Constitution, and in accordance with what is established in No. 4, Article 1 of the Basic Law authorizing the president of the Republic to adopt extraordinary measures related to economic and financial issues during the Council of Ministers; Mandates with rank and force of law: Decree Establishing a Tax on Debits to Accounts Held With Financial Institutions Article 1. A tax is hereby levied on all individuals, legal entities, communities, societies, or corporations which, as a result of being account holders, authorize fund withdrawals or other debits from their respective checking or savings accounts, deposits in custody as liquid assets, or any other type of demand deposits, fiduciary funds, or other financial market assets. The tax will apply to the issuance of cashiers checks or any other type of operation by any financial institution regulated by the General Banking and Financial Law, by the National System of Savings and Loan Law, by the Central Bank Law, and by the other special laws regulating banks and credit institutions. The general rate of this tax shall be zero point seventy-five percent (0.75 percent). Article 2. The tax base is configured and therefore stems from the obligation to pay the tax when a debit or withdrawal from any of the accounts, deposits, or funds referred to in the preceding article is made or when a cashier's check is issued. Article 3. The payment or liquidation made by financial institutions on behalf of third parties regarding credit, rights, or assets represents the tax base, provided such payments have not been made to the beneficiary in checking or savings accounts or in cash deposits. Article 4. The obligation to pay the tax will prevail even if the recording of the debit entails the cancellation of the corresponding account, in which case such cancellation can be made only after the corresponding tax is paid. Article 5. Financial investments of any kind can be made only by way of debits from the accounts or deposits of the investment holder. Proceeds from the sale, transfer, or renewal of financial investments referred to in this article, as well as of assets involving loans granted by financial institutions, must be paid exclusively to the beneficiary with a nonendorsable check or credited to his account. Article 6. The taxable income will consist of the gross debit or taxable transaction prior to the deduction of commissions or expenses, regardless of their nature. The taxable income of transactions carried out by the stock exchange will be made up exclusively of security shares [titulos valores] offered to the public and issued in accordance with the Law on Market Capitals, Basic Law on Public Credit, and Basic Law of the Central Bank of Venezuela, as the case may be. Article 7. Stock markets and stockbrokers, in keeping with controls imposed by this decree, must keep special files on all transactions made by investors. Article 8. The responsible institutions must register as a debit the tax produced [impuesto causado] by virtue of this decree. They will transfer it to a National Treasury account that will be opened at the Central Bank of Venezuela on the first banking day following the day when a debit is made to the taxpayer's account through forms that tax authorities will edit or authorize for this purpose. Article 9. Financial institutions are responsible for the obligations imposed by this decree. Thus, such institutions must pay the taxes that taxpayers fail to pay in any taxable transaction for which they serve as intermediary. Article 10. For the purpose of this decree only, the holders of accounts, deposits, funds, and other assets specified in Article 1 must pay the taxes established by it for the endorsement or transfer of checks or securities that are representative of taxable operations starting with the second endorsement or transfer, inclusive. Taxpayers may indicate "nonendorsable" or "endorsable only once" on the reverse of securities. In the case of transactions made through the stock market, the tax will be applied only to the first purchase for the corresponding title. Article 11. The following will be exempt from payment of this tax: a) The Republic, states, municipalities, Central Bank of Venezuela, Venezuelan Investment Fund, National Savings and Loans Bank, autonomous institutions, education institutions duly registered and authorized by the Education Ministry, and public and private universities. b) Debits that result from cash reserve accounts held in the Central Bank of Venezuela. c) Transactions between the National Savings and Loans Bank and savings and loans organizations. d) Transactions between the Central Bank of Venezuela and Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation and its affiliates. e) Debits to accounts caused by the payment of the tax established in this decree. f) Debits on checking or savings accounts, ready cash funds, and other cash deposit accounts that are accredited indistinctly to an account of the same nature, to the same account holders, and at the same financial institutions. This exemption does not apply to accounts that are transferable, either jointly or separately, by individuals and established by more than two account holders. It is also not applicable to any account transferable by more than one legal entity. i) The issuance of cashiers checks to be applied to an operation that has generated and paid the tax established in this decree. i) Transactions carried out on the interbanking market that have terms of less than five consecutive days. Article 12. The tax administration will dictate the required norms and procedures and impart the administrative instructions necessary to implement, collect, control, inspect, and prompt compliance with the tax established in this decree. This exemption is not applicable to consulates and honorary consuls. h) Debits corresponding to entries and corrections [asientos y reversos] due to material errors or annulment of operations previously accredited to the account. g) Debits on checking accounts of diplomatic or consular missions, international organization representations, and their foreign officials accredited in Venezuela. Article 13. This decree will go into effect on 2 May 1994 and will remain in effect until 31 December 1994.
