This sad fact was stated by Bulat Yesekin, the head of the city directorate for ecology and bioresources in an interview with our correspondent. The state has not allocated any money for the improvement of Almaty's ecology either in the current or last year. Even the external budgeting fund for protection of nature, which used to finance several important programs, will be used by the government for other purposes. The city needs new roads and traffic controls because the number of cars in the capital increases annually by a third. The quality of gas leaves much to be desired. The life of catalysts, which were used to purify car exhausts, expire very quickly nowadays. The city has two power engineering units that are very unsafe ecologically. The president of the Republic issued an edict last year on urgent measures for the development of Almaty, in conformity with which the Ministry of Power Engineering and Fuel Resources was to provide its Almaty enterprises with low-ash coal and low-sulphur fuel oil, but the only thing that the ministry has done is to persuade the government to set flexible norms of air pollution. This has only worsened the situation. The city and the oblast do not have special sites for storing toxic waste. The recycling of garbage needs improvement. These problems become even more topical in view of the mountains surrounding the city. Our capital has no natural ventilation. Currently, Almaty leads as a city with the most polluted air in the republic, ranking second to Leninogorsk, which is the largest industrial center. It is not by chance that the population in Almaty ranks second to no one in the number of diseases of the respiratory, cardio-vascular, nervous, and urino-genital systems. Their health is also affected by the fact that the soil in the city and subsoil waters are noxious.
