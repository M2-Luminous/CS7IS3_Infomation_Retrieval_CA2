FR941011-1-00009 FR941011-1-00003 This is considered interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider additional rulemaking. The FAA estimates that 19 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. The AFM revision that was previously required by AD 94&hyph;01&hyph;09, and retained in this proposal, takes approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AFM revision requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $55 per airplane. The FAA estimates that all affected U.S. operators have previously accomplished this requirement; therefore, the future cost impact of this requirement is minimal. The removal, installation, and replacement of shear pins that would be required by this proposal would take approximately 5 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these proposed requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $5,225, or $275 per airplane. The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
