This year, however, the government fears that such exports may fall to Fr30 billion. The official figure for French weapons exports in 1993 has not been disclosed yet. Reliable sources estimate it to be "approximately Fr45 billion." In 1992, Fr50 billion worth of French weapons were sold abroad, the best performance since 1984. Last year's figure includes the Fr21 billion in revenues from the sale of 390 Leclerc tanks (GIAT [Industrial Group for Ground Wepons] Industries) and 46 tow trucks to the United Arab Emirates in February. Another Fr2.8 billion came from the sale of 17 Cougar helicopters to the Netherlands and another 20 to Turkey [Cougars are made by Eurocopter, which is owned by Aerospatiale (70 percent) and DASA [Deutsche Aerospace] (30 percent)]. A number of smaller contracts made up the balance. Due to a Number of Diplomatic Choices However, the government takes small comfort in this relatively satisfactory performance, as it believes the current year may turn out to be a very disappointing one. According to an expert, the initial hope of seeing French sales reach the Fr60-billion mark by year end has now been superseded by a more pessimistic forecast: that of a final figure hovering around an abysmal Fr30 billion. This is due to a number of diplomatic choices, such as the defense agreement entered into with Israel in the midst of the international talks on the occupied territories, which is said to have infuriated Arab countries. Another such choice is Paris' decision to turn its back to Taiwan in the hope of regaining China's favors. To this must be added some rumored commercial blunders on the part of France, among others the underestimation of competition and weak financial arrangements. On 17 November 1993, French Defense Minister Francois Leotard stated the following in an interview with LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES: "I think we should exceed 1992's figure of Fr50 billion in 1994 and possibly even in 1995." In early January, Mr. Leotard's ministry still saw things in this light. Today, such rather overoptimistic hopes have been deflated. In Sweden, the Leclerc tank has lost out to Germany's Leopard (Krauss Maffei) in a bid for 120 units worth Fr4.3 billion. Matra's Mica missile is in danger of being sidelined by the American Amraam missile and British Aerospace's Active Skyflash in the race to provide Stockholm with 500 airborne missile worth Fr2.8 billion. In Pakistan, as part of a competition for three submarines worth Fr3.5 billion, Sweden's Kockums corporation is proving a dangerous competitor for France's shipbuilding industry. Abu Dhabi still has not bought the 10 or so Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft Dassault thought it would, and Pakistan has bought no additional aircraft either. Saudi Arabia may well postpone until 1995 payment of all or part of the Fr9 billion relating to the three large maintenance contracts it recently entered into with France; and it has not yet decided to purchase the three French antiaircraft frigates worth Fr20 billion. Last, Taiwan is now keeping its distance [following the rapprochement with the PRC], although the island was expected to purchase weapon systems worth Fr10 billion for its six French-made frigates, as well as 300 armored vehicles made by Renault Vehicules Industriels (Fr1.2 billion), and Fr2.5 billion's worth of Roland missiles (jointly made by Aerospatiale and DASA), not to mention another 60 Mirage aircraft in a more distant future.
