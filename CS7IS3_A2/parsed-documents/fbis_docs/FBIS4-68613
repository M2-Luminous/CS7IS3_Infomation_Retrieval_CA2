It was with them that Yuriy Meshkov began his ascent to power three years ago. On the wall of the largest tent is a pencil portrait of Meshkov of an extremely impressive size with the inscription "Long live the president!" The rest of the decoration of the compound shows its inhabitants' lack of acceptance of Ukraine in all of its manifestations--from the Ukrainian language to Ukrainian salt pork. Anatoliy Los, the leader of the picketers, speaks at the small rally several times a day. In his words, the old men and women (with the latter clearly in the majority) have gathered here in order to protect their president from the intrigues of Ukrainian nationalists. Incidentally, a situation is developing in the Crimea in which, most likely, Meshkov will have to be protected not from the persistent fighters for the Ukrainian idea, who are nowhere to be found here, and not from the opposition, who suffered a crushing defeat in the elections to the Supreme Council of the Crimea, but from his own advisers. It is true that the Russia bloc won an absolute majority--54 of the 90 positions that are occupied as of today (four mandates have not been won by anyone yet). But the unanimity with which representatives of sometimes diametrically opposed political forces speak both about Meshkov himself and about the qualitative composition of the parliament shows that if the president of the Crimea is fostering hopes that the Supreme Council will automatically rubber stamp any of his decisions, they are in vain. This can be seen both from the deputy chairman of the Council of the Crimean Tatar people, Rifat Chubarov, and from Meshkov's former rival for the presidential elections, Sergey Shuvaynikov (Russian Party). Another former claimant to the high state post in the Crimea, the chairman of the Communist Party of Crimea, Leonid Grach, told a MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent: "I do not rule out the possibility that this Supreme Council of the Crimea in general will be unable to begin to function and realize itself as a parliament. And this could raise the question of repeat elections in the near future. The Russia bloc even today is coming apart at the seams. But if the deputies from it continue to refuse to take Ukraine into account, we will not give our consent. The Tatars, who have 14 mandates in the Supreme Council, will not go along with this either." Moreover, Grach states that he is ready to consider the proposals (and Grach is convinced that there will be some) to nominate him as a candidate for the post of chairman of the Crimean parliament. True, the Russia bloc is considering other candidates, but Leonid Grach would suit many. If this election occurs, the confrontation within the "Russian type" along the lines of parliament-president in the Crimea will be more than likely. Many of the president's advisers in the Russia bloc have a personal score to settle with him as well: He very blatantly failed to take their wishes and hopes into account when dividing up the portfolios. Moreover, having abolished the Council of Ministers of the Crimea, except for appointing Yevgeniy Saburov as deputy prime minister, the president has practically not distinguished himself in the field of state construction. Workers of the Crimean SBU (Security Service of Ukraine) administration, in which Meshkov tried to change the leadership with his edict, adopted an appeal to the president requesting that he not involve them in political conflicts. In so doing they revealed an open secret: where the previously unknown people on Meshkov's team had come from. In their message the Chekists express their surprise that their former colleagues who are now in the president's circle do not understand such simple things. According to numerous pieces of evidence, Meshkov's team includes people who are directly linked to criminal structures who have served their term for various reasons. In any case it became unofficially known that Meshkov had prepared an edict which envisions a radical purge of the ranks of presidential advisers. During the two months of his presidency Yuriy Meshkov has used up his extremely small reserve of strength in relations with Kiev. His statement to the effect that the present Ukrainian government is "the greatest threat to peace in Europe" practically rules out the possibility of businesslike contacts with this government. Yet Meshkov had every reason to count on the idea that with an indisputable victory of the left wing (inclined toward alliance with Russia) in the elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine he would have a real chance of working with different leaders in Kiev. But here again he could not refrain from inciting passions by calling for a boycott of these elections. Even Crimean politicians who are far from sympathizing with the current Ukraine note that the fight against Ukrainian nationalism in the Crimea is beginning to grow into Russian chauvinism. But one can see how the tension is growing from the example of the war of edicts between Kiev and Simferopol which broke out in the middle of March. First Meshkov, violating not only Ukrainian but also Crimean legislation, fired the chairman of the telephone and radio company of Crimea, Valeriy Astakhov. The president of Ukraine overrode this edict. Then followed the aforementioned firing of the chief of the SBU with an attempt to appoint "his own person" to the special unit. At the same time the stirring up of passions causes harm to the sphere which could help the economy of the Crimea very much this year: It is difficult to imagine how many lovers of the Crimean sun and sea have rejected the president's invitation to come to the blessed peninsula this summer. It is impossible to understand what future awaits the three edicts Meshkov signed at the suggestion of Deputy Prime Minister Saburov: "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control," "On Taxation," and "On Banks and Banking Activity on the Territory of the Republic of Crimea." The purpose of these edicts was to step up the circulation of funds and encourage investment of money in the economy of the Crimea. But who will invest money in a territory where "it smells like thunder in the air"? A special podium with a separate dais has already been constructed in the meeting hall of the Supreme Council of the Crimea for Yuriy Meshkov, who is keenly attentive to the presence and observance of a presidential environment and vocabulary. Eyewitnesses who have seen him sitting at his assigned place during the last session of the Supreme Council of the old convocation note that he looked very lonely there....
