For oral outcry bidding, applicants will be required to show the Commission or its representative, immediately prior to the auction, a cashiers check for at least $2500 in order to get a bidding number and secure a place in the room where the bidding will take place. Bidders will be required to have $2500 upfront money for every five licenses they win. No upfront payment will be required from applicants in single-round sealed bid auctions. See 47 CFR 1.2106.
