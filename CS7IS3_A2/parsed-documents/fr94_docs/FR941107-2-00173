FR941107-2-00173 FR941107-2-00093 11. No sales charge is deducted from premium payments under the Contracts. However, to pay Travelers for its costs of distributing the Contracts, a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') equal to 5% of a purchase payment will be assessed in the first five years following such payment for certain full or partial surrenders. After the first contract or certificate year, Contract owners may surrender up to 10% of their contract value as of the first valuation date of any given contract year without incurring a CDSC (``Free Withdrawal''). Free Withdrawals do not apply to full surrenders, and, under IRA plans, are only available after the annuitant has attained age 591/2. Additionally, the CDSC is not assessed on Contract earnings which equal (a) Contract Value, minus (b) the sum of all purchase payments not previously surrendered, and minus (c) the amount of the Free Withdrawal, if applicable. For purposes of determining the CDSC, surrenders will be deemed to be taken first from any applicable Free Withdrawal amount, then from purchase payments on a first-in, first-out basis, and finally from Contract earnings in excess of any 10% Free Withdrawal. The CDSC cannot be increased during the life of the Contracts and may be waived under certain circumstances. Travelers does not expect that revenues from the CDSC will be sufficient to cover sales and distribution expenses incurred in connection with the Contracts. In that event, the excess distribution costs would have to be paid out of Travelers' general assets, which may include profits, if any, from the mortality and expense risk charges assessed under the Contracts. In some cases, where Travelers may expect to incur lower sales and administrative expenses or perform fewer services, it may, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate certain administrative and CDSC charges. 12. A charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of net asset value of the Subaccounts will be imposed to compensate Travelers for bearing certain mortality and expense risks. Of this amount, .625% is for mortality and .625% is for expense risks. This charge cannot be increased during the life of the Contracts. 13. The mortality risk arises from Travelers' contractual obligation to make Annuity Payments for the life of the annuitant under annuity options involving life contingencies, regardless of the annuitant's longevity and any improvement in life expectancy generally. Thus, Travelers assumes the risk that the annuitants, as a class, may live longer than has been estimated by its actuaries, so that payments guaranteed for the life of the Contracts will continue for longer than had been anticipated. 14. Travelers assumes additional mortality and certain expense risks under the Contracts by its contractual obligation to pay the death benefit in a lump sum (or in the form of an annuity option) upon the death of the annuitant before annuity or income payments commence. Also, no CDSC will be assessed if the Contract Value is paid as a death benefit. Travelers also assumes an expense risk under the Contracts because the administrative charges may be insufficient to cover actual administrative expenses. 15. In the event that the administrative charge and the mortality and expense risk charge are more than sufficient to cover Travelers' costs and expenses, any excess will be a profit to Travelers. While Travelers does not expect to profit from the administrative charges, it does expect a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. Any profit realized from this charge would be available for any proper corporate purpose, including the payment of distribution expenses for the Contracts not reimbursed by the CDSC. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of: (a) Fund VA in connection with the offering of Current Contracts; (b) Fund VA in connection with the offering of Future Contracts; and (c) any Other Accounts established in the future by Travelers in connection with the offering of Future Contracts. Applicants believe that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. 2. Applicants represent that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Future Contracts funded by Fund VA or the Other Accounts are consistent with the standards set forth in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants represent that the Future Contracts will be substantially identical in all material respects to the Current Contracts. Applicants state that without the requested relief, Travelers would have to request and obtain exemptive relief for Fund VA, or each new Other Account, to fund Future Contracts. Applicants assert that these additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the 1940 Act not already addressed in this application. Further, if Travelers were to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors would not receive additional protection or benefit and could be disadvantaged by increased overhead of Travelers. Applicants argue that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest because the relief will promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need for Travelers to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources. Applicants believe that both the delay and the expense of repeatedly seeking exemptive relief would impair Travelers' ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.
