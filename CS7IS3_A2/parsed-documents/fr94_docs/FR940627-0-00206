FR940627-0-00206 FR940627-0-00019 (C) The Atypical Gasoline category is comprised of gasoline fuels and associated additives which contain one or more elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. (ii) Diesel Categories. (A) The Baseline Diesel category is comprised of diesel fuels and associated additives which satisfy all of the following criteria: ( 1 ) Contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. Pursuant to 40 CFR 80.29, highway diesel sold after October 1, 1993 shall contain 0.05 percent or less sulfur by weight; ( 2 ) Contain less than 1.0 percent oxygen by weight; ( 3 ) Diesel formulations containing more than 0.05 percent sulfur by weight are precluded by 40 CFR 80.29; ( 4 ) Possess the characteristics of diesel fuel as specified by ASTM standard D 975&hyph;93 (incorporated by reference, pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section); and ( 5 ) Derived from conventional petroleum sources only. (B) The Non-Baseline Diesel category is comprised of diesel fuels and associated additives which conform to the specifications in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for the Baseline Diesel category except that they contain 1.0 percent or more oxygen by weight and/or may be derived from synthetic crudes, such as those prepared from coal, shale and tar sands, heavy oil deposits, and other non-conventional petroleum sources. (C) The Atypical Diesel category is comprised of diesel fuels and associated additives which contain one or more elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. (iii) Methanol Categories. (A) The Baseline Methanol category is comprised of methanol fuels and associated additives which contain at least 50 percent methanol by volume, no more than 4.0 percent by volume of substances other than methanol and gasoline, and no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and/or chlorine. Baseline methanol shall contain no more than 0.004 percent by weight of sulfur or 0.0001 percent by weight of chlorine. (B) The Non-Baseline Methanol category is comprised of fuel blends which contain at least 50 percent methanol by volume, more than 4.0 percent by volume of a substance(s) other than methanol and gasoline, and meet the baseline limitations on elemental composition in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
