Galway oystermen expect to harvest hundreds of thousands of oysters from mid-November to the end of December, but at the end of their first day boatmen had 40 oysters between them, instead of the normal thousand for each of a dozen boats. Oyster beds at Clarenbridge, the village that hosts an annual oyster festival, have almost been eliminated and other areas are at risk. The threat comes from bonamia, a wasting disease, which poses no threat to people eating oysters but is fatal to the shellfish. Environmentalists say bonamia is one of the worst ecological disasters to strike Ireland this century. There is no known cure and marine scientists have found that its effects could take between 50 and 100 years to clear. Michael Kennedy, manager of Ireland's Western Region Fisheries Board, said: "Something like 90 percent of the shells are coming up empty. It is very, very serious." Bonamia spread to Europe from California, destroying millions of oysters in France, and reached the British Isles a decade ago. In Britain, it was first located in the West Country and spread to the south and east coasts. Len Hodges, 70, who runs the Duchy of Cornwall farm, near Falmouth, said that before the disease arrived in 1983 he had a staff of 18, but had since had to lay off all but three. To survive, many farmers have begun breeding the Pacific oyster, which is unaffected by the disease.
