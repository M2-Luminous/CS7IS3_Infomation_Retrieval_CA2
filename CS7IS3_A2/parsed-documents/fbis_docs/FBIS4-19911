The violence and the resulting chaos prompted the forced evacuation of virtually all nationals of the international community present in Rwanda. As a result of the solidarity shown by member states, it was possible to rescue those nationals in a satisfactory manner. The EU repeats its pressing call for Rwandese lives to be protected, and urgently appeals to the opposing forces to bring the violence to an end and to resume negotiations on the basis of the principles in the Arusha agreement. It wishes to see appropriate humanitarian action organized in response to the human tragedy unfolding in the region, and undertakes to play its part in such action.
