FBIS4-431 "drafr070_a_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Calls Foreign Reports of Cease-Fire `Unfounded' RPF Calls Foreign Reports of Cease-Fire `Unfounded' EA1104210094 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in Kinyarwand to Rwanda 1730 GMT 11 Apr 94 EA1104210094 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura Kinyarwand BFN [Text] Recent foreign media broadcasts referring to a cease-fire agreement between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and the government are unfounded. The RPF cannot sign an agreement with a government it does not recognize. The so-called government is null and void politically and legally. The clique calling itself a coalition of parties which were part of the previous government actively comprises individuals jointly motivated by a desire to divide Rwandans. The government comprises the small group of people who fought the Arusha agreement and did everything possible to ensure it was scrapped. The RPF cannot hold talks with the clique, which does not recognize the Arusha agreements. As far as the RPF is concerned, there is no government in Rwanda. It does not even recognize the man who calls himself president of the Republic after being installed unlawfully. He has said himself that he was installed as president under Article 42 of the Constitution of 10 February 1991. He says so himself. However, he well knows that the article is no longer valid. The president of the Republic had been sworn in under the peace agreement and was to have been replaced in accordance with the same agreement. The agreement stipulates that the president of the Republic is to be replaced by the president of the transitional broad-based National Assembly. Theodore Sindikubgabo is only president of the National Development Counci [CND], which is now irrelevant. His government cannot hold talks with the RPF. It is not a government of Rwandans but a clique with Coalition for the Defense of the Republic [CDR] ideas which conflict with the Arusha agreements. It is a government that has not been recognized by a single foreign country. Even international radios call it the CDR. [Words indistinct] the United Nations has not recognized it. The so-called government cannot hold talks with the RPF, because it has exterminated the government of Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana. A close look shows that the government is made up of a clique which usurped power by shedding blood. What it did is no different from a coup d'etat. It has been said on several occasions that the clique wanted to replace the government with another which would oppose the RPF. To install such a government they first had to kill all their opponents in the government, which they did. What also exposes their plan was killing Felicien Ngango, who was to have become president of the broad-based National Assembly and would therefore have replaced the president of the Republic. They made it even clearer with the death of Joseph Kavaruganda, the president of the Constitutional Court, who was empowered to swear in the individual who would have replaced the president of the Republic and his friends. The clique had always nursed its plan of capturing power, but failed to obtain the ways and means to carry it out. They found a way through the death of President Habyarimana, which the clique must have paved the way for so as to bring to realization the objectives of those who called themselves power. [as heard] That is why some conclude that what was done was no different from a coup d'etat, as there are killings causing tears. Over 10,000 have already died. The government is still cooperating with the killers although it [words indistinct] part of its program. That is why the RPF must fight the clique until dictatorship and division are disposed of in Rwanda. The RPF decided to resume fighting for three main reasons: First, to support the RPF combatants in the CND compound, who have been and continue being attacked by the Presidential Guard. Second, to stop the killings of innocent people. Third, to restore peace in the country. The RPF continues to implement its goals. In fact, the RPF has entered the outskirts of Kigali. It is fighting the Presidential Guards and their supporters. That is why it asks all citizens to support the RPF combatants [words indistinct] and that if they see them they should know they are coming to rout Rwanda's enemies. We call on government soldiers who do not support the clique to support the RPF combatants. The UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda's contribution is also necessary. They should avoid the clique's traps, especially by refraining from bringing the RPF leaders messages from the clique. This is not a clique to hold talks with, but one to be fought by all Rwandans. If we unite, we shall get rid of it.
