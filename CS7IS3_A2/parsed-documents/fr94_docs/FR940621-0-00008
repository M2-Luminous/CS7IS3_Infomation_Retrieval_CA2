FR940621-0-00008 FR940621-0-00003 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 77 [Docket No. 94&hyph;053&hyph;1] Tuberculosis in Cattle and Bison; State Designation AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Interim rule and request for comments. SUMMARY: We are amending the tuberculosis regulations concerning the interstate movement of cattle and bison by reducing the designation of Virginia from an accredited-free State to an accredited-free (suspended) State. We have determined that Virginia no longer meets the criteria for designation as an accredited-free State but meets the criteria for designation as an accredited-free (suspended) State. This change is necessary to prevent the spread of tuberculosis in cattle and bison. DATES: Interim rule effective June 21, 1994. Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 94&hyph;053&hyph;1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Ronald A. Stenseng, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Cattle Diseases and Surveillance Staff, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 729, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8715. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Bovine tuberculosis is the contagious, infectious, and communicable disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis. The tuberculosis regulations contained in 9 CFR part 77 (referred to below as the regulations), regulate the interstate movement of cattle and bison because of tuberculosis. Cattle or bison not known to be affected with or exposed to tuberculosis are eligible for interstate movement without restriction if those cattle or bison are moved from jurisdictions designated as accredited-free States, accredited-free (suspended) States, or modified accredited States. The regulations restrict the interstate movement of cattle or bison not known to be affected with or exposed to tuberculosis if those cattle or bison are moved from jurisdictions designated as nonmodified accredited States. The status of a State is based on its freedom from evidence of tuberculosis, the effectiveness of the State's tuberculosis eradication program, and the degree of the State's compliance with the standards contained in a document captioned ``Uniform Methods and Rules_Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication,'' which is part of the regulations via incorporation by reference in part 77.
