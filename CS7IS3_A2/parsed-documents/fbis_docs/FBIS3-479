This is due to delay tactics being orchestrated by the Monrovia Group and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]. Reports say in Monrovia, they are trying to sort out the status of Mr. Thomas Ziah who was reportedly replaced by ULIMO but rejected by the ULIMO military high command. Other dignitaries in Monrovia to witness the occasion include ECOWAS executive secretary, Dr. Edouard Benjamin; the Ivorian foreign minister, Amara Essy; Nigeria's foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe; and General Arnold Quainoo, representing the Ghanaian Government. The representatives of various international and local organizations are also in Monrovia for the ceremony. At the same time, news say the NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly] delegation to the Monrovia inauguration of Liberia's collective leadership, headed by Vice President Enoch Dogolee, has been blocked in Kakata from attending the seating of the transitional government. The NPRA Government's delegation was being escorted by the UN Observer Mission. This move by ULIMO in Kakata comes in the wake of assurances by UNOMIL [United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia] and ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] that all is set for the seating of the LNTG unhindered. Earlier, ULIMO military commander, General Roosevelt Johnson, made a trip to Kakata at which time he gave an assurance that his men will strictly adhere to the free movement of people, but this has since been violated by his soldiers. Similar undisciplined behavior by ULIMO fighters occurred during the opening of the road when the US ambassador and several other dignitaries were stopped from traveling through Kakata. ULIMO has been openly defying the mandate of the UN and ECOMOG by seizing and looting UN relief convoys, bringing in supplies to Greater Liberia. The NPRA Government is yet to react to the stopping of its delegation by ULIMO to attend the inaugural ceremony. The ECOMOG high command has also not intervened to get the NPRA Government's delegation through Kakata despite its assurances that all is set for the seating of the LNTG today.
