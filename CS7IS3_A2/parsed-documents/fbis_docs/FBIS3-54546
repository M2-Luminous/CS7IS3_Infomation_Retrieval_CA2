The prime minister and his delegation will then visit al-Qardahah in Syria to offer condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad on the death of his son Staff Major Basil al-Asad. Last night, Prime Minister al-Hariri addressed the alumni of the American University of Beirut-London branch. The prime minister dealt with the current situation and the Lebanese Government's stances and plans to reconstruct Lebanon. He reiterated that his visit to London has been successful, noting that British companies will contribute toward reconstructing Lebanon. Prime Minister al-Hariri had the following to say: [Begin al-Hariri recording] I believe that our visit to Britain was successful and the outcome exceeds our expectations. It had been a long time since a Lebanese prime minister visited Britain, but the atmosphere of frankness and amity that prevailed during our talks with British officials demonstrate [words indistinct]. I firmly believe that a new page has been turned in Lebanese-British relations. British companies will take part in the reconstruction of Lebanon, particularly in the realms of electricity and irrigation. British companies could possibly participate in any project if their quotations are competitive. The British Government supports this trend. During my meetings with British businessmen yesterday and today I sensed that they are quite serious, that they respect the Lebanese people, and that they have confidence in Lebanon. We will benefit from their expertise and they will benefit from the opportunities. Britain is a friendly state. It fully supports Security Council Resolution 425, Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon, and the establishment of peace -- a comprehensive and just peace that safeguards dignity and honor. [sentence indistinct] We have many friends in the world, and all our friends support us. We hope to secure an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and that peace will prevail in the region. If Israel indeed wants to live in peace, the Arabs, all the Arabs, are quite prepared to reciprocate. The Arabs are indeed willing to live in peace. [Words indistinct] but Israel must realize that it cannot keep the land, occupy the land, and have peace too. If Israel wants peace, it must withdraw from the land in the Golan and south Lebanon. The ball is now in Israel's court. The Arabs have tried everything to show the world that they are peace advocates. The world has started to listen to us with open minds. Lebanon, like the other states in the region, will benefit from peace, therefore peace is our real objective. Peace, however, should not be made by one side; it must rather be sought by both sides. The Israelis are attacking us every day and 10 percent of our land is occupied. Israel must withdraw and peace will then be established. [end recording]
