Policies related to taxation, import and export trade, customs tariffs, and the use of foreign capital will be slanted in terms of trade sector. This was recently decided at an important meeting in Beijing. Up to now, the Chinese Government has granted a series of favorable policies to coastal areas, thus enabling these areas to become prosperous ahead of others. By benefiting from the favorable policies, the coastal areas have effected unprecedented economic growth. In particular, the coastal areas of Guangdong have achieved enviable economic development as they have benefited from favorable policies and being adjacent to Hong Kong. The new policy decision of the Chinese Government will terminate the overall policy structure which was favorable to the coastal areas and resulted in a widening the gap between different areas, and this is related to the increasing discontent in society. In recent years, many people have criticized the practice of giving more favorable policies to some areas. They pointed out that during the period of reform and opening up, substantial economic development in the coastal areas, especially the coastal areas of Guangdong, was not a result of their own efforts to a great degree, but was gained at the expense of the interior's development. The special and favorable policies the central government adopted for the coastal areas have had some negative effects. The manpower and material resources of the interior have been continuously flowing to Guangdong and other coastal areas at low prices. As time goes on, the poor will become poorer while the rich get richer. As various localities have to hand over similar amounts of tax revenue and profits to the state, the coastal areas can keep more funds in their own hands, and this is extremely unfair. A scholar revealed in an article that, for a time, funds flowing to Shenzhen accounted for one-third of the country's total working capital. The slanted policies might have created a false impression of prosperity, but this was not something one should be proud of because it was just an abnormal situation. In the interior provinces and regions, people, from government officials to ordinary people, are discontented with the biased policies favorable to the coastal areas. If such a situation continues, it will certainly bring about certain serious social problems nationwide. The termination of the policy structure favorable to the coastal areas, to a great degree, is aimed at preventing social unrest rather than meeting the needs of economic development. On the other hand, the Chinese Government has also now decided to stop the practice of giving favorable treatment to the coastal areas because it fears that some local forces might strengthen excessively. For example, in the past 10 years or more of reform and opening, Guangdong's local economic strength has increased substantially and people there have become rather arrogant on the basis of their wealth. Their practice of "making full use of the policies" and "daring to jump red lights" has also startled people in other parts of the country. If it is allowed to continue to enjoy favorable policy treatment, it is doubtful whether the central government will still be able to control the province effectively. When they made the favorable policy arrangements, the central authorities hoped that economic growth in the coastal areas would bring common development to other areas. Now, in discovering this tendency to go beyond their control, it is certain that the first thing they should do is to check such a tendency. However, the change in the policy structure tilted in favor of certain areas to a policy structure tilted in favor of certain industries also shows that the government has become more mature in guiding economic development. In the vast territory of China, excessive imbalances between different areas will inevitably cause great obstructions to economic development rather than promoting economic development. The improper industrial structure will eventually cause economic growth to lack momentum. In the past, Hong Kong people's investments were mainly concentrated in Guangdong and other coastal areas, and such investments yielded handsome returns. This year, China's economic reform will undergo another major turning point, and the scope of foreign investment will be extended to commerce, banking, insurance, and shipping industries, and no restraint will be imposed on the scale and technological level of foreign investment projects. The industrial tilt will become a major characteristic of macroeconomic guidance policies. It can be said that, this year, in order to achieve better results in investment in China, Hong Kong investors should first give consideration to the impact of the guiding policies the Chinese Government has adopted.
