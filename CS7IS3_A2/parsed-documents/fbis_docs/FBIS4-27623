He said his ministry, which is in charge of the insurance sector in the talks under a bilateral trade "framework," will make "utmost efforts" to reach an accord by the July 8 start of the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in Naples, Italy. The insurance talks started earlier in the day, three and a half months after breaking down on February 11 over how to measure progress in opening Japan's markets. Fujii told a regular news conference he knew nothing of the details of the day's Tokyo talks, as he had been in Diet hearings all day. On the economy, despite a surge in the stock market and upturns in several economic indicators, Fujii said he cannot yet judge that the economy has hit bottom as "not necessarily good" factors continue to cloud the emerging bright signs.
