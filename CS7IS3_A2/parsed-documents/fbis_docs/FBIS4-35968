FBIS4-35968 "drnes108_n_94002" FBIS-NES-94-108 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 LEBANON Says No Withdrawal From Peace Talks Says No Withdrawal From Peace Talks NC0606071394 Beirut Radio Lebanon in Arabic 0430 GMT 6 Jun 94 NC0606071394 Beirut Radio Lebanon Arabic BFN [Text] Lebanon has affirmed it will not withdraw from the peace negotiations regardless of Israeli pressures. Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has told the newspaper AL-SAFIR that the Madrid Conference formula is second to none, in the absence of any alternative formula. But the problems do not rest with the formula; rather they rest with Israel's dealing with this formula, the foreign minister added. Fariz Buwayz said: Despite its acceptance in theory or principle of this formula since it was initiated in Madrid, Israel has been ceaselessly trying to torpedo this formula. The foreign minister maintained that since the start Israel has been trying to isolate and separate out parties. It continues this policy even now and is trying to torpedo the Madrid Conference mechanism. In his statement to AL-SAFIR, the foreign minister said that a withdrawal from the negotiations would trigger various repercussions. Therefore, it would not be in Lebanon's interest to withdraw from the negotiations. This would make Lebanon appear before the world public as a rejector of peace, particularly since Israel can exploit this issue in the media, Buwayz added. The foreign minister said: We must continue the negotiations because there is no other mechanism that is supported and sponsored internationally. We also must not throw in our cards before the end of the negotiations. Minister Buwayz pointed out that he had informed the Americans of Lebanon's commitment to continuing its resistance as long as there are insufficient assurances of the liberation of its land. Buwayz affirmed that the aggression against Ba'labakk was a new Israeli attempt to strike at Lebanese-Syrian cohesion. The foreign minister criticized the Gaza-Jericho agreement, adding that Lebanon's ties with the Palestinian issue are clear. But as for Lebanon's relations with the Palestinian leadership, I believe that this leadership must propose a final concept and strategy so that we can finally define our relations with them. But defining a relationship to a structure based on transient principles is absolutely impossible, the foreign minister concluded.
