FR940303-2-00180 FR940303-2-00093 Section III: 1993 Activities A. Passenger Car CAFE Standards The following synopsis describes litigation challenging NHTSA actions under the CAFE program. Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) v. NHTSA, D.C. Circuit Court, No. 89&hyph;1422 This case challenged NHTSA's May 1989 decision to terminate rulemaking on whether to amend the MY 1990 passenger car CAFE standard. On February 19, 1992, in a 2&hyph;1 decision, the D.C. Circuit Court held that NHTSA failed to adequately evaluate the safety consequences of its decision to retain the MY 1990 passenger car CAFE standard of 27.5 mpg rather than proceeding with proposed rulemaking to reduce that model year's standard. The Court remanded the matter to NHTSA for further consideration. CEI filed a Motion for Attorney Fees which NHTSA opposed. On August 6, 1992, the Court issued an order deferring decision on CEI's fee motion until NHTSA acts on the Court's remand order. NHTSA's subsequent action on this remand order is discussed below. Competitive Enterprise Institute v. NHTSA, D.C. Circuit Court, No. 93&hyph;1210 This case challenges NHTSA's January 15, 1993, decision (D.C. Circuit Court's remand in Case No. 89&hyph;1422) to again terminate the rulemaking it commenced to consider amending the MY 1990 passenger car CAFE standard. The petition for review was filed on March 15, 1993. Both sides filed preliminary papers, but the Court has not yet issued a briefing and argument schedule. B. Light Truck CAFE Standards NHTSA published a final rule establishing the MY 1995 light truck fuel economy standard on April 7, 1993 (58 FR 18019). NHTSA set a combined standard of 20.6 mpg for MY 1995, the highest CAFE standard the agency has ever established for light trucks. The rule also converted certain measurements into metric units, the agency's first occurrence of using metric conversion for regulations relating to fuel economy standards. In the final rule for MY 1995 light trucks, NHTSA determined that GM is the ``least capable'' manufacturer with a combined fuel economy capability of 20.6 mpg. NHTSA concluded upon balancing the relevant statutory factors, that the relatively small and uncertain energy savings that would be associated with setting a standard above GM's capability would not justify the economic harm to the company and the economy as a whole. NHTSA projected that GM could not achieve a combined fuel economy level higher than 20.6 mpg for MY 1995. In contrast, NHTSA concluded that Chrysler and Ford can achieve CAFE levels of at least 20.6 mpg. NHTSA selected 20.6 mpg for MY 1995 as the final combined standard to balance the potentially serious adverse economic consequences associated with the realization of the above market and technological risks against GM's opportunity as the ``least capable'' manufacturer with a substantial share of sales. Since GM produces more than 38 percent of all light trucks that are subject to the fuel economy standards, its capability significantly affects the level of the industry's capability and, therefore, the standard level. A final rule for light truck fuel economy standards for MYs 1996 and 1997 is pending. C. Low Volume Petitions Section 502(c) of the Act provides that a low volume manufacturer of passenger cars may be exempted from the generally applicable passenger car fuel economy standards if these standards are more stringent than the maximum feasible average fuel economy for that manufacturer and if NHTSA establishes an alternative standard for that manufacturer at its maximum feasible level. Under the Act, a low volume manufacturer is one that manufactured fewer than 10,000 passenger cars worldwide, in the model year for which the exemption is sought (the affected model year) and in the second model year preceding that model year. During 1993, NHTSA acted on one low volume petition that was filed by Rolls-Royce. Rolls-Royce requested an alternative standard for its passenger cars for MYs 1995 and 1996. NHTSA issued a proposed decision to grant an alternative standard of 14.6 mpg for both model years (58 FR 41228 August 3, 1993). D. Enforcement Section 508(b)(1) of the Act imposes a civil penalty of $5 dollars for each tenth of a mpg by which a manufacturer's CAFE level falls short of the standard, multiplied by the total number of passenger automobiles or light trucks produced by the manufacturer in that model year. Credits that were earned for exceeding the standard in any of the three model years immediately prior to or subsequent to the model years in question can be used to offset the penalty. With EPA completion of final CAFE computations for MY 1992 for most passenger car fleets, NHTSA initiated enforcement actions for manufacturers that did not meet the CAFE standard.
