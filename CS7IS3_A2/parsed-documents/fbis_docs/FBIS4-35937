He also described it as a violation and circumvention of the UN Security Council. In a telephone conversation held with him from Doha by the Qatari News Agency editor-in-chief, the Presidential Council member stressed that all the Yemeni people support unity and do not approve of what is being done by the secessionist elements in Aden. He said the separatists obstructed all positive initiatives designed to overcome our country's current crisis. He explained: When we announced a cease-fire on the eve of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, they issued the declaration of secession. Now, when a UN Security Council resolution has been issued calling for peace and stability in our country, they declare the formation of a secessionist government. The Presidential Council member reiterated that our country welcomes the UN Security Council resolution and deals with it on condition that all those concerned cooperate with the implementation of the resolution. He said the resolution proceeds from the principles and the charter of the United Nations, for it calls for respecting the unity and sovereignty of the entire territory of the Republic of Yemen. He explained that our country's approval of the UN Security Council resolution is not considered a change in its policy. He explained: We welcomed the resolution after we found that it does not contravene the Republic of Yemen's unity and sovereignty over its entire territory. Consequently, the resolution has been dealt with. He stressed that as a UN member, our country could not have prevented the UN Security Council from debating any issue. He explained that the UN Security Council will be submitted to the Presidential Council, given that the executive authority in the Republic of Yemen is made up of the Presidential Council and the Council of Ministers. The Presidential Council member welcomed the appointment of Lakhdar Ibrahim as a representative of the UN secretary general to lead the fact-finding committee. He described Ibrahimi as an esteemed Arab personality worthy of this mission.
