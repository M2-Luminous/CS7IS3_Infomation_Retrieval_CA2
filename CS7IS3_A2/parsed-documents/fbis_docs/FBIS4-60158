"Although Muslims feel bitter about the Saudi regime's banning of the disavowal of polytheists rally, as was evident in your valuable remarks, it is a matter of regret that a government which styles itself as servant of holy shrines obstructs such rally at the centre of monotheism and revelation," read the message. It hoped the Saudi regime would realize its folly of following the dictates of Zionism and arrogant powers, especially the criminal U.S., and next year would allow pilgrims to stage the disavowal of polytheists rally which is a basic part of the "Abrahmic Hajj".
