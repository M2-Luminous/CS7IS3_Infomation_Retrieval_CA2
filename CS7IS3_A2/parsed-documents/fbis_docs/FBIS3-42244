On this tape there was a recording of a payment demand for $500,000 and 500 million rubles. If these terms were not met, the terrorists threatened to detonate explosions at important vital installations. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's special correspondent called the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Ministry of Security and asked the officer on duty, Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Telegin, to spell out the details of what had occurred. [Ignatyev] Sergey Vladimirovich, how did all this begin? [Telegin] At 0900 hours on 1 February, an unidentified person dropped a cassette tape off in the lobby of city hall and asked Tamara, the secretary, to give it to her superiors. The cassete lay around in the lobby nearly all day, and it was only toward the evening that someone remembered that it was there. When the tape was played, an unusual 10-minute recording was discovered on it. A calm male voice announced that a terrorist group named "Revenge" is operating in Yakutsk; it has the capability to carry out sabotage and terrorist acts, blow up vital installations in the city -- namely heat supply stations, gasworks, and water supply systems -- and also perform acts of violence against the civilian population on bus routes and in airport waiting halls if the authorities do not meet the relevant conditions. The conditions are these: On 4 February the authorities must hand over $500,000 and 500 million rubles. The extortioners proposed the following plan of action: At 1900 hours local time on 3 February, there should be an announcement on the 12th channel of Yakutsk television in which, if the conditions had been accepted, a contact telephone number should be indicated for communication purposes. The terrorists named a vehicle -- a Moskvich station wagon -- together with its registration number. According to the criminals' information, it is a private vehicle that carries paying passengers. The money must be handed to the driver. Between 1000 and 2100 hours on 4 February he has to drive around the city picking up anyone who hails him and asks to be taken to the airport. Every 50-60 minutes the driver has to turn up at the cabstand at the airport. The driver must not be replaced by an officer. The capture of the person arriving to collect the money would also result in serious consequences: The terrorists would open fire indiscriminately on people outside and in the airport waiting hall. A pack of "Rodopi" cigarettes is to be fixed to the windscreen of the "Moskvich" to identify it. The voice warned the driver not to touch it, it was none of his business. [Ignatyev] What action did you take to prevent a tragedy? [Telegin] As soon as the chief heard about the message, an operational staff was set up with the participation of representatives of the Internal Affairs Ministry, Federal Counterintelligence Service, prosecutor's office, and Committee for Civil Defense and Emergencies. We put extra guards on all important installations in the city. There was a joint session of this staff and the government of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The terrorists' conditions were accepted. We found the driver indicated by the criminals and handed him the money. The contact telephone number was read out on local television channel 12. An operation was carried out to search for and disable potential explosive devices. None has been found so far. The relevant services are ready at any time to take all the necessary steps to prevent a tragedy. The Transbaykal regional center of the Russian Federation Emergencies Ministry has been placed on red alert. A special team will come from Moscow to assist if necessary. A ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent asked mayor of Yakutsk, Aleksey Tomtosov, about the situation in the city. [Tomtosov] All is quiet in the city at this time, all institutions and enterprises are operating. It is probably an unsuccessful hoax. I hope there will be no explosions or terrorist acts. The criminals are just after the money. Nonetheless, it is not nice when these situations occur. We have tighter supervision at heating plants and other vital installations, since the winter has been unusually severe this time round. As I talk with you, the temperature is -41 outside. The Arctic winter has ended and the days are considerably longer. We are looking forward to some warmth. And we are hoping for better things. STOP PRESS: As is known, the terrorists set a deadline for the receipt of the money -- 2100 hours local time. That is 1500 hours in Moscow. We telephoned the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Security Ministry duty officer and he said that none of the bandits had arrived to collect the money. It had been decided to extend the operation until around 2300 hours local time. The Yakutsk prosecutor's office has instituted criminal proceedings for extortion.
