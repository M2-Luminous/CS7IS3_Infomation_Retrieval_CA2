He emphasized during the discussion: In order to study well Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, it is most important to consider the new circumstances and tasks, seriously implement the principle of integrating theory with practice, persistently combine the study of theories with the research on actual problems, and display a study style of integrating study with application and of studying for the purpose of application. Present at the discussion were vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, as well as members of the Central Military Commission Chi Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou. Six representatives of the trainees spoke during the discussion. They discussed such issues as how to thoroughly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building during the new period and the Central Military Commission's general and specific policies, how to step up Army building in an all-round way, and how to further strengthen army-government unity and army-people unity. After hearing their views, Jiang Zemin made an important speech. He first pointed out: To seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development and maintain stability is the general task set by the party Central Committee for the whole party and the whole country. The general task, set under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, reflects the fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities across the country. In order to study theories in light of reality, we must uphold the general task and consider it to be the greatest reality. High-ranking Army cadres should take the lead in ensuring that the orders of the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission reach all levels, and in doing all work well according to high and strict standards. High-ranking Army cadres should display a strong party spirit and a high degree of sense of organization and discipline, strictly enforce prohibitions, and obey orders in all actions. Jiang Zemin then pointed out: The Army should take a further step to carry forward fine traditions and step up the building of socialist spiritual civilization. It should uphold the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly and advocate the spirit of selfless dedication. It should deepen the campaigns to learn from Lei Feng, Su Ning, Xu Honggang, and other heroes and models; further advance and enrich revolutionary righteousness; foster good morality; and always keep the distinctive character of Red Army veterans, as well as the image of the People's Army. Jiang Zemin emphasized: To seek truth and do a solid work is the key to success in every work. Leading cadres must display a style of doing arduous and meticulous work, work steadily and make solid progress in every phase of the work. Leading cadres must do all they can to reduce activities at the higher level, constantly conduct investigation and study among troops of grass-roots units, and familiarize themselves with the actual situation of the troops, so that the policies and guidance formulated by them will be more effective and with clearer objectives. In the final analysis, to do a solid work means doing a solid work for grass-roots units. When a leading organ makes a policy decision or issues instructions, it must fully consider the reality and endurance of grass-roots units. We should create a concentrated atmosphere of doing a solid work throughout the Army, strictly carry out all the policy decisions of the Central Military Commission, and constantly push Army building forward in an all-round way. The training class is the second rotational training class for cadres holding regular corps-level or higher posts to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. It is run by the National Defense University at the request of the Central Military Commission and the three general departments. Zhu Dunfa, commandant of the National Defense University, chaired the discussion meeting. Li Wenqing, political commissar of the University, attended the meeting.
