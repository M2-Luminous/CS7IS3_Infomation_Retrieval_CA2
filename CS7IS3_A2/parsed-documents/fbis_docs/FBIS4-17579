Some five years ago hardly anyone knew its chairman's name, whereas now it has become a political office attracting universal attention. The only question now is: To what extent does the Central Bank perform its functions which, in the conditions of market economy, are always extremely simple -- to ensure the stability of the currency and the stability of the banking system. Stability of the currency means low inflation and a stable exchange rate. Stability of the banking system means the absence of defrauding of clients and the stability of banks. No country in the world has a stable currency with a weak economy. On the other hand, most countries with weak currencies have very weak economies. It is obvious that today we fall within the second group and the length of time we will spend in this group depends largely on the Central Bank. A sound way of boosting the Central Bank's activeness in this sphere has been devised in New Zealand -- the Central Bank chairman's salary there is linked to the level of inflation. The lower the inflation, the higher the salary; the higher the inflation, the lower the salary. There we have some food for thought. The Central Bank's independence is a key question. The Germans had a taste of hyperinflation in the wake of two world wars, and no Central Bank is stronger or more independent than Germany's. The independence question was widely discussed in our country in 1989-1990, but independence was in fact replaced by excessive dependence on parliament and -- frequently -- by irresponsibility. I recently read a report analyzing the link between the level of inflation since the beginning of this century and the Central Bank's status. Thus, we are a unique country where greater independence for the Central Bank means higher inflation. I am reluctant to draw the conclusion that we have not yet fully experienced the "wonders" of hyperinflation. I am in principle against any form of subordination of the Central Bank to either the government or the parliament. Both are equally bad, politicians should not interfere with professionals provided, of course, that they are professionals and are accurately performing their functions. In our case it is necessary to change the system of running the Central Bank so as to reduce the likelihood of dangerous and unlawful decisions. On the one hand, there must be a supervisory council -- a "political" organ comprising representatives of the banking system, industry, and trade, which would make key decisions of monetary, credit, and banking policy. On the other hand -- a board of directors as an organ for daily leadership of the bank's activity which would prepare all basic decisions. Collective and professional leadership should protect the economy against arbitrariness. Such a system exists in all countries in the world. Furthermore, it is necessary to render banking legislation as detailed as possible, and it must be operating directly, ruling out any free interpretation and precisely defining normatives and their limits, the instruments of policy, and the Central Bank's mutual relations with the government and other institutions of power. Nowadays hardly anyone in the country has any accurate knowledge about questions affecting the lives of each and every one of us. I fear that many people have an incorrect perception of the idea of a federal reserve system. The specific U.S. system is "federal" on the surface, but the United States does have a unified policy, all decisions are made in Washington and there can be no autonomization. Any experiments with a total restructuring of the banking system can bring more harm than good. On the other hand, it is time to say honestly that the processes now under way in several republics within Russia are extremely dangerous. The redesignation of the Central Bank's territorial organs as national banks, the adoption of their own banking laws, and the demands for greater autonomy and regionalization of monetary policy -- all these are signs of separatism. Therefore, there is perfect justification for creating territorial organs of the Central Bank in economic regions comprising several Federation components. Such organs would exercise greater powers and would be less dependent on local authorities. Another problem facing the Central Bank is its withdrawal from the sphere of commercial activities. This means liquidating its holdings in former Soviet banks abroad, the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia, the Bank for Labor Savings and Credit to the Population, and the Sovfintrade [expansion unknown]. It is impermissible to mix the functions of banking regulation with direct involvement in business dealings -- this creates a conflict of interests. Another aspect of the question is the persistent desire of former Gosbank [USSR State Bank] officials to remain involved in credit facilities for the economy under the cover of conducting operations through commercial banks. I am profoundly convinced that, for as long as central bankers engage in business, they will not tackle monetary and credit policy. It is obvious that the current law on the Central Bank is outdated and we can no longer remain satisfied with cosmetic amendments to the legislation. A new law on the Central Bank is needed.
