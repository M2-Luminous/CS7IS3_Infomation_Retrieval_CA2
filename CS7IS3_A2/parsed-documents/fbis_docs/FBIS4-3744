According to an official in charge of the Guangdong Provincial Copyrights Bureau, a joint campaign--launched by local copyright bureaus in cooperation with public security, industrial and commercial administration, press and publication administration, radio and television, and cultural departments -- targetting pirated CD's in Guangdong got underway at 1300 on 19 April. Thanks to careful preparations, the operation was successful. According to incomplete statistics, as of 1200 on 20 April, 1,657 vendors across the province were inspected, and 140,000 illegal CDs, 1,322 illegal laser discs, and 85,000 illegal video cassettes were seized. The campaign was launched with greater momentum in such prime target areas as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. In connection with the operation, Guangzhou unfolded a city-wide campaign named "Action Week for Implementing the Copyright Law and Protecting Intellectual Property" on 19 April. The official said: Since joining the "Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic works," the "Universal Copyright Convention," and the "Convention for the Protection of Phonograms," China has brought its copyright protection in line with the international copyrights protection system. The departments concerned in Guangdong take the protection of intellectual property rights seriously. Last year they launched six raids against illegal publications. They also unfolded a concentrated campaign to crack down on illegal audio-visual products toward the end of last year. At present, localities in Guangdong are continuing the crackdown in light of their respective local conditions. Relevant provincial authorities are formulating a series of measures to improve regular administration over the processing, duplication, wholesale, and marketing of audio-visual products. It has been learned that Guangdong will reorganize the 16 CD manufacturers in the province and place them under the jurisdiction of press and publication departments. The provincial copyrights bureau has formulated procedures for copyrights examination and registration in the manufacture of CDs. In the future, a system of "certificate first and license later" -- that is, an operation permit from relevant authorities must be obtained before a business license can be issued--will be introduced in the wholesaling and retailing of audio- visual products. Customs will also crack down harder on smuggling of audio-visual products to stop illegal products from entering China.
