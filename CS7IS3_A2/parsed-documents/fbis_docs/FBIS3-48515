We have strong desire for realization of the noble and genuine objectives of the recently-founded USDA. Active participation of the entire mass of people is now essential for realization of the following five objectives of the USDA; 1. Non-disintegration of the Union, 2. Non-disintegration of national unity, 3. Perpetuation of sovereignty, 4. Promotion and vitalization of national pride, and 5. Emergence of a prosperous, peaceful, and modern Union. These five objectives, in fact, reflect the basic welfare for the union nationals. It is therefore essential for the entire mass of people to wholeheartedly support the USDA and to earnestly take part for realization of the five objectives. All patriotic Myanmar [Burmese] people desire perpetuity of the union, consolidation of unity among union nationals, and perpetuation of sovereignty. As we all encountered and overcame suffering and misery owing to the loss of sovereignty, we all must safeguard our sovereignty sacrificing our lives not to fall into servitude again. The fourth objective of the USDA -- promotion and vitalization of national pride -- is specially essential for gradual fading away of the spirit of patriotism is inclined to incapacitate safeguarding of sovereignty. The entire mass of people must therefore cultivate the spirit of patriotism to a new height. Myanmar nationals cannot help speaking in praise of the USDA which is endowed with the objectives for emergence of an affluent modern nation. As all know, today, the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] is laying down foundations for emergence of an affluent modern nation. We all are to congratulate the SLORC for its farsighted efforts for all-round national development spending tens of millions of money in the education and health sectors, construction of roads, bridges, railroads, airports, parks, gardens, and various buildings. That is why, I would like to urge you to decide to wholeheartedly uphold the five objectives of the USDA. I would like to emphatically urge the entire mass of people to cooperate and provide support for consolidation and extensive formation of the USDA to be able to stand tall and firm as national front that will organize national movement with noble and genuine objectives. Esteemed people: The National Convention, which is comparable to the architect for emergence of a new democratic state in Myanmar history, has been held since 9 January 1993. On 16 September 1993, the national convention plenary session laid down 104 basic principles for formulating state fundamental principles to be incorporated into the state constitution. Every observer will find vividly that all these 104 basic principles are mirror of the welfare of the Union of Myanmar [Burma] and union nationals in all angles at present and in future. Evidently, 39 of the 104 basic principles are found to be laid down as fundamental principles. They are: 1. Non-disintegration of the union, 2. Non-disintegration of national solidarity, 3. Perpetuation of sovereignty, 4. Flourishing of a genuine multiparty democracy system, 5. Further burgeoning of the noblest and worthiest of worldly values namely justice, liberty, and equality in the state, 6.

Sovereign power of the state is derived from the citizens and is in force in the whole country, 12. The three branches of state power, namely -- legislative, executive, and judicial, are separated as much as possible and exert reciprocal control, check, and balance among themselves, 13. The three branches of state power so separated are distributed among Pyidaungsu, regions, states, and self-administered areas, 14. The legislative power of the state is distributed among the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw [parliament], Region Hluttaws, and State Hluttaws; legislative power stipulated by the constitution shall be distributed to self-administered areas, 15. The chief executive of the state is the president of the state, 16. The executive power of the state is distributed among the administrative organs of Pyidaungsu, regions and states; self-administrative power shall be distributed to self-administered areas as stipulated by the state constitution, 17. The judicial power of the state is distributed among Pyidaungsu Taya Hluttaw [Supreme Court], Region Taya Hluttaw [Region High Court], State Taya Hluttaw [State High Court] and law courts at different levels including law courts of self- administered areas, 18. The tatmadaw is strong, modern, and must be the sole existing tatmadaw, 19. The defence services commander-in-chief is the supreme commander of all armed forces, 20. All persons born of parents both of whom are nationals are citizens; all persons who have become citizens in accord with law on the date the state constitution comes into force are citizens; and citizenship, naturalization, and revocation of citizenship shall be prescribed by law, 21. Every citizen shall enjoy rights of equality, rights of liberty and rights of justice etc. as prescribed in the state constitution, 22. The state shall help for development, consolidation, and preservation of national culture, 23. The state is the ultimate owner of all the land, and natural resources above and below the ground, above and beneath the waters, and in the atmosphere within its territorial boundary, 24. The state shall enact necessary laws to supervise economic forces' extraction and utilization of state-owned natural resources, 25. The state practices independent, active, and nonaligned foreign policy, aims at world peace and friendly relations with nations, and upholds the principles of peaceful coexistence among nations, 26.

The state shall strive to imbue youths with strong and dynamic patriotic spirit, correct way of thinking and the five noble strengths, 33. The state shall care for mothers and children, orphans, fallen tatmadaw servicemen's children, the old and the infirm, and the disabled, 34. The state shall arrange for disabled tatmadaw servicemen to be able to make a respectable livelihood and get free vocational training, 35.

Voters concerned shall have the right, in accord with provisions of the state constitution, to recall elected people's representatives, and, 39. The state shall enact necessary law for systematic formation of political parties for flourishing of genuine multiparty democracy system. In addition to these 39 basic principles, the remaining 65 are also of importance in respective chapters. We must, therefore, treasure the 104 basic principles for formulating principles as firm foundation for our much desired new democratic state. All of us are responsible for protecting these 104 basic principles against any obstruction and deviation. It is encouraging that these 104 basic principles were laid down as much as possible to reflect the six objectives of the National Convention: 1. Non-disintegration of the union, 2. Non-disintegration of national solidarity, 3. Perpetuation of sovereignty, 4. For a genuine multiparty democracy system to flourish, 5. For further burgeoning of the noblest and worthiest of worldly values namely justice, liberty, and equality, and, 6. For the tatmadaw to be able to participate in the national political leadership role of the future state. All desire to safeguard the basic principles for formulating principles without losing sight of them and wish the national convention success after procuring detailed suggestions when it resumes. Esteemed people: Now is the time for all nationals to make utmost efforts for national development and emergence of an affluent modern nation accepting it as a national task. As the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] is based on consolidated, united tatmadaw, it is practically and effectively striving for the welfare of the state and the people in conformity with its fine traditions. In the present era of changing the economic, social, and political spheres, it is essential for the entire mass of people to actively take part in their respective roles zealously and intensively. Peasants have to strive for boosting production of quality crops and workers on their part have to prevent loss and wastage and be free from graft while making concerted efforts for boosting production of their factories and mills. All are urged to maintain roads and bridges, dams and reservoirs, schools, hospitals, parks and gardens, and buildings built by the state in various parts of the country. So also, I would like to urge the entire mass of people to participate actively in the state's short-term and long-term projects for building a modern, developed country. As the saying "Make hay while the sun shines" goes, it is opportune for armed groups to abandon their incurred stand and return to the legal fold, and to join hands with the state in all round development tasks. The top national objective of the SLORC is "Our three main national causes". It is essential for non-disintegration of the union, non-disintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of sovereignty. Like the Myanmar [Burmese] saying "If the cattle are scattered the tiger seizes them", disunity among union nationals is the opportune state for neocolonialists and the state and the people may suffer low. All nationals have to uphold and cherish the fine traditions of the forefathers who defended the state against the dangers through unity among national races and lived through weal or woe. Now it is time to promote and vitalize these fine traditions of our forefathers. From this mass meeting, all armed groups are urged to accept the invitation of the SLORC and return to the legal fold. Esteemed people: The Union of Myanmar [Burma] is an independent and sovereign state. As all know, Myanmar had to strive hard in national freedom battles for over a hundred years to become an independent state. In conformity with an independent, sovereign state, Myanmar always upholds the principles of peaceful coexistence among nations. Governments of the Union of Myanmar have always taken a constructive stand in international affairs and supported efforts for world peace, prevention of outbreak of wars, and general and total disarmament. It is undeniable that Myanmar has never intended and attempted to work against the interests of any other country. Myanmar expects reciprocal, sincere relations from every nation. Under prevailing political condition, the neocolonialists have been making false allegations against Myanmar with the aim of enabling their axe handles [henchmen] to gain power. The traitor axe handles, who have dealings with neocolonialist groups on economic grounds, have cooked up stories to tarnish the dignity of Myanmar. These are the acts to ignore and insult the sovereignty of our state. It is human nature that a person or an organization or a nation is liable to do good or bad. Under unavoidable circumstances, strength is applied in some matters. Bitter quinine has to be used to banish malaria though one knows it is too bitter. Similarly, there are restrictions on the rights of freedom to ensure prevalence of peace and tranquillity and for non-disintegration of national unity. As the SLORC strives for prevalence of peace and tranquillity and law and order, crime has diminished considerably. Every educated person understands that for flourishing of genuine democracy, the state is laying down firm foundation for the community. Esteemed people: In conclusion, I would like to emphatically urge all patriotic nationals at this mass rally sponsored by the Yangon [Rangoon] Division Union Solidarity and Development Association [USDA]; -- to support the 104 basic principles laid down by the National Convention, -- to uphold the five objectives of the USDA, -- for the armed groups to return to the legal fold and actively take part in all round national development tasks, -- to prevent subversions at home and abroad that would disrupt perpetuation of sovereignty, -- to strive hard for emergence of affluent nation as a national task, and, -- to make concerted efforts for consolidation of Union Solidarity and Development Associations.
