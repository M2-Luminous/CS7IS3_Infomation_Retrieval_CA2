They also agreed that the abolition of sanctions against the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] must be seriously examined, given that the Serbian side has met all conditions regarding this plan. Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic also took part in the talks that lasted two and a half hours. In a statement for the press, Papoulias assessed the talks as useful and said his impression was that he would "return" to his colleagues in the EU "with very nice messages." Simic said that the talks were "exceptionally open and fruitful." "The thinking prevailed during the talks that any form of discrimination at this stage--when one of the sides involved in the conflict is being pushed aside--cannot politically be either appropriate or effective," stressed Simic. "The EU plan remains in force and I think that this plan is the core of any new initiative or action," said Papoulias. In this context "the question of abolishing the sanctions is very significant," he said, adding that the stand of Greece on this subject was well-known and Greece was sticking by it. Papoulias explained that Greece, as the chairman of the EU Council of Ministers, ought to reassure its partners that the question of sanctions should be examined both in general and in the case of Yugoslavia, in particular. "If in principle the abolition of the sanctions contributes to a peaceful settlement of this crisis, this question ought to be examined seriously," the Greek foreign minister pointed out. "Yugoslavia was particularly pleased with the fact that in Greece, which is the current president of the European Union, our view on the futility of the sanctions and the damage that the sanctions have inflicted on the neighboring countries and the entire Balkan Peninsula enjoys support," Simic stressed. "It is well-known that the Serb side has fully complied with all the EU conditions that were set several months ago, including the territorial concessions in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he recalled, "but the EU reneged on its obligation to alleviate or lift the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia." The Yugoslav deputy prime minister said that "the application of sanctions against anyone at the end of 20th century is an anachronistic act." "In our opinion the only way to restore a permanent peace is to apply those democratic principles advocated by Greece since the very outset of the crisis on the territory of former Yugoslavia," Simic said. According to him, these are three elementary principles: a cessation of all hostilities, negotiations that have to be based on democratic principles, and respect of the will of all three sides and the search for a solution that will not be to the detriment of any of the warring sides. Papoulias announced that the Bosnian crisis will be the main topic of a EU ministerial meeting on 26th and 27th March in Athens, adding that details will be discussed at the meeting and decisions adopted "as required by the current situation." Asked about Greece's reaction to Turkey's attempts to send its forces to former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Papoulias reiterated his country's well-known position that neighboring countries should not send their troops as peacekeepers. However, violations of this principle--accepted by both NATO and the European Union--would create a new situation and in such a case Greece would reach new decisions aimed at defending national and broader regional interests, Papoulias explained. Asked whether relations with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] were discussed, Papoulias replied that "the issue of relations with the Skopje republic was reviewed from all angles. Mr. Milosevic--and this is no secret--is expressing great interest in the resolution of the crisis in the relations between Greece and Skopje," he said. The talks also focused on the overall situation created by the meddling of nonBalkan countries in the Balkan crisis. "All who wish to contribute to a peaceful resolution are welcome, but they should not complicate matters even further," Papoulias said. Deputy Prime Minister Simic added that the talks also covered bilateral issues and the development of the traditionally good relations between Greece and Yugoslavia. He thanked Papoulias for his personal contribution to the resolution of the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Greek Government "which acknowledged political reality and advocated principles in the spirit of ancient Greece" since the beginning of the crisis in the region of former Yugoslavia. After a luncheon with his hosts, the Greek foreign minister left Belgrade for Athens.
