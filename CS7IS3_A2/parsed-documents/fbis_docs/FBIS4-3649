In an interview with the newspaper, Goh Chok Tong, who was on a three-day visit in Britain, warned that a break in Sino-U.S. relations over the question would have severe long-term consequences for the world, because China would interpret the U.S. action as an attempt to limit its growth and would remember it for a long time. But he emphasized that he did not foresee a fracture in relations between the two countries because he did not expect President Clinton to revoke China's most-favored-nation status when it comes up for annual renewal in June. "The U.S. at the end of the day will be rather pragmatic," he said. "China is a huge export market for the U.S.. U.S. business people are putting pressure on the administration that you can only make a point on human rights thus far and beyond that the Chinese are not going to move." If there were a break between China and the U.S., the prime minister said, Singapore would continue to invest in China. "The market would be open to those who trade with China," he added. And China will continue to grow because in China, he said, "the resources are generated internally, not like the former Soviet Union which depends on (other countries) for resources." Goh Chok Tong was in London to spearhead a marketing effort for Singapore's "External Wing" policy, under which it is building industrial parks in other Asian countries and wants foreign companies to set up plants in them while also basing part of the operation in Singapore.
