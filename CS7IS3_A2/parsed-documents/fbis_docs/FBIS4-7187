I was appointed to the post of minister of international trade and industry. First, I would like to express my appreciation for the guidance given to me when I was agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister. As you know, we are in a very severe economic situation and have to deal with many issues. We need to play a responsible economic role in the international arena to improve our reliability. Moreover, we need to deal with other issues as well -- including the issue of economic cooperation between Japan and the United States, and the issue of easing government regulations. Now that I have been appointed to the post of minister of international trade and industry, I will use all my energy to deal with these issues. While seeking people's understanding, I will make strenuous efforts to accomplish these tasks. [Unidentified reporter] Some people are saying that the new administration will have difficulties in conducting state affairs and will be short-lived because it is backed by a minority ruling coalition. Can you explain what you think of this situation? [Hata] I think our major task is to gain support from the people as we make a series of movements for political reform and other matters. We need to do that by implementing policies which will be understood and supported by the people. The opposition parties, if they deal with various matters in a gentlemanly manner, will also be able to gain understanding and support from the people as healthy opposition parties. While settling these issues, I think we have to build a stable foundation to enable the new cabinet to fulfill the responsibilities it is expected to fulfill. [Unidentified reporter] It seems that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is in a chaotic situation because former MITI Minister Kumagai fired an influential deputy MITI bureau chief. How are you going to mend the situation within MITI? [Hata] I do not know the details. However, the purpose of personnel reshuffle is, in a way, to renew people's minds. I think such a purpose is being achieved.
