The offer, repeating a similar one made Monday, came hours after the European Commission sent a letter to Athens demanding an explanation for the controversial trade blockade it imposed last week against the Former Yugoslav Republic. Crvenkoski said Skopje had never called for an end to negotiations with Athens and was "ready to continue them at any time." Crvenkoski, who is on a two-day official visit to the Netherlands, said his country was ready to talk over "all aspects of bilateral relations" to try to normalise links. "Nothing can be ruled out," he added. The EC, currently headed by Greece in the revolving six-month presidency, is using a mixture of threats and offers of mediation to get Athens to abandon its hard-line policy, which poses an unprecedented problem for the 12-country union. Tuesday's letter started a procedure which could end with the executive Commission taking Athens to the European Court of Justice. The letter to Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, signed by Commission President Jacques Delors, expressed "serious concern about the legality of the measures taken by the Greek Government" and asked it to indicate what measures it would take to resolve the situation. Athens last week blocked all trade to Macedonia [the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] through the northeastern Greek port of Salonika, which handles most of the country's imports including oil, and subsequently tightened the blockade to include frontier posts. Greece justified the move by citing Macedonia's "continual provocations and growing irredentist intransigence" and claims that Macedonia has territorial ambitions in the northern Greek province of the same name. Most of Greece's European Community partners recognised Macedonia before Greece took over the EC presidency in January.
