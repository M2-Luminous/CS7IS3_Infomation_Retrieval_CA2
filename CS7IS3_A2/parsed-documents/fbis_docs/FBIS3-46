Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-18Mar94-Russia Republics Give Varied Responses To Moscow On Local Constitutions SUMMARY President Boris Yeltsin continues to face serious opposition from certain regions in his efforts to define a division of central and local authority. Several republics failed to approve the federal constitution in the 12 December referendum and have since taken fresh steps toward enacting republic constitutions that claim greater powers for local authorities. In the case of Tatarstan, Moscow has dealt with the conflict by signing a bilateral treaty after prolonged negotiations, but it is not yet clear if Moscow is willing to conclude such treaties with other republics. END SUMMARY Rejection of the federal constitution by voters in several republics in the 12 December referendum and recent moves to approve republic constitutions that assert regional authority in ways incompatible with the Federation constitution demonstrate that the republics' constitutional conflict with Moscow remains a serious issue: -- The Tuvan republic held a referendum to approve the republic's constitution on 12 December, the same day as the referendum on the federal constitution. While the Tuvan constitution, approved by 53.9 percent of the voters in the referendum, formally acknowledges the republic to be part of the Russian Federation (Ostankino TV, 27 October 1993), it also "envisages the right to self-determination" (ITAR-TASS, 16 December 1993). It provides for a 32-member republic parliament, the Supreme Hural, whose membership was also elected on 12 December. The republic's constitution gives parliament authority to decide "problems of war and peace, borders," and to suspend Russian Federation legislative acts which "go beyond the powers envisaged by the constitution of the Russian Federation, the federal treaty or other agreements" (ITAR-TASS, 16 December 1993). Only 30.5 percent of Tuvan voters approved the federal constitution on 12 December. -- The constitution of the republic of Bashkortostan, adopted on 24 December 1993 by 206 out of 227 republic Supreme Soviet deputies (Segodnya, 28 December 1993; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 December 1993), claims precedence over the federal constitution, at least in some provisions. The Bashkortostan constitution provides that the republic will voluntarily yield to Moscow certain powers pertaining to interstate relations under terms of an as yet to be negotiated treaty with the Russian Federation but retain authority over its judicial system and prosecutor's office, independent foreign economic and foreign policy affairs, and entrance into interstate associations (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 28 December 1993). The republic's constitution also asserts "the land, its contents, natural wealth, and other natural resources on its territory" to be "the property of its multinational people" (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 December 1993). Fifty-three percent of the Bashkortostan electorate voted against the federal constitution in the 12 December referendum (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 16 December). -- Tatarstan also rejected the federal constitution on 12 December as fewer than fourteen percent of the republic's electorate participated in the referendum (Izvestiya, 14 December 1993). In November 1992, the republic Supreme Soviet approved a republic constitution that states that Tatarstan's laws "take precedence throughout its territory, unless they conflict with international commitments of the republic," and that the republic constitution "is an act of the highest legal force of direct effect" and declares the republic a "sovereign state" and "subject of international law" (Sovetskaya Tatariya, 13 December 1992). The constitution associates the republic with the Russian Federation only within the parameters of a bilateral treaty that divides Federation and republic authority (see box) (Interfax, 6 November 1992). Moscow is also engaged in a constitutional conflict with Sverdlovsk oblast over the oblast's bid to claim republic status. Under the leadership of former oblast Governor Eduard Rossel, residents of the Sverdlovsk region are seeking formal recognition for the Urals republic, favored by 83 percent of voters (with a 55 percent voter turnout) in a 25 April 1993 non-binding referendum (Interfax, 1 July 1993) and proclaimed by a decision of the oblast soviet (Izvestiya, 3 July 1993). Despite being fired by Yeltsin for backing the move to claim republic status, Rossel was given a vote of confidence as 61.87 percent of the Sverdlovsk Oblast electorate endorsed him for a seat in the Federation Council (Interfax, 13 December 1993). Rossel has succeeded in getting a debate on approval of the constitution of the Urals Republic on the Federation Council's agenda (Izvestiya, 10 February). Claiming that the establishment of the Urals Republic and adoption of its constitution were made "in full conformity" with the federal constitution, Rossel asserted he is "ready" to appeal to the Constitutional Court to approve the republic constitution (ITAR-TASS, 17 January). Tatarstan Negotiations Moscow's response to the conflict with Tatarstan has been to engage in protracted negotiations with the republic, talks which have ended in mutual agreement on a treaty. Culminating three years of negotiations with Kazan, Moscow's future relations with the republic will be based on the bilateral "Treaty on the Mutual Delegation of Authority and Terms of Reference," signed on 15 February by Yeltsin and Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev (ITAR-TASS, 15 February) (See Box). The Moscow-Kazan bilateral treaty is supplemented by twelve intergovernmental agreements. According to Kommersant-Daily, the agreements concern oil production, ownership matters, defense industries, customs, transportation of oil products, environmental cooperation, education, the budget, banking system, foreign economic activity, crime, and military organization (5 February). Treaty as a Model Since the signing of the Russia-Tatarstan bilateral treaty, Yeltsin and Shakhray have hailed the treaty as a "precedent" for negotiating similar agreements with other components: -- Following the treaty signing, Yeltsin stressed that "treaties of this kind are, basically, the sole constitutional way of removing contradictions between the Russian Federation constitution and republic constitutions in a civilized way, without twisting anyone's arm" (ITAR-TASS, 15 February). -- Shakhray was quoted as saying that "there is a legal and economic possibility of the conclusion of treaties similar to that with Tataria with each component of the Russian Federation," based on "Article 11 of the Constitution . . . clause 3 of which says that the terms of reference shall be delineated "by this constitution and the Federal and other treaties" (Segodnya, 25 February). According to a 15 February Interfax report, Shakhray would like to see Federal Assembly adoption of a law on power- sharing as a way of regulating the process. Detractors characterize the Russia-Tatarstan treaty as a threat to federalism, saying it will complicate future center-regional relations and unacceptably weaken the center: -- Sergey Baburin, State Duma deputy and leader of the unregistered "Russian Way" faction, viewed the treaty as a threat to federalism and submitted a Duma proposal "On Guarantees of the Federal System and Provision for Territorial Integrity of the Russian Federation On Account of the Signing of the Treaty with Tatarstan," which apparently failed for lack of votes. Explaining his proposal, Baburin was quoted as saying that "for the first time the state signed a treaty with a part of itself" and that the treaty presents "a great danger because it means the state's transition to a confederative system" (Interfax, 16 February). -- In a 16 February article, Segodnya commentator Vladimir Todres suggested that pursuing separate treaties for each region would produce gridlock and confusion. He wrote, "Russia has a further 87 regions, not counting Chechnya. The question "If the Tatars can do it, why can't we?" is quite natural. Why should the other regional leaders swallow this treaty in silence?" Other Republics While Moscow and Kazan were putting the finishing touches on the treaty, Moscow still appeared to be pressing the other republics to revise their constitutions, remaining noncommital on a willingness to conclude other treaties. In the case of at least one republic, Bashkortostan, Moscow appears to have opened negotiations on a set of agreements similar to those it signed with Tatarstan. According to republic Prime Minister Anatoliy Kopsov, the signing of the treaty with Tatarstan "gave the latest impetus" to the resumption of talks between Moscow and Bashkortostan. He said that the negotiators were working on a treaty and a package of bilateral economic, social, and cultural agreements, some of which are "practically ready for signing" (Interfax, 17 March). Moscow officials have not been observed to comment on these negotiations. Before the Moscow-Kazan treaty signing, Moscow urged constitutional reform in a unilateral effort to rein in the regions. Members of the Council of Heads of Administrations under President Yeltsin had reportedly advised the formation of a commission that would bring the constitutions of republics "in line" with the federal constitution. The Council cited "a number of norms" in which component constitutions "contradict" the federation's. Nikolay Medvedev, head of the presidential Administration's Directorate for Work with the Territories, placed "special emphasis" on twelve republics that still have "old" constitutions (See Note 1), and five newly established republics, Adygey, Altai, Ingushetia, Karachayevo-Cherkessia, and Khakassiya, which do not yet have their own constitutions (Interfax, 6 January; Russian Television, 6 January). (Note 1) To illustrate his point, Medvedev reportedly cited the republic of Mordovia, which "by its constitution is still a soviet socialist republic" (Interfax, 6 January). The Mordovian SSR has since been renamed the Republic of Mordovia (Ostankino TV, 26 January). Republics' Response To date, only a few republics have signaled willingness to amend their draft constitutions in response to Moscow's objections and the criticism from the Council of Heads of Administrations: -- In its 11 January issue, Izvestiya reported that the Kabardino-Balkar Republic's parliament approved a package of proposals from republic President Valeriy Kokov to "alter" and "supplement" the republic constitution so that it complies with the federal constitution. -- According to a 19 February Nezavisimaya Gazeta article, the Komi Republic constitution "corresponds" with the federal constitution. Adopted on 17 February by a majority vote of the republic Supreme Soviet, the republic constitution proclaims Komi as a sovereign formation within the Russian Federation (Radio Rossii, 17 February). According to Russian TV, even before its adoption the draft constitution for the Komi Republic was recognized as an attempt to incorporate "the principles of territorial sovereignty on the basis of Russian federalism" (24 January). -- In a 27 February referendum, 97.6 percent of voters approved the constitution of Ingushetia, which declares the republic a "democratic, rule-of-law state, part of the Russian Federation on a treaty basis" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 2 March). Employees of the republic Justice Ministry had underscored the need to put the Ingush constitution in line with the federal constitution before the scheduled referendum (ITAR-TASS, 23 January). Ingushetia's conciliatory response may be linked to the federation government's mediating role in an Ingush-North Ossetian territorial dispute as an attempt to gain the federation government's favor. -- The republic of Buryatia reportedly passed a new constitution that appears to follow the model set by Tatarstan. Having received a unanimous vote of confidence by the republic Supreme Soviet, Buryatia's constitution reportedly states that the republic is a "sovereign, democratic, law-governed state within the Russian Federation," and that its relations with Moscow will be "built on a constitutional, treaty-based foundation" (Ostankino TV, 22 February). -- According to republic Supreme Soviet First Deputy Chairman Bagaudin Akhmedov, the new constitution of Dagestan calls for "the building of a single, sovereign, democratic state within the Russian Federation (Segodnya, 1 March). Implications Despite Yeltsin's and Shakhray's endorsements of the Moscow-Kazan bilateral treaty as a model, it is not clear that Moscow is actually prepared to conclude similar treaties with the other republics. Although Shakhray has reemerged as a player in nationality affairs after a period of relative eclipse, his position within the government remains clouded, somewhat diluting the value of his endorsement. The other republics, probably viewing the treaty as a success for Kazan, will likely press Moscow to give them a similar deal. Box The Moscow-Kazan Treaty: Who won? Who lost? Officials have made conflicting statements on the specifics on the bilateral treaty, but media reportage suggests that both Russia and Tatarstan made concessions in the treaty's final draft: -- Although Tatarstan may now "take part in international relations and foreign economic activity" (ITAR-TASS, 15 February) and--according to republic President Mintimer Shaymiyev--the treaty "recognizes the right to self-determination . . . and defense of sovereignty" (ITAR-TASS, 16 February), the words sovereign state" and "subject of international law" were reportedly removed from the treaty draft (Krasnaya Zvezda, 17 February). -- The treaty reportedly gives Tatarstan "exclusive" ownership and use of the land on its territory and its contents, and all property (ITAR-TASS, 16 February). -- According to a 17 February Krasnaya Zvezda article, Tatarstan reportedly had to abandon its plans to establish a "single- channel" taxation system in favor of the "general federal scheme." -- Although Shaymiyev has reportedly described the outcome of the negotiations as "a change in [Tatarstan's] status . . . within Russia" (Krasnaya Zvezda, 17 February), Minister of Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray has countered that the treaty "provides neither for upgrading nor for downgrading the status of Tatarstan" (Interfax, 18 February). Shaymiyev stated that the Moscow-Kazan treaty will not have to be ratified, as the federal and Tatarstan constitutions only require parliamentary ratification of international treaties (Kazanskiye Vedomosti, 22 February).
