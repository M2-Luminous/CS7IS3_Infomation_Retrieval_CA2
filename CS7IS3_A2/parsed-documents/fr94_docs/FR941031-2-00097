FR941031-2-00097 FR941031-2-00069 (4) The procedures and documentation requirements are sufficiently specific to avoid duplication of activities. At the same time, the procedures establish a process that will facilitate investigations of complaints against employers and enforcement of sanctions where necessary. The regulations set forth a process which: (1) requires attestations that are specific with respect to employer statements and promises; (2) limits the Department's review of an attestation to a simple check to assure that it is signed, completed, contains no obvious inaccuracies, and is not, on its face, inconsistent with the documentation submitted in support thereof; (3) describes the information that employers must retain to document the validity of their statements; and (4) establishes a system for the receipt of complaints, and their investigation and disposition, including the imposition of penalties where warranted. (5) Section 258 of the INA prohibits the use of alien crewmembers to perform longshore activity in U.S. ports with five exceptions as follows: (a) Where the vessel's country of registration does not prohibit U.S. crewmembers from performing longshore work in that country's ports and nationals of a country which does not prohibit U.S. crewmembers from performing longshore work in that country's ports hold a majority of the ownership interest in the vessel; (b) Where there is in effect in a local port one or more collective bargaining agreement(s), each covering at least 30 percent of the longshore workers at a particular port and each permitting the activity to be performed by alien crewmembers; (c) Where there is no collective bargaining agreement covering at least 30 percent of the longshore workers and an attestation has been filed with the Department which states that the use of alien crewmembers to perform longshore work is permitted under the prevailing practice of the port, that the use of alien crewmembers is not during a strike or lockout, that such use is not intended or designed to influence the election of a collective bargaining representative, and that notice has been provided to longshore workers at the port; (d) Where the activity is performed with the use of automated self-unloading conveyor belts or vacuum-actuated systems; provided that, the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) has not found that an attestation is required because it was not the prevailing practice to utilize alien crewmembers to perform the activity or because the activity was performed during a strike or lockout or in order to influence the election of a collective bargaining representative; and (e) Where the longshore work is to be performed at a particular location in the State of Alaska and an attestation with accompanying documentation has been filed with the Department of Labor attesting that, among other things, before using alien crewmen to perform the activity specified in the attestation, the employer will make a bona fide request for and employ United States longshore workers who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers from contract stevedoring companies, labor organizations recognized as exclusive bargaining representatives of United States longshore workers, and private dock operators. In developing the joint interim final regulations to implement Section 258 of the INA at 20 CFR part 655, subparts F and G, and at 29 CFR part 505, subparts F and G, the Department has carefully considered the issues pertinent to the filing of attestations by employers to use alien crewmembers to perform longshore activities in the State of Alaska. The Department proposes to review an attestation only to ensure that it is timely, completed properly, includes the required documentation, and that the documentation is not, on its face, inconsistent with the attestation. This interim final rule does not include an administrative appeals process within ETA for attestations. When an attestation is returned because it is untimely, improperly completed, or lacking proper documentation, an employer may resubmit another attestation to the Department. Attestations which are accepted by ETA may be objected to by any aggrieved party through the complaint process under subpart G, and procedures for investigation, hearing and appeal are provided therein. In the event a complaint is filed with the Department, the employer must have sufficient documentation available on file at the place of business of its U.S. agent to meet the burden of proof for the validity of each attestation element. Documentation submitted or retained pursuant to this part shall either be in English or be accompanied by an English translation. The Department believes that this is consistent with the statute's intent for a streamlined attestation system for filing and a complaint-driven process for the enforcement of the law's sanctions for violators. (6) The Department has notified the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, and made the certification pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
