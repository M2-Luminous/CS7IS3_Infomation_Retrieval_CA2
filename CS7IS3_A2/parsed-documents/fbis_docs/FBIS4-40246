Deputies rejected the amendments providing for subordination of the local authorities to the Ukrainian president. Observers in Kiev say that this limited the powers of the president at a local level. In accordance with the law, the heads of the local bodies will be subordinated only to the cabinet of ministers and to the Councils of a higher authority. On 26 June (after the local elections) the powers of the regional administrations will be transferred to the chairmen and executive committees of the Councils. The Councils' deputies will have the right to be a part of the local executive power. A member of the parliamentary commission on legal policy, Sergey Sobolev, called on the Ukrainian president not to sign this law since, he said, it contradicted the Ukrainian Constitution. In accordance with provision 89 of the Constitution, deputies of the local councils cannot be members of the executive committees.
