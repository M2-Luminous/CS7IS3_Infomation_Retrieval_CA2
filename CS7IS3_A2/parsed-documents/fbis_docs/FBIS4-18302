"I find it absolutely right, and I welcome the ruling of Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein," Oymen said on Saarland radio on Saturday [2 April]. The Kurds who are to be deported from Germany are neither threatened by capital punishment nor torture in Turkey, Oymen said. Turkey is a "law-governed state just like Germany." In the last 10 years, the Turkish Parliament has not passed a single death sentence. Moreover, Turkey is a member of the European Anti-Torture Convention, Oymen stated.
