FR941103-2-00024 FR941103-2-00017 [Docket Nos. CP94&hyph;267&hyph;000 and CP94&hyph;267&hyph;001] NorAm Gas Transmission Co.; Availability of the Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Line F Replacement Project October 28, 1994. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC of Commission) has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) on the natural gas facilities proposed by NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT) in the above-referenced dockets. The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the proposed Line F Replacement Project including: •Construction of about 90.9 miles of 20-inch-diameter pipeline to replace about 87 miles of 20-inch-diameter pipeline on Line F in Caddo, Bossier, Webster, Claiborne, Lincoln, Union, and Ouachita Parishes, Louisiana; •Rerouting a portion of Line F included in the above 90.9 miles of replacement pipeline to connect Line F directly to the Ruston Compressor Station in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana; •Reclassification of about 8.2 miles of Line F as a low-pressure gas supply line and operate it as part of Line F&hyph;1&hyph;F in Caddo Parish, Louisiana; •Abandonment of Line 1&hyph;F in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, a 0.8-mile-long, 20-inch-diameter storage line no longer needed after the reroute of Line F; •Abandonment of Line FT&hyph;5 in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, a 0.9-mile-long, 10-inch-diameter gas supply line, no longer needed after the reroute of Line F; •Construction of 10 new metering and regulating facilities at various locations on Line F; •Abandonment of 66 delivery taps on Lines F, 1&hyph;F, and FT&hyph;5 installed to deliver gas to rural customers served by Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company; •Construction of about 2.2 miles of 20-inch-diameter pipeline (Line ACT&hyph;4) in Hot Spring County, Arkansas; •Installation of one 2,200-horsepower compressor unit and the rearrangement and upgrading of existing facilities at the existing Ruston Compressor Station in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana; •Abandonment of about 0.4 mile of Line S in Harrison County, Texas; and •Uprating the maximum allowable operating pressure on NGT's Line S from 880 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) to 930 psi in Harrison County, Texas; Caddo, Bossier, and Webster Parishes, Louisiana; and Columbia County, Arkansas. NGT indicates that the Line F Replacement Project would enhance the safety, reliability, and efficiency of its pipeline system. The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC and is available for public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Room 3104, Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of this EA have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, newspapers, and parties to this proceeding. A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, Environmental Project Manager, Environmental Review and Compliance Branch I, Office of Pipeline Regulation, Room 7312, PR&hyph;11.1, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;0325. Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket Nos. CP94&hyph;267&hyph;000 and &hyph;001 and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426. Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than November 28, 1994 to ensure consideration before a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should also be sent to Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, Environmental Project Manager, Room 7312 at the above address. Comments will be considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commentor a party to the proceeding. Any person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures (18 CFR 385.214). The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file late interventions must show good cause, as required by Section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your comments considered. Additional information about this project is available from Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, Environmental Project Manager. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
