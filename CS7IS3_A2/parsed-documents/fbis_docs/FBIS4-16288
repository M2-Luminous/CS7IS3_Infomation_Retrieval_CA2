Russia has not rescinded in the form demanded by Latvia the presidential directive on the creation of a military base on Latvian territory. The two presidents were to have met 20 April. The meeting could have brought Latvia and Russia closer together and smoothed over some political problems. In mid-March agreements on the troop withdrawal from Latvia, social guarantees for military pensioners, and the status of the radar station at Skrunda were initialed. The ruling coalition has had difficulty in getting the documents ratified in the Saeima, fending off virulent opposition from the national radical opposition, which considers the agreements a "betrayal" and a "threat to our independence." Now even the agreements' supporters are claiming that there can be no question of ratifying them in their previous form. The agreement on Russian military pensioners is under threat. An accord had previously been reached to the effect that Russian military pensioners transferred to the reserve before 1992 could stay in Latvia. There are currently around 21,000 of them in the republic, and more than one-half are over 60. Patriots are calling for changes to the composition of the delegation to the talks with Russia and for those talks to be conducted in a tougher and more demanding way. Radicals are calling in several publications for violent action against the "occupiers" and "colonialists" and for the overthrow of the current authorities.
