FR940208-2-00180 FR940208-2-00093 Rule 62, formerly rule 55, provides that all committee orders and decisions require a majority vote. Rule 63, which amends former rule 57, provides for Notices of Motion requesting dismissal. Subrule 63(1) provides that a committee may terminate an extraordinary challenge proceeding where a motion requesting dismissal of the proceeding has been filed. Subrule 63(2) has been amended to remove the requirement for an order of the committee where termination is by consent of all participants. The subrule now provides that an extraordinary challenge proceeding is terminated when all participants consent to dismissal and an affidavit to that effect is filed. Rule 64, formerly rule 58, sets out three alternative actions which a committee may take on a final decision. The rule has been amended to include the possibility of a remand in a proceeding based on a Request for Extraordinary Challenge Committee filed under Article 1904.13(a)(i) of the Agreement. Rules 65 to 67 Rules 65 to 67 provide for the completion of extraordinary challenge proceedings. Rule 65 amends former rule 59 to provide that publication of a Notice of Termination on termination of an extraordinary challenge proceeding by consent occurs on the day after the day on which all requirements under subrule 63(2) are met, given that termination on consent no longer requires issuance of an order by the committee. Rule 66, formerly rule 60, provides for publication of a Notice of Completion of Extraordinary Challenge on issuance of a final decision by a committee. Subrule 60(c) has been amended to provide that on remand to a panel, it is the Secretary, not the panel as in the former rule, who gives notice to the committee that the panel has taken action not inconsistent with the decision of the committee. Rule 67, formerly rule 61, provides for discharge of committee members.
