The question that emerges now is if she also provided information concerning Colombian domestic policy to the CIA. During her time at the embassy, Casas not only had access to intimate information on the Colombian guerrillas but on other Central American subversive groups who at that time took their ideological leadership from the USSR. Rafael Vergara Navarro, the M-19's international secretary, addressed the issue. [Begin Vergara recording] In 1982 and 1983 there was considerable intellectual and political activity in Mexico. If she was, in fact, working for the CIA, she was in a marvelous position to prepare her reports and submit them. [end recording] Residents of the San Diego neighborhood in Cartagena have vague memories of the Casas-Ames couple, who made rare visits to a home they own there. Augusto Vaca, a neighbor, had this to say about the Ames. [Begin Vaca recording] They were very quiet, reserved people. They never established close connections in the neighborhood. [end recording] According to residents of San Diego, the alleged spy couple last visited the neighborhood in 1987.
