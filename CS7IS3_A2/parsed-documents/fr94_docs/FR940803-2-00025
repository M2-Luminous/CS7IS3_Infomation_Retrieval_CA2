FR940803-2-00025 FR940803-2-00020 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. PL94&hyph;4&hyph;000] Pricing Policy For New And Existing Facilities Constructed By Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines; NOTICE OF PUBLIC CONFERENCE AND OPPORTUNITY TO FILE WRITTEN COMMENTS July 28, 1994. Take notice that the Commission will convene a public conference in the above-captioned proceeding to consider the methodologies to be used in setting rates for transportation service with regard to new and existing facilities constructed by interstate natural gas pipelines. The Commission also will be accepting written comments prior to the conference. The date and procedures for the conference will be established by a subsequent notice. Written comments may be filed within 60 days of the date of this notice. I. Scope of Inquiry Historically, when pipelines have sought to enlarge their facilities, the Commission had a preference for rolling-in the costs of the new construction into the pipeline's cost-of-service and establishing a single rate for both the existing customers and the expansion customers (those customers obtaining capacity as a result of the new facilities). The Commission found that rolled-in pricing would be appropriate when the new facilities were part of an integrated system and provided system-wide benefits. 1 When the new construction was not integrated into the pipeline's existing system, the Commission would approve incremental pricing in which a separate cost-of-service is established for the existing and expansion facilities, and the prior holders of capacity (existing shippers) and expansion shippers pay different rates. 1 See Trunkline Gas Company, 21 FPC 704 (1959), aff'd, Battle Creek Gas Company v. FPC, 281 F.2d 42 (D.C. Cir. 1960); Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership, 45 FERC ¶61,237 (1988). The Commission, however, became concerned about the effect of rolling-in the costs of new construction that is integrated into the pipeline's existing system. The Commission was particularly concerned with the effects of expensive construction because using rolled-in rates could result in disproportionate costs being imposed on existing customers when compared with the benefits they receive from the expansion. 2 The Commission was further concerned that rolling-in rates in this situation could conflict with its efforts to adopt rate designs that promote economic efficiency by causing the pipeline's existing customers to subsidize the rates paid by expansion customers. As a result of these concerns, the Commission, in its Great Lakes orders, required the pipeline to charge incremental prices for a system expansion based on a test in which the benefits to existing customers were weighed against the costs of rolling-in the facilities (commensurate benefits test). 2 See Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership, 57 FERC ¶61,140 (1991) (Opinion No. 367), reh'g denied, 62 FERC ¶61,101 (1993), 57 FERC ¶61,141 (1991) (Opinion No. 368), reh'g denied, 62 FERC ¶61,102 (1993) remanded, No. 91&hyph;1380, (D.C. Cir. June 10, 1994), 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 14190; and Southern Natural Gas Company, 51 FERC ¶61,296 (1990). In TransCanada Pipelines Limited v. FERC, 3 the court of appeals, however, remanded the Commission's determination to use incremental rates in Great Lakes. The court concluded that the Commission had not justified its focus on commensurate benefits in light of the Commission's past approach of examining whether the new facilities were integrated into existing facilities and whether the facilities provided system-wide benefits, qualitatively described. The court also expressed concern that the use of incremental pricing may result in undue discrimination because facility expansion is caused not only by the demands of the new customers, but by the continuing demands of the existing customers. 4 3 No. 91&hyph;1380, (D.C. Cir. June 10, 1994), 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 14190. 4 The Commission will decide its position in the Great Lakes remand in concert with its consideration of the appropriate pricing policy to use generically in this proceeding.
