Note 1: This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (d) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the strut and subsequent loss of the engine, accomplish the following: (a) Accomplish the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994, at the time specified in either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this AD, as applicable.
