Do you give priority to intensifying integration within the framework of the current Twelve or do you favor EU enlargement? [Durao Barroso] Intensifying multilateral cooperation among the current EU member countries and enlarging the Brussels based organization are communicating vessels. The two processes must take place concurrently without us giving priority to or accelerating one of them. Creating a new united Europe on the basis of closer integration is the logical outcome of cooperation on the continent. The Maastricht Treaty on European Union, which has been signed and ratified by all 12 of the current community members, defines quite clearly the image of the future integrated Europe. Not only is the trend toward intensifying internal integration among the member states becoming apparent within the framework of creating a political, economic, and monetary union, but the rules for the future EU enlargement are also being defined at the same time. The fact that the EU has now opened itself to the north in no way discounts its possible enlargement toward the East in the future. In the case of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway, however, it was agreed that their affiliation to the EU will not be linked to the Union's institutional reform. The talks on the admission of the East European countries -- which can begin only after the EU intergovernment conference in 1996 -- will, however, undoubtedly take place against the background of the reform of the present EU organizational structures. [Sklenka] Realistically, when could such talks be initiated with the Central and East European countries? [Durao Barroso] It is necessary to proceed from the premise that such a step can only be taken if the two sides are well prepared for it. Admission into the Brussels based organization will mean a completely new situation for both the European Union and the interested parties from the postcommunist countries. In our case, it is essential to ensure that the correct formula for institutional reform is found with the proviso that the EU does not lose its ability to function and operate, for instance, as a 20- or 24-member organization. On the other hand, the candidate countries must adapt their economies and legal systems to the West European arrangement. Specifically, the Czech Republic -- whose entry into the EU is supported on all sides -- must reckon with abandoning some jurisdiction concerning national sovereignty and also fundamental changes in its legislation, beginning with the regulations on domestic trade and ending with foreign policy. Of course, it is necessary to modernize and liberalize further the economy and to prepare the entrepreneurial sphere for a free competitive environment. [Sklenka] However, opinions are sometimes expressed in Portugal that reveal anxiety about the rapid admission into the EU of the countries of Central and East Europe, because this could reduce the financial aid for Lisbon from the Twelve's structural funds, aid that would be directed toward the East. [Durao Barroso] Such anxiety is absolutely unfounded. During the EU summit in Edinburgh at the end of 1992, a package of financial aid from the structural funds and the solidarity fund was approved as a prerequisite for the joint journey of all 12 countries from the Brussels based organization toward political, economic, and monetary union. Within the framework of economic and social solidarity, the rich countries of northern Europe have committed themselves to assist the poorer countries in achieving the convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty for admission into the EU. The financial aid for the years 1993-99 has been fixed and is not linked to the EU's enlargement. [Sklenka] There is no risk of a two or more-speed Europe, then? [Durao Barroso] By signing and ratifying the Maastricht documents, all the European Union member states have committed themselves to economic and social solidarity. All of the prescribed parameters for convergence should be fulfilled by the end of 1999 at the latest. If someone were to cast doubt on this principle for a joint course of action now, he would -- at the same time --be repudiating the very essence of closer European cooperation and thus de facto be demolishing the foundations of the future federal Europe, foundations that are being laid only very slowly. It is unacceptable to us for certain rich countries to use the cyclical difficulties and still extant differences in economic and social development within the European Union and embark themselves along a quicker path. That would, obviously, mean the end of the idea of pan-European integration and of a united Europe in general.
