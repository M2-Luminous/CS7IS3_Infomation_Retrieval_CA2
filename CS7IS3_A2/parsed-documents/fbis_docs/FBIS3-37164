The chief of the General Staff sent the request to Supreme Commander Boris Yeltsin right after Kolesnikov had met with Pavel Grachev in person. In requesting his resignation, the colonel general writes that he wants no part in the further disintegration of the Russian Armed Forces. It is still unknown for how long the president will consider the request. Consultative meetings of Yeltsin with Grachev, his deputies, and commanders of combat arms are being planned already this week, however, where the question of the resignation of the chief of the General Staff will no doubt be raised.
