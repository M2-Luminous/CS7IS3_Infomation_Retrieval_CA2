"These elections have been tainted," Culhaoglu said. In a statement from his party's headquarters, Culhaoglu said that they have received claims that the results of local polls have been distorted. He said that they have received great numbers of ballots casted for his party that were found in trash cans and that they found a printing house in the central Anatolian city of Kayseri which was printing ballots. Culhaoglu said that the SDPP applied to the Prosecutor's Office, claiming fraud and petitioned the High Election Board. "Fraud claims are pouring in from all over the country," he said. "These claims show that an organized action has been carried out throughout the country." [passage omitted]
