Kozyrev, arriving from Israel, told reporters he was bringing "certain ideas" and an important message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin, but did not give details. He would stay in Tunis for several hours. "I have come to express our support and determination to prevent the enemies of peace from undermining the efforts" to keep the peace talks going, Kozyrev said, before meeting 'Arafat. "It is a question now of focusing efforts to save the peace process," he added. Kozyrev was also expected to meet Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahia. Officials said 'Arafat earlier discussed the peace process with Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The PLO leader deplored the UN Security Council's failure to adopt a resolution condemning the Hebron massacre and calling for the deployment of an international force in the occupied territories. The delay was having "a very serious negative impact on the whole situation" in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank, 'Arafat said after the meeting. Kozyrev held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Jerusalem Friday, during which Rabin called on the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace talks, Russia and the United States, to work together to revive the peace process. However, Israeli state radio said a Russian proposal to stage a new Middle East peace conference was not discussed during Kozyrev's talks with Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. The proposal was announced by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov Wednesday, after a Middle East tour during which he met twice with 'Arafat, as well as with Rabin and Peres. Moscow has argued that the February 25 massacre of 30 Arab worshipers by a Jewish settler in Hebron has derailed the negotiating process and that another international conference is needed, along the lines of the 1991 Madrid conference which launched the peace process.
