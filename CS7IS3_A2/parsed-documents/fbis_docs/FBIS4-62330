Here is Yevgeniy Prokhorov, director of the International Law Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry to speak on this from the point of view of international law. [Prokhorov] It would be quite a difficult thing to do for one simple reason: We would have to leave the United Nations. The decision of the Security Council is of a compulsory nature and applies to all states of the world, even should they disagree with one or another decision. Therefore it would be impossible to unilaterally stop implementing sanctions adopted at the decision of the Security Council without violating the UN Charter.
