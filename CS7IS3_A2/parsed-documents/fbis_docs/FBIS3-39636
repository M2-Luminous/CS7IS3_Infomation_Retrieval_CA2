This is the size of the Swedish demand for a rebate upon accession that the government will soon be putting forward. This was said by Finance Minister Anne Wibble, who visited Brussels yesterday after a tour of the EU capitals where she pleaded Sweden's case for a decreased membership contribution to the EU in the initial years of membership. "A factor that we stressed and that was listened to with interest is that in no year does Sweden intend to be a burden on the EU's budget," Anne Wibble said. "We will always be a net contributor even though to begin with our contribution is small or even zero." According to Wibble, Sweden's regular membership contribution to the EU will end up "somewhere under 20 billion kronor" a year. Both sides' experts are sitting and making their calculations and their figures "are in the process of converging," the finance minister said. But Sweden wants a phasing-in rebate, which means that only after a number of years will Sweden's membership contribution reach the full amount. The justification for this includes the arguments that other countries have been granted this and that Sweden has problems with its state finances. According to a state report on the effects of EU membership, the flow of money back to Sweden from the EU could be 5 to 9 billion kronor in agricultural support and around 2 million from the structural fund. Thus a Swedish zero payment would correspond to an initial rebate of around 50 percent. But Anne Wibble is aware that in the final phase of negotiations a Swedish rebate demand could be played off against other demands close to Sweden's heart -- such as regional support for northern Sweden. "This is exactly how discussions will go in the final phase. Obviously the whole picture is of significance in the final phase. "Regional policy is of great political importance. My feelings about regional policy are very strong. "But it is important to achieve a good solution on both issues. We could not swap regional support for the budget rebate." In the past, European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel has said several times that the Swedish negotiators want to see what they will get back from the EU before Sweden produces an official negotiating stance on the budget.
