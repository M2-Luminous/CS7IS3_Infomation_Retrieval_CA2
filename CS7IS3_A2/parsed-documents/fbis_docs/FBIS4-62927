People's deputies of Ukraine Vasyl Vasylyovych Durdynets, Oleksandr Mykolayovych Karpov, Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz, and Yuriy Kazymyrovych Tyma were entered in the secret ballot paper for the election of the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. Proceeding from the results of the secret ballot the Counting Commission has determined the following: the overall number of people's deputies of Ukraine elected by the time of holding the session is 338. The number of people's deputies of Ukraine whose plenary powers have been recognized by the Supreme Council of Ukraine is 336. The number of the people's deputies of Ukraine who received the secret ballot papers is 326. The number of the people's deputies of Ukraine who took part in the ballot is 322. The results of the ballot are as follows: Vasyl Vasyloyvych Durdynets: 103 votes in favor of the candidate and 219 votes against.

In compliance with Article 97 of the Constitution of Ukraine, [word indistinct] 22/6 of the temporary time-table of the sittings of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, the Counting Commission has decided to consider Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz elected chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. Chairman of the counting commission: Syrota. Deputy chairman of the counting commission: Pavlovskyy. Secretary of the counting commission: Stretovych. The protocol was not signed by one member of the Counting Commission, Ratushnyy -- I do not remember his initials. He expressed his personal opinion which I will read out, if you do not mind. This is the personal opinion of member of the Counting Commission, deputy Mykhaylo Ratushnyy. Due to the fact that I was forwarding a proposal that the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine should be elected by two thirds of votes and this proposal was turned down, I refuse to sign the protocol. This does not mean that I consider that the Counting Commission made any violations during the counting of votes. Such is the protocol. [Symoneko] Esteemed people's deputies. We must approve the protocol of the counting commission for the election of the Supreme Council chairman. I am putting it to the vote: Those who are in favor of approving the protocol of the counting commission for the election of the Supreme Council chairman, please vote. The decision is made. Esteemed people's deputies. We must pass a resolution on the election of the Supreme Council chairman. If you let me, I will offer it to you. Any objections? Resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine on the chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine -- the Supreme Council of Ukraine resolves to elect people's deputy of Ukraine Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. I am putting this to the vote. Who is in favor of adopting this resolution? The decision is made.
