I consider this to be a rather serious situation. In my view, either the existing Constitution, regardless of how much or how little we like it, is to be observed, with the constitutional system functioning normally, or--and this is the worse possibility--the Constitution has to be amended. In fact, the worst possibility is when the Constitution is valid but is not being complied with because this is an undemocratic state of affairs. I cannot imagine a democracy where, for instance, it would be impossible to dissolve a parliament--and this is the situation today because the senate does not exist. If there is no will to have a senate, it is necessary to follow the second option, which is worse than complying with the Constitution but still better than the current state of affairs. In other words, it is necessary to amend the Constitution. However, if this is the case, it is not enough to simply delete the word "senate," as somebody has already suggested. It demands a full rethink of the respective three chapters of the Constitution and a rethink of all constitutional aspects, relations between individual constitutional officials, in order to form a functioning constitutional system. The senate had its essential role in this system, and it is not possible to simply omit it and think the system will function without it. [Correspondent] In the context of what you have just said, I would like to mention today's proposal by the KDU-CSL [Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party], which calls for a parliamentary commission to initiate the amendment of the Constitution. The amendment would aim at abolishing the senate, some of whose powers would be transferred to the president of the Republic. [Havel] I think this initiative is probably good and necessary because some action has to be taken. We cannot live forever in this untenable situation. The problem of how to divide the powers of the senate is another question. Probably some of them would have to be transferred to the head of state. This is possible, but it is a matter for the parliament to discuss. [Correspondent] Is it possible to call the current situation a constitutional crisis, as some politicians have done? [Havel] I would not say that we have found ourselves in a constitutional crisis. We have only found ourselves in a situation that would prevent us from solving a constitutional or political crisis if such a crisis arises. [Correspondent] Do you think it is essential to solve this problem quickly? [Havel] Yes, I do.
