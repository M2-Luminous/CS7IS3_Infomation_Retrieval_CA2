At the press conference held today, a reporter asked: U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown recently said that there is full hope for extension of China's MFN. What is your comment on this? Wu Jianmin replied: We have taken note of the remarks made by a number of American personages recently, calling for unconditional renewal of China's MFN. This is a positive development. Another reporter asked: Will China make further concessions so that President Clinton can extend China's MFN status? Wu Jianmin said that the differences between China and the United States can be discussed through dialogue on equal footing. If an agreement cannot be reached for the time being, we can seek common ground while reserving differences. The U.S. can only do what is permitted by its laws. China can only do what is permitted by China's laws. A reporter asked: According to a report, a number of U.S. House of Representatives members, including Smith, said on 18 May that China has not ceased exporting its prison goods to the United States. Do you have any comments on this? Wu replied that the report is a sheer fabrication. On the question of prison goods export, China and the United States had already signed the "Memorandum of Understanding on Prohibiting the Exports and Trading of Prison Products." China strictly follows the memorandum. Not long ago, the two countries again signed a statement on cooperation in specific implementation. Both sides hold that implementation of the two documents is proceeding quite well. With ulterior motives, some people are spreading rumors on the issue in an attempt to throw mud at China.
