At the same time, however, this has also given rise to a noteworthy "rural disease." In order to deal with this problem, the State Council's Research Office carried out a systematic investigation and submitted a special report. RENMIN RIBAO reporters have summarized the main points of the report as follows: The Noteworthy "Rural Disease" Since the beginning of reform and opening, major changes have occurred in the urban and rural economic structures in our country. In particular, various nonfarming industries, composed mainly of township and town enterprises, have developed greatly in the countryside. However, some special phenomena also appeared in such developments and have been called a "rural disease" which mainly finds expression in the following facts. The rural industry is widely scattered. In 1992, there were 20.79 million township and town enterprises throughout the country, and more than 19 million were located in natural villages. The advantage of such a scattered distribution was that the starting costs would be much lower and villagers could be engaged in both farming and industrial production. However, there were more disadvantages: First, the enterprises were operating in a closed condition; second, they were widely scattered; third, it was hard to control industrial pollution; and fourth, there was a serious degree of duplicated production and competition remained at a low level, even causing serious waste. The construction of small cities was not well planned and coordinated. At present, most rural towns with comparatively developed industry and commerce in the coastal provinces have been developed into small cities. In some areas, small cities and towns have been linked up. However, the size of most such cities is still too small, so the scale of the urban districts uneconomical. They require huge investment in the construction of infrastructural facilities but their utilization rate is rather low and too much land is occupied. The nonfarming population is now migrating between cities and the countryside. They have their native residence in the countryside and still undertake the land contracts but they work and live in cities and towns. They possess the means of production and livelihood both in their native rural areas and in cities. On the one hand, they have no interest in engaging in farming production or no longer have the ability to do so; on the other hand, they cannot gain the same status as urban residents. In order to promote the healthy development of the rural economic communities, we must give guidance to the development of the nonfarming industries in the countryside and should combine this with the construction of small cities. In practice, we should explicitly adopt the following guidelines: First, remove the constraining factors and create a policy environment which can naturally effect the "combination." Second, the "combination" mainly relies on the full use and proper transformation of existing small cities, and also on the development of new small cities according to scientific plans, so that their layout is reasonable and their development is orderly. Third, the "combination" is not aimed at concentrating the scattered nonfarming industrial projects, because this is unrealistic; instead, it is mainly aimed at concentrating new projects in the future. Fourth, the "combination" should not only be effected between the nonfarming industries and the small cities but also between the nonfarming population and the small cities. Giving Positive Guidance to the Combination Giving guidance to the combination between the development of the nonfarming industries and the construction of small cities is of great significance in many aspects: 1. This will quicken the development of the tertiary industry and will shift more surplus labor force from farming to other industries. In the last more than 10 years, various nonfarming industries have made substantial development in the countryside with the rise of the township and town enterprises. In 1992, such industries employed 106 million rural working people. At present, there are about 170 million surplus working people in the rural areas, equal to the total urban population of the 517 cities in the whole country. In future, the meaning of the term "local employment" should be broadened. In the past, "local" mainly referred to people's native places; henceforth, "local" should go beyond people's native places. Facts show that the tertiary industry can absorb a much larger quantity of the work force than secondary industry; and the main supporters of the tertiary industry are cities and towns. That is to say, small cities should have a much stronger capacity to absorb the surplus labor force in the countryside. 2. This will create more favorable conditions for farming operations on an appropriate scale and thus make a new leap in agricultural production. Henceforth, in order to raise our country's agricultural production, especially grain production, to a new stage, we shall have to solve the problems caused by an excessive number of peasants and the small area of farmland in per capita terms. 3. This will mitigate the pressure caused by the surplus rural labor force on the large and medium cities. In current social and economic circumstances, the household registration system for permanent residence is no longer effective in restraining peasants from moving into cities. The sole method is to give more effective guidance to the population movement and actively encourage the combination between the development of the nonfarming industries and the construction of small cities. While developing nonfarming industries, the rural areas can also develop small cities which will become "huge sponges" absorbing a large number of surplus working people from agriculture. This should be the most realistic method suited to the national conditions. 4. This will promote family planning and reduce the natural population growth and thereby enhance the quality of the population. Family planning can be promoted among peasants who have moved into cities, thus reducing the natural population growth; on the other hand, through their marriages, peasants can be connected to the urban population and the higher educational level and this will promote the enhancement of the population quality. 5. This will economize on land and construction funds. As the nonfarming industries in the rural areas are relatively concentrated and are developed on large stretches of land according to unified plans, the outlay will become more reasonable. The enterprises may share the same public utilities. This will economize on the use of land and save more funds for the construction of infrastructural facilities. 6. This will enhance civilization and promote social progress in the rural communities because the development of the cultural, educational, scientific, technological, and public health undertakings is all preconditioned by the relatively concentrated residence of the people. Backup Policies and Measures In order to promote the combination between the development of nonfarming industries and the construction of small cities, it is proposed that backup reforms and corresponding policies be gradually adopted mainly in the following aspects: The household registration and permanent residence policy. The policy for managing peasants' permanent residence and resettlement should be made more flexible so that peasants are allowed to move to small cities after they meet certain requirements. In general, the scope of such free movement can be extended to county towns or towns below the county level. The general principle is to keep large and medium cities stable and to develop small cities and small towns; the purpose is to promote common socioeconomic development. Policies in this regard may be formulated by various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities according to their conditions under the guidance of the state's general arrangements. The land policy. There should be a system for strictly examining and approving the use of land for the development of nonfarming districts and for the construction of small cities. The use of land should be planned by the local governments who should also requisition, develop, and distribute it. Land distribution can adopt such forms as signed contracts, invited tenders, or auctioned. Different prices should be fixed on land used for different purposes, such as industrial, commercial, and residential purposes. Favorable land prices may be given to peasants trying to start industrial and commercial businesses in the new districts for planned development. Peasants who have settled down in small cities, and those who have changed their status into the nonfarming population, should be required to return the land that was previously contracted to them for farming production and the land contracts should be terminated. The farmland should be contracted to other people for management by the rural collectives. Peasants should be allowed to freely purchase commercial housing in small cities and towns without any restrictions. Economic means, such as requisitioning land, raising land use fees for township and town enterprises, or exchanging land, can be used to encourage and prompt the existing township and town enterprises which are scattered widely to move to certain well-planned districts or small cities to seek more concentrated development. The social policy. Mass self-management organizations such as residents' committees should be set up in small cities, as should social service organizations providing community services and job placement services. The management of the permanent and migrating population should be strengthened. Various social security networks covering a broad scope of the population should be set up according to the characteristics of the small cities. The social security programs in small cities should be included in their overall socioeconomic development plans and should be joined by enterprises under all different ownership systems and by all workers employed under different conditions. The financial policy. The income from selling the land use rights and the profits made from the real estate development projects in small cities should be used for the construction of small cities. The rate of taxes for maintaining urban utilities in small cities should be appropriately enhanced and the tax revenue should be completely used for the construction of infrastructural facilities in the same cities. Public utilities should be run as enterprises and those who make investment in public utilities should gain returns, as the public utilities are used on a paid basis. Residents moving into small cities should first pay a certain amount of construction fees and this money can be refunded in later years. The banks should give financial support to the construction of small cities by offering favorable terms. Measures: Strengthening the planning, management, and guidance of the county (city) governments. The county-level (city-level) planning, management, and guidance should achieve the following ends; First, overcome the narrow-minded parochial mentality and remove the obstacles of rural administrative districts to the "combination." Second, make unified planning for the "combination" in the scope of a county (city), thus preventing the excessively scattered distribution of township and town enterprises and also preventing ill-coordinated "combination," which can lead to the appearance of excessive small industrial districts and small cities. Being the upper authorities of the townships and towns, the unified planning and management by the county (city) governments can achieve better results.
