The violence erupted Saturday, a day after the country's three opposition parties, lead by the MNSD or National Movement for the Development Society, called for civil disobedience to protest at the marginalisation of their supporters by the government. Niamey Hospital said one demonstrator had died from his injuries and a second was seriously hurt. The MNSD spokesman said police arrested about 100 party militants including "several influential members," among them Karadji Ayarga and Sani Mahamane, respectively a former government minister and former general secretary of the National Assembly. MNSD is Niger's former sole party. The demonstrations came as the ruling Alliance of Forces for Change was celebrating the first anniversary of President Mahamane Ousmane's investiture. The worst clashes occurred near Niamey stadium between opposition supporters and backers of the Alliance participating in the swearing-in ceremonies, the spokesman said. Throughout the afternoon, youths erected roadblocks of burning tires at the city's main intersections and looted government cars. On Friday, in a letter sent to Ousmane, the 33 opposition deputies (out of 83 deputies in total) threatened to form a parallel administration if their supporters were not given 46 percent of top government jobs, a figure which corresponds to the amount of votes won by the opposition March 27, in the second round of presidential elections. Government spokesman Mouctar Diallo condemned the demonstrations Saturday and said the government would not back down in the face of their protests. Earlier in the week clashes between police and Islamic fundamentalists left 10 dead in northern Niamey, while negotiations with the rebel Tuaregs, due Friday, were postponed yet again. Tuaregs have been fighting a war since 1971 for recognition by the Niamey authorities of their rights and a share in the wealth derived from their uranium-rich traditional lands.
