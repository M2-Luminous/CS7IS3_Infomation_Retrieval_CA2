Two days after police announced a major crack-down on crime, three gunmen seized a bus with some 40 hostages heading for the southern city of Stavropol and demanded two helicopters and 5.8 billion US dollars. The drama began at 16.00 hours Moscow time (13.00 GMT) and ended early next morning. The hostage-takers were seized in the rebel Russian republic of Chechnya and the ransom retrieved. All hostages were safely freed. This was the shortest drama. The first one which took place last December 23 continued for four days, the second one lasted 24 hours. All the three had practically the same scenario. A bus with hostages was seized, terrorists demanded a multi-million dollar ransom, guns and drugs and tried to escape on a helicopter somewhere in the mountains, preferably in Chechnya where crime rate is extremely high. All the three times the terrorists were seized, hostages freed and ransom retrieved. It is noteworthy that terrorists are no longer hijacking planes abroad as it used to happen in Soviet years, but prefer to remain in Russia with huge amounts of hard currency. Russian commandos fighting terrorists had also changed their manner of action. In Soviet years they did everything possible to prevent a hijacked plane from crossing the border. Thus, nine passengers were killed and the plane completely destroyed when commandos stormed a hijacked craft in March 1988 which landed in St. Petersburg for refuelling. After the tragedy the anti-terrorist groups focused mostly on saving the lives of hostages rather than seizing terrorists. However, this might have made terrorists no longer fear resolute actions against them. The three hostage dramas clearly show a new tendency in the Russian crime record. It is also evident that the failure of terrorists to escape does not stop their successors. Hardly anyone can say for sure that the Mineralnyye Vody airport would not face yet another hostage drama in future.
