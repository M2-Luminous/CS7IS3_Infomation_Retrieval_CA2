[Constantino] The idea to hold the conference was first hatched in Bangkok two years ago, namely during a conference called the People's Plan for the 21st Century [six preceding words in English], which was attended by hundreds of nongovernmental organizations from several countries. I must admit that it was [East Timor leader opposed to Indonesia] Ramos Horta's idea to hold the conference, but we are the organizers who prepared the agenda. [Ismartono] Why do most of the participants belong to the Fretilin [Revolutionary Front of an Independent East Timor] group, who are against East Timor integration into Indonesia? [Constantino] We have invited delegates from all political groups and made efforts to ensure that the conference will be attended by all sides, including the East Timorese who hold different political views. Among these people, there are two persons who were recently allowed by the Indonesian Government to return to Dili to visit their families. These people are certainly not Horta's friends. Indeed, we have been accused of trying to discredit the Indonesian Government, but the allegation is not true. I made the preparations for the conference in an open manner. Last April, I held three-hour talks on the matter with officials of the Indonesian Embassy in Manila. We also invited them to send their representatives to the conference so they can also voice their views. [Ismartono] What are the objectives of the conference? [Constantino] The conference is aimed at turning attention to the East Timor issue from a government forum to a people's forum. We especially want to look at the human rights issue in East Timor. That is why we have invited various nongovernmental organizations. We also want to give a chance to all parties involved in the East Timor issue to voice their views in an academic atmosphere devoid of government threat or influence. Among the ASEAN countries, I believe only the Philippines can provide such an atmosphere. [Ismartono] Has the Philippine Government ever tried to force you to cancel the conference? [Constantino] Government officials have contacted us since last November, but they never tried to scuttle the conference and they only urged us to watch our step. As you know, preventing us from holding the meeting and voicing our views is against the Philippine Constitution. The Manila government is not stupid. They are only anxious to see that the conference should not be a one- sided affair with one party being put on the defensive. To counter this, I told them that we would invite officials from the Indonesian Embassy in Manila as well as government officials from Jakarta to ensure that the conference would be fully represented. [Ismartono] Have you done this? [Constantino] Not yet. When I made this proposal, Philippine officials became increasingly worried because they thought it would make things more complicated. Therefore, I decided not to extend the invitation to the Indonesian officials. [Ismartono] Did you ever consider the impact of the conference on Indonesia-Philippines ties? [Constantino] You mean bilateral relations will be strained? Well, it cannot be helped, but I hope that will not happen.
