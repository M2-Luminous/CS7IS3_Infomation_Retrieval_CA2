Kiriakidhis] [Excerpt] Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller assured the British and U.S. Governments that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas will finally give a positive answer on the confidence-building measures. According to I MAKHI's information, a diplomatic source in Nicosia (from a country that is a permanent UN Security Council member) said the message has already been conveyed to the Greek Cypriot side to calm concerns created by the delay in the submission of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report. British officials believe Denktas will accept the 21 March UN document on the confidence-building measures and express this position openly. During a dinner on 23 May for Greek Cypriot political leaders, British Deputy Foreign Secretary Tom Richardson revealed that at the end of the past week the Turkish side asked for a 10-day deadline to give Denktas the chance to "manipulate" his "sudden" change toward accepting the measures. The British official even asked the party leaders or representatives for their views on how the talks procedure can move to the next stage, that is, discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue. He asked the leaders for their views on Butrus-Ghali's set of ideas, which the United Nations considers the basis for talks on the substance of the Cyprus issue. According to I MAKHI, despite the assurances that the Cypriot Government received, it remains dissatisfied and disappointed with the supportive stance that it believes the United States is showing. The Greek Cypriot side believes the U.S. stance is encouraging Turkish intransigence and facilitating Turkish maneuvers. It also expresses strong concerns that Denktas will finally accept the confidence-building measures "with conditions" (something that is categorically rejected). Yesterday, for the first time in public and after a week's delay, U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher described as false Turkish Cypriot press reports that at the Vienna talks, Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, submitted new proposals that change the 21 March document. I MAKHI reported yesterday that during his meeting with Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis the day before yesterday, the U.S. ambassador made the same explicit denial. Speaking at the U.S. stand at the International State Fair, the U.S. ambassador mentioned that an effort was made in Vienna to understand the confidence-building measures and overcome the obstacles. He noted that the United States insists on implementing the confidence-building measures, adding that the ongoing efforts include studying alternative ways of action for accepting the package.
