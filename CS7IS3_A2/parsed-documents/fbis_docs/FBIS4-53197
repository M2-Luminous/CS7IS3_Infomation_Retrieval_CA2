FBIS4-53197 "dreas096_m_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 Thailand Debate on Government Aid to Cambodia Reported Debate on Government Aid to Cambodia Reported Paper Opposes Military Aid BK1705082794 Bangkok SIAM POST in Thai 17 May 94 p 4 BK1705082794 Bangkok SIAM POST Thai BFN [Editorial: "Sihanouk Deserts Cambodia"] [Text] King Norodom Sihanouk declared in Phnom Penh last Thursday that he felt hopeless about peace in his country and asserted that national reconciliation is dead. He said he was leaving for Beijing. In his news conference, Sihanouk said the Khmer Rouge rejection of his peace initiatives led him to feel hopeless and to cancel the roundtable meeting on national reconciliation. Late last month, King Sihanouk invited the Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge leaders to a roundtable meeting at his palace to discuss national reconciliation. However, his invitation was rejected outright by Khieu Samphan, who claimed that there was no guarantee for his safety. Sihanouk issued another invitation to the two Cambodian factions to attend a meeting in Pyongyang. He also let out his frustration by saying that he would ask for foreign troops to solve the problem in his country. Last week, the Australian Foreign Ministry confirmed that it received a request for military assistance from Cambodian Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivut. The minister had made this request to the Australian, U.S., French, and ASEAN embassies in Phnom Penh. Australia and certain countries are now considering arms or military training for Cambodia and consulting certain countries, particularly Thailand, on this issue. King Sihanouk, however, denies any knowledge of the matter. A decision by any Western country or its allies to provide assistance to Cambodia, be it in the form of arms or military training, is tantamount to interference in the internal affairs of that country. It can be said that by completely distancing himself from peace efforts in Cambodia, King Sihanouk has given the leaders of the two Cambodian factions the opportunity to seek foreign assistance to continue a war of genocide.
