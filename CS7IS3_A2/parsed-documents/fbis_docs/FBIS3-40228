Experimental results show that the thinner the film is, the higher the dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and pyroelectric coefficient are. These experimental results are explained qualitatively. Room-temperature (15�C) detectors developed by the authors from these thin films (15-20 �m thick) have a detectivity D[.sup]*[/] (500K, 12.5 Hz) of 1.55 x 10[.sup]8[/] cm-Hz[.sup]1/2[/]-W[.sup]-1[/], an NEP [noise equivalent power] (500K, 12.5 Hz) of 1.95 x 10[.sup]-9[/] W, and a photosensitive-area diameter of 2mm. Four figures, not reproduced, show an SEM photo of the coarse surface of the composite film, a graph of dielectric constant vs. temperature, a graph of dielectric loss vs. temperature, and a graph of pyroelectric coefficient vs. temperature. There are no tables. References 1. Skinner, D. P., Newnham, K. E., Cross, L. E., MAT. RES. BULL., 1978, 13:599. 2. Amin, M., Balloomal, L. S., Darwish, K. A., et al., FERROELECTRICS, 1988, 81:381. 3.
