From the list of so-called hot spots--particularly critical sources of effluent--drawn up by the Helsinki Commission for Protection of the Baltic Sea (Helcom) a couple of years ago, 13 such spots have already been deleted. Hopes are good that it will be possible to eliminate more hot spots over the next few years, says Helcom, which concluded its meeting in Helsinki on Friday [11 March]. The 13 critical sources of effluent that have already succeeded in reducing their discharges to a considerably lower level are in Finland and Sweden but also in Latvia and Lithuania, which have been able in particular to reduce their discharges of polluted municipal refuse. Latvia is not a member of Helcom, but will join within a few months. The Finnish hot spots are mainly industrial, and all factories are working to reduce their effluent levels. The two factories removed from the critical list at the end of last year were Kaukas in Lappeenranta and Enso-Gutzeit in Kaukopaa. Since that time, Metsa-Botnia in Kasko has also been removed from the list. Two of the hot spots that Finland is having the most trouble doing anything about are sewage from the municipalities in the region of the capital and fish breeding in the archipelago waters. At its meeting, Helcom adopted a recommendation concerning the reduction of polluting effluent from the fish farms. Money Available When Helcom designated the hot spots around the Baltic Sea, it estimated that cleaning them up would cost a total of 10 billion ECU's or about 63 billion markkas. About one-fourth of that amount has already been allocated to various projects, according to Fleming Otzen, Helcom's general secretary. "We now know what needs to be done at most of the critical spots, and new measures are being adopted all the time," says Otzen. There are still nearly 120 hot spots in the Baltic Sea area, most of them in countries that belonged to the former Eastern bloc. The situation in the Baltic Sea has also improved because many East European states have been forced to shut down factories due to the lack of money and raw materials with which to keep them operating. The lack of money has also led to a decline in the use of artificial fertilizer by agriculture. According to Otzen, Helcom now has a good opportunity to introduce better technology in factories of that kind before they begin operating again. Investment in Protection of Environment Also adopted at the meeting in Helsinki were three recommendations concerned solely with protection of the environment. The first of those recommendations deals with the 100- to 300-meter restricted zone that will prevent construction on the shores of the Baltic Sea. Finland has accepted that recommendation, but with the reservation that construction with a special permit and construction in planned areas will be allowed. A recommendation regarding a network of nature reserves was also adopted at the meeting. That network will consist of 62 different areas in the Baltic states, and it corresponds almost completely to the national nature reserves already in existence. But now that Helcom has adopted this recommendation, an individual nation will not be able to abolish a nature reserve without Helcom's approval. The third recommendation dealing directly with protection of the environment calls for drawing up a so-called red book of threatened marine biotypes--that is, natural areas and species--in the Baltic Sea area. An initial survey will be conducted in each individual country. The issue of chemical weapons being dumped into the Baltic Sea was also discussed at the meeting. Earlier reports to Helcom listed the known locations where dumping has occurred, but information on possible Soviet-era dumping in Russian and Baltic territorial waters is still lacking. In any case, it is safer to let the chemical weapons stay where they are than to try to bring them to the surface, says Otzen. "Fishing in the Baltic Sea area is so active that we now have a very good picture of where chemical dumping has taken place," says Otzen. "This means that we are not necessarily going to find any more old Soviet weapons."
