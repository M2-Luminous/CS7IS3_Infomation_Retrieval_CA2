The departments in Estonia and Russia must resolve the issue of the Kurds without creating a strife between themselves or interference by the world community, Tarmo Kouts, the head of the Estonian border department said. Kouts at the meeting requested from Russian Military Attache Anatoli Tschizhikov that Russia answer to letters by the Estonian department concerning the Kurds' illegal crossing of the border. Kouts told BNS he hopes to get an answer by Friday [6 May]. "From that answer we will be able to conclude whether the issue can be settled at our departments' level or has to be referred to the Foreign Ministry and the broader public." [passage omitted]
