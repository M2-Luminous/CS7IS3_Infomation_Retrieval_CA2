One of Yeltsin's closest advisers is currently holding talks in Germany to find out to what extent the Russian president can count on the support of internationally renowned economics experts. One of the German advisers Yeltsin would like to win over is Professor Otto Schlecht. Schlecht was a leading official in the German Economics Ministry for 31 years, including 18 years as state secretary. At present he is chairman of the Ludwig Erhard Foundation, which promotes economic research programs all over the world. Another personality Yeltsin would like to win over is former Social Democratic Party Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who was economics and finance minister before he became chancellor. Schmidt developed the European Monetary System together with former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Yeltsin also hopes to be given special advice by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer. If Schlecht and Schmidt agree to act as Yeltsin's advisers, it is also hoped that France's Raymond Barre will accept a role in this cast. According to information available to WELT AM SONNTAG, Moscow has already established the appropriate contacts with Paris, hoping to gain the support of the renowned economist. Raymond Barre was French prime minister from 1976 to 1981. Before that he was vice president of the European Commission in Brussels, where he was in charge of economic policy, and monetary problems in particular. Barre was professor of economics at the Sorbonne for many years. The adviser problem has also become topical for Yeltsin because U.S. experts such as Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University have resigned as advisers to the Russian government.
