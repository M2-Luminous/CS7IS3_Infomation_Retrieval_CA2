P. Shilov; UDC 546.799.6] [Abstract] Comparison of thermodynamic and optical properties and stability in aqueous alkaline solutions of heptavalent neptunium, plutonium, and americium, makes it possible to predict certain properties of curium (VII). The oxidation potential of a metal pair M(VII)/M(VI) in 1 mole per liter NaOH increases almost linearly in the series Np-Pu-Am. Extrapolation shows that the Cm(VII)/Cm(VI) potential is 1.3 volts. This value indicates that curium (VII) could at some time exist in an alkaline solution. In the present work it is postulated that on the basis of published data, preparation of curium (VII) in cold alkaline solutions is possible by reaction of strong oxidizers with curium (VI). Possible oxidizers include ozone, the O[.sup]-[/] ion-radical, and any compound having an oxidation potential of 1.3 volts in this medium.
