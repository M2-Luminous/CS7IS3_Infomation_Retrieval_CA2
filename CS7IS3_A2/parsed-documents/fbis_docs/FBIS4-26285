Speaking with reporters at Beijing airport, Mutsuko Miki said she was invited to Pyongyang by the North Korean president on June 14 and met with him for two hours on Sunday. "I don't remember clearly the date of the scheduled summit meeting that Kim Il-song referred to, but I believe he said August 17," Miki, 77, said. The summit was first proposed by the North Korean president during talks with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in Pyongyang late last week and relayed Saturday to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who readily accepted the proposal. The mention of the August date and Pyongyang is the first proposal by either side of a time and place for what could be a historic meeting. The south has proposed a preparatory meeting for the summit on June 28 at the heavily armed border crossing at panmunjom and it is believed the North Korean side will put forward the August date at meeting, analysts said. Kim Il-song was very upbeat in describing his meetings with Carter, which he called "very successful" and "in a very friendly atmosphere," Miki said. "We would like to have more personnel exchanges with Japan and get along with Japan," she quoted Kim as saying, adding that he expressed a strong hope of establishing diplomatic ties with Japan. Takeo Miki was prime minister from 1974 to 1976.
