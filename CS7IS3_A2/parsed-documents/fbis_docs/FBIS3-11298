Some members of the delegation that traveled to Washington to draft this plan are ready to return to Washington, according to Deputy Antoine Joseph. Commenting on the statements of the UN secretary general, who expressed the desire to pursue negotiations in order to achieve a new plan in conformity with the Governors Island agreement, Deputy Joseph revealed that he was ready to undertake the political pilgrimage if that effort can help solve the crisis. The legislators are reportedly willing to sit down with the president-in-exile this time to listen to his reservations and viewpoint. Deputy Joseph answers Edner Jean's questions: [Begin recording] [Joseph, in Creole] I do not believe that the latest statement made by the UN secretary general is ambiguous at all. On the contrary, it is one more way to support the plan of the parliamentary delegation. When he said that he had opened a space for dialogue and negotiation, he also said that he was waiting for the Senate to make a decision and, most probably, he is expecting the Senate to ratify the plan, meaning that he is referring to a document. Certainly, President Aristide has some reservations on the plan, and those points, without modifying the plan, are essentially guarantees that President Aristide requires. The parliamentary delegation, the UN secretary general, the Clinton administration, and President Aristide are going to sit down to offer President Aristide the guarantees that he needs so that he understands the reason for the plan, the applicability of the plan, and the reason we say that the plan is efficient, realistic, and peaceful. [Jean] Does that mean, Deputy Joseph, that the delegation will be willing to go back to Washington to renegotiate the plan if President Aristide and the UN secretary general ask them to do so? [Joseph, in Creole] I have said many times that I was willing to take my pilgrim's staff, go to Washington, and meet with all concerned sectors -- I started doing so, why not continue -- all the more so if there is a plan today and this plan, for us, constitutes a good springboard for a solution to the Haitian crisis. I must tell you that those who are against the plan, until now, have never said what they have against the plan and have never defined their reservations toward the plan, which would allow us legislators to engage them in a debate to help clarify those reservations. We must ask ourselves the question: Today, what is the alternative? Not necessarily a presidium, not necessarily the reactivation of Article 149, not necessarily Joseph Nerette, not necessarily casting aside the 30 September family, but a realistic plan which takes into account the position of the international community, the position of President Aristide, and the position of the Army. [Jean] But the Army is still mute on the plan, while Father Aristide's stance is known. Does the Army's silence constitute another element of blockade? [Joseph, in Creole] You can interpret this silence in two ways. I know that the military have not felt that they can take a stand until now. Perhaps they also feel that they do not have the guarantees to accept the plan. What I can say to the Army is that I think the Army has already committed a major mistake in rejecting the Washington protocol. Is the Army going to repeat that mistake? I would hope not, because in this plan there is a way for the military to reinforce the military institution. [end recording]
