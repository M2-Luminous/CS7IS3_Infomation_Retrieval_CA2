The association said cooperation between Japanese and U.S. automobile and auto parts industries to enhance bilateral trade is bearing fruit. It said the report was compiled on the occasion of the resumption of Japan-U.S. negotiations for a new bilateral trade "framework." The report said Japanese automakers are continuing efforts to increase procurement from U.S. auto parts makers. In referring to a sales drive in Japan by the "big three" U.S. automakers, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., the report said those firms still need to step up efforts to sell more vehicles. It said the U.S. automakers have not developed small vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 2000 cc which account for more than 80 percent of the Japanese auto market. The association said an English version of the report will be distributed in the United States later.
