The Russian economy has hit the bottom line, and must now stabilise and improve, according to the Russian president's analytical centre chief Yevgeniy Yasin. Yasin told journalists at a press conference here that he expected a u-turn from the end of 1994 when the slump will have reached 20-25 percent of the 1993 level. "The situation will stabilise then," Yasin predicted. "This is much better than a lesser slump for a longer period, including 1995 and 1996," Yasin assured the journalists. He also said the government has scored several successes in combatting inflation. As of May 10, the inflation rate was registered at 2- 2.5 percent and it is unlikely to exceed the level by the end of the month. More, the presidential analyst said the first signs of stabilisation are already evident, almost a year ahead of the deadline provided for in the program adopted by the Russian Government on August 6,1993.
