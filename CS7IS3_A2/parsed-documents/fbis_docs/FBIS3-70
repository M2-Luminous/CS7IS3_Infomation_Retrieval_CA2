Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-28MAR94-DPRK-U.S.-ROK DPRK Calibrates War Rhetoric, Leaves Door Ajar for Talks SUMMARY Pyongyang's carefully calibrated media campaign against Washington and Seoul over the nuclear issue seems designed to convey the impression that while the North Korean leadership is prepared to deal with the full consequences of its refusal to abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), it still hopes for a negotiated settlement of the nuclear inspection issue. END SUMMARY A measure of rhetorical restraint was evident in a 28 March Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, the first authoritative statement observed to have been carried by Pyongyang media on the reported U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the South (Pyongyang radio, 28 March). The statement "sternly denounced" the prospective shipment of Patriots to South Korea, calling it a "dangerous" and "irrational" military action. Seeking to refute the U.S. assertion that the Patriot is a defensive weapon, the statement contended that the topography of the Korean peninsula enables the missile to be used to strike any target in the North with a change of its "warhead" and that it could be used for a preemptive strike on the DPRK. Nevertheless, the statement fell short of an ultimatum and warned only of unspecified "grave consequences" while calling on Washington to give the issue "profound and deliberate consideration." The 28 March statement was in sharp contrast to Pyongyang's earlier nonauthoritative pronouncements, which the North Korean leadership has used for its more vituperative attacks. The shrillest of these pronouncements, carried by Pyongyang radio on 26 March, characterized the reported U.S. plan to resume Team Spirit and deploy the Patriot missiles as actions that are "dangerous in the extreme" and as moves that could bring on "a catastrophic crisis." It accused Washington of "frantically" attempting to "isolate and crush" the DPRK. Similarly, a 26 March Pyongyang radio commentary described U.S. plans to deploy the missiles as "sinister" and charged that there is a U.S. contingency plan to mobilize "two marine divisions, more than 200 warships, and over 1,600 planes" from the U.S. mainland to Korea in case of war, and claimed that the carrier Carl Vinson and 30 other ships have already been deployed "near" the Korean waters. The commentary warned that while Pyongyang does not want war, it is "by no means afraid of war," and went on to liken an attempt to "swallow" North Korea to an attempt to "break a boulder" with "a rotten egg." Harsh as these pronouncements may sound, the North seems to be holding back bigger ammunition in its rhetorical arsenal. For instance, North Korean media have not been observed to repeat once-standard phrases such as "the U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemy with whom the Korean people cannot live under the same sky," "the Korean people will certainly make the enemy pay a thousand-fold for the blood shed by fellow countrymen at the hands of the enemy," and "shameful and humiliating defeat to the aggressors." Such expressions surfaced briefly after the North Korean withdrawal from the NPT last year (Pyongyang radio, 17 March 1993; KCNA, 13 May 1993). Talks With U.S. Pyongyang also seems to be seeking to foster the impression that it is interested in somehow preserving dialogue with the United States. For example, the 28 March Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, by contending that the introduction of the Patriots would violate last June's DPRK-U.S. joint statement, also seemed to imply that Pyongyang still regards itself and Washington as bound by the statement's principles that have served as the basis for further Washington- Pyongyang dialogue. Further signaling Pyongyang's lingering interest in pursuing dialogue with Washington, the spokesman's statement, by accusing the South Korean government of trying to "frustrate the DPRK-U.S. talks," intimated that resumption of the talks is a goal to be striven for. Although Pyongyang media have begun criticizing U.S. Congressional and Administration leaders, such as Secretary of State Christopher and Secretary of Defense Perry (KCNA, 24 March; Pyongyang radio, 28 March), they have so far refrained from personal attacks on President Clinton. For instance, KCNA on 23 March used the proper title and name--"U.S. President Bill Clinton"--in criticizing the President's decisions on Team Spirit and the Patriots. Talks With South Pyongyang media treatment of South Korea since the breakup of the inter-Korean talks on 19 March also seemed designed to convey the impression that the North has not totally ruled out dialogue with Seoul. Pyongyang media have so far withheld authoritative comment on South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's recent remarks suggesting that the South would view any attack by the North as "an opportunity" to reunify the nation (Seoul Chungang Ilbo, 24 March). Moreover, the 28 March Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement used the neutral term "South Korean authorities" to refer to the ROK Government. Although nonauthoritative pronouncements coming from the North have continued to refer to ROK President Kim Yong-sam as a "traitor" and "puppet," these pronouncements have also contained the less pejorative references to "the Kim Yong-sam regime" and "the Kim Yong-sam group" (KCNA, 25 March). Even a statement attributed to the League of Socialist Youth of Korea, a youth organ traditionally among the most vituperative in its denunciations of South Korean leaders, has mixed terms such as "the South Korean authorities" and "the Kim Yong-sam group" with the "puppet clique." Implications Pyongyang media's fine-tuned campaign against Washington and Seoul suggests that, in spite of its recent hardline stance on the nuclear inspection issue, the North Korean regime finds it politic to convey the impression that it has not ruled out a negotiated settlement of the issue.
