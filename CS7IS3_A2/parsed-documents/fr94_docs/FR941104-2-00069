FR941104-2-00069 FR941104-2-00038 A phased approach to employing social attractants may be used to refine the use of social attractants on the colony. Criteria to be used to determine the use of social attractants include: loss of subcolonies or colonies, below normal reproductive success, lack of colony growth, limited availability of breeding sites in existing subcolonies, high numbers of prospecting common murres in existing subcolonies, presence of prospecting common murres in areas with no breeding, and population status at each colony. The use of social attractants would be employed at sites where it was deemed necessary to encourage common murres to recolonize lost subcolonies or prospect and nest on unoccupied rocks. The goal would be to prevent colony loss and/or restore the breeding colony to historic numbers without negatively impacting existing subcolonies. If, for any reason, social attractants are not deemed advisable after two years, the colonies at these sites will be monitored for three more years to insure adequate reproductive success, activity, colony survival, and recovery and, if necessary, to develop alternative restoration techniques. Schedule: Fall and winter 1994&hyph;1995: Preliminary work will begin, including selection of observation points, obtaining access permits, planning, and purchasing. In December 1994, observations of breeding colonies will begin in order to obtain necessary baseline information. Spring and summer 1995: Aerial surveys of breeding common murre colonies will be conducted in May-June to obtain baseline data. These surveys will be conducted in conjunction with aerial common murre surveys for central California. Observations of breeding colonies will continue each year from December 1994 until August 1997, at a minimum. In August 1997, the use of social attractants will be assessed to restore these common murre colonies. In fall 1997, social attractants will be deployed where suitable. Goals The Apex Houston oil spill killed an estimated 6,000 common murres, eradicated the Devil's Slide Rock colony, and damaged colonies at Castle and Hurricane Point Rocks. If the latter two colonies are lost, over 75% of the recent range of the central California common murre population will have been lost. The Trustee Council has selected restoration alternatives designed to restore common murres to colonies in the areas most severely affected by the spill. An important goal is to make significant progress toward the establishment of 100 breeding pairs of common murres at Devil's Slide Rock and San Pedro Rock colonies. The time frame needed for common murres to become established at extirpated colonies is unknown but is suspected to be many years. If possible, the project will attempt to restore the colonies to pre-spill population levels. The time frame needed for common murres to reach pre-spill population levels is unknown but is suspected to take several generations. Ultimately, the long-term goal is to restore the common murre colonies to historic breeding levels, although this would probably require funds in addition to those currently budgeted. The Trustee Council plans to review the common murre restoration project at least annually at which time the effectiveness of the project and possible improvements will be considered. The annual review process may result in revisions to the plan. Revisions will be reviewed by the Trustee Council. Revisions to the plan will be guided by documented evidence, scientific literature, and best professional judgement. Environmental Compliance The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the project is categorically excluded from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq, according to the Department of Interior's Departmental Manual, 516 DM 6, Appendix I, 516 DM 2, Appendix I. Resource management activities such as the type described for this project, which include research, reintroduction of established species into their historic range, and small structures or improvements, are categorically excluded from NEPA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has prepared an Environmental Action Memorandum setting forth the basis for the categorical exclusion of this project. The State of California has determined that the project is categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Cal. Pub. Resources Code 21000 et seq., and has filed a Notice of Exemption with the State Clearinghouse. The Trustee Council is submitting a Consistency Determination pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. ยง1456(c) with the California Coastal Commission. The Trustee Council has concluded that the proposed project will have no impact on California's coastal zone.
