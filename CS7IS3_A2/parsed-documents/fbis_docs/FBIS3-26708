They also inspected the progress of the Wanjiazhai project for diverting water from the Huang He. They held forums with the provincial organs on market, prices, and other issues. Chen Jinhua said that, with strategic foresight, Shanxi has focused on infrastructural building in developing its economy. It is indeed encouraging to see the vigor of the people throughout the province in changing Shanxi's outlook. Shanxi also had sound judgment in mobilizing the whole province to develop "Project Hope." We have the responsibility to show our concern and give assistance. Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning Commission, arrived in Taiyuan on 20 January with comrades responsible for the Agricultural Department, Transportation Department, and Investment Department under the State Planning Commission. After listening to an account given by the Shanxi Planning Committee and the Wanjiazhai project headquarters on diverting water from the Huang He, they inspected some large- and medium-size enterprises, including the Shanxi Textile Mill and Taiyuan Heavy Machine Plant. From 21 to 24 January, Chen Jinhua, Hu Fuguo, and Sun Wensheng went to conduct investigation and study in Ningwu, Shuzhou, Pianguan, Baode, Shenchi, and Xinzhou and inspect the progress of the Wanjiazhai project for diverting water from the Huang He. Then they went to the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Complex and the Mining Machine-Building Plant to conduct investigation and study. They also inspected the expansion project for the Taiyuan Airport and the Taiyuan Railway Station. Chen Jinhua, Hu Fuguo, and Sun Wensheng examined in detail the key water diversion project and culvert and walked into the tunnel, which was still under construction, to perform a quality check. They extended their greetings to officials and construction workers involved in the project. Chen Jinhua pointed out: The project for diverting water from the Huang He to the Shanxi is a great event. As Shanxi is the country's base for energy, heavy industry, and chemical industry, the water diversion project has attracted nationwide attention. He affirmed that, as always, the State Planning Commission will show concern for and support the project. Construction has started for the key project, main canal, and north trunk. The State Planning Commission will take concerted action to ensure that the project is completed on time and will deliver water to Taiyuan in 1998. Chen Jinhua said that, under the leadership of the provincial party committee and government, the people of the entire province are enthusiastic about changing Shanxi's outlook. I am encouraged about the good and valuable things that I have personally seen. Li Shuangliang's [Shanxi deputy to the 8th National People's Congress] method of handling the province's problem of accumulated spent coal is unique nationwide, and this spirit of transforming the country's outlook is valuable. In my view, the strategy of Shanxi's economic development conforms to the spirit of the 14th Party Congress, is based on the current situation and focused on the 21st century, and is based on Shanxi while having the country and the world in mind. You have promoted current economic growth and accumulated staying power for further development, which will play a great role in upgrading Shanxi's economy in the 1990's and will create conditions for development in the next century. The efforts made by the provincial party committee and government to step up infrastructure building are farsighted. Chen Jinhua made the following three proposals for Shanxi's economic development: First, as Shanxi has favorable conditions for its economic development, structural readjustment, and optimized distribution of resources, I hope that you can introduce bold reforms in ownership and accelerate the development of collective and township enterprises. Second, it is necessary to update the concept of proportional relations between heavy industry and light industry and let heavy and light industries complement each other. Third, regarding projects included in the Eighth Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to concentrate forces to implement the plan, make efforts to check inflation, and prevent investment in capital construction from exceeding general supply. Chen Jinhua called for doing well the following work regarding market and prices: First, take note of maintaining the overall balance and never let the difference between general supply and demand exceed 5 percent. Second, attach importance to agriculture and the "vegetable basket" project, protect the interests of the broad masses of the people, and guarantee social stability. Third, it is necessary to properly handle the extent of price reform and the timing of introducing reform packages. Fourth, offer correct media guidance for forecasting the inclination of the masses. Fifth, in management over prices, it is necessary to combine government interference with mass supervision and strengthen price work. He emphasized that relations among reform, development, and stability should be properly handled.
