The government has decided that if the construction of nuclear power plants in Asian countries does not proceed smoothly, it will hinder their domestic development of atomic energy as a source for power. Therefore, the government is considering technical cooperation through the private sector. Specific policy will be discussed on 11 November at the meeting of the Atomic Energy Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for Energy (a MITI advisory body). According to the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, among the countries in Asia, China plans to construct a total of six nuclear power plants, including those presently under construction, in the future. In addition, by the year 2006 ROK will increase its capability to generate power from nuclear energy to 23,200,000 kW, roughly three times the current level, and both Indonesia and Malaysia plan to begin generating power by nuclear energy. Not only is there concern that Japan's environment may be adversely affected by a nuclear accident in Asia, but such an accident will make construction of nuclear power plants in Japan that much more difficult. Therefore, the government is considering such methods as promoting exchange of human resources and technology transfer from the private sector in an effort to encourage international cooperation and ensure safe operation.
