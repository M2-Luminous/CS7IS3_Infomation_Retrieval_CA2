B. Docket The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered in the development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested parties to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process; and (2) to serve as the official record in case of judicial review, except for interagency review material (section 307(d)(7)(A)). The docket number for this rulemaking is A&hyph;90&hyph;45. Docket No. A&hyph;89&hyph;08 also includes background information for this rulemaking that supported the proposal and promulgation of the subpart Ca emission guidelines. C. Clean Air Act Procedural Requirements The following procedural requirements of the Act are addressed: Administrative listing, periodic review, external participation, and economic impact assessment. 1. Administrative Listing_Sections 111 and 129 of the Act As prescribed by section 111 of the Act, establishment of emission guidelines for MWC's is based on the Administrator's determination (52 FR 25399, July 7, 1987) that these sources contribute significantly to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Additionally, section 129 of the Act of 1990 directs the Administrator to promulgate guidelines for existing MWC's. 2. Periodic Review_Sections 111 and 129 of the Act Sections 111 and 129 of the Act require that the guidelines be reviewed no later than 5 years following the initial promulgation. At that time and at 5-year intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall review the guidelines in accordance with sections 111 and 129 of the Act and revise them if necessary. This review will include an assessment of such factors as the need for integration with other programs, the existence of alternative methods, enforceability, improvements in emission control technology, and reporting requirements. 3. External Participation In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this proposal was preceded by consultation with appropriate advisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies. The Administrator welcomes comments on all aspects of the proposed guidelines, including economic and technological issues. 4. Economic Impact Assessment Section 317A of the Act requires the EPA to prepare an economic impact assessment for any emission guidelines promulgated under section 111(d) of the Act. An economic impact assessment was prepared for the proposed emission guidelines. In the manner described in sections III, IV, and V of this preamble regarding the impacts of and rationale for the proposed emission guidelines, the EPA considered all aspects of the economic impact assessment in proposing the emission guidelines. The economic impact assessment is included in the list of key technical documents at the beginning of today's notice under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION . D. Executive Order 12866 Review Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and, therefore, subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines a ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, users fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, the EPA considers these proposed guidelines to be ``significant'' because their annual effect on the economy would be expected to exceed $100 million. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public docket for this rulemaking.
