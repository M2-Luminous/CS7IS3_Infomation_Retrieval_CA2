FR940706-1-00007 FR940706-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR Part 1915 [Docket No. S&hyph;045] Personal Protective Equipment for Shipyard Employment AGENCY: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Department of Labor. ACTION: Proposed rule; limited reopening of the rulemaking record. SUMMARY: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is reopening the rulemaking record for the proposed revision of the regulation of personal protective equipment for shipyard employment (53 FR 48150, November 29, 1988) to incorporate the rulemaking record developed for the recently revised regulation of personal protective equipment for general industry (Docket S&hyph;060, final rule published in 59 FR 16334, April 6, 1994) and the record for the proposed regulation of personal protective equipment (fall protection equipment for general industry) (Docket S&hyph;057, 55 FR 13423, April 10, 1990). While the shipyard rulemaking on personal protective equipment (PPE) generated 10 comments, the general industry rulemakings generated hundreds of comments and several thousand pages of hearing testimony regarding PPE issues. The Agency believes the regulation of PPE in shipyard and general industry employment should be consistent, in order to facilitate compliance and effective employee protection. OSHA has determined that the information in Dockets S&hyph;060 and S&hyph;057 is relevant to full consideration of the issues raised by the shipyard PPE proposal, and that it is appropriate to reopen the record to incorporate those materials and to allow the public an opportunity to comment. This notice also raises specific PPE issues arising out of the general industry rulemakings for public comment. DATES: Comments on the issues raised in the notice of reopening must be postmarked by August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments are to be sent to the Docket Office, Docket No. S&hyph;045A, U.S. Department of Labor, room N&hyph;2625, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James F. Foster, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, room N&hyph;3637, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. Telephone (202) 219&hyph;8148. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On November 29, 1988, OSHA proposed to revise the personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements in the shipyard employment standards (part 1915, subpart I) (53 FR 48150).

The written comment period ended on February 27, 1989. The Agency received 10 comments on the proposed rule. There were no hearing requests.
