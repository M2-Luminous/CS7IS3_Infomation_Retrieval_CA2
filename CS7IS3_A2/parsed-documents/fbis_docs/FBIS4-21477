The chemical industry in the FRG is now up in arms against this decision. It fears that its efforts so far to develop substitutes will be frustrated. Back in the seventies, atmospheric scientists warned of a thinning out of the ozone layer in the stratosphere as a result of CFC's that had proven themselves so overwhelmingly in daily use as propellants in sprays, cooling or cleaning agents or as foaming agents. The scientists' warning did not go unheeded. Industry went all out in the search for new, environmentally friendly substances. Manfred Ritz, spokesman for the Chemical Industry Association [VDI] in Frankfurt acknowledges the success of development activities in the branch: ``By now there is an adequate substitute for virtually all applications.'' For instance, ``R134a'' (hydrofluorocarbon [HFC]), a chlorine-free fluorocarbon is now available as a substitute for cooling systems that will not harm the ozone. Naturally, such a substitute is not to be had free of charge. In the words of Dr. Rudolf Staab, head of the ``specialty products'' business unit at Hoechst AG, Frankfurt: ``Such substances currently cost three to four times more than CFC's because of higher raw material costs and more expensive production.'' This may also be the reason for the present emergence of a ``gray market'' for CFC's and halons through the back door, as it were, and yet completely legal. In the future they will be allowed to be imported in large quantities from non-EU countries. For in the EU's latest decision, the import quota for CFC's from third countries into the EU was dramatically increased. VCI spokesman Manfred Ritz characterized it as a ``low-blow to environmental policy.'' And Dr. Hartmut Vennen, a spokesman for Hoechst, remarked that the decision was ``political shenanigans at the expense of the environment.'' Still, what lurks beneath the patently questionable decision from Brussels? As so often, it is the different political position inside and outside the EU that operates at the expense of environmental protection. The European signatories to the Montreal Agreement at their November 1992 meeting in Copenhagen resolved that production and consumption of fully halogenated CFC's in Europe in 1994 were not to exceed an amount of 46,000 ``Ozone Depletion Potential [ODP] tons.'' Using the descriptor ``ODP'' as a clearing-quantity, allowance is made for the different ozone depletion potentials of the individual compounds. As of 1 January 1995, production and marketing of CFC's in the EU is prohibited, albeit not their use. Only in the FRG will it be forbidden to operate new systems with CFC's as of 1995. This is because of the 6 May 1991 ``ordinance prohibiting CFC's and halons.'' In plain terms, however, that means that in the future, old systems in Germany as well as old and new systems in other European countries may be unrestrictedly cooled with CFC's. But, if dealing in freshly manufactured CFC's is outlawed, where are the CFC's to be gotten from? The alternative here is to import ``used goods'' from all corners of the world, for, even countries that have signed the Montreal Agreement may go on merrily producing them. The People's Republic of China [PRC], for example, currently has an annual per capita consumption of nearly 0.05 kg. Like all developing countries, however, it is allowed to produce 0.3 kg annually per capita. Rudolf Staab's prediction is: ``In the future, China all by itself will make up for it if the western world backs out of the production of CFC's.'' Even worse is the fact that China, India and the CIS countries as producers are busily seeking out customers in the industrial nations that are now heading towards zero in their production of CFC's and want to market their new substitutes. An indication that this suspicion is not groundless is the enormous amounts of CFC's ordered by EU importers this year in Brussels. Dr. Heinrich Kraus, assistant minister in the federal environmental ministry and responsible for the safety of chemicals and their impact on the environment acknowledges: ``The amounts requested were so exorbitantly high that some applicants did not even get any amount.'' Hence, the EU approved ``only'' an additional amount of 26,000 t of CFC's, 20,000 t of halons and 85,000 t of carbon tetrachlorides, each in ODP units. Naturally, this decision runs counter to neither the Montreal nor the Copenhagen protocol. The reason is that specific terms are linked to the new import licenses. Only used or recycled goods may be imported. ``Where are the 26,000 t of recycled goods supposed to come from,'' asks Staab. And chemists corroborate the suspicion: recycled and new CFC's are chemically identical and therefore analytically indistinguishable. For this reason Staab's fear is: ``In those third countries there is no recycling anywhere, only the labeling.'' In the federal environmental ministry there is a calm reaction to this charge: ``The Commission has also recognized this handicap and devised a self-declaration form that has been forwarded to all potential importers,'' explains assistant minister Kraus. On it, each importer is obliged to state specifically where the material originates and also guarantee that it is recycled or used material. Kraus states: ``If `black market goods' are involved, fines of up to DM100,000 are payable.'' To be sure, he does not dispute the fact that it will be difficult for an official in Brussels to inspect a producer's recycling capacities in China, India or beyond the Urals.
