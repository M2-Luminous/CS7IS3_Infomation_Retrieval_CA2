News agencies have quoted British officials as saying that the International Court of Justice [ICJ] only looks into conflicts between nations, not into criminal cases. They were commenting on the Arab League's proposal that the two Libyan suspects appear before a Scottish court affiliated with the ICJ. What is your reaction? ['Abd-al-Majid] I have heard these statements. I believe the British Foreign Office officials know full well, as do I, the jurisdiction of the ICJ. The Arab League has never thought that this case is within the jurisdiction of the ICJ. This is the alphabet of the international law. They say this is not the business of the ICJ. I have never said it is. I am talking about a Scottish court applying Scotland's law but having its seat in the ICJ in The Hague; the ICJ will have nothing to do with the case. I hope this clarification will serve as a response to the statement of the official British Foreign Office spokesman, who, I am sure, knows very well what I am talking about. The idea, as discussed by the seven-member committee and in the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers, is that we apply Scottish law, as the incident took place in Scotland. Judicial rules say that when an incident takes place in a country, the law of that country is applied. As concerns Libya, it is only natural for any country not to hand over its subjects for trial in foreign countries. The Libyan position in this regard is fully in keeping with the international law. The suspects can appear before a Scottish court in accordance with Scottish law, and, at the same time, the trial can take place in a neutral country, whether the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, or any other country. But the ICJ will have nothing to do with the case. Why Scottish law? I would like to explain an important point here. In criminal cases, Scottish law is more flexible than British law. A Scottish court examining a case has three options concerning the defendant: guilty, not guilty, not proven [previous five words in English]. In Britain, courts apply what they call common law [previous two words in English], and they have only two choices against the defendant: guilty or not guilty. Scottish law, therefore, is more flexible. The painful Lockerbie incident took place in Scotland. So, we say let us apply Scottish law. Libya accepted that, and the Arab League Council ratified it. We are talking about a Scottish court, with Scottish judges, and perhaps other judges. The Scottish law will be applied where the suspect -- who is innocent until proven guilty -- is given a chance to be found not-proven. That is the whole thing. [Hijazi] We were optimistic that an Arab court of justice would see the light, and that the Arab League Charter would be amended during the Arab League Council session. Why were these two projects postponed? ['Abd-al-Majid] Concerning the Arab court of justice plan, I would like to give the credit to its rightful owners; namely, those who laid down the Arab League Charter in 1945. Article 19 of the Charter mentions this court. It was conceived in 1945, but it never came to be. The idea was revived now so that the court can serve as a mechanism to resolve Arab conflicts by peaceful means. Going to the court is optional; no country can be forced to go to the court. The OAU established a mechanism to resolve African conflicts. As regards the amendment of the Arab League Charter, this has been under consideration for many years, but it did not happen either. There have lately been many changes that have pushed us to think of some important amendments, particularly adopting resolutions by a two-thirds majority rather than unanimity. Current Arab circumstances, and I understand this, prompted some countries to ask for a postponement of this issue. But both subjects, an Arab court and an amendment of the Charter, are still open; the door is not closed.
