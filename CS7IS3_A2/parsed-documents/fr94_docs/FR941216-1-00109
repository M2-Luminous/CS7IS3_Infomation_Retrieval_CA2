FR941216-1-00109 FR941216-1-00012 Subpart G_Liquid Propellant Requirements §184.62 Application. (a) These criteria establish Q/D, storage compatibility groupings, and high explosives equivalencies for liquid propellants. They apply to liquid propellant storage facilities (including missiles, rockets, and multi-compartment tanks in which both liquid fuels and liquid oxidizers are stored). (b) If hazard classifications and storage compatibility groups for liquid propellants are not listed in Appendix A to Subpart G of this part, they may be obtained from the PCO. §184.63 Determination of propellant quantity. (a) For Q/D purposes, the net weight of propellant in a tank, drum, cylinder, or other container shall be used. The quantity of propellant in associated piping (to the point(s) providing means for interrupting the flow in an incident) shall be included in the net weight of propellant in a storage container. (b) When incompatible propellants are not separated by distances prescribed in Appendix B to Subpart G of this part or provisions for preventing their mixing are not available, the combined quantity of the two shall be used with appropriate HE equivalency (Appendix C to Subpart G of this part) to determine the Q/D (Appendix D to Subpart G of this part). (c) Appendix E to Subpart G of this part lists conversion factors (gallons to pounds) for the various liquid propellants. §184.64 Measurement of separation distances. (a) Separation distances shall be measured from the nearest hazard source (containers, buildings, or positive cutoff point in piping, whichever is controlling). (b) If a building contains a small number of drums or cylinders, or if quantities of propellant in the building are subdivided effectively, distances may be measured from the nearest container or controlling subdivision. §184.65 Q/D considerations. (a) Q/D criteria in this section are based on these premises: construction materials shall be compatible with propellants to which they may be exposed; design shall take into account the properties of the propellant; required fire protection and drainage controls shall be provided; and other special controls (such as nitrogen padding, tank cooling, etc.) shall be provided when required. (b) If group I, II, and III propellants are contaminated, Appendix B to Subpart G of this part is not applicable. In such cases, group IV Q/D requirements shall apply except when the PCO specifically approves other criteria. §184.66 Hazard grouping. Liquid propellants present various types and degrees of hazards. The following propellant groupings are based on these hazards. (a) Group I . Considered the least hazardous, these materials have a fire hazard potential and require separation distance as specified in Appendix B to Subpart G of this part. When group I materials are stored with more hazardous materials under conditions described in §184.67, Appendices C and D to Subpart G of this part, shall determine Q/D requirements. (b) Group II . Strong oxidizers, these materials may cause serious fires when they come into contact with material such as organic matter. Appendix B to Subpart G of this part specifies quantity limitations and minimum distance requirements. When group II materials are stored with more hazardous materials under conditions described in §184.67, Appendices C and D to Subpart G of this part shall determine Q/D requirements. (c) Group III . Hazardous fragmentation of the container, its protective structure, or other nearby material may be produced by pressure rupture of the storage container or a vapor-phase explosion. Appendix B to Subpart G of this part specifies quantity limitations and minimum distance requirements for this group. When group III materials are stored with more hazardous materials, under conditions described in §184.67, Appendices C and D to Subpart G of this part shall determine Q/D requirements. (d) Group IV . These hazards are the same as for mass-detonating explosives (such as air blast overpressure and fragments from the containers and surrounding equipment and material). Appendix D to Subpart G of this part shall determine Q/D requirements.
