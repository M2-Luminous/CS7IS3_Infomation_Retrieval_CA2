He said that this sum includes credits received and already used, as well as "the difference between Ukrainian exports to these countries and imports from them." The debt to the CIS countries slightly exceeds $4.3 billion, including $2.7 billion to Russia, $693 million to Turkmenistan, $28 million to Moldova, and $1.3 million to Kazakhstan. The debt to Western countries mostly consists of the commitments against the export credits extended to Ukraine by the U.S., Germany, and the European Union. Sobolev announced that the total amount of Western credits, used by Ukraine stood at about $1 billion. In addition to this, Kiev concluded agreements on $2.5 billion worth of loans. Sobolev said that Ukraine was not delaying repayment of debts to Western creditors. He admitted, however, that Ukraine's debts to the CIS countries, including Russia, were not being paid back regularly. He said that the debt problem was closely connected with that of dividing the former Soviet Union's assets and liabilities which is still to be solved. A foreign debt department is to be set up at the Ukrainian Finance Ministry to monitor the servicing of the debts, he said.
