The resolution was approved unanimously by the 60 council members who met at CUT headquarters. On 11 July, called the "Day of National Dignity" in memory of the date the copper mines were nationalized in 1971, CUT will stage two rallies along the Alameda, one beginning at the Plaza Italia and another in the Central Station. Among other measures, which will be revealed today, the CUT national council decided to call a meeting of Confasin (National Labor Confederations, Federations, and Unions) for 21 June, during which they will agree on future actions. Last night CUT appointed a committee that will organize the rallies and the other activities scheduled by CUT with the purpose of mobilizing a maximum number of workers. In the past few days CUT has hardened its criticism of the current administration. On 8 June, CUT President Manuel Bustos said that relations between the government and workers are at a turning point because of some pending labor reforms. Bustos said that the workers are demanding changes to the collective bargains law, the dismissals law, and the National Training and Employment Service (Sence). He also said that CUT is willing to discuss the pending problems with the government, but he expects the government to make some decisions. CUT Vice President Arturo Martinez said on 13 June that the rally does not mean a strike, but a call to attention by the workers. A series of labor conflicts have taken place at different companies in the past 15 days during collective labor bargains. [passage omitted]
