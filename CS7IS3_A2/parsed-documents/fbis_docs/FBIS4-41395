Aldoshina] Acting procurator-general Aleksandr Ilyushenko said today that by using criminal terrorist methods, the criminal formations operating on Russian territory have essentially taken over the streets, towns, and populated localities. [Ilyushenko] Their barefaced insolence and impunity are creating an atmosphere of fear and helplessness in society. [Aldoshina] Over the first five months of this year, 1,094,000 crimes were registered, 216,000 of them serious crimes. In the view of participants in the extended sitting of the procuracy's collegium, the federal program for combatting crime and the president's edict on protecting the population from gang violence should put an end to organized crime. However, the document is controversial. [I. Kostoyev, chairman of the Federation Council's Committee for Constitutional Legislation] It is quite clear that the president's edict contradicts the constitution and a number of federal laws. [Aldoshina] Issa Kostoyev believes, however, that the actual state of affairs must be borne in mind and, given the outburst of gang violence, that the edict should be used as an interim legal enactment. Those assembled in the hall believe that it is now a question of who will bring whom down first, the state or the mafia? And the law enforcement bodies intend to demonstrate their strength whatever happens. [Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service] I am in favor of the violation of human rights, if the person involved is a bandit and criminal. There can be no alternative here. [Aldoshina] The only person who objected to this stance was Sergey Kovalev. [Sergey Kovalev, chairman of the Russian Federation President's Human Rights Commission] Human rights exist. If you are in favor of violation of the rights of the criminal, you are in favor of the violation of human rights. This axiom is known worldwide. [Aldoshina] As the acting procurator-general explained today, only the Constitutional Court can revoke the president's edict. However, the participants in the procuracy collegium are fully determined to use this document to bring the full punitive force of the law to bear and achieve a real breakthrough in the crime situation.
