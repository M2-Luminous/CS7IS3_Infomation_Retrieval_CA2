FR940222-0-00055 FR940222-0-00023 47 CFR Part 73 [MM Docket No. 93&hyph;315; RM&hyph;8320] Radio Broadcasting Services; Pella, IA AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Station KFMG(FM), Pella, Iowa, was previously licensed on Channel 277C which was short spaced to Channel 278C1 at Huntsville. Station KFMG(FM) has recently been downgraded to Class C1 facilities. Since ยง73.202(b) of the Rules has not been editorially amended to reflect the downgrading of Channel 277 at Pella, we will make the change in this proceeding. Since the change is editorial in nature, a public notice and comment proceeding is unnecessary. See 5 U.S.C. 553(b) (A) and (B). With this action, this proceeding is terminated.
