Wei was coming from the port city of Tianjin when at least seven police vehicles stopped the car he was riding in and took him away, his secretary, who was riding with him, said. Police showed Wei a "summons and investigation warrant" before taking him off, the secretary said in describing the incident which occurred about 5:00 p.m. [0900 GMT] Beijing time. Wei was returning from what is believed to have been a forced exile after being detained in early March, several days before U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in Beijing to press China's communist leaders for progress in human rights. The dissident, who became famous for his publications and imprisonment during the democracy wall period in the late 1970s, was released on parole last September 15, days before the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted on what city was to hold the 2000 Olympics. Many surmised his release was a cynical move by Beijing to attempt to polish its human rights image for IOC voters, while using its political dissidents as hostages. Wei was jailed for "counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement" 15 years ago March 29, which was also the date on which his parole was to end. However he had also been deprived of his political rights for three years following his release. Deprivation of civil rights for varying periods is among China's punishments. The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed Thursday that despite the termination of his parole, Wei is not allowed to give interviews to foreign journalists. The ministry refused to clarify under which law such a restriction is stipulated, although it stressed that china has "a rule of law." Theoretically a "summons and investigation warrant" allows for the detention of citizens for up to three days. Wei incensed Chinese leaders when he met U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights John Shattuck at Shattuck's request two weeks before the Christopher visit and said the U.S. should continue to link trade with progress in human rights. The United States has tied the renewal of China's most-favored- nation (MFN) trading status, which facilitates billions of dollars in bilateral trade, to progress on the rights front. Wei, similarly incensed paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978 when he called democracy China's "fifth modernization," at a time when Deng was pushing the "four modernizations" -- of agriculture, industry, defense and science -- in his attempt to rebuild china after the disastrous 10-year cultural revolution. Deng reportedly personally ordered Wei's arrest at that time, saying, "arrest Wei Jingsheng and never let him go."
