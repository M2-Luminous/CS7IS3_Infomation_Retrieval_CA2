Developments in domestic politics have overshadowed that problem. In view of that, little attention has been focused on whether or not President Clinton was able to influence President al-Asad when they met some time ago. A high-ranking official has said that President Clinton was able to do so. Intelligence reports Turkey has recently received indicate that Syria has seriously restricted Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leader Abdullah Ocalan's activities in that country. Restrictions on Ocalan There are various rumors about Ocalan's whereabouts. He is reported to be living in a village between Syria and Lebanon. He has been informed that he must remain indoors during the day and avoid holding political talks. There are reports that the PKK camps in Syria have been closed down and the movement of PKK militants has been restricted. In short, Turkey's pressure seems to have achieved a certain degree of success. Meanwhile, the Turkish Foreign Ministry is worried that Turkey may be subjected to intensive pressure by Western countries on matters related to the Kurdish problem. It seems that the first signs of that pressure have come from the United States. In Germany, a motion on the Kurdish problem has recently been blocked in the Bundestag. Undoubtedly, it will be looked at again if a message is received from the United States. [passage omitted]
