S. Mozgov; UDC 523.165;538.561;551.593] [Abstract] A great deal of practical value attaches to the study of the propagation in the Earth's atmosphere of x-ray emissions from deep-space nuclear explosions and the secondary physical phenomena produced by such explosions. This paper examines the possibility of ground-based recording of uneven light emissions excited in the Earth's atmosphere by an x-ray beam whose parameters are typical of an x-ray laser with pumping from a nuclear explosion. Since uneven light emissions in the atmosphere are isotropic, they can be recorded at great distances from the beam axis. The researchers here examine the process associated with the light signal generation and calculate the amplitude-time characteristics of a light signal that comes about when an x-ray beam from a cosmic source interacts with the atmosphere. The light emissions achieve maximum intensity within 10[.sup]-8[/]-10[.sup]-5[/] sec. That time is a function of the position of the recording site: the farther the site is from the beam, the greater the time. Pulse width is also a function of recording-site position: the closer the site is to the beam, the faster the intensity grows (10[.sup]-5[/]-10[.sup]-4[/] sec).
