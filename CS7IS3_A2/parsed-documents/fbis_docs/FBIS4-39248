The arguments in favor of the draft law submitted by the Tatarstan Government, which were incorporated in the report of Deputy Prime Minister Ravil Muratov, boiled down to the following: It is necessary to raise the minimum wage in order to avoid a sharp decline in the republic population's standard of living because of a sharp jump in prices. However, the presenter noted, we cannot allow the Unified Pay Scale level I salary to be set at R50,000, since it will cause leveling in labor remuneration of the workers in the budget and production spheres and may lead to social tensions. Planning and Budget Commission Chairman Geliy Kobelev and the Tatarstan people's deputies did have strong objections, which they voiced to the presenter. As one of the opponents justly noted, one can issue a directive to set the minimum wage at R100,000 or even R1 million, but what will it change in principle if enterprises do not have money and back pay is owed for months? So what is the point of adopting another law that will not work? It is already clear that setting the minimum wage at R30,000 did not result in raising the average wage in February-May. Meanwhile, questions arise when these categories are compared in Russia and Tatarstan. With the minimum wage in the Russian Federation being R14,600, in March the average wage rose to over R170,000, while in our republic, where the minimum is set much higher, average earnings amount to only R140,000. The commission came to the conclusion that the materials attached to the draft law do not contain sufficient analysis of the consequences and do not identify the sources to cover the attendant additional budget expenditures. If we are to accept such a draft law, it needs clear justification that will take into account the interests of industrial enterprises, first and foremost the defense industry. The preliminary analysis as to what raising the minimum wage will produce is already taking shape. And it is far from optimistic. If the law is adopted, the taxable base will inevitably shrink, which means losses for the revenue part of the budget, which are estimated to exceed R200 billion. Overall, additional expenditures and loss of income are estimated at R350 billion, or R50 million a month with the actual budget revenue being an average of R80 billion monthly. This means that the government will have to take some steps to increase the budget revenue. The deputies were unanimous in the opinion that this draft law once again will not affect the pay of the budget sphere workers, since the proposal is to adopt it without taking into account the Unified Pay Scale. It will, however, necessitate changes in the Tatarstan law "On the Republic of Tatarstan Budget System for 1994," since the 2.5-fold wage raise for budget organizations, which is built into the budget, is pegged on a minimum wage of no more than R30,000 until the end of the year. It was also quite reasonably pointed out that our entire legislative base is pegged on the minimum wage, and in the event this law passes, fines calculated on a factor of R50,000 will become astronomical, which actually will lead to a result directly opposite that intended -- decline in the population's income. To this Ravil Muratov offered a compromise solution: Since Russian Federation laws are in effect on the Tatarstan territory, fines may be applied on the basis of the Russian minimum wage, that is, R14,600. The presenter's reasoning was not accepted, however. As one of the deputies remarked, with this draft law we once again attempt to cure the symptoms rather than the disease. And the disease is the republic's extremely difficult economic situation. The program of anticrisis measures, which the deputies had instructed the government to develop before 25 May, was supposed to help. Instead, they offered to discuss only the draft of "Priority Measures for Stabilization of Republic of Tatarstan Economy." But this document -- the substance of which was presented at the commission meeting by Filza Khamidullin, a deputy prime minister and the chairman of the State Committee for Economics and Forecasting -- also raised serious questions among the deputies. In Geliy Kobelev's opinion, the draft of "Priority Measures..." lacks clarity and specifics in such critically important matters as overcoming the insolvency crisis, bringing down the rate of production decline, providing guarantees for the timely payment of wages, and the operation of the bills of exchange system. The commission returned the draft law "On the Minimum Wage" for modifications and recommended to consider it simultaneously with the draft law on the adjusted budget.
