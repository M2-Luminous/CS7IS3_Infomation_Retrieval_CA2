[passage omitted] With regard to the issue of Ukraine's accession to the nuclear arms nonproliferation treaty, Ivan Plyushch said that the last time parliament discussed the issue was on 18 November 1993, when it adopted reservations concerning ratification of the START treaty. Since then, the president of Ukraine has carried out a great deal of work which resulted in the signing of the Moscow statement. Plyushch said the president of Ukraine requested the Supreme Council to examine the issue of Ukraine's accession to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. However, the Supreme Council's three standing commissions which met 24 January with the participation of the working group dealing with ratification of the treaty, failed to find a common solution. The parliament speaker said that this afternoon's session of the Supreme Council will look at the resolution on the state privatization program for 1994.
