FBIS4-28374 "dreas112_i_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Cambodia Communique Dated 7 Jun Closes Newspaper Communique Dated 7 Jun Closes Newspaper BK0906121294 Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in Cambodian 9 Jun 94 pp 1, 11 BK0906121294 Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA Cambodian BFN [Text] The newspaper PRUM BAYON NEWS has been closed forever. Ieng Muli, information minister, issued a communique dated 7 June forbidding Thai Sarun, alias Seng Sokhom, to continue publishing the newspaper PRUM BAYON NEWS. This communique reached REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA on 7 June. It did not give any details about the offenses that PRUM BAYON NEWS had committed. The communique merely referred in general to the final provision of the Kingdom of Cambodia Constitution's Article 139, the Cambodian king's royal decree of 1 November 1993 dealing with the appointment of the Royal Government of Cambodia, the press law of the State of Cambodia's National Assembly passed in its 6 April 1992 extraordinary session, and the ethical code of the Cambodian Journalists Association. Besides all of that, no other specific, detailed explanations were given. Since Cambodia returned to democracy after the May 1993 election, this has been the first time that a newspaper has been officially shut down by government authorities. It should be recalled that on 24 March Nguon Non, political director of DAMNOENG PEL PROEK, was jailed for two days for refusing to respond to a subpoena, and on 16 May the police confiscated all copies of SAKAL before they could be distributed on the grounds that this newspaper had disparaged the king, an act prohibited by the Constitution. Concerning this worrisome incident, it can be said that the press in Cambodia is going through a frightening stage of destabilization. While commenting on this event, the optimists have pointed out that it was a correct measure taken by the Royal Government to help strengthen the journalistic profession, a step well in line with true democracy and necessary in a law-abiding country. Almost without exception, people disapprove of Cambodian journalists who are irresponsible to their profession. At about the same time we have learned that two other newspapers might be closed if they continued to ignore the laws of the state, to spurn their professional conscience, to cause riots, to inflame public opinion due to old grudges or past scores to settle, and if they refused to respect the superior interests of the nation. One Cambodian journalist has expressed skepticism, saying that the leaders are indulging in the questionable tactic of making certain statements intentionally for the press to report, and then issuing denials to discredit the press. Faced with such a ploy, Cambodian journalists will encounter great difficulties no matter how extensive is the documentation and evidence, including tape recordings, they have to back up their reports. Aside from stoically enduring "pain" of great magnitude, how courageous must these journalists be in order to use all the proof they have against their own top leaders in open court?
